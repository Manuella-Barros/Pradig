Trump is described as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nTrump has argued that he can't be prosecuted for acts he committed while serving as president. The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday will hear arguments on his bid to avoid federal prosecution over his efforts to reverse his loss.\n\nWith the indictments, Arizona becomes the fourth state where allies of the former president have been charged with using false or unproven claims about voter fraud related to the election. Heading into a likely November rematch with Biden, Trump continues to spread lies about the last election that are echoed by many of his supporters.\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the document.\n\nOne is an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, which clearly describes Giuliani. Another is Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment but if Meadows is named, \"it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\" Giuliani's political adviser, Ted Goodman, decried what he called \"the continued weaponization of our justice system.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, past president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nIn a statement, Hoffman accused Mayes of weaponizing the attorney general's office in bringing the case but didn't directly comment on the indictment's allegations.\n\n\"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process,\" Hoffman said.\n\nNone of the others responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jonathan J.

They're charged with nine counts each of conspiracy, fraud and forgery. The identities of seven other defendants, including Giuliani and Meadows, were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.\n\nTrump, who is described in the indictment as an unindicted co-conspirator, has argued that he can't be prosecuted for acts he committed while serving as president. The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday will hear arguments on his bid to avoid federal prosecution over his efforts to reverse his loss.\n\nWith the indictments, Arizona becomes the fourth state where allies of the former president have been charged with using false or unproven claims about voter fraud related to the election. Heading into a likely November rematch with Biden, Trump continues to spread lies about the last election that are echoed by many of his supporters.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic state Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the document.\n\nOne is an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, which clearly describes Giuliani. Another is Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nDescriptions of other unnamed defendants point to Mike Roman, who was Trump's director of Election Day operations; John Eastman, a lawyer who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election; and Christina Bobb, a lawyer who worked with Giuliani. Eastman and Bobb did not respond to text messages seeking comment, nor did a lawyer who is representing Roman in a case in Georgia.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment but if Meadows is named, \"it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\" Giuliani's political adviser, Ted Goodman, decried what he called \"the continued weaponization of our justice system.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges.

Ward is one of 11 Republicans in Arizona who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring Donald Trump had beaten Joe Biden in the state during the 2020 presidential election were charged Wednesday, April 24, 2024 with conspiracy, fraud and forgery, marking the fourth state to bring charges against \"fake electors.\" (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin, File)PHOENIX (AP) - An Arizona grand jury has indicted former Donald Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows and lawyer Rudy Giuliani along with 16 others in an election interference case. The indictment released Wednesday names 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring that Donald Trump beat Joe Biden in Arizona in the 2020 presidential election. It shows seven other defendants whose names were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges. The Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the indictment. One is described as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\"\u009d and spread false allegations of election fraud, a description that clearly describes Giuliani. Another is described as Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\"\u009d which describes Meadows. \"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\"\u009d Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\u009d The 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\"\u009d electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored. Biden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner. Their lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\u009d Days after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing. The Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states. In December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty. Michigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty. Three fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty. In Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin. Trump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states. In early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00c3\u00bal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania. In Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office. In another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty. The Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward. None of the 11 responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press on Wednesday seeking comment. ___ Associated Press writers Jonathan J.

Trump is described as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nTrump has argued that he can't be prosecuted for acts he committed while serving as president.

Trump is described as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nTrump has argued that he can't be prosecuted for acts he committed while serving as president. The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday will hear arguments on his bid to avoid federal prosecution over his efforts to reverse his loss.\n\nWith the indictments, Arizona becomes the fourth state where allies of the former president have been charged with using false or unproven claims about voter fraud related to the election. Heading into a likely November rematch with Biden, Trump continues to spread lies about the last election that are echoed by many of his supporters.\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the document.\n\nOne is an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, which clearly describes Giuliani. Another is Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment, but if Meadows is named, \"it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\" Giuliani's political adviser, Ted Goodman, decried what he called \"the continued weaponization of our justice system.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.", "source": {"uri": "chicago.suntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Sun-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nREAD MORE: Read the full indictment against Trump for his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen.

They're charged with nine counts each of conspiracy, fraud and forgery. The identities of seven other defendants, including Giuliani and Meadows, were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.\n\nTrump, who is described in the indictment as an unindicted co-conspirator, has argued that he can't be prosecuted for acts he committed while serving as president. The US Supreme Court on Thursday will hear arguments on his bid to avoid federal prosecution over his efforts to reverse his loss.\n\nWith the indictments, Arizona becomes the fourth state where allies of the former president have been charged with using false or unproven claims about voter fraud related to the election. Heading into a likely November rematch with Biden, Trump continues to spread lies about the last election that are echoed by many of his supporters.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic state Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the document.\n\nOne is an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, which clearly describes Giuliani. Another is Trump's \"chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nDescriptions of other unnamed defendants point to Mike Roman, who was Trump's director of Election Day operations; John Eastman, a lawyer who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election; and Christina Bobb, a lawyer who worked with Giuliani. Eastman and Bobb did not respond to text messages seeking comment, nor did a lawyer who is representing Roman in a case in Georgia.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment but if Meadows is named, \"it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\" Giuliani's political adviser, Ted Goodman, decried what he called \"the continued weaponization of our justice system.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes.

John McCain, R-Ariz., in the race for the Republican nomination to U.S. Senate, Aug. 30, 2016, at her primary night party at a hotel in Scottsdale, Ariz. Ward and her husband are two of 11 Republicans in Arizona who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring Donald Trump had beaten Joe Biden in the state during the 2020 presidential election were charged Wednesday, April 24, 2024, with conspiracy, fraud and forgery, marking the fourth state to bring charges against \"fake electors.\"\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- An Arizona grand jury has indicted former Donald Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows and lawyer Rudy Giuliani along with 16 others in an election interference case.\n\nThe indictment released Wednesday names 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring that Donald Trump beat Joe Biden in Arizona in the 2020 presidential election. It shows seven other defendants whose names were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the indictment.\n\nOne is described as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, a description that clearly describes Giuliani. Another is described as Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nNone of the 11 responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press on Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nAssociated Press writers Jonathan J.

They're charged with nine counts each of conspiracy, fraud and forgery. The identities of seven other defendants, including Giuliani and Meadows, were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.\n\nTrump, who is described in the indictment as an unindicted co-conspirator, has argued that he can't be prosecuted for acts he committed while serving as president. The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday will hear arguments on his bid to avoid federal prosecution over his efforts to reverse his loss.\n\nWith the indictments, Arizona becomes the fourth state where allies of the former president have been charged with using false or unproven claims about voter fraud related to the election. Heading into a likely November rematch with Biden, Trump continues to spread lies about the last election that are echoed by many of his supporters.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic state Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the document.\n\nOne is an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, which clearly describes Giuliani. Another is Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nDescriptions of other unnamed defendants point to Mike Roman, who was Trump's director of Election Day operations; John Eastman, a lawyer who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election; and Christina Bobb, a lawyer who worked with Giuliani. Eastman and Bobb did not respond to text messages seeking comment, nor did a lawyer who is representing Roman in a case in Georgia.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment but if Meadows is named, \"it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\" Giuliani's political adviser, Ted Goodman, decried what he called \"the continued weaponization of our justice system.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state.

Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, past president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nIn a statement, Hoffman accused Mayes of weaponizing the attorney general's office in bringing the case but didn't directly comment on the indictment's allegations.\n\n\"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process,\" Hoffman said.\n\nNone of the others responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It shows seven other defendants whose names were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the indictment.\n\nOne is described as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, a description that clearly describes Giuliani. Another is described as Trump's \"chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nNone of the 11 responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press on Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nRead more:\n\n0 Comments Tags Wire Dcc Lee-national\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

Guiliani, a lawyer for former President Donald Trump, was among those indicted Wednesday, April 24, 2024, in an Arizona election interference case.(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)\n\nAn Arizona grand jury has indicted former Donald Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows and lawyer Rudy Giuliani along with 16 others in an election interference case.\n\nThe indictment released Wednesday names 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring that Donald Trump beat Joe Biden in Arizona in the 2020 presidential election. It shows seven other defendants whose names were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the indictment.\n\nOne is described as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, a description that clearly describes Giuliani. Another is described as Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nNone of the 11 responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press on Wednesday seeking comment.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Meadows, chief of staff for former President Donald Trump, was among those indicted Wednesday, April 24, 2024, in an Arizona election interference case.\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- An Arizona grand jury has indicted former President Donald Trump 's chief of staff Mark Meadows, lawyer Rudy Giuliani and 16 others for their roles in an attempt to overturn Trump's loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 election.\n\nThe indictment released Wednesday names 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring that Trump won Arizona in 2020. They include the former state party chair, a 2022 U.S. Senate candidate and two sitting state lawmakers, who are charged with nine counts each of conspiracy, fraud and forgery.\n\nThe identities of seven other defendants, including Giuliani and Meadows, were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the documents. They were readily identifiable based on descriptions of the defendants, however.\n\nTrump himself was not charged but was referred to as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nWith the indictments, Arizona becomes the fourth state where allies of the former president have been charged with using false or unproven claims about voter fraud related to the election. Heading into a likely November rematch with Biden, Trump continues to spread lies about the last election that are echoed by many of his supporters.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic state Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe indictment alludes to Giuliani as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud. Another defendant is referred to as Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nDescriptions of other unnamed defendants point to Mike Roman, who was Trump's director of Election Day operations; John Eastman, a lawyer who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election; and Christina Bobb, a lawyer who worked with Giuliani.\n\nA lawyer for Eastman, Charles Burnham, said his client is innocent. Bobb did not respond to a text message seeking comment, nor did a lawyer who is representing Roman in a case in Georgia.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment but if Meadows is named, \"it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\" Giuliani's political adviser, Ted Goodman, decried what he called \"the continued weaponization of our justice system.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time.

There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump was indicted in August in federal court over efforts to cling to power after his defeat, including the fake electors scheme. The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday will hear arguments on his claim in that case that he can't be prosecuted for acts he committed while serving as president.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nThe so-called fake electors facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen.

They include the former state party chair, a 2022 U.S. Senate candidate and two sitting state lawmakers, who are charged with nine counts each of conspiracy, fraud and forgery.\n\nThe identities of seven other defendants, including Giuliani and Meadows, were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the documents. They were readily identifiable based on descriptions of the defendants, however.\n\nTrump himself was not charged but was referred to as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nWith the indictments, Arizona becomes the fourth state where allies of the former president have been charged with using false or unproven claims about voter fraud related to the election. Heading into a likely November rematch with Biden, Trump continues to spread lies about the last election that are echoed by many of his supporters.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic state Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe indictment alludes to Giuliani as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud. Another defendant is referred to as Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nDescriptions of other unnamed defendants point to Mike Roman, who was Trump's director of Election Day operations; John Eastman, a lawyer who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election; and Christina Bobb, a lawyer who worked with Giuliani.\n\nA lawyer for Eastman, Charles Burnham, said his client is innocent. Bobb did not respond to a text message seeking comment, nor did a lawyer who is representing Roman in a case in Georgia.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment but if Meadows is named, \"it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\" Giuliani's political adviser, Ted Goodman, decried what he called \"the continued weaponization of our justice system.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump was indicted in August in federal court over efforts to cling to power after his defeat, including the fake electors scheme. The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday will hear arguments on his claim in that case that he can't be prosecuted for acts he committed while serving as president.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nThe so-called fake electors facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, past president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nIn a statement, Hoffman accused Mayes of weaponizing the attorney general's office in bringing the case but didn't directly comment on the indictment's allegations.\n\n\"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process,\" Hoffman said.\n\nNone of the others responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.", "source": {"uri": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp", "dataType": "news", "title": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, US District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump was indicted in August in federal court over efforts to cling to power after his defeat, including the fake electors scheme. The US Supreme Court on Thursday will hear arguments on his claim in that case that he can't be prosecuted for acts he committed while serving as president.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognised as duly elected, qualified electors.\n\nNo charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nThe so-called fake electors facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Senator Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organisation Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Senator Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the US Capitol during the January 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a US Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, past president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nIn a statement, Hoffman accused Mayes of weaponising the attorney general's office in bringing the case but didn't directly comment on the indictment's allegations.\n\n\"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process,\" Hoffman said.\n\nNone of the others responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.", "source":

COOPER and JOSH KELETY (Associated Press)\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- An Arizona grand jury has indicted former President Donald Trump 's chief of staff Mark Meadows, lawyer Rudy Giuliani and 16 others for their roles in an attempt to overturn Trump's loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 election.\n\nThe indictment released Wednesday names 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring that Trump won Arizona in 2020. They include the former state party chair, a 2022 U.S. Senate candidate and two sitting state lawmakers, who are charged with nine counts each of conspiracy, fraud and forgery.\n\nThe identities of seven other defendants, including Giuliani and Meadows, were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the documents. They were readily identifiable based on descriptions of the defendants, however.\n\nTrump himself was not charged but was referred to as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nWith the indictments, Arizona becomes the fourth state where allies of the former president have been charged with using false or unproven claims about voter fraud related to the election. Heading into a likely November rematch with Biden, Trump continues to spread lies about the last election that are echoed by many of his supporters.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic state Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe indictment alludes to Giuliani as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud. Another defendant is referred to as Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nDescriptions of other unnamed defendants point to Mike Roman, who was Trump's director of Election Day operations; John Eastman, a lawyer who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election; and Christina Bobb, a lawyer who worked with Giuliani.\n\nA lawyer for Eastman, Charles Burnham, said his client is innocent. Bobb did not respond to a text message seeking comment, nor did a lawyer who is representing Roman in a case in Georgia.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment but if Meadows is named, \"it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\" Giuliani's political adviser, Ted Goodman, decried what he called \"the continued weaponization of our justice system.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state.

The grand jury indictment also describes an unindicted co-conspirator who is clearly Trump.\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nSeven others were indicted, but their names were blacked out of records released by Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes. Her office said the names will be released after those people are served with the charges.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case, and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's attorney general in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nNone of the 11 responded to either phone, email or

They're charged with nine counts each of conspiracy, fraud and forgery. The identities of seven other defendants, including Giuliani and Meadows, were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.\n\nTrump, who is described in the indictment as an unindicted co-conspirator, has argued that he can't be prosecuted for acts he committed while serving as president. The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday will hear arguments on his bid to avoid federal prosecution over his efforts to reverse his loss.\n\nWith the indictments, Arizona becomes the fourth state where allies of the former president have been charged with using false or unproven claims about voter fraud related to the election. Heading into a likely November rematch with Biden, Trump continues to spread lies about the last election that are echoed by many of his supporters.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic state Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the document.\n\nOne is an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, which clearly describes Giuliani. Another is Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nDescriptions of other unnamed defendants point to Mike Roman, who was Trump's director of Election Day operations; John Eastman, a lawyer who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election; and Christina Bobb, a lawyer who worked with Giuliani. Eastman and Bobb did not respond to text messages seeking comment, nor did a lawyer who is representing Roman in a case in Georgia.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment but if Meadows is named, \"it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\" Giuliani's political adviser, Ted Goodman, decried what he called \"the continued weaponization of our justice system.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state.

A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, past president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nIn a statement, Hoffman accused Mayes of weaponizing the attorney general's office in bringing the case but didn't directly comment on the indictment's allegations.\n\n\"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process,\" Hoffman said.\n\nNone of the others responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.\n\nRead more:\n\nNational\n\nArizona indicts 18 in case over 2020 election in Arizona, including Giuliani and Meadows\n\nBy JACQUES BILLEAUD, JONATHAN J.

It shows seven other defendants whose names were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the indictment.\n\nOne is described as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, a description that clearly describes Giuliani. Another is described as Trump's \"chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nNational\n\nInvestigator says Trump, allies were uncharged co-conspirators in plot to overturn Michigan election\n\nBy ED WHITE - Associated Press\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's attorney general in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nNone of the 11 responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press on Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nRead more:\n\nNational\n\nArizona indicts 18 in case over 2020 election in Arizona, including Giuliani and Meadows\n\nBy JACQUES BILLEAUD and JOSH KELETY - Associated Press\n\n5 takeaways from the Jan. 6 report\n\n1.

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Eleven Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring that Donald Trump beat Joe Biden in Arizona in the 2020 presidential election were charged Wednesday with conspiracy, fraud and forgery, marking the fourth state to bring charges against \"fake electors.\"\n\nThe defendants include the former chair of the Arizona Republican Party, a 2022 U.S. Senate candidate and two sitting state legislators. The grand jury indictment also describes an unindicted co-conspirator who is clearly Trump.\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nSeven others were indicted, but their names were blacked out of records released by Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes. Her office said the names will be released after those people are served with the charges.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nNone of the 11 responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press on Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nAssociated Press writers Jonathan J.

It shows seven other defendants whose names were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the indictment.\n\nOne is described as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, a description that clearly describes Giuliani.

It shows seven other defendants whose names were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the indictment.\n\nOne is described as an attorney \"who was often identified as the mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, a description that clearly describes Giuliani. Another is described as Trump's \"chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's attorney general in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a co-operation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states. Trump has pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors.

They include the former state party chair, a 2022 U.S. Senate candidate and two sitting state lawmakers, who are charged with nine counts each of conspiracy, fraud and forgery.\n\nThe identities of seven other defendants, including Giuliani and Meadows, were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the documents. They were readily identifiable based on descriptions of the defendants, however.\n\nTrump himself was not charged but was referred to as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nWith the indictments, Arizona becomes the fourth state where allies of the former president have been charged with using false or unproven claims about voter fraud related to the election. Heading into a likely November rematch with Biden, Trump continues to spread lies about the last election that are echoed by many of his supporters.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic state Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe indictment alludes to Giuliani as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud. Another defendant is referred to as Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nDescriptions of other unnamed defendants point to Mike Roman, who was Trump's director of Election Day operations; John Eastman, a lawyer who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election; and Christina Bobb, a lawyer who worked with Giuliani.\n\nA lawyer for Eastman, Charles Burnham, said his client is innocent. Bobb did not respond to a text message seeking comment, nor did a lawyer who is representing Roman in a case in Georgia.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment but if Meadows is named, \"it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\" Giuliani's political adviser, Ted Goodman, decried what he called \"the continued weaponization of our justice system.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state.

They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump was indicted in August in federal court over efforts to cling to power after his defeat, including the fake electors scheme. The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday will hear arguments on his claim in that case that he can't be prosecuted for acts he committed while serving as president.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nThe so-called fake electors facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, past president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nIn a statement, Hoffman accused Mayes of weaponizing the attorney general's office in bringing the case but didn't directly comment on the indictment's allegations.\n\n\"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process,\" Hoffman said.\n\nNone of the others responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Gabe Stern and Scott Sonner in Las Vegas, Kate Brumback in Atlanta and Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, contributed to this report.\n\nJacques Billeaud, Jonathan J.

Jake Hoffman and Anthony Kern, and Tyler Bowyer, a GOP national committeeman and chief operating officer of Turning Point Action, the campaign arm of the pro-Trump conservative group Turning Point USA.\n\nTrump was not charged, but he is described in the indictment as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nThere was no immediate response to phone messages seeking comment that were left Wednesday with Jacob Hoffman, Kelli Ward, Michael Ward, James Lamon and Tyler Bowyer.", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"}, "authors":

The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nThere was no immediate response to phone messages seeking comment that were left Wednesday with Jacob Hoffman, Kelli Ward, Michael Ward, James Lamon and Tyler Bowyer.\n\nStaff writers Teri Sforza and Todd Harmonson and the Associated Press

Giuliani, along with 16 others in an election interference case.\n\nThe indictment released Wednesday names 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring that Trump had beaten Joe Biden in Arizona in the 2020 presidential election. The names of seven other defendants were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.\n\nThe Associated Press has determined the identities of the unnamed defendants based on the indictment's descriptions of them.\n\nOne is described as an attorney \"often identified as the Mayor\" who spread false allegations of election fraud, a description that clearly describes former New York Mayor Giuliani. Another is described as Trump's \"chief of staff in 2020,\" a clear reference to Meadows.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Arizona Atty. Gen. Kris Mayes, a Democrat, said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nEleven people nominated as Arizona's Republican electors in 2020 met in Phoenix that Dec. 14 to sign a certificate claiming that they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and that Trump had carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. One of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged the Democrat's victory in the state was filed by the 11 Republicans who later signed the certificate declaring Trump the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to decertify the vote counts that showed Biden had won Arizona, and to block the state from sending the results to the electoral college for the nationwide tally. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the 11 Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 took part in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's attorney general filed felony charges in July against 16 Republican fake electors on counts that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery. Charges have been dropped against a defendant who reached a cooperation deal, and the remaining 15 have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors are among those charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing the defendants of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the state's results. They have also pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump was also indicted in federal court in August over the fake electors scheme. The indictment says that when he was unable to persuade officials in key states to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting slates of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won the states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Atty. Gen. Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors could not be prosecuted under the current law. Fake electors there and in Pennsylvania had added caveats to their election certificates, saying the submissions were in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, had conducted an investigation into the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThose charged in Arizona on Wednesday include Kelli Ward, former state GOP chair; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, a Turning Point USA executive who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack and is now a U.S. House candidate; Greg Safsten, former executive director of the state GOP; and energy executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 U.S. Senate primary.\n\nAlso charged are Robert Montgomery, former chair of the Cochise County Republican Committee; Samuel Moorhead, a GOP precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, former vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, a physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nNone of the 11 responded Wednesday to Associated Press phone, email or social media requests for comment.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com",

The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nSeven others were indicted, but their names were blacked out of records released by Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes. Her office said the names will be released after they're served with the charges.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged his victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner. Days after that lawsuit was dismissed, they participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in Nevada, Michigan and Georgia.\n\nThe eleven people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claimed Trump had carried the state in the 2020 election. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in Arizona, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner in the state.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending those results to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states. In December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans with felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results of the presidential election. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump could not persuade state officials to illegally swing the election in his favor, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said the state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate for Arizona's 8th Congressional District seat; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee during 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType":

The grand jury indictment also describes an unindicted co-conspirator who is clearly Trump.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nSeven others were indicted, but their names were blacked out of records released by Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes. Her office said the names will be released after those people are served with the charges.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nThere was no immediate response to phone messages seeking comment that were left Wednesday with the Wards, Hoffman, Lamon and Bowyer.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jonathan J.

It shows seven other defendants whose names were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the indictment.\n\nOne is described as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, a description that clearly describes Giuliani. Another is described as Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nPeople are also reading...

A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nSeven others were indicted, but their names were blacked out of records released by Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes. Her office said the names will be released after those people are served with the charges.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden\u00b4s victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nFILE - Dr. Kelli Ward, left, chair of the Arizona Republican Party, talks with a supporter of President Donald Trump as they join the crowd at a rally outside the Arizona Capitol, Nov. 7, 2020, in Phoenix.

Franklin, File)\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan\u00b4s Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden\u00b4s victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state\u00b4s five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes\u00b4 predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes\u00b4 office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes\u00b4 office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP\u00b4s chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona\u00b4s 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nThere was no immediate response to phone messages seeking comment that were left Wednesday with Jacob Hoffman, Kelli Ward, Michael Ward, James Lamon and Tyler Bowyer.\n\nAssociated Press writers Kate Brumback in Atlanta and Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, contributed to this report.\n\nFILE - Republican Rep.

The grand jury indictment also describes an unindicted co-conspirator who is clearly Trump.\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nSeven others were indicted, but their names were blacked out of records released by Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes. Her office said the names will be released after those people are served with the charges.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nThere was no immediate response to phone messages seeking comment that were left Wednesday with the Wards, Hoffman, Lamon and Bowyer.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jonathan J.

Her office said the names will be released after they're served with the charges.\n\nJoe Biden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged his victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner. Days after that lawsuit was dismissed, they participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in Nevada, Michigan and Georgia.\n\nThe 11 people met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claimed Trump had carried the state in the 2020 election. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nPresident Biden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in Arizona, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner in the state.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave President Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending those results to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states. In December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans with felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results of the presidential election. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump could not persuade state officials to illegally swing the election in his favor, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said the state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate for Arizona's 8th Congressional District seat; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee during 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nThis is a breaking news story.

Her office said the names will be released after those people are served with the charges.\n\nThe description of a defendant that matched Eastman read, in part, that the person \"was an attorney who encouraged the Republican electors to vote on December 14, 2020, and spread false claims of widespread election fraud. He also pressured the legislature in Arizona and six other states to change the outcome of the election. For example, on January 4, 2021, pushed then-Arizona Speaker of the House Rusty Bowers to convene a Special Session to decertify Arizona's presidential electors, telling him to 'just do it and let the court sort it out.'\"\n\nEastman has been quoted by Bowers as telling him that.\n\nEastman has raised more than $750,000 to help his legal defense on the site GiveSendGo.\n\nHe also casts himself as a victim of \"lawfare\" by an unhinged left, and complained that his bank accounts at Bank of America and USAA were closed without explanation. \"I strongly suspect that BofA's and USAA's decisions to cancel our accounts was a reflection of their increasingly \"woke\" corporate ideology against those who hold conservative political views or, as in my case, those who represented a client who is despised by our nation's ruling elite. If that is what is going on, it could be a big problem for them,\" he wrote on the site on April 23.\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nThere was no immediate response to phone messages seeking comment that were left Wednesday with Jacob Hoffman, Kelli Ward, Michael Ward, James Lamon and Tyler Bowyer.\n\nStaff writers Teri Sforza and Todd Harmonson and the Associated Press

The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nSeven others were indicted, but their names were blacked out of records released by Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes.

Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged his victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner. Days after that lawsuit was dismissed, they participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in Nevada, Michigan and Georgia.\n\nThe eleven people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claimed Trump had carried the state in the 2020 election. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in Arizona, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner in the state.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending those results to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states. In December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans with felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results of the presidential election. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump could not persuade state officials to illegally swing the election in his favor, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said the state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate for Arizona's 8th Congressional District seat; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee during 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.", "source": {"uri": "yorkdispatch.com", "dataType":

They were readily identifiable based on descriptions of the defendants, however.\n\nTrump himself was not charged but was referred to as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nWith the indictments, Arizona becomes the fourth state where allies of the former president have been charged with using false or unproven claims about voter fraud related to the election. Heading into a likely November rematch with Biden, Trump continues to spread lies about the last election that are echoed by many of his supporters.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic state Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe indictment alludes to Giuliani as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud. Another defendant is referred to as Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nDescriptions of other unnamed defendants point to Mike Roman, who was Trump's director of Election Day operations; John Eastman, a lawyer who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election; and Christina Bobb, a lawyer who worked with Giuliani.\n\nA lawyer for Eastman, Charles Burnham, said his client is innocent. Bobb did not respond to a text message seeking comment, nor did a lawyer who is representing Roman in a case in Georgia.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment but if Meadows is named, \"it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\" Giuliani's political adviser, Ted Goodman, decried what he called \"the continued weaponization of our justice system.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time.

Another is described as Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the US Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a US Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nNone of the 11 responded to either phone, email or social media

It shows seven other defendants whose names were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the indictment.\n\nOne is described as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, a description that clearly describes Giuliani. Another is described as Trump's \"chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nPeople are also reading...

A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nNone of the 11 responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press on Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nRead more: National Arizona indicts 18 in case over 2020 election in Arizona, including Giuliani and Meadows By JACQUES BILLEAUD and JOSH KELETY - Associated Press 5 takeaways from the Jan. 6 report 1.

A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nSeven others were indicted, but their names were blacked out of records released by Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes. Her office said the names will be released after those people are served with the charges.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nThere was no immediate response to phone messages

President Trump is an unindicted co-conspirator\n\nThe indictment released Wednesday names 11 Republicans, including the attorney Boris Epshteyn, who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring that Mr. Trump defeated President Biden in Arizona in the last presidential election. It also features seven other defendants whose names were not immediately released because they had not yet been served.\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the indictment.\n\nOne is described as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, a description that clearly describes Mr. Giuliani. Another is described as Mr. Trump's \"chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Mr. Meadows.\n\nAttorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, said in a video statement \"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined. It's too important.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met at Phoenix on December 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Mr. Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party.\n\nThe document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored. Mr. Biden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Mr. Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Mr. Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, a district court judge, Diane Humetewa, said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing. The Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filings. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General, Dana Nessel, in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican \"alternate electors.\" One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Mr. Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in that state.\n\nMr. Trump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Mr. Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that his state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, alternate electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nNone of the 11 Arizona defendants responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press on Wednesday seeking comment.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jonathan J.

A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nSeven others were indicted, but their names were blacked out of records released by Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes. Her office said the names will be released after those people are served with the charges.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nThere was no immediate response to phone messages seeking comment that were left Wednesday with Jacob Hoffman, Kelli Ward, Michael Ward, James Lamon and Tyler Bowyer.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Kate Brumback in Atlanta and Marc Levy in

Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in Arizona, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner in the state.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending those results to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states. In December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans with felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results of the presidential election.

There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump could not persuade state officials to illegally swing the election in his favor, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said the state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate for Arizona's 8th Congressional District seat; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee during 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES

No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nNone of the 11 responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press on Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nRead more: National Arizona indicts 18 in case over 2020 election in Arizona, including Giuliani and Meadows By JACQUES BILLEAUD and JOSH KELETY - Associated Press 5 takeaways from the Jan. 6 report 1.

It shows seven other defendants whose names were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the indictment.\n\nOne is described as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, a description that clearly describes Giuliani. Another is described as Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nReactions mixed to Wentzville superintendent's $1 million buyout Former Wentzville schools superintendent gets more than $1 million in contract buyout St. Louis Zoo closed after 'intel' on Washington University carnival fights coming there Bally Sports owner banks on streaming TV growth, expects Amazon Prime deal by October Geno Auriemma says Dawn Staley's undefeated season was 'harder today' Holleman: She became a local celebrity during COVID.

A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nNone of the 11 responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press on Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nAssociated Press writers Jonathan J.

They're charged with nine counts each of conspiracy, fraud and forgery. The identities of seven other defendants, including Giuliani and Meadows, were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.\n\nTrump, who is described in the indictment as an unindicted co-conspirator, has argued that he can't be prosecuted for acts he committed while serving as president. The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday will hear arguments on his bid to avoid federal prosecution over his efforts to reverse his loss.\n\nWith the indictments, Arizona becomes the fourth state where allies of the former president have been charged with using false or unproven claims about voter fraud related to the election. Heading into a likely November rematch with Biden, Trump continues to make claims of fraud in the 2020 election echoed by many of his supporters.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the document.\n\nOne is an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread allegations of election fraud, which clearly describes Giuliani. Another is Trump's \"chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nDescriptions of other unnamed defendants point to Mike Roman, who was Trump's director of Election Day operations; John Eastman, a lawyer who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election; and Christina Bobb, a lawyer who worked with Giuliani. Eastman and Bobb did not respond to text messages seeking comment, nor did a lawyer who is representing Roman in a case in Georgia.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment but if Meadows is named, \"it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\" Giuliani's political adviser, Ted Goodman, decried what he called \"the continued weaponization of our justice system.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded innocent.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, past president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nIn a statement, Hoffman accused Mayes of weaponizing the attorney general's office in bringing the case but didn't directly comment on the indictment's allegations.\n\n\"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process,\" Hoffman said.\n\nNone of the others responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press seeking comment by deadline.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Jonathan J. Cooper, Kate Brumback and Marc Levy of The Associated Press.\n\nFILE - Mark Meadows speaks with reporters at the White House, Oct. 21, 2020, in Washington.

Another is described as Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates.

The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges.

They include the former state party chair, a 2022 U.S. Senate candidate and two sitting state lawmakers, who are charged with nine counts each of conspiracy, fraud and forgery.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe identities of seven other defendants, including Giuliani and Meadows, were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the documents. They were readily identifiable based on descriptions of the defendants, however.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTrump himself was not charged but was referred to as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nWith the indictments, Arizona becomes the fourth state where allies of the former president have been charged with using false or unproven claims about voter fraud related to the election. Heading into a likely November rematch with Biden, Trump continues to spread lies about the last election that are echoed by many of his supporters.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic state Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe indictment alludes to Giuliani as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud. Another defendant is referred to as Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nDescriptions of other unnamed defendants point to Mike Roman, who was Trump's director of Election Day operations; John Eastman, a lawyer who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election; and Christina Bobb, a lawyer who worked with Giuliani.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nA lawyer for Eastman, Charles Burnham, said his client is innocent. Bobb did not respond to a text message seeking comment, nor did a lawyer who is representing Roman in a case in Georgia.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment but if Meadows is named, \"it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\" Giuliani's political adviser, Ted Goodman, decried what he called \"the continued weaponization of our justice system.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump was indicted in August in federal court over efforts to cling to power after his defeat, including the fake electors scheme. The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday will hear arguments on his claim in that case that he can't be prosecuted for acts he committed while serving as president.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nThe so-called fake electors facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, past president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn a statement, Hoffman accused Mayes of weaponizing the attorney general's office in bringing the case but didn't directly comment on the indictment's allegations.\n\n\"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process,\" Hoffman said.\n\nNone of the others responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Gabe Stern and Scott Sonner in Las Vegas, Kate Brumback in Atlanta and Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_j_cooper@thestar.com", "name": "Jonathan J.

The signers identified themselves as certified state electors, even though state officials already certified the Democratic Party's nominations as the rightful electors.\n\n\"I will not allow American Democracy to be undermined,\" Mayes said in a video statement released alongside the indictment. \"We're here because justice demands an answer to the efforts the defendants and unindicted co-conspirators allegedly took to undermine the will of Arizona's voters during the 2020 election.\"\n\nAmong those indicted are active state Senators Jake Hoffman and Anthony Kern, the latter of whom is under FBI investigation for his participation in the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection.\n\nFormer Arizona state Senator and Arizona GOP chair Kelli Ward, her husband Michael Ward, and Turning Point Action chief operating officer Tyler Bowyer are also named as defendants.\n\nThe remaining six \"fake electors\" charged are:\n\nThose mentioned in the indictment, following the lead of the former president and other Republicans across the country, peddled baseless theories of election fraud, claiming that Trump was the true winner in 2020. The theories were aimed at pressuring election officials to change the outcome of the 2020 election, according to the indictment. Those ideas inspired \"fake elector\" schemes in Arizona and six other states, including Nevada and New Mexico.\n\n\"These defendants deceived the citizens of Arizona by falsely claiming that those votes were contingent only on a legal challenge that would change the outcome of the election,\" Mayes said. \"None of the legal challenges filed in Arizona state and federal courts regarding the 2020 election were remotely successful at any stage of the case.\"\n\nThe indictment also includes redacted names of seven other \"conspirators,\" who will be revealed as soon as possible, according to an attorney general spokesperson. But the mystery characters are already apparent. The document makes reference to Rudy Guiliani as a Trump attorney often identified as \"the mayor,\" and Mark Meadows as Trump's chief of staff in 2020.\n\nBased on the descriptions of the remaining five, they appear to be Trump attorneys Jenna Ellis, John Eastman and Christina Bobb, Trump campaign adviser Boris Epshteyn and former campaign aide Mike Roman.\n\nTrump is listed as a conspirator -- his name is redacted -- but he isn't charged.\n\nThe nine charges against all 18 defendants include fraud, forgery, and conspiracy -- class 2, 4, and 5 felonies.\n\nBefore each presidential election, both the Democratic and Republican parties in each state select one elector for each congressional seat that state has. Arizona has 11. Once the popular vote in the state determines a winner, the governor certifies the electors chosen by the winning party, who then cast their votes in alignment with the popular vote.\n\nThe 11 indicted \"fake electors\" were chosen by the Republican Party, but weren't certified because the candidate on the Republican ticket lost. Thus, they lacked authority to sign the certificate claiming to be electors and giving Arizona's votes to Trump.\n\nDiscussions to use Republican electors to change the election outcome began as early as Nov. 4, 2020, according to the indictment, which details memos drafted by the Trump administration that advocate for Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania to \"send their own electors to vote and have it go to the SCOTUS.\"\n\nTexts from Trump suggest that states should have refused to seat Democrat electors, regardless of the election outcome. Attorneys for Trump eventually decided that the strategy was \"legally unsound,\" but Trump's campaign continued to fight anyway, according to the indictment.\n\nBy early December, Ward was put in charge of organizing the 10 other Republican electors to convene to cast their votes.\n\nThe electors defended their actions to reporters in the following weeks.\n\n\"In unprecedented times, unprecedented action has occurred,\" Hoffman said in January 2021.", "source": {"uri": "courthousenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Court House News Service"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Mr Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Mr Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Mr Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College.\n\nIn dismissing the case, US district judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case, and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims\".\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's attorney general filed felony charges in July against 16 Republican fake electors, including forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery. One defendant had the charges dropped after reaching a co-operation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Mr Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Mr Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nMr Trump was also indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Mr Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Mr Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico attorney general Raul Torrez said that the state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors.\n\nNo charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mr Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mr Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mr Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges.\n\nA grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state Republican Party's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state senator Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organisation Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Senator Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the US Capitol during the January 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a US Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nNone of the 11 responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press on Wednesday seeking comment.", "source":

(Screenshot via AZGOP)\n\nA grand jury has indicted 18 people, including two Arizona state senators and the former head of the Arizona Republican Party, in a fake elector scheme that aimed to install Donald Trump as the president after he lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden.\n\nThe Arizona Attorney General's Office has not released the names of everyone who was indicted, but all 11 fake electors were charged:\n\nKelli Ward, former AZGOP chairmanArizona Sen. Jake Hoffman, leader of the Arizona Freedom CaucusArizona Sen. Anthony Kern, member of the Arizona Freedom CaucusTyler Bowyer, Turning Point USA CEOMichael Ward, husband of Kelli WardNancy Cottle, a Republican who's been active in local politics for a decadeJames Lamon, a failed 2022 U.S. Senate candidateRobert Montgomery, former chairman of the Cochise County Republican CommitteeSamuel Moorhead, former chairman of Gila County Republican PartyLorraine Pellegrino, former president of the Ahwatukee Republican WomenGregory Safsten, former executive director of the AZGOP\n\nThere were also seven people indicted whose names were redacted.\n\nRichie Taylor, a spokesman for the Attorney General's office told the Arizona Mirror that the names were redacted because they haven't yet been served. He said that service should happen quickly and once it is completed, an unredacted indictment will be published.\n\nThe identities of some of the redacted defendants were obvious, including Rudy Giuliani, who was described as an attorney for Trump who was often referred to as \"the mayor,\" former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Mike Roman, the director of Election Day operations for the Trump campaign.\n\nGiuliani was one of the big names who spread false claims of election fraud following the Nov. 3, 2020 election, and he held a hearing in Phoenix in late November where he claimed that Arizona's elections officials had made no effort to ensure that the results of the presidential election were accurate.\n\nAll 11 of the fake electors were charged with conspiracy, fraudulent schemes and artifices, fraudulent schemes and practices and forgery, which are all felonies.\n\nThe fake electors were indicted by a grand jury on April 23 for signing bogus documents claiming that Donald Trump won the 2020 election, after Trump's campaign allegedly urged them to do so.\n\nTrump is identified in the indictment as \"unindicted co-conspirator 1.\"\n\nIn the indictment, all of the fake electors are implicated in an attempt to deceive \"the public with false claims of election fraud in order to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency.\"\n\nThey are accused of attempting to keep \"President Donald J. Trump in office against the will of Arizona voters, and depriving Arizona voters of their right to vote and have their votes counted.\"\n\nAccording to the indictment, the fake electors forged certificates of Electoral College votes for President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Michael Pence and filed those with the Arizona Secretary of State and the chief judge of the Federal District Court for the District of Arizona.\n\nThe Signing. pic.twitter.com/6gPsfqrk7T\n\n-- Republican Party of Arizona (@AZGOP) December 14, 2020\n\nThe group is also charged with pressuring the Maricopa Board of Supervisors, the state Legislature and then-Gov. Doug Ducey to change the election results.\n\nThe fake electors are additionally accused of trying to trick Arizonans into believing that their fraudulent votes were contingent on a successful outcome in Trump's challenge of the 2020 election results, when they were actually trying to urge Pence to reject the votes for Biden on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Ward organized the fake elector vote, and proclaimed that they were Arizona's \"true electors.\"\n\nSeveral of the fake electors, including Hoffman, Kern, Ward and Bowyer, have continued to spread the unfounded claim that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, even though no evidence of that has ever come to light.\n\nHoffman sent a letter to then-Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 5, 2021, asking him to delay the certification of the election results and to check with the Arizona Legislature to determine which slate of presidential electors to use.\n\nHoffman issued a statement Wednesday evening, shortly after Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes released news of the indictments.\n\n\"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this disgusting political persecution by the judicial process,\" Hoffman wrote. \"Kris Mayes & the Democrats' naked corruption and weaponization of government will long be a stain on the history of our great state and nation.\"\n\nHoffman additionally alleged that Mayes made up her mind that the fake electors were guilty before she even began an investigation, saying that the indictments were an effort to go after her political opponents.\n\nThe Arizona Republican Party condemned the indictments and called them \"politically motivated\" and \"designed to silence dissent and weaponize the law against political opponents.\"\n\n\"The timing of these charges -- precisely four years after the 2020 election and as President Biden seeks re-election -- is suspiciously convenient and politically motivated. This is not justice; it is pure election interference,\" the AZGOP said in its statement.\n\nThere were multiple fake elector schemes in Arizona, one tied to the AZGOP which included the above-named electors, as well as another one by the Sovereign Citizens of the Great State of Arizona that was not tied to the Trump campaign.\n\nGeorgia, Michigan and Nevada have already brought charges against fake electors there, and Wisconsin is still investigating possible charges for its fake electors.\n\nArizona Senate Minority Leader Mitzi Epstein lauded Mayes for sending the message that attempting to subvert the will of the people and stop the peaceful transfer of power comes with legal consequences.\n\n\"I appreciate Attorney General Mayes' leadership in ensuring that Arizona's fake electors are held accountable,\" Epstein said in a statement. \" The individuals who played into and spread the big lie that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump are dangerous to our nation's democracy.\"\n\nThis story was written and produced by the Arizona Mirror which is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

The names of several other indicted defendants remain redacted, Mayes said in a statement Wednesday, until those people have been served.\n\n\"A state grand jury made up of everyday regular Arizonans, has now handed down felony indictments for all 11 Republican electors as well as several others connected to this scheme,\" Mayes said. \"These are serious indictments, but this is the first hurdle the state must pass in our constitutional criminal justice system. We intend to prove these crimes were committed beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nWhile Trump is not among those charged in Arizona, the details in the indictment suggest he is \"Unindicted Coconspirator 1.\"\n\nThe indictment in Arizona includes nine counts, from conspiracy and forgery to engaging in fraudulent schemes. Because the indictment remains partially redacted, it is unclear what charges Trump allies such as Meadows, Epshteyn and Giuliani face.\n\n\"In Arizona, and the United States, the people elected Joseph Biden as President on November 3, 2020,\" the indictment reads. \"Unwilling to accept this fact, Defendants and unindicted coconspirators schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency to keep Unindicted Coconspirator 1 in office against the will of Arizona's voters.\"\n\nThe scheme, according to the indictment, called for the fake electors to fraudulently vote for Trump, \"falsely claiming to be the duly elected and qualified Electors for President and Vice President of the United States from the State of Arizona.\"\n\n\"Defendants deceived the citizens of Arizona by falsely claiming that those votes were contingent only on a legal challenge that would change the outcome of the election,\" the indictment continues. \"In reality, Defendants intended that their false votes for Trump-Pence would encourage Pence to reject the Biden-Harris votes on January 6, 2021, regardless of the outcome of the legal challenge.\"\n\nThis scheme failed on January 6, 2021, when then-Vice President Mike Pence accepted the electoral votes for Joe Biden, the indictment says.\n\nWhile the names of several defendants in the Arizona case remain redacted because they have not yet been served, the indictment does describe their roles in the alleged plot.\n\nOther individuals charged in the Arizona indictment but whose names have been redacted, the source familiar with the investigation told CNN, include Trump allies Mike Roman, a 2020 campaign official; Trump campaign lawyer Jenna Ellis; and conservative attorney John Eastman.\n\nRoman, Ellis and Eastman also were charged in the election subversion case in Georgia, as were Meadows and Giuliani. Ellis pleaded guilty to one charge in the Georgia case. The others have pleaded not guilty.\n\nEpshteyn has not been charged before in connection with 2020 post-election efforts to reverse Trump's loss.\n\nMeadows, whose name is redacted in the indictment but is listed as Trump's chief of staff in 2020, \"worked with members of the Trump Campaign to coordinate and implement the false Republican electors' votes in Arizona and six other states,\" the indictment says, and \"was involved in the many efforts to keep (Trump) in power despite his defeat at the polls.\"\n\nThe individual who CNN has identified as Giuliani is described as spreading false claims of voter fraud across the country after the 2020 election, falsely claiming Arizona officials \"made no effort to find out\" if the vote was accurate, and encouraging \"Republican electors in Arizona and in six other contested states to vote for Trump-Pence on December 14, 2020,\" the indictment says.\n\nOther unnamed defendants allegedly worked to overthrow the 2020 election results by encouraging Pence to reject or delay the certification of the electoral vote on January 6, spreading false claims of voter fraud, encouraging the fake electors and working to implement the fake electors scheme in Arizona.\n\nThe case adds scrutiny to actions taken on Trump's behalf after the last election. It also comes as Trump's legal team will argue before the Supreme Court Thursday that he's immune from prosecution in the federal election interference case - at the same time Trump is on trial in New York related to hush money paid to cover up an alleged affair before the 2016 election.\n\nThe Arizona case is the latest state-level prosecution aimed at schemes to upend Biden's electoral victory. Prosecutors in Michigan, Georgia and Nevada also have brought criminal charges against some of the people who signed on as fake electors in those states. Investigators in Wisconsin are conducting a similar probe.\n\nA grand jury empaneled in Maricopa County, Arizona, to investigate efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the state met this week before Mayes announced the charges.\n\nCNN previously reported that Arizona prosecutors had issued a series of grand jury subpoenas to people connected to Trump's campaign and several individuals who served as fake electors from that state - a sign the probe was accelerating ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nSome of the fake electors who were ultimately charged in Arizona recently appeared before the grand jury and cited their Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination, sources familiar with the probe told CNN.\n\nMayes initially focused her investigation on the 11 fake electors from Arizona and those who helped organize them, but the sources recently told CNN she also was looking into individuals tied to the former president's national campaign.\n\n\"We conducted a thorough and professional investigation over the past 13 months into the fake electoral scheme in our state,\" Mayes said Wednesday. \"I understand for some of you today didn't come fast enough. And I know I'll be criticized by others for conducting this investigation at all. But as I've stated before, and will say here again today, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined.\"\n\nSeveral state-level officials from Arizona told the House Select Committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot that Trump and his allies tried to pressure them to decertify the state's election results.\n\nThe fake electors for Trump convened at the state Republican Party headquarters in Phoenix on December 14, 2020. They broadcast themselves preparing to sign the documents, allegedly provided by a Trump campaign attorney, claiming that they were the legitimate representatives of the state's electoral votes.\n\nBy that time, Trump's loss in the state - by fewer than 11,000 votes - had already been certified by its Republican governor, affirming that Biden won Arizona in the 2020 presidential election. But in the weeks that followed, some of the fake electors continued to push for Pence to reject the legitimate Democratic slate of electors.\n\nThe fake elector scheme and pressure campaign on Pence are focal points of special counsel Jack Smith's federal indictment of Trump.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN's Rashard Rose contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The names of several other indicted defendants remain redacted, Mayes said in a statement Wednesday, until those people have been served.\n\n\"A state grand jury made up of everyday regular Arizonans, has now handed down felony indictments for all 11 Republican electors as well as several others connected to this scheme,\" Mayes said. \"These are serious indictments, but this is the first hurdle the state must pass in our constitutional criminal justice system. We intend to prove these crimes were committed beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nWhile Trump is not among those charged in Arizona, the details in the indictment suggest he is \"Unindicted Coconspirator 1.\"\n\nCNN is reaching out to those charged for comment.\n\nTrump allies 'deceived the citizens of Arizona' after 2020 election, indictment alleges\n\nThe indictment in Arizona includes nine counts, from conspiracy and forgery to engaging in fraudulent schemes. Because the indictment remains partially redacted, it is unclear what charges Trump allies such as Meadows, Epshteyn and Giuliani face.\n\n\"In Arizona, and the United States, the people elected Joseph Biden as President on November 3, 2020,\" the indictment reads. \"Unwilling to accept this fact, Defendants and unindicted coconspirators schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency to keep Unindicted Coconspirator 1 in office against the will of Arizona's voters.\"\n\nThe scheme, according to the indictment, called for the fake electors to fraudulently vote for Trump, \"falsely claiming to be the duly elected and qualified Electors for President and Vice President of the United States from the State of Arizona.\"\n\n\"Defendants deceived the citizens of Arizona by falsely claiming that those votes were contingent only on a legal challenge that would change the outcome of the election,\" the indictment continues. \"In reality, Defendants intended that their false votes for Trump-Pence would encourage Pence to reject the Biden-Harris votes on January 6, 2021, regardless of the outcome of the legal challenge.\"\n\nThis scheme failed on January 6, 2021, when then-Vice President Mike Pence accepted the electoral votes for Joe Biden, the indictment says.\n\nEastman and Trump 2020 campaign officials also indicted\n\nWhile the names of several defendants in the Arizona case remain redacted because they have not yet been served, the indictment does describe their roles in the alleged plot.\n\nOther individuals charged in the Arizona indictment but whose names have been redacted, the source familiar with the investigation told CNN, include Trump allies Mike Roman, a 2020 campaign official; Trump campaign lawyer Jenna Ellis; and conservative attorney John Eastman.\n\nRoman, Ellis and Eastman also were charged in the election subversion case in Georgia, as were Meadows and Giuliani. Ellis pleaded guilty to one charge in the Georgia case. The others have pleaded not guilty.\n\nEpshteyn has not been charged before in connection with 2020 post-election efforts to reverse Trump's loss.\n\nMeadows, whose name is redacted in the indictment but is listed as Trump's chief of staff in 2020, \"worked with members of the Trump Campaign to coordinate and implement the false Republican electors' votes in Arizona and six other states,\" the indictment says, and \"was involved in the many efforts to keep (Trump) in power despite his defeat at the polls.\"\n\nThe individual who CNN has identified as Giuliani is described as spreading false claims of voter fraud across the country after the 2020 election, falsely claiming Arizona officials \"made no effort to find out\" if the vote was accurate, and encouraging \"Republican electors in Arizona and in six other contested states to vote for Trump-Pence on December 14, 2020,\" the indictment says.\n\nOther unnamed defendants allegedly worked to overthrow the 2020 election results by encouraging Pence to reject or delay the certification of the electoral vote on January 6, spreading false claims of voter fraud, encouraging the fake electors and working to implement the fake electors scheme in Arizona.\n\nThe case adds scrutiny to actions taken on Trump's behalf after the last election. It also comes as Trump's legal team will argue before the Supreme Court Thursday that he's immune from prosecution in the federal election interference case - at the same time Trump is on trial in New York related to hush money paid to cover up an alleged affair before the 2016 election.\n\nLatest prosecution of fake electors schemes\n\nThe Arizona case is the latest state-level prosecution aimed at schemes to upend Biden's electoral victory. Prosecutors in Michigan, Georgia and Nevada also have brought criminal charges against some of the people who signed on as fake electors in those states. Investigators in Wisconsin are conducting a similar probe.\n\nA grand jury empaneled in Maricopa County, Arizona, to investigate efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the state met this week before Mayes announced the charges.\n\nCNN previously reported that Arizona prosecutors had issued a series of grand jury subpoenas to people connected to Trump's campaign and several individuals who served as fake electors from that state - a sign the probe was accelerating ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nSome of the fake electors who were ultimately charged in Arizona recently appeared before the grand jury and cited their Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination, sources familiar with the probe told CNN.\n\nMayes initially focused her investigation on the 11 fake electors from Arizona and those who helped organize them, but the sources recently told CNN she also was looking into individuals tied to the former president's national campaign.\n\n\"We conducted a thorough and professional investigation over the past 13 months into the fake electoral scheme in our state,\" Mayes said Wednesday. \"I understand for some of you today didn't come fast enough. And I know I'll be criticized by others for conducting this investigation at all. But as I've stated before, and will say here again today, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined.\"\n\nSeveral state-level officials from Arizona told the House Select Committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot that Trump and his allies tried to pressure them to decertify the state's election results.\n\nThe fake electors for Trump convened at the state Republican Party headquarters in Phoenix on December 14, 2020. They broadcast themselves preparing to sign the documents, allegedly provided by a Trump campaign attorney, claiming that they were the legitimate representatives of the state's electoral votes.\n\nBy that time, Trump's loss in the state - by fewer than 11,000 votes - had already been certified by its Republican governor, affirming that Biden won Arizona in the 2020 presidential election. But in the weeks that followed, some of the fake electors continued to push for Pence to reject the legitimate Democratic slate of electors.\n\nThe fake elector scheme and pressure campaign on Pence are focal points of special counsel Jack Smith's federal indictment of Trump.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN's Rashard Rose contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Others include attorneys John Eastman, Jenna Ellis and Christina Bobb, as well as Trump 2020 campaign operative Mike Roman.\n\nKen Chesebro, an attorney who helped devise Trump's post-election strategy, is described as \"unindicted coconspirator 4.\"\n\nThe only defendants whose names are visible in the version of the indictment released by the Arizona attorney general's office Wednesday evening are the 11 Republicans who falsely posed as the state's presidential electors despite Joe Biden's narrow victory there. Among them: former Arizona GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward, state senators Jake Hoffman and Anthony Kern, and Arizona's RNC committeeman Tyler Bowyer.\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, has been helming the aggressive investigation. Though she initially appeared to be focused primarily on the false electors, in recent months it became clear that the scope of the probe was broader than previously understood and swept up prominent Trump allies at the national level.\n\nMayes is the fifth prosecutor to bring criminal charges over the sprawling, multi-state bid by Trump and his allies to upend the 2020 results. Special counsel Jack Smith has charged Trump with federal crimes for those efforts. Prosecutors in Georgia have charged Trump and many of his allies for their efforts to overturn the results in that state, including the fake electors plot. Prosecutors in Michigan and Nevada have also charged Republicans who posed as fake electors in those states.\n\nThe announcement felt like something right out of 1984 or out of a Communist Regime.\n\nThe indictment in Arizona includes nine counts, from conspiracy and forgery to engaging in fraudulent schemes. Because the indictment remains partially redacted, it is unclear what charges Trump allies such as Meadows, Epshteyn and Giuliani face.\n\n\"In Arizona, and the United States, the people elected Joseph Biden as President on November 3, 2020,\" the indictment reads. \"Unwilling to accept this fact, Defendants and unindicted coconspirators schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency to keep Unindicted Coconspirator 1 in office against the will of Arizona's voters.\"\n\nThe scheme, according to the indictment, called for the fake electors to fraudulently vote for Trump, \"falsely claiming to be the duly elected and qualified Electors for President and Vice President of the United States from the State of Arizona.\"\n\n\"Defendants deceived the citizens of Arizona by falsely claiming that those votes were contingent only on a legal challenge that would change the outcome of the election,\" the indictment continues. \"In reality, Defendants intended that their false votes for Trump-Pence would encourage Pence to reject the Biden-Harris votes on January 6, 2021, regardless of the outcome of the legal challenge.\"\n\nThis scheme failed on January 6, 2021, when then-Vice President Mike Pence accepted the electoral votes for Joe Biden, the indictment says.\n\nCNN is reaching out to those charged for comment.\n\nThe case adds scrutiny to actions taken on Trump's behalf after the last election. It also comes as Trump's legal team will argue before the Supreme Court Thursday that he's immune from prosecution in the federal election interference case - at the same time Trump is on trial in New York related to hush money paid to cover up an alleged affair before the 2016 election.\n\nThe Arizona case is the latest state-level prosecution aimed at schemes to upend Biden's electoral victory. Prosecutors in Michigan, Georgia and Nevada also have brought criminal charges against some of the people who signed on as fake electors in those states. Investigators in Wisconsin are conducting a similar probe.\n\nA grand jury empaneled in Maricopa County, Arizona, to investigate efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the state met this week before Mayes announced the charges.\n\nCNN previously reported that Arizona prosecutors had issued a series of grand jury subpoenas to people connected to Trump's campaign and several individuals who served as fake electors from that state - a sign the probe was accelerating ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nSome of the fake electors who were ultimately charged in Arizona recently appeared before the grand jury and cited their Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination, sources familiar with the probe told CNN.\n\nMayes initially focused her investigation on the 11 fake electors from Arizona and those who helped organize them, but the sources recently told CNN she also was looking into individuals tied to the former president's national campaign.\n\n\"We conducted a thorough and professional investigation over the past 13 months into the fake electoral scheme in our state,\" Mayes said Wednesday. \"I understand for some of you today didn't come fast enough. And I know I'll be criticized by others for conducting this investigation at all. But as I've stated before, and will say here again today, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined.\"\n\nSeveral state-level officials from Arizona told the House Select Committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot that Trump and his allies tried to pressure them to decertify the state's election results.\n\nThis is a developing story.\n\nWe'll continue to monitor and bring you updates as we have them.", "source": {"uri": "100percentfedup.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "100 Percent Fed Up"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

John McCain, R-Ariz., in the race for the Republican nomination to U.S. Senate, Aug. 30, 2016, at her primary night party at a hotel in Scottsdale, Ariz. Ward and her husband are two of 11 Republicans in Arizona who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring Donald Trump had beaten Joe Biden in the state during the 2020 presidential election were charged Wednesday, April 24, 2024, with conspiracy, fraud and forgery, marking the fourth state to bring charges against \"fake electors.\"\n\nBy JACQUES BILLEAUD and JOSH KELETY - Associated Press\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- An Arizona grand jury has indicted former Donald Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows and lawyer Rudy Giuliani along with 16 others in an election interference case.\n\nThe indictment released Wednesday names 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring that Donald Trump beat Joe Biden in Arizona in the 2020 presidential election. It shows seven other defendants whose names were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the indictment.\n\nOne is described as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, a description that clearly describes Giuliani. Another is described as Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nJarrod DeGeorgia, former Sioux City Bandits coach and quarterback, dead at age 49 Developer wants former nursing home on Sioux City's north side rezoned Authorities investigating Harrison County homicide Four of Siouxland's favorite food trucks going head-to-head in a charity battle royale New market manager takes over popular Sioux City Farmers Market for 2024 season Sioux City native named to Time100's Most Influential People of 2024 DEAR ABBY: Flurry of new sounds drifts through quiet neighborhood Smithland, Iowa roadhouse to be profiled as one of 'America's Favorite Restaurants' Restaurant Week returns to Downtown Sioux City on Tuesday Court documents: North Sioux man tried to make traffic stops at Bacon Creek Park Lee wins Olympic Team Trials title at 57 kilograms Meet the SCJ's 2023-24 Small School All-Area Boys' Basketball Team Judge rules Sioux City School Board member Dan Greenwell must pay attorney fees in Gausman lawsuit Sioux City woman pleads guilty of child endangerment Woodbury County Court Report for April 23, 2024\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nNone of the 11 responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press on Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nAssociated Press writers Jonathan J. Cooper in Phoenix, Kate Brumback in Atlanta and Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The hope was that then-Vice President Mike Pence would recognize those Trump-supporting electors instead of the true electoral votes cast for Biden.\n\nWithout naming him, the indictment asserts that Giuliani -- often identified as \"the Mayor\" -- spread false claims of election fraud in Arizona. He pressured Arizona officials to change the outcome of the state's election, and was responsible for encouraging the pro-Trump electors to vote for the former president's ticket, according to the indictment.\n\nFormer Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R ) implicated Giuliani in his 2022 testimony before the House Jan. 6 committee. Bowers said that, despite repeatedly pushing the New York mayor-turned-Trump-surrogate for proof to back up his 2020 election fraud claims, Giuliani failed to produce any.\n\n\"My recollection, [Giuliani] said, 'We've got lots of theories, we just don't have the evidence,'\" Bowers testified.\n\nMeadows, also unnamed in the indictment, allegedly worked with members of Trump's campaign to \"coordinate and implement\" the alternate electors' votes in the battleground states, and was involved in \"many efforts to keep Unindicted Coconspirator 1 (Trump) in power despite his defeat at the polls,\" the charging document reads.\n\nThe other Trump allies allegedly helped implement the scheme, including by pressuring Pence to accept the pro-Trump slate of electors, according to the indictment.\n\nThe so-called 'fake electors' indicted are former Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward; her husband, Michael Ward; Tyler Bowyer, the chief operating officer of Turning Point Action; Nancy Cottle, who has held positions on the Maricopa County Republican Committee; Arizona State Sen. Jacob Hoffman; Arizona State Sen. Anthony Kern; former U.S. Senate candidate James Lamon; former Cochise County Republican Party Chair Robert Montgomery; Samuel Moorhead, a former Gila County Republican Party precinct committeeman; former Ahwatukee Republican Women president Lorraine Pellegrino; and Gregory Safsted, the state Republican party's former executive director.\n\nPro-Trump electors in Michigan, Nevada and Georgia have also faced charges for attempting to subvert the results of the 2020 presidential election.", "source": {"uri": "wfla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFLA"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Giuliani, along with former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, RNC integrity Lawyer Christina Bobb and a total of 18 Trump allies and Arizona Republicans who falsely declared Trump won in 2020 are accused of trying to steal the election.\n\n'It's not a coincidence that this is happening as we approach the summer before the election,' Ted Goodman, political advisor for Giuliani, told DailyMail.com. Giuliani 'is proud to stand up for the countless Americans who raised legitimate concerns surrounding the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election,' he added. Eleven Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring that Donald Trump beat Joe Biden in Arizona in the 2020 presidential election were charged Wednesday with conspiracy, fraud and forgery, marking the fourth state to bring charges against 'fake electors.'\n\nIt shows seven other defendants whose names were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges but the descriptions matched Giuliani, Meadows and former Trump campaign operative Mike Roman. Trump is described as 'Unindicted Co-conspirator 1' in the indictment, which includes charges of conspiracy, fraud and forgery. 'It's unfortunate to see so many so-called 'leaders' who are willing to eviscerate our entire justice system in their quest to take down the biggest threat to their grasp on power -- President Donald Trump and anyone willing to take on the ruling regime,' Goodman said.\n\nDemocratic Attorney General Kris Mayes' office said the names will be released after those people are served with the charges. 'Meanwhile in the Banana Republic of Arizona...' Senate candidate Kari Lake wrote on X of her home state. 'I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,' Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. 'It's too important.' A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored. Biden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden\u00b4s victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and 'failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims. Days after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing. Another defendant whose name is redacted is Trump lawyer Christina Bobb, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung confirmed, calling the Arizona indictment 'another example of Democrats' weaponization of the legal system.' 'Christina Bobb is a former Marine Corps officer, who served our nation and the President with distinction. The Democrat platform for 2024: if you can't beat them, try to throw them in jail,' Cheung said. Pictured: Ex-White House aide Boris Epshteyn.\n\nBoris Epshteyn, former Trump attorney Jenna Ellis and John Eastman, a former dean of Chapman University's law school and an advisor to former President Trump, are also on the list. The Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states. In December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty . A state investigator testified Wednesday that he considers former President Donald Trump , former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani to be uncharged co-conspirators in the Michigan fake electors plot. Howard Shock, whose work led to forgery charges against more than a dozen people in Michigan, was being cross-examined Wednesday in Lansing as part of a hearing Wednesday to determine if there's enough evidence to order a trail. Pictured left: John Eastman.\n\nA defense attorney, Duane Silverthorn, offered a series of names and asked Shock if they were 'unindicted co-conspirators,' which means they weren't charged but could have been part of an alleged plot to put Michigan's electoral votes in Trump's column. Shock responded 'yes' to Trump, Meadows, Giuliani and some high-ranking state Republicans. In Michigan, authorities said more than a dozen Republicans sent certificates to Congress falsely declaring they were electors and that Trump was the winner of the 2020 election in the state, despite results showing he had lost. Trump is in court this week for the Stormy Daniels hush money case after the jury selection process wrapped up last week. In Georgia, Trump, Giuliani and others are charged with conspiracy related to the filing of a Republican elector certificate in that state following the 2020 election .\n\nMeadows is also charged in Georgia but not in relation to the elector scheme. They have pleaded not guilty. An indictment by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith charging Trump with plotting to overturn the election also accuses the former president in a fake elector scheme and identifies six unnamed and unindicted co-conspirators, including Giuliani. In Wisconsin, ten Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit , admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden\u00b4s victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin . Trump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state\u00b4s five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania. In Arizona, Mayes\u00b4 predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes\u00b4 office. In another election-related case brought by Mayes\u00b4 office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nNone of the 11 responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press on Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nRead more: National Arizona indicts 18 in case over 2020 election in Arizona, including Giuliani and Meadows By JACQUES BILLEAUD and JOSH KELETY - Associated Press 5 takeaways from the Jan. 6 report 1.

COOPER and JOSH KELETY - Associated Press\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- An Arizona grand jury has indicted former President Donald Trump 's chief of staff Mark Meadows, lawyer Rudy Giuliani and 16 others for their roles in an attempt to overturn Trump's loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 election.\n\nThe indictment released Wednesday names 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring that Trump won Arizona in 2020. They include the former state party chair, a 2022 U.S. Senate candidate and two sitting state lawmakers, who are charged with nine counts each of conspiracy, fraud and forgery.\n\nThe identities of seven other defendants, including Giuliani and Meadows, were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the documents.

Bobb did not respond to a text message seeking comment, nor did a lawyer who is representing Roman in a case in Georgia.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment but if Meadows is named, \"it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\" Giuliani's political adviser, Ted Goodman, decried what he called \"the continued weaponization of our justice system.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state.

Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump was indicted in August in federal court over efforts to cling to power after his defeat, including the fake electors scheme. The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday will hear arguments on his claim in that case that he can't be prosecuted for acts he committed while serving as president.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nThe so-called fake electors facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, past president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nIn a statement, Hoffman accused Mayes of weaponizing the attorney general's office in bringing the case but didn't directly comment on the indictment's allegations.\n\n\"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process,\" Hoffman said.\n\nNone of the others responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.\n\nAssociated Press writers Gabe Stern and Scott Sonner in Las Vegas, Kate Brumback in Atlanta and Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

It shows seven other defendants whose names were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the indictment.\n\nOne is described as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, a description that clearly describes Giuliani. Another is described as Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nWaterloo mayor, county supervisor barraged by racist texts; former Waterloo man arrested College Men's Basketball: Former Cedar Falls, UNI guard transfers to MVC foe UPDATE: Two injured in single vehicle crash on US Highway 20 near Jesup Restitution ordered for Evansdale woman, former roommate on lottery fraud case Longtime Waverly family business purchased with growth in mind Hudson man dead in Waterloo motorcycle crash Man arrested for home burglary in Waterloo after break-in Police arrest man after chase through Waterloo, Elk Run Heights, Cedar Falls Man arrested Sunday for burglaries at two Waterloo businesses Man charged with racial threats to Waterloo mayor, Black Hawk County supervisor Peppercorn Pantry in Aplington chosen one of 'America's Best Restaurants' Cedar Falls man arrested for two chases as he awaits trial for pursuit College Football: Waterloo West standout announces commitment to Iowa College Men's Basketball: Cedar Falls forward commits to UNI Waterloo man claims $35,000 lottery prize on Monopoly game\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes.

The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen.

The state Republican Party documented the signing of the certificate in a social media post and sent it to Congress and the National Archives.\n\nTrump is described as \"Unindicted Coconspirator 1\" in the indictment, which includes charges of conspiracy, fraud and forgery. The document also describes people who have been charged in the case but have not yet been served and whose names are redacted: Meadows, Trump's former White House chief of staff; Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and Trump attorney; Epshteyn, a Trump campaign official and attorney; former Trump campaign and White House official Mike Roman; former Trump attorney Jenna Ellis; former Trump attorney Christina Bobb; and John Eastman, another attorney and Trump legal adviser in the aftermath of the 2020 election.\n\nEpshteyn sat at the defense table with Trump when he was arraigned in his New York hush money case last year, though he has not appeared during the trial.\n\nAlso among those charged in Arizona is Kelli Ward, who served as chair of the Arizona GOP during the 2020 election and the immediate aftermath. She tweeted on Jan. 6, 2021, after the attack on the U.S. Capitol: \"Congress is adjourned. Send the elector choice back to the legislatures.\" Ward was a Trump elector and a consistent propagator of false claims that Arizona's election results were rigged.\n\nOthers charged along with Ward as \"fake electors\" were: state legislators Anthony Kern and Jake Hoffman; Michael Ward, Kelli Ward's husband; Tyler Bowyer, the Republican National Committee's Arizona committeeman and the chief operating officer of the Trump-aligned Turning Point USA; Greg Safsten, the former Arizona GOP executive director; former U.S. Senate candidate Jim Lamon; Robert Montgomery, the former head of the Cochise County GOP; and Republican Party activists Samuel Moorhead, Nancy Cottle and Loraine Pellegrino.\n\nAnother passage of the indictment appears to describe attorney Kenneth Chesebro, one of the planners of the alleged scheme, as an unindicted coconspirator. Chesebro pleaded guilty last year in Georgia to conspiracy charges brought against him, Trump and 17 other people in the state. He is also believed to be one of the unidentified co-conspirators special counsel Jack Smith described in his federal election interference indictment of Trump last year.\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, led the investigation. She won her election to be the state's chief prosecutor in November 2022, replacing Republican Mark Brnovich, a onetime ally of Trump who later earned his scorn for not substantiating his claims of election fraud in the state.\n\n\"We conducted a thorough and professional investigation over the past 13 months into the fake electors scheme in our state,\" Mayes said in a video announcing the charges. \"I understand for some of you today didn't come fast enough. And I know I'll be criticized by others for conducting this investigation at all. But as I've stated before, and we'll say here again, today, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined.\"\n\nThe Arizona charges are the latest example of Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election sprouting into legal cases during his 2024 bid to retake office.\n\nArizona was one of seven states where \"alternate electors\" signed paperwork falsely claiming Trump had won the states. Prosecutors have already charged \"alternate electors\" in Nevada, Georgia and Michigan.\n\nChesebro and others, including Eastman, argued in the months after the 2020 election that then-Vice President Mike Pence could use the existence of the alternate electors to name Trump the winner of the election as he presided over the electoral vote count in Congress on Jan. 6.\n\nEastman wrote in a memo: \"At the end, he announces that because of the ongoing disputes in the 7 States, there are no electors that can be deemed validly appointed in those States. ... There are at this point 232 votes for Trump, 222 votes for Biden. Pence then gavels President Trump as re-elected.\"\n\nTrump lost Arizona by just under 11,000 votes. As the Republican electors sent illegitimate certifications to Washington, Trump sought to put pressure on Maricopa County officials and other Arizona Republicans, including then-state House Speaker Rusty Bowers and then-Gov. Doug Ducey.\n\nTrump placed a phone call directly to Ducey as the governor certified the state's election results. Ducey muted the call.\n\nMayes' term as Arizona attorney general has been marked by other election cases stemming from Trump's false claims about fraud in the 2020 election and after.\n\nLast fall, Mayes charged two local officials who delayed the certification of midterm election results in 2022 in Cochise County. The officials voted against certifying the county's election results by the statutory deadline after they aired baseless accusations about the integrity of the election for months. The county certified its election results only after a court ordered it to do so.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Because the indictment remains partially redacted, it is unclear what charges Trump allies such as Meadows, Epshteyn and Giuliani face.\n\n\"In Arizona, and the United States, the people elected Joseph Biden as President on November 3, 2020,\" the indictment reads. \"Unwilling to accept this fact, Defendants and unindicted coconspirators schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency to keep Unindicted Coconspirator 1 in office against the will of Arizona's voters.\"\n\nThe scheme, according to the indictment, called for the fake electors to fraudulently vote for Trump, \"falsely claiming to be the duly elected and qualified Electors for President and Vice President of the United States from the State of Arizona.\"\n\n\"Defendants deceived the citizens of Arizona by falsely claiming that those votes were contingent only on a legal challenge that would change the outcome of the election,\" the indictment continues. \"In reality, Defendants intended that their false votes for Trump-Pence would encourage Pence to reject the Biden-Harris votes on January 6, 2021, regardless of the outcome of the legal challenge.\"\n\nThis scheme failed on January 6, 2021, when then-Vice President Mike Pence accepted the electoral votes for Joe Biden, the indictment says.\n\nCNN is reaching out to those charged for comment.\n\nThe case adds scrutiny to actions taken on Trump's behalf after the last election. It also comes as Trump's legal team will argue before the Supreme Court Thursday that he's immune from prosecution in the federal election interference case - at the same time Trump is on trial in New York related to hush money paid to cover up an alleged affair before the 2016 election.\n\nThe Arizona case is the latest state-level prosecution aimed at schemes to upend Biden's electoral victory. Prosecutors in Michigan, Georgia and Nevada also have brought criminal charges against some of the people who signed on as fake electors in those states. Investigators in Wisconsin are conducting a similar probe.\n\nA grand jury empaneled in Maricopa County, Arizona, to investigate efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the state met this week before Mayes announced the charges.\n\nCNN previously reported that Arizona prosecutors had issued a series of grand jury subpoenas to people connected to Trump's campaign and several individuals who served as fake electors from that state - a sign the probe was accelerating ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nSome of the fake electors who were ultimately charged in Arizona recently appeared before the grand jury and cited their Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination, sources familiar with the probe told CNN.\n\nMayes initially focused her investigation on the 11 fake electors from Arizona and those who helped organize them, but the sources recently told CNN she also was looking into individuals tied to the former president's national campaign.\n\n\"We conducted a thorough and professional investigation over the past 13 months into the fake electoral scheme in our state,\" Mayes said Wednesday. \"I understand for some of you today didn't come fast enough. And I know I'll be criticized by others for conducting this investigation at all. But as I've stated before, and will say here again today, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined.\"\n\nSeveral state-level officials from Arizona told the House Select Committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot that Trump and his allies tried to pressure them to decertify the state's election results.\n\nThe fake electors for Trump convened at the state Republican Party headquarters in Phoenix on December 14, 2020. They broadcast themselves preparing to sign the documents, allegedly provided by a Trump campaign attorney, claiming that they were the legitimate representatives of the state's electoral votes.\n\nBy that time, Trump's loss in the state - by fewer than 11,000 votes - had already been certified by its Republican governor, affirming that Biden won Arizona in the 2020 presidential election. But in the weeks that followed, some of the fake electors continued to push for Pence to reject the legitimate Democratic slate of electors.\n\nThe fake elector scheme and pressure campaign on Pence are focal points of special counsel Jack Smith's federal indictment of Trump.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN's Rashard Rose contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

It alleges the slate of Republicans sometimes known as fake electors engaged in a conspiracy aimed at \"preventing the lawful transfer of the presidency of the United States, keeping President Donald J. Trump in office against the will of Arizona voters, and depriving Arizona voters of their right to vote and have their votes counted.\"\n\nThe names of seven other individuals are redacted from the grand jury indictment, meaning they have not yet been served notice of the charges against them.\n\nThough their names are redacted, as are the charges against them, details in the indictment make clear that many top allies of Trump's, who led a pressure campaign to change the election result, are also facing charges in Arizona. Those individuals look to include Giuliani, Mark Meadows and others.\n\nTrump himself is, according to the document, \"unindicted coconspirator 1.\"\n\nMore: 'Somewhat dicey' and 'problematic': Inside Trump's bid to have fake electors overturn 2020 election\n\nThe grand jury's decision could levy criminal consequences for an unprecedented plot to subvert the will of Arizona voters, one that has ruptured faith in elections and fueled election conspiracies that have taken root in GOP politics in the state. It comes as Mayes has promised to aggressively combat election conspiracies, offering a sharp contrast to her predecessor.\n\nThe grand jury, a panel of Arizonans who met in secret in recent weeks, heard evidence presented by Mayes' prosecutors and ultimately decided there was enough to substantiate criminal charges.\n\nThe 11 electors are each charged with nine criminal counts, including conspiracy, fraudulent schemes and artifices, fraudulent schemes and practices, and six counts of forgery. Their lawyers, or the named defendants themselves, could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nThe fake electors in Arizona are:\n\nThe electors who claimed Trump won\n\nMayes has been under immense political pressure to bring a case. Similar slates of electors in Michigan, Georgia and Nevada have already been charged for their role in the sweeping effort to keep Trump in power.\n\nAnd a federal grand jury last year brought charges against Trump himself, alleging the former president conspired with others to disenfranchise voters and subvert Biden's win. Trump is also facing charges in the Georgia case, which alleges he led a criminal enterprise and relies on a state law normally reserved for prosecuting mobsters.\n\nSeveral of the Arizona electors have previously claimed they were merely offering Congress a backup plan, though nothing in the documents they sent to Congress and the National Archives backs up that assertion. Similar groups of electors in other states did include conditional language, but none was included in Arizona.\n\nBiden carried Arizona in November 2020 by a 10,457 vote margin with nearly 3.4 million votes cast. It was Biden's smallest margin of victory in any state, and only the second time in 70 years that a Democrat won the state.\n\nAt the time, Trump had spent months furthering doubt about the election result. In the days after his loss, he and his aides unleashed a pressure campaign on GOP leaders in Arizona and other states.\n\nThey found some support in Arizona, while others rebuffed the president's unfounded claims. That split in loyalties continues to divide the state's Republican Party and grassroots support, threatening the party's ability to win elections in the swing state.\n\nArizona actually had two different groups of illegitimate GOP electors. The indictment made public on Wednesday names the slate that included more prominent Republican figures, and some of whose involvement has already been well established by the Congressional committee investigating the violent break-in at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThose 11 GOP electors met at the Arizona Republican headquarters in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, posting videos on social media of themselves casting their votes for Trump. They signed paperwork to submit to Congress claiming they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors.\n\nBut that was a lie.\n\nThe same day, electors for Biden met to cast their votes in the Electoral College confirming the Democrat's win. They met at an undisclosed location, citing security concerns tied to Trump's refusal to accept his loss.\n\nIt was a procedural process that, prior to 2020, was a formality often overlooked by most Americans.\n\nInvestigation begins under a new attorney general in 2023\n\nMayes confirmed more than one year ago, in March 2023, that her office would investigate Arizona's electors who falsely claimed to be legitimate. A former Republican who left the party in 2019 citing the growth of Trumpism and what she saw as shrinking room for moderates in the party, Mayes had been in office for two months. She won her election in November 2022 by 280 votes -- one of the narrowest margins in state history.\n\nThat race and others on the ballot two years ago put to the test Arizonans' appetite for electing those who deny legitimate election results.\n\nMayes pledged to protect election workers and defend elections, where her Republican predecessor Mark Brnovich had tried to straddle election denialism. She promised a purposeful shift in focus within the office, which amounts to the state's largest law firm, and condemned Brnovich for sitting on a report for over a year that said his office \"did not uncover any criminality or fraud.\"\n\nHer investigation at first focused on the 11 electors, but a trickle of information that has leaked out from the grand jury proceedings over the past several weeks has suggested Mayes cast a wider net.\n\nTwo Arizona congressmen who were among the loudest voices in support of Trump's \"Stop the Steal\" campaign, Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar, received subpoenas.\n\nMayes' office turned to Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro for information. Chesebro, who also aided prosecutors in Georgia (after he was indicted) and Nevada, wrote memorandums outlining the strategy to send alternate electors to Congress.\n\nMore: Rudy Giuliani files for bankruptcy after jury orders him to pay $148 million in defamation case\n\nSending the documents from Trump electors \"can prevent Biden from amassing 270 electoral votes on January 6, and force the Members of Congress, the media, and the American people to focus on the substantive evidence of illegal election and counting activities in the six contested States,\" one memo from Dec. 6, 2020, reads. The memo suggests states that undertook the plan should also spread \"messaging that presents this as a routine measure.\"\n\nIn fact, the effort was anything but routine -- it was criminal, the grand jury said.", "source": {"uri": "citizen-times.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Asheville Citizen Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nNone of the 11 responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press on Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nRead more: National Arizona indicts 18 in case over 2020 election in Arizona, including Giuliani and Meadows By JACQUES BILLEAUD and JOSH KELETY - Associated Press 5 takeaways from the Jan. 6 report 1.

They're charged with nine counts each of conspiracy, fraud and forgery. The identities of seven other defendants, including Giuliani and Meadows, were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.\n\nTrump, who is described in the indictment as an unindicted co-conspirator, has argued that he can't be prosecuted for acts he committed while serving as president. The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday will hear arguments on his bid to avoid federal prosecution over his efforts to reverse his loss.\n\nWith the indictments, Arizona becomes the fourth state where allies of the former president have been charged with using false or unproven claims about voter fraud related to the election. Heading into a likely November rematch with Biden, Trump continues to spread lies about the last election that are echoed by many of his supporters.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic state Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the document.\n\nOne is an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, which clearly describes Giuliani.

Eastman and Bobb did not respond to text messages seeking comment, nor did a lawyer who is representing Roman in a case in Georgia.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment but if Meadows is named, \"it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\" Giuliani's political adviser, Ted Goodman, decried what he called \"the continued weaponization of our justice system.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state.

Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nThere was no immediate response to phone messages seeking comment that were left Wednesday with Jacob Hoffman, Kelli Ward, Michael Ward, James Lamon and Tyler Bowyer.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Kate Brumback in Atlanta and Marc Levy in

Also charged were seven Trump allies and lawyers who allegedly aided in the scheme, several of whom are facing prosecution in other states that already have brought similar cases.\n\nThe Trump campaign aides' names were redacted from the indictment, as were the charges against them. But details included in the document, compared with information already in the public sphere about the scheme, helped identify those defendants. Unless noted below, lawyers for many of the seven were unable to be reached late Wednesday by The Arizona Republic or declined to comment.\n\nBased on the descriptions in the indictment, which are included below, the Trump allies who appear to have been indicted were:\n\nRudy Giuliani\n\nThe indictment says he is an attorney for Trump -- identified as \"unindicted coconspirator 1\" -- and often known as \"the Mayor.\" Giuliani is a former mayor of New York City.\n\nThe document notes he led a meeting in downtown Phoenix on Nov. 30, 2020, that was rife with false claims that election officials weren't investigating whether the election result was accurate. And this defendant pressured Arizona lawmakers and the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to \"change the outcome of Arizona's election\" as well as similar pressure in six other states, the indictment says.\n\nJohn Eastman\n\nEastman was a Trump lawyer and an architect of the plan to change the outcome of the election in six contested states. The indictment identifies him in part through pressure he put on former Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, a Mesa Republican, to decertify the state's legitimate electors. Bowers testified about denying that request before the congressional committee investigating Trump and the Jan. 6, 2021, breach of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nRandy Miller represents Eastman, but he had little to say Wednesday evening until he could have a longer conversation with his client. \"Dr. Eastman does know, of course, but we haven't had a chance to delve into it,\" said Miller, who is representing Eastman in a California case that seeks to disbar him.\n\nTrump fake electors:Grand jury indicts fake electors who falsely certified Donald Trump as 2020 winner in Arizona\n\nBoris Epshteyn\n\nThe indictment identifies this person as an attorney and adviser to the 2016 and 2020 Trump campaigns involved in the plan to submit false elector votes \"to obstruct the certification process\" during the Jan. 6, 2021 joint session of Congress.\n\nEpshteyn pleaded guilty in Scottsdale City Court to disorderly conduct and served probation after a woman and her sister accused him of repeatedly groping them inside a Scottsdale nightclub in 2021. The conviction was set aside by the court in January 2023.\n\nChristina Bobb\n\nIdentified as an attorney for the Trump campaign, the indictment says this defendant, a former One America News personality, \"made false claims of widespread election fraud in Arizona and in six other states.\" She encouraged the Arizona Legislature to change the outcome of the election and \"she also encouraged Pence to accept the false Arizona Republican electors' votes on January 6, 2021.\"\n\nJenna Ellis\n\nThe indictment alleges Ellis lobbied GOP lawmakers in Arizona to \"disregard the popular vote\" and \"helped organize the false Arizona Republican electors' votes on December 14, 2020.\" Ellis pleaded guilty in a similar case brought by prosecutors in Georgia, USA Today has reported, and received a sentence of probation.\n\nMichael Roman\n\nRoman was \"the director of election day operations\" for Trump's campaign. According to the indictment, he worked closely with others to arrange the false electors' votes in Arizona and other states. Roman is also charged in a similar case in Georgia.\n\nMark Meadows\n\nTrump's chief of staff in 2020, this defendant worked with staffers on the Trump campaign to \"coordinate and implement the false Republican electors' votes in Arizona and six other states,\" the indictment reads.\n\nMeadows was held in contempt for not complying with a subpoena from the committee investigating what happened on Jan. 6, 2021, and was charged in a similar case in Georgia.\n\nWho are the 11 fake electors indicted and named?\n\nThe Republicans who served as electors for Donald Trump in the 2020 election include powerful and influential GOP figures: a former Republican Party of Arizona chairman; a Republican national committeeman and executive at Turning Point USA and its political arm; and two sitting state senators -- one of whom retains immense political power at the Arizona Capitol.\n\nKelli Ward, Tyler Bowyer, Nancy Cottle, Jacob Hoffman, Anthony Kern, James Lamon, Robert Montgomery, Samuel Moorhead,

Senate candidate Kari Lake wrote on X of her home state.\n\n'I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,' Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. 'It\u00b4s too important.'\n\nA one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden\u00b4s victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College.\n\nIn dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and 'failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.'\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nAnother defendant whose name is redacted is Trump lawyer Christina Bobb, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung confirmed, calling the Arizona indictment 'another example of Democrats' weaponization of the legal system.'\n\n'Christina Bobb is a former Marine Corps officer, who served our nation and the President with distinction. The Democrat platform for 2024: if you can't beat them, try to throw them in jail,' Cheung said.\n\nFormer Trump attorney Jenna Ellis\n\nEx-White House aide Boris Epshteyn\n\nJohn Eastman (pictured left), a former dean of Chapman University's law school and an advisor to former President Donald Trump\n\nEx-White House aide Boris Epshteyn, former Trump attorney Jenna Ellis and John Eastman, a former dean of Chapman University's law school and an advisor to former President Trump, are also on the list.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan\u00b4s Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors.\n\nOne had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nA state investigator testified Wednesday that he considers former President Donald Trump, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani to be uncharged co-conspirators in the Michigan fake electors plot.\n\nHoward Shock, whose work led to forgery charges against more than a dozen people in Michigan, was being cross-examined Wednesday in Lansing as part of a hearing Wednesday to determine if there's enough evidence to order a trail.\n\nA defense attorney, Duane Silverthorn, offered a series of names and asked Shock if they were 'unindicted co-conspirators,' which means they weren't charged but could have been part of an alleged plot to put Michigan's electoral votes in Trump's column.\n\nRepublican Arizona State Sen. Anthony Kern (pictured left) and Sen. Jake Hoffman (pictured right) were also charged. Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack, is now a candidate in Arizona\u00b4s 8th Congressional District\n\nGreg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party (pictured left) and energy industry executive James Lamon (pictured right) are also on the list\n\nRobert Montgomey, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020 (pictured left), was also indicted\n\nShock responded 'yes' to Trump, Meadows, Giuliani and some high-ranking state Republicans.\n\nIn Michigan, authorities said more than a dozen Republicans sent certificates to Congress falsely declaring they were electors and that Trump was the winner of the 2020 election in the state, despite results showing he had lost.\n\nTrump is in court this week for the Stormy Daniels hush money case after the jury selection process wrapped up last week.\n\nIn Georgia, Trump, Giuliani and others are charged with conspiracy related to the filing of a Republican elector certificate in that state following the 2020 election.\n\nMeadows is also charged in Georgia but not in relation to the elector scheme. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nAn indictment by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith charging Trump with plotting to overturn the election also accuses the former president in a fake elector scheme and identifies six unnamed and unindicted co-conspirators, including Giuliani.\n\nIn Wisconsin, ten Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden\u00b4s victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme.\n\nAlso indicted: Tyler Bowyer (pictured left), an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee and Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women (pictured right with Trump)\n\nLoraine Pellegrino (pictured right), president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women, was also charged\n\nSamuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County\n\nMichael Roman, a former Trump campaign operative, was also indicted\n\nThe indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state\u00b4s five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law.\n\nIn New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes\u00b4 predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes\u00b4 office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes\u00b4 office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges.\n\nA grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nWho is being indicted in the Arizona 'fake electors' case?\n\nKelli Ward, the state GOP\u00b4s chair from 2019 until early 2023\n\nState Sen. Jake Hoffman\n\nTyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee\n\nState Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona\u00b4s 8th Congressional District\n\nGreg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party\n\nEnergy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat\n\nRobert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020\n\nSamuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County\n\nNancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women\n\nLoraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women\n\nMichael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward\n\nRudy Giuliani, former Mayor of New York City and Trump attorney\n\nMark Meadows, former White House Chief of Staff\n\nMike Roman, former Trump campaign operative\n\nJenna Ellis, former Trump attorney\n\nChristina Bobb, the RNC's senior

Trump in office against the will of Arizona voters, and depriving Arizona voters of their right to vote and have their votes counted.\"\n\nAccording to the indictment, the fake electors forged certificates of Electoral College votes for President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Michael Pence and filed those with the Arizona Secretary of State and the chief judge of the Federal District Court for the District of Arizona.\n\nThe group is also charged with pressuring the Maricopa Board of Supervisors, the state Legislature and then-Gov. Doug Ducey to change the election results.\n\nThe fake electors are additionally accused of trying to trick Arizonans into believing that their fraudulent votes were contingent on a successful outcome in Trump's challenge of the 2020 election results, when they were actually trying to urge Pence to reject the votes for Biden on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Ward organized the fake elector vote, and proclaimed that they were Arizona's \"true electors.\"\n\nSeveral of the fake electors, including Hoffman, Kern, Ward and Bowyer, have continued to spread the unfounded claim that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, even though no evidence of that has ever come to light.\n\nHoffman sent a letter to then-Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 5, 2021, asking him to delay the certification of the election results and to check with the Arizona Legislature to determine which slate of presidential electors to use.\n\nHoffman issued a statement Wednesday evening, shortly after Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes released news of the indictments.\n\n\"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this disgusting political persecution by the judicial process,\" Hoffman wrote. \"Kris Mayes & the Democrats' naked corruption and weaponization of government will long be a stain on the history of our great state and nation.\"\n\nHoffman additionally alleged that Mayes made up her mind that the fake electors were guilty before she even began an investigation, saying that the indictments were an effort to go after her political opponents.\n\nThere were multiple fake elector schemes in Arizona, one tied to the AZGOP which included the above-named electors, as well as another one by the Sovereign Citizens of the Great State of Arizona that was not tied to the Trump campaign.\n\nGeorgia, Michigan and Nevada have already brought charges against fake electors there, and Wisconsin is still investigating possible charges for its fake electors.\n\nArizona Senate Minority Leader Mitzi Epstein lauded Mayes for sending the message that attempting to subvert the will of the people and stop the peaceful transfer of power comes with legal consequences.\n\n\"I appreciate Attorney General Mayes' leadership in ensuring that Arizona's fake electors are held accountable,\" Epstein said in a statement. \" The individuals who played into and spread the big lie that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump are dangerous to our nation's democracy.\"", "source":

Meadows, chief of staff for former President Donald Trump, was among those indicted Wednesday, April 24, 2024, in an Arizona election interference case.\n\nBy JACQUES BILLEAUD, JONATHAN J. COOPER and JOSH KELETY - Associated Press\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- An Arizona grand jury has indicted former President Donald Trump 's chief of staff Mark Meadows, lawyer Rudy Giuliani and 16 others for their roles in an attempt to overturn Trump's loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 election.\n\nThe indictment released Wednesday names 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring that Trump won Arizona in 2020. They include the former state party chair, a 2022 U.S. Senate candidate and two sitting state lawmakers, who are charged with nine counts each of conspiracy, fraud and forgery.\n\nThe identities of seven other defendants, including Giuliani and Meadows, were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the documents. They were readily identifiable based on descriptions of the defendants, however.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Heading into a likely November rematch with Biden, Trump continues to spread lies about the last election that are echoed by many of his supporters.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic state Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe indictment alludes to Giuliani as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud. Another defendant is referred to as Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nDescriptions of other unnamed defendants point to Mike Roman, who was Trump's director of Election Day operations; John Eastman, a lawyer who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election; and Christina Bobb, a lawyer who worked with Giuliani.\n\nA lawyer for Eastman, Charles Burnham, said his client is innocent. Bobb did not respond to a text message seeking comment, nor did a lawyer who is representing Roman in a case in Georgia.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment but if Meadows is named, \"it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\" Giuliani's political adviser, Ted Goodman, decried what he called \"the continued weaponization of our justice system.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump was indicted in August in federal court over efforts to cling to power after his defeat, including the fake electors scheme. The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday will hear arguments on his claim in that case that he can't be prosecuted for acts he committed while serving as president.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nThe so-called fake electors facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, past president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nIn a statement, Hoffman accused Mayes of weaponizing the attorney general's office in bringing the case but didn't directly comment on the indictment's allegations.\n\n\"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process,\" Hoffman said.\n\nNone of the others responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.\n\nAssociated Press writers Gabe Stern and Scott Sonner in Las Vegas, Kate Brumback in Atlanta and Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Jake Hoffman (R) and Anthony Kern (R) were also hit with charges long after they signed paperwork on December 14, 2020, certifying that Trump was the winner of the election.\n\nThe indictment of several Trump allies and members of Arizona's Republican Party comes as a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll conducted between April 8 and 15, found that President Joe Biden is trailing Trump in several key swing states such as Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and North Carolina by six or more points.\n\nIn Arizona, Trump led by seven points, receiving 49 percent of support from voters who indicated they would vote for him, while Biden received 42 percent.\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes announced the indictment in a video posted to X:\n\nI will not allow American democracy to be undermined. It's too important. Investigators and attorneys assigned to this case took the necessary time to throughly piece together the details of the events that began nearly four years ago. They followed the facts where they led and I'm very proud of the work they've done to date. We are here because justice demands an answer to the efforts that the defendants and other unindicted co-conspirators allegedly took to undermine the will of Arizona's voters during the 2020 presidential election. Arizona's election was free and fair. The people of Arizona elected President Biden.\n\nThis indictment from the Arizona grand jury is the latest in a series of efforts to use the legal system against conservatives and Republicans, something that Trump and other Republicans like as Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) have referred to as \"weaponization.\"\n\nIn July 2023, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel charged 16 \"fake electors\" with eight felonies, including conspiracy and election law forgery for their alleged roles in attempting to dispute the 2020 presidential election results.\n\nMonths later, in December 2023, a Nevada grand jury indicted several top members of the state's Republican Party. Those indicted were charged with forging and submitting fake documents in relation to the \"fake electors\" plot.\n\nThe so-called \"fake electors\" have maintained that they were acting earnestly, with the belief that Trump had won each of the states.\n\nOne example Trump's allies have pointed to is the presidential election of 196o between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon.\n\nWhile Kennedy narrowly won the presidential election, a recount occurred in Hawaii as the initial results showed Nixon had won the state by 140 votes, according to Politico.\n\nAs a recount was occurring, electors for Nixon met and cast three votes for him, three other electors for Kennedy also gathered and signed a certificate that Kennedy had won the state, instead of Nixon.\n\nElectors for Kennedy and electors for Trump also reportedly used similar wording in their documents.\n\nIn this instance, the results were ultimately overturned in Kennedy's favor.\n\nThe indictment of several top allies of the former president's and several members of the Arizona GOP comes as Trump is currently on trial and facing 34 counts of allegedly falsifying business records in the first degree regarding payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThose charged in the indictment include the eleven Arizona Republicans who served as alternate electors, according to the Arizona Mirror.\n\nThe eleven Arizona Republicans are:\n\nTrump allies who were reportedly indicted include Mark Meadows, Jenna Ellis, Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, Christina Bobb, a former Trump attorney, Boris Epshteyn, and Mike Roman, a former Trump campaign aide, according to the Washington Post.", "source": {"uri":

Others include attorneys John Eastman, Jenna Ellis and Christina Bobb, as well as Trump 2020 campaign operative Mike Roman.\n\nKen Chesebro, an attorney who helped devise Trump's post-election strategy, is described as \"unindicted coconspirator 4.\"\n\nThe only defendants whose names are visible in the version of the indictment released by the Arizona attorney general's office Wednesday evening are the 11 Republicans who falsely posed as the state's presidential electors despite Joe Biden's narrow victory there. Among them: former Arizona GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward, state senators Jake Hoffman and Anthony Kern, and Arizona's RNC committeeman Tyler Bowyer.\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, has been helming the aggressive investigation. Though she initially appeared to be focused primarily on the false electors, in recent months it became clear that the scope of the probe was broader than previously understood and swept up prominent Trump allies at the national level.\n\nMayes is the fifth prosecutor to bring criminal charges over the sprawling, multi-state bid by Trump and his allies to upend the 2020 results. Special counsel Jack Smith has charged Trump with federal crimes for those efforts. Prosecutors in Georgia have charged Trump and many of his allies for their efforts to overturn the results in that state, including the fake electors plot. Prosecutors in Michigan and Nevada have also charged Republicans who posed as fake electors in those states.\n\nThe announcement felt like something right out of 1984 or out of a Communist Regime.\n\nWatch this if you can stomach it:\n\nGrok reports:\n\nThe full list of the 18 individuals indicted in the Arizona election probe includes: Kelli Ward Tyler Bowyer Nancy Cottle Jacob Hoffman Anthony Kern James Lamon Robert Montgomery Samuel Moorhead Lorraine Pellegrino Greg Safsten Michael Ward Mark Meadows Rudy Giuliani Boris Epshteyn Jenna Ellis Christina Bobb John Eastman Mike Roman\n\nFrom CNN:\n\nThe indictment in Arizona includes nine counts, from conspiracy and forgery to engaging in fraudulent schemes. Because the indictment remains partially redacted, it is unclear what charges Trump allies such as Meadows, Epshteyn and Giuliani face.\n\n\"In Arizona, and the United States, the people elected Joseph Biden as President on November 3, 2020,\" the indictment reads. \"Unwilling to accept this fact, Defendants and unindicted coconspirators schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency to keep Unindicted Coconspirator 1 in office against the will of Arizona's voters.\"\n\nThe scheme, according to the indictment, called for the fake electors to fraudulently vote for Trump, \"falsely claiming to be the duly elected and qualified Electors for President and Vice President of the United States from the State of Arizona.\"\n\n\"Defendants deceived the citizens of Arizona by falsely claiming that those votes were contingent only on a legal challenge that would change the outcome of the election,\" the indictment continues. \"In reality, Defendants intended that their false votes for Trump-Pence would encourage Pence to reject the Biden-Harris votes on January 6, 2021, regardless of the outcome of the legal challenge.\"\n\nThis scheme failed on January 6, 2021, when then-Vice President Mike Pence accepted the electoral votes for Joe Biden, the indictment says.\n\nCNN is reaching out to those charged for comment.\n\nThe case adds scrutiny to actions taken on Trump's behalf after the last election. It also comes as Trump's legal team will argue before the Supreme Court Thursday that he's immune from prosecution in the federal election interference case - at the same time Trump is on trial in New York related to hush money paid to cover up an alleged affair before the 2016 election.\n\nThe Arizona case is the latest state-level prosecution aimed at schemes to upend Biden's electoral victory. Prosecutors in Michigan, Georgia and Nevada also have brought criminal charges against some of the people who signed on as fake electors in those states. Investigators in Wisconsin are conducting a similar probe.\n\nA grand jury empaneled in Maricopa County, Arizona, to investigate efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the state met this week before Mayes announced the charges.\n\nCNN previously reported that Arizona prosecutors had issued a series of grand jury subpoenas to people connected to Trump's campaign and several individuals who served as fake electors from that state - a sign the probe was accelerating ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nSome of the fake electors who were ultimately charged in Arizona recently appeared before the grand jury and cited their Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination, sources familiar with the probe told CNN.\n\nMayes initially focused her investigation on the 11 fake electors from Arizona and those who helped organize them, but the sources recently told CNN she also was looking into individuals tied to the former president's national campaign.\n\n\"We conducted a thorough and professional investigation over the past 13 months into the fake electoral scheme in our state,\" Mayes said Wednesday. \"I understand for some of you today didn't come fast enough. And I know I'll be criticized by others for conducting this investigation at all. But as I've stated before, and will say here again today, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined.\"\n\nSeveral state-level officials from Arizona told the House Select Committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot that Trump and his allies tried to pressure them to decertify the state's election results.\n\nThis is a developing story.\n\nWe'll continue to monitor and bring you updates as we have them.", "source": {"uri": "en-volve.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "enVolve"}, "authors": [{"uri": "a_m_smith@en-volve.com", "name": "A.M.

Hoffman had in the past several weeks been pursuing a position with the Republican National Committee. In a statement on X, the Republican Party of Arizona called the indictments \"politically motivated\" and a \"blatant abuse of legal authority aimed to disrupt, distract, and interfere in the 2024 election.\"\n\nThe defendants, according to the indictment, are accused of pressuring election officials to change the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. After the secretary of state, board of supervisors and GOP Gov. Doug Ducey certified that Joe Biden had won the election in Arizona over Trump, the defendants, who were the Republican presidential electors for Arizona, voted for Trump and then-Vice President Mike Pence. They were, the indictment says, \"falsely claiming to be the duly elected and qualified Electors for President and Vice President of the United States from the State of Arizona.\"\n\nIn a statement, Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes said the indictments were the results of a \"thorough\" 13-month investigation.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Mayes said. \"It is too important.\"\n\nAdditional defendants' names were redacted from court documents because they had not yet been served, Mayes said. Some, however, could be identified by their descriptions in court documents.\n\nThe indictment described Trump as \"Unindicted Coconspirator 1.\" Trump has repeatedly called such prosecutions \"witch hunts.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement that the case is a \"another example of Democrats' weaponization of the legal system.\"\n\nProsecutors are accusing the defendants of deceiving Arizonans \"by falsely claiming that those votes were contingent only on a legal challenge that would change the outcome of the election.\"\n\nHowever, the indictment says that in fact, the defendants intended to use their false votes to \"encourage (Vice President) Pence to reject the Biden-Harris votes on January 6, 2021, regardless of the outcome of the legal challenge.\" They allegedly hoped that when six other states with false GOP electors submitted their uncertified votes for Trump and Pence, that Pence would either declare Trump the winner, \"delay the proceeding and have individual state legislatures determine their electors, or have Congress resolve any claimed uncertainty about the validity of election results in Arizona and six other states\" in Trump's favor.\n\n\"The scheme failed,\" prosecutors said in the indictment, when Pence accepted all certified Biden-Harris votes on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nHoffman told the Arizona Republic in a statement that he is \"innocent of any crime,\" and \"I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process.\"\n\nAn attorney for Lamon also told the Arizona Republic the indictment is \"a politically motivated prosecution.\"\n\nAn attorney for Unindicted Coconspirator 1 who was often identified as 'the Mayor,'\" appears to be Rudy Giuliani. Jenna Ellis, another attorney who joined Giuliani in helping spread baseless claims of widespread voter fraud, also seems to be described in the documents.\n\nWhile Ellis did not directly publicly comment, she replied, \"It's been a great day to keep serving a faithful God\" on X when a user asked her, \"it wasn't the best of days for you was it?\"\n\nAnother unidentified defendant is referred to as Trump's chief of staff in 2020, which would have been Mark Meadows. Another unidentified defendant was the Trump campaign's Director of Election Day Operations, a title that belonged to Mike Roman.\n\nAttorney George Terwilliger, who represents Meadows, told The Associated Press that, while he hadn't seen the indictment, naming Meadows would be \"a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\"\n\nTed Goodman, a political advisor to Giuliani, told the AP the indictment shows, \"the continued weaponization of our justice system.\"\n\nThe Arizona Republican Party called the indictments a \"blatant and unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial power\" and said it \"condemns these actions in the strongest terms.\"\n\nThe charges being brought include fraud, forgery, and conspiracy, which are class 2, 4, and 5 felonies, Mayes said.\n\nArizona is one of seven states that Trump lost in 2020 where the former president's allies allegedly attempted to create a fraudulent register of electors.\n\n\"Unwilling to accept\" the fact that Biden won the 2020 presidential election, the defendants \"schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency\" by raising false claims of election fraud and organizing fake elector votes, the indictment said.\n\nThe alleged fraud was committed to prevent \"the lawful transfer of the presidency of the United States,\" keeping \"Trump in office against the will of Arizona voters, and depriving Arizona voters of their right to vote and have their votes counted,\" court documents said.\n\nThe Arizona indictments came as Trump and 18 of his associates face charges of racketeering, election fraud and other charges in Fulton County, Georgia, over an alleged effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election, including the alternate elector scheme. That indictment alleged that some of the defendants solicited legislators to appoint new electors in other states besides Georgia, including Arizona.\n\nIn August of last year, the former president was indicted by a federal grand jury over alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. That indictment, stemming from special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into Trump's actions following the 2020 election, cited a memo outlining a strategy for Trump supporters to serve as fake electors.\n\nThe former president has denied all wrongdoing in both of those cases.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It alleges the slate of Republicans sometimes known as fake electors engaged in a conspiracy aimed at \"preventing the lawful transfer of the presidency of the United States, keeping President Donald J. Trump in office against the will of Arizona voters, and depriving Arizona voters of their right to vote and have their votes counted.\"\n\nThe names of seven other individuals are redacted from the grand jury indictment, meaning they have not yet been served notice of the charges against them.\n\nThough their names are redacted, as are the charges against them, details in the indictment make clear that many top allies of Trump's, who led a pressure campaign to change the election result, are also facing charges in Arizona. Those individuals appear to include Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, former chief of staff Mark Meadows, and others.\n\nTrump himself is, according to the document, \"unindicted coconspirator 1.\"\n\nThe Arizonans now facing charges include powerful and influential GOP figures: a former Republican Party of Arizona chairman; a Republican national committeeman and executive at Turning Point USA and its political arm; and two sitting state senators -- one of whom retains immense political power at the Arizona Capitol.\n\nThe grand jury's decision could levy criminal consequences for an unprecedented plot to subvert the will of Arizona voters, one that has ruptured faith in elections and fueled election conspiracies that have taken root in GOP politics in the state. It comes as Mayes has promised to aggressively combat election conspiracies, offering a sharp contrast to her predecessor.\n\nThe grand jury, a panel of Arizonans who met in secret, in recent weeks heard evidence presented by Mayes' prosecutors and ultimately decided there was enough to substantiate criminal charges.\n\nThe 11 electors are each charged with nine criminal counts, including conspiracy, fraudulent schemes and artifices, fraudulent schemes and practices, and six counts of forgery. Their lawyers, or the named defendants themselves, could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nThe fake electors in Arizona are:\n\nThe electors who claimed Trump won\n\nMayes has been under immense political pressure to bring a case. Similar slates of electors in Michigan, Georgia and Nevada have already been charged for their role in the sweeping effort to keep Trump in power.\n\nAnd a federal grand jury last year brought charges against Trump himself, alleging the former president conspired with others to disenfranchise voters and subvert Biden's win. Trump is also facing charges in the Georgia case, which alleges he led a criminal enterprise and relies on a state law normally reserved for prosecuting mobsters.\n\nSeveral of the Arizona electors have previously claimed they were merely offering Congress a backup plan, though nothing in the documents they sent to Congress and the National Archives backs up that assertion. Similar groups of electors in other states did include conditional language, but none was included in Arizona.\n\nBiden carried Arizona in November 2020 by a 10,457 vote margin with nearly 3.4 million votes cast. It was Biden's smallest margin of victory in any state, and only the second time in 70 years that a Democrat won the state.\n\nAt the time, Trump had spent months furthering doubt about the election result. In the days after his loss, he and his aides unleashed a pressure campaign on GOP leaders in Arizona and other states.\n\nThey found some support in Arizona, while others rebuffed the president's unfounded claims. That split in loyalties continues to divide the state's Republican Party and grassroots support, threatening the party's ability to win elections in the swing state.\n\nArizona actually had two different groups of illegitimate GOP electors. The indictment made public on Wednesday names the slate that included more prominent Republican figures, and some of whose involvement has already been well established by the Congressional committee investigating the violent break-in at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThose 11 GOP electors met at the Arizona Republican headquarters in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, posting videos on social media of themselves casting their votes for Trump. They signed paperwork to submit to Congress claiming they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors.\n\nBut that was a lie.\n\nThe same day, electors for Biden met to cast their votes in the Electoral College confirming the Democrat's win. They met at an undisclosed location, citing security concerns tied to Trump's refusal to accept his loss.\n\nIt was a procedural process that, prior to 2020, was a formality often overlooked by most Americans.\n\nInvestigation begins under a new attorney general in 2023\n\nMayes confirmed more than one year ago, in March 2023, that her office would investigate Arizona's electors who falsely claimed to be legitimate. A former Republican who left the party in 2019 citing the growth of Trumpism and what she saw as shrinking room for moderates in the party, Mayes had been in office for two months. She won her election in November 2022 by 280 votes -- one of the narrowest margins in state history.\n\nThat race and others on the ballot two years ago put to the test Arizonans' appetite for electing those who deny legitimate election results.\n\nMayes pledged to protect election workers and defend elections, where her Republican predecessor Mark Brnovich had tried to straddle election denialism. She promised a purposeful shift in focus within the office, which amounts to the state's largest law firm, and condemned Brnovich for sitting on a report for over a year that said his office \"did not uncover any criminality or fraud.\"\n\nHer investigation at first focused on the 11 electors, but a trickle of information that has leaked out from the grand jury proceedings over the past several weeks has suggested Mayes cast a wider net.\n\nTwo Arizona congressmen who were among the loudest voices in support of Trump's \"Stop the Steal\" campaign, Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar, received subpoenas.\n\nMayes' office turned to Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro for information. Chesebro, who also aided prosecutors in Georgia (after he was indicted) and Nevada, wrote memorandums outlining the strategy to send alternate electors to Congress.\n\nSending the documents from Trump electors \"can prevent Biden from amassing 270 electoral votes on January 6, and force the Members of Congress, the media, and the American people to focus on the substantive evidence of illegal election and counting activities in the six contested States,\" one memo from Dec. 6, 2020, reads. The memo suggests states that undertook the plan should also spread \"messaging that presents this as a routine measure.\"\n\nIn fact, the effort was anything but routine -- it was criminal, the grand jury said.", "source": {"uri": "eu.lcsun-news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Cruces Sun-News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_fake_electors_plot",

Seven others were indicted but had their names redacted.\n\nThose seven include former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and former Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman.\n\nNPR was able to identify them based on information included in the indictment, such as one defendant being \"often identified as 'the Mayor.' \" Giuliani was a mayor of New York City.\n\nThe identities of other defendants need to be confirmed. According to a news release from Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, \"[a]n unredacted version of the indictment will be made available after all defendants have been served.\"\n\nThe indictment includes nine criminal counts, including felony fraud, forgery and conspiracy.\n\n\"The people of Arizona elected President Biden,\" Mayes says in a video statement. \"Unwilling to accept this fact, the defendants charged by the state grand jury allegedly schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency.\"\n\nShe adds: \"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined. It's too important.\"\n\nThe indictment also cites five unindicted co-conspirators, including \"a former president of the United States who spread false claims of election fraud following the 2020 election\" -- Trump -- and former members of the Arizona Legislature.\n\nThe indictment, which Mayes released Wednesday, makes Arizona the fourth state where charges have been brought against individuals involved in so-called \"fake elector\" schemes that sought to undermine Biden's victory over Trump.\n\nProsecutors in Georgia, Michigan and Nevada have already charged individuals accused of participating in similar schemes in those states. In another swing state, Wisconsin, fake electors admitted to their roles as part of civil settlements.\n\nThe slate of fake electors charged in Arizona includes several influential Republicans, including sitting state Sens. Jake Hoffman and Anthony Kern. Former Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward, former party Executive Director Greg Safsten and RNC Committeeman Tyler Bowyer also signed documents transmitted to the federal government. Bowyer is also an executive with Turning Point USA, an Arizona-based right wing advocacy group founded by Trump ally Charlie Kirk.\n\nOthers indicted are Nancy Cottle, James Lamon, Robert Montgomery, Samuel Moorhead, Lorraine Pellegrino and Michael Ward.\n\nHoffman quickly responded to the charges, saying in a statement: \"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process.\"\n\nThe indictments mark a significant step forward in an investigation that began a year ago after Mayes, a Democrat who was elected attorney general in 2022 by just 280 votes, took office in early 2023.\n\nSome Democrats criticized Mayes over the pace of that investigation, which proceeded largely behind closed doors as grand juries in other states indicted alleged participants in the fake electors scheme.\n\nBut Mayes urged patience, pointing out that she took office after many of the officials pursuing the case in other states. Her predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, did not investigate the case.\n\n\"The investigators and attorneys assigned to this case took the necessary time to thoroughly piece together the details of the events that began nearly four years ago,\" Mayes says in the video.\n\nThere were signs the case was picking up steam in recent months, though. In December, the investigators met with former Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro, a lead architect of the fake elector scheme who's pleaded guilty to a felony charge in Georgia.\n\nTrump himself faces charges in Georgia, as do Meadows, Giuliani and Eastman, among others.\n\nThe Arizona indictment comes as Trump faces jurors in a hush money case in New York City. Trump is the first former president to be charged criminally.", "source": {"uri": "whyy.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WHYY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They include Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows and former Trump attorney John Eastman -- as well Boris Epshteyn, who remains one of Trump's closest advisers and a current member of his 2024 campaign team.\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes also announced charges against 11 alleged fake electors, for their alleged role in their alleged efforts to subvert Joe Biden's 2020 victory in the state.\n\nThe charges include fraud, forgery, and conspiracy.\n\n\"Unindicted Coconspirator 1\" in the indictment appears to be Trump as the language of the document says they were involved in a scheme to keep him and former Vice President Mike Pence \"in office against the will of Arizona's voters.\"\n\nIn the indictment, another individual whose name is currently redacted, but appears to be Giuliani is described as \"An attorney for Unindicted Coconspirator 1 who was often identified as {{the Mayor.\"\n\nTrump's former Chief of Staff Meadows appears to be one of the individuals whose name is redacted. That individual \"was Unindicted Coconspirator 1's Chief of Staff in 2020,\" the indictment reads, which seems to match Meadows' job at the time.\n\nMayes said in a release all the names would be unredacted when all defendants have been served.\n\nIn filing the indictment, Arizona becomes the fourth state to file criminal charges against the so-called \"fake electors\" who allegedly announced they were ready to pledge electoral votes to Donald Trump in their respective states during the 2020 election, despite Joe Biden winning those states.\n\nThe 11 current named defendants in the indictment whose names are visible on the court document are Kelli Ward, Tyler Bower, Nancy Cottle, Jacob Hoffman, Anthony Kern, James Lamon, Robert Montgomery, Samuel Moorhead, Lorraine Pellegrino, Gregory Safsten and Michael Ward.\n\nAccording to the indictment, 11 Republicans met in Arizona in December 2020, including then-Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward, two Republican lawmakers, and a top official with the Republican National Committee, and signed documents that falsely claimed they were Arizona's rightful electors.\n\nMORE: 'The Signing': What to know about the Arizona attorney general's 2020 election probe\n\n\"Today, Arizona's 11 Republican presidential electors met to cast their votes for President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence,\" the Arizona GOP tweeted in December 2020. \"With ongoing legal challenges to the 2020 presidential election still being heard in the courts across the country holding hearings on election fraud and voting irregularities, it is imperative that the proper elections are counted by Congress.\"\n\nAll 11 alleged fake electors were also part of a legal challenge in the state that sought to challenge the election results based on allegations of voter fraud. The case was thrown out by a judge who called their claims of election fraud \"sorely wanting of relevant or reliable evidence.\"\n\nRusty Bowers, then the Arizona House speaker, told the House Jan. 6 committee that following the election he received calls from Trump and attorney Rudy Giuliani claiming that there was election fraud in the state.\n\n\"I was insistent that I had to have proof, real proof, judicial level,\" Bowers testified. \"That's the kind of proof I'm talking about. And the president said, 'Rudy, give the man what he wants.'\"\n\nAsked by ABC News' Jonathan Karl if Giuliani ever provided that evidence, Bowers said, \"He never gave us anything. No names, no data, nothing.\"\n\nBowers also said that Giuliani and attorney Jenna Ellis flew to Phoenix and met with him and other Arizona lawmakers, and asked them to convene the legislature to investigate their unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud.\n\nIn December, Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford announced felony charges against six alleged \"fake electors\" in that state. In Michigan, Attorney General Dana Nessel similarly charged 16 \"alternate electors\" in July for conspiracy to commit forgery, among other charges. And in Georgia, three such \"fake electors\" were among the 18 co-defendants charged, along with Trump, in a sweeping racketeering indictment for alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in that state.\n\nAll defendants charged in all three probes have pleaded not guilty, with Georgia defendants Jenna Ellis, Kenneth Chesebro, Sidney Powell and Scott Hall subsequently taking plea deals in exchange for agreeing to testify in that case. In Michigan, the attorney general dropped all charges against defendant Jim Renner in exchange for his cooperation.\n\nABC News previously reported that Trump's Georgia co-defendant Michael Roman was subpoenaed as part of the Arizona probe and that Chesebro sat for a voluntary interview with Arizona investigators in recent weeks.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It shows seven other defendants whose names were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the indictment.\n\nOne is described as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, a description that clearly describes Giuliani. Another is described as Trump's \"chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nPeople are also reading...

A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nNone of the 11 responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press on Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nRead more: National Arizona indicts 18 in case over 2020 election in Arizona, including Giuliani and Meadows By JACQUES BILLEAUD and JOSH KELETY - Associated Press 5 takeaways from the Jan. 6 report 1.

Whatever their reasoning was, the plot to violate the law must be answered for.\"\n\nThe indictment names former Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward, sitting state Republican Sens. Jake Hoffman and Anthony Kern, former U.S. Senate candidate Jim Lamon, and seven others as the \"fake electors\" who sought to declare Trump the rightful winner of the state's presidential contest.\n\nThe names of other individuals indicted by the state grand jury are redacted, but the document's descriptions make clear that former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, and top Trump legal strategist Boris Epshteyn are among those facing felony charges -- including fraud, forgery, and conspiracy.\n\n\"In Arizona, defendants, unindicted coconspirators, and others pressured the three groups of election officials responsible for certifying election results to encourage them to change the election results,\" the document reads. \"Discussions about using the Republican electors to change the outcome of the election began as early as November 4, 2020. Those plans evolved during November based on memos drafted by [an attorney for the Trump campaign, Kenneth Chesebro].\"\n\nMayes said Wednesday that had the fake elector scheme succeeded, it would have \"deprived Arizona's voters of their right to have their votes counted for their chosen president.\"\n\n\"It effectively would have made their right to vote meaningless,\" said Mayes.\n\nAlex Gulotta, state director of All Voting Is Local Action Arizona, said Wednesday that \"the indictment of the eleven fake electors is one of the first steps required in holding these election deniers accountable for their alleged attempts to take power away from voters by disrupting our free and fair elections.\"\n\n\"Arizonans deserve to trust the election officials responsible for administering our elections and preserving our democracy,\" said Gulotta, \"and this is a positive step forward as we continue to strengthen the foundations of our democracy and restore faith in our elections.\"\n\nThe Arizona Republic reported Wednesday that \"several of the Arizona electors have previously claimed they were merely offering Congress a backup plan, though nothing in the documents they sent to Congress and the National Archives backs up that assertion.\"\n\n\"The indictment includes several statements the false electors made on social media that contradict those claims,\" the newspaper observed.\n\nJenny Guzman, director of Common Cause's Arizona program, said the indictment \"marks the start of a new chapter for the fake elector scheme that has plagued Arizona.\"\n\n\"Arizonans are still dealing with the fallout from the false electors and the Big Lie about the 2020 elections,\" said Guzman. \"We are relieved that the investigation by Attorney General Mayes has concluded and Arizonans can now know that what comes next is accountability. These efforts by these fake electors to undermine the will of Arizona's voters have had implications far beyond their failed attempt to overthrow the 2020 election.\"\n\n\"This indictment can reassure all Arizonans that if anyone, regardless of their political affiliation, attempts to undermine their vote, consequences will follow,\" Guzman added.", "source": {"uri": "truthout.org", "dataType":

The state Republican Party documented the signing of the certificate in a social media post and sent it to Congress and the National Archives.\n\nAmong those charged is Kelli Ward, who served as chair of the Arizona GOP during the 2020 election and the immediate aftermath. She tweeted on Jan. 6, 2021, after the attack on the U.S. Capitol: \"Congress is adjourned. Send the elector choice back to the legislatures.\" Ward was a consistent propagator of false claims that Arizona's election results were rigged.\n\nOthers charged include: state legislators Anthony Kern and Jake Hoffman; Michael Ward, Kelli Ward's husband; Tyler Bowyer, the Republican National Committee's Arizona committeeman and the chief operating officer of the Trump-aligned Turning Point USA; Greg Safsten, the former Arizona GOP executive director; former U.S. Senate candidate Jim Lamon; Robert Montgomery, the former head of the Cochise County GOP; and Republican Party activists Samuel Moorhead, Nancy Cottle and Loraine Pellegrino.\n\nThe indictment lists Trump as \"Unindicted Coconspirator 1.\" It also includes redacted names of other people who have been charged in the case but have not yet been served.\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, led the investigation. She won her election to be the state's chief prosecutor in November 2022, replacing Republican Mark Brnovich, a one-time ally of Trump who later earned the former president's scorn for not substantiating Trump's claims of election fraud in the state.\n\n\"We conducted a thorough and professional investigation over the past 13 months into the fake electors scheme in our state,\" Mayes said in a video announcing the charges. \"I understand for some of you today didn't come fast enough. And I know I'll be criticized by others for conducting this investigation at all. But as I've stated before, and we'll say here again, today, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined.\"\n\nThe Arizona charges are the latest example of Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election sprouting into legal cases during his 2024 bid to retake office.\n\nArizona was one of seven states where \"alternate electors\" signed paperwork falsely claiming Trump had won the state. \"Alternate electors\" in Nevada, Georgia and Michigan have already been charged by prosecutors in their respective states.\n\nAttorney Kenneth Chesebro, one of the planners of the alleged scheme, pled guilty last year in Georgia on conspiracy charges brought against him, Trump and 17 others in the state. He is also believed to be one of the unidentified co-conspirators described by Special Counsel Jack Smith in his federal election interference indictment of Trump last year.\n\nChesebro and others, including Trump legal adviser John Eastman, argued in the months after the 2020 election that then-Vice President Mike Pence could use the existence of the alternate electors to name Trump the winner of the election as he presided over the electoral vote count in Congress on Jan. 6.\n\nEastman wrote in a memo: \"At the end, he announces that because of the ongoing disputes in the 7 States, there are no electors that can be deemed validly appointed in those States. ... There are at this point 232 votes for Trump, 222 votes for Biden. Pence then gavels President Trump as re-elected.\"\n\nTrump lost Arizona by just under 11,000 votes. As the Republican electors sent illegitimate certifications to Washington, Trump sought to put pressure on Maricopa County officials and other Arizona Republicans, including then-state House Speaker Rusty Bowers and then-Gov. Doug Ducey.\n\nTrump placed a phone call directly to Ducey as the governor certified the state's election results. Ducey muted the call.\n\nMayes' term as Arizona attorney general has been marked by other election cases stemming from Trump's false claims about fraud in the 2020 election and after.\n\nLast fall, Mayes charged two local officials who delayed the certification of midterm election results in 2022 in Cochise County. The officials voted against certifying the county's election results by the statutory deadline, after airing baseless accusations about the integrity of the election for months. The county certified its election results only after a court ordered it to do so.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vaughn_hillyard@aol.com",

Also charged were seven Trump allies and lawyers who allegedly aided in the scheme, several of whom are facing prosecution in other states that already have brought similar cases.\n\nThe Trump campaign aides' names were redacted from the indictment, as were the charges against them. But details included in the document, compared with information already in the public sphere about the scheme, helped identify those defendants. Unless noted below, lawyers for many of the seven were unable to be reached late Wednesday by The Arizona Republic or declined to comment.\n\nBased on the descriptions in the indictment, which are included below, the Trump allies who appear to have been indicted were:\n\nThe indictment says he is an attorney for Trump -- identified as \"unindicted coconspirator 1\" -- and often known as \"the Mayor.\" Giuliani is a former mayor of New York City.\n\nThe document notes he led a meeting in downtown Phoenix on Nov. 30, 2020, that was rife with false claims that election officials weren't investigating whether the election result was accurate. And this defendant pressured Arizona lawmakers and the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to \"change the outcome of Arizona's election\" as well as similar pressure in six other states, the indictment says.\n\nEastman was a Trump lawyer and an architect of the plan to change the outcome of the election in six contested states. The indictment identifies him in part through pressure he put on former Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, a Mesa Republican, to decertify the state's legitimate electors. Bowers testified about denying that request before the congressional committee investigating Trump and the Jan. 6, 2021, breach of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nRandy Miller represents Eastman, but he had little to say Wednesday evening until he could have a longer conversation with his client. \"Dr. Eastman does know, of course, but we haven't had a chance to delve into it,\" said Miller, who is representing Eastman in a California case that seeks to disbar him.\n\nTrump fake electors: Grand jury indicts fake electors who falsely certified Donald Trump as 2020 winner in Arizona\n\nThe indictment identifies this person as an attorney and adviser to the 2016 and 2020 Trump campaigns involved in the plan to submit false elector votes \"to obstruct the certification process\" during the Jan. 6, 2021 joint session of Congress.\n\nEpshteyn pleaded guilty in Scottsdale City Court to disorderly conduct and served probation after a woman and her sister accused him of repeatedly groping them inside a Scottsdale nightclub in 2021. The conviction was set aside by the court in January 2023.\n\nIdentified as an attorney for the Trump campaign, the indictment says this defendant, a former One America News personality, \"made false claims of widespread election fraud in Arizona and in six other states.\" She encouraged the Arizona Legislature to change the outcome of the election and \"she also encouraged Pence to accept the false Arizona Republican electors' votes on January 6, 2021.\"\n\nThe indictment alleges Ellis lobbied GOP lawmakers in Arizona to \"disregard the popular vote\" and \"helped organize the false Arizona Republican electors' votes on December 14, 2020.\" Ellis pleaded guilty in a similar case brought by prosecutors in Georgia, USA Today has reported, and received a sentence of probation.\n\nRoman was \"the director of election day operations\" for Trump's campaign. According to the indictment, he worked closely with others to arrange the false electors' votes in Arizona and other states. Roman is also charged in a similar case in Georgia.\n\nTrump's chief of staff in 2020, this defendant worked with staffers on the Trump campaign to \"coordinate and implement the false Republican electors' votes in Arizona and six other states,\" the indictment reads.\n\nMeadows was held in contempt for not complying with a subpoena from the committee investigating what happened on Jan. 6, 2021, and was charged in a similar case in Georgia.\n\nThe Republicans who served as electors for Donald Trump in the 2020 election include powerful and influential GOP figures: a former Republican Party of Arizona chairman; a Republican national committeeman and executive at Turning Point USA and its political arm; and two sitting state senators -- one of whom retains immense political power at the Arizona Capitol.\n\nKelli Ward, Tyler Bowyer, Nancy Cottle, Jacob Hoffman, Anthony Kern, James Lamon, Robert Montgomery, Samuel Moorhead, Loraine Pellegrino, Gregory Safsten and Michael Ward were

The former president is named as a co-conspirator himself.\n\nThe phony electors are now facing felony counts of fraud, forgery, and conspiracy.\n\nNews about whether state prosecutors would seek charges for the \"fake elector\" scheme has been anticipated for weeks. During a March taping of Politics Unplugged, Mayes had told Arizona's Family political editor Dennis Welch that an announcement was imminent.\n\nWho are Arizona's 11 'fake electors'?\n\nArizona's false electors included high-profile and powerful politicians. Like Kelli Ward, former chairwoman of the Arizona Republican Party, and her husband. Two current GOP state lawmakers, Jake Hoffman from Queen Creek and Anthony Kern from Glendale, were also involved.\n\nKern, currently running for U.S. Senate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District, has previously called Mayes' investigation a \"joke\" and has said that he is refusing to cooperate with her office, adding that he has done nothing wrong.\n\n\"There's no such thing as fake electors,\" Kern told Arizona's Family in December. \"If it was illegal, we wouldn't have done it.\"\n\nPolitico reported last month that those \"fake electors\" appeared in front of a grand jury in recent weeks and that many have pleaded the Fifth Amendment.\n\nLORAINE PELLEGRINO\n\nTYLER BOWYER\n\nGREG SAFSTEN\n\nKELLI WARD\n\nMICHAEL WARD\n\nWho else was investigated as part of this?\n\nArizona state Rep. Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar were also reportedly subpoenaed by state attorney general Kris Mayes, according to Politico. In the Jan. 6 Congressional Committee's report, they noted Biggs was \"involved in numerous elements of President Trump's efforts to contest the election results...\"\n\nTexts that Biggs reportedly sent to former President Trump's Chief of Staff Mark Meadows showed that even he called the plan to put together an alternate slate of electors \"highly controversial.\" Gosar also tried to challenge the state's 2020 election results when they were up for certification in Congress.\n\nWhat about the Trump officials named in the indictment?\n\nArizona's Family has identified Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, Mike Roman and Mark Meadows as the Trump officials who have been indictment whose names haven't been yet released in the latest public copy of the indictment.\n\nPro-Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro, who pleaded guilty in Georgia's election interference case, is believed to be \"unindicted coconspirator 4,\" Politico reported.\n\nIn the Georgia indictment, it says on Dec. 11, 2020, Chesebro sent an e-mail with attached documents to Gregory Safsten with the Arizona Republican Party and others. Those documents were reportedly to be used by Trump presidential elector nominees in Arizona for the purpose of casting electoral votes for Trump, despite the fact that Trump lost the election in Arizona.\n\nHas this happened in other states?\n\nThe AP reported that Michigan's Attorney General filed felony charges in 2023 against 16 Republican fake electors, who would face eight criminal charges, including forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery.\n\nIn Georgia, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis charged fake electors, but later granted at least 8 of the 16 electors were granted immunity. Then, in December 2023, a grand jury indicted six Republicans for those roles in the alleged scheme in Nevada.\n\nUntil now, Arizona had been the only state that still had the electors scheme legally unresolved.\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nAccording to the attorney general's office, \"additional named defendants have been indicted but redacted from the attached copy.\" Officials say that an unredacted version will be available after all defendants have been served. It's not immediately clear if additional charges could be forthcoming.\n\nRead the full indictment below\n\nThis is a breaking news story. Check back for updates.

Ward and her husband are two of 11 Republicans in Arizona who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring Donald Trump had beaten Joe Biden in the state during the 2020 presidential election were charged Wednesday, April 24, 2024, with conspiracy, fraud and forgery, marking the fourth state to bring charges against \"fake electors.\"\n\nBy JACQUES BILLEAUD and JOSH KELETY - Associated Press\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- An Arizona grand jury has indicted former Donald Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows and lawyer Rudy Giuliani along with 16 others in an election interference case.\n\nThe indictment released Wednesday names 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring that Donald Trump beat Joe Biden in Arizona in the 2020 presidential election. It shows seven other defendants whose names were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the indictment.\n\nOne is described as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, a description that clearly describes Giuliani. Another is described as Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nPeople are also reading...

A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nNone of the 11 responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press on Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nAssociated Press writers Jonathan J. Cooper in Phoenix, Kate Brumback in Atlanta and Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Whatever their reasoning was, the plot to violate the law must be answered for.\"\n\nThe indictment names former Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward, sitting state Republican Sens. Jake Hoffman and Anthony Kern, former U.S. Senate candidate Jim Lamon, and seven others as the \"fake electors\" who sought to declare Trump the rightful winner of the state's presidential contest.\n\nThe names of other individuals indicted by the state grand jury are redacted, but the document's descriptions make clear that former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, and top Trump legal strategist Boris Epshteyn are among those facing felony charges -- including fraud, forgery, and conspiracy.\n\n\"In Arizona, defendants, unindicted coconspirators, and others pressured the three groups of election officials responsible for certifying election results to encourage them to change the election results,\" the document reads. \"Discussions about using the Republican electors to change the outcome of the election began as early as November 4, 2020. Those plans evolved during\n\nNovember based on memos drafted by [an attorney for the Trump campaign, Kenneth Chesebro].\"\n\nMayes said Wednesday that had the fake elector scheme succeeded, it would have \"deprived Arizona's voters of their right to have their votes counted for their chosen president.\"\n\n\"It effectively would have made their right to vote meaningless,\" said Mayes.\n\nAlex Gulotta, state director of All Voting Is Local Action Arizona, said Wednesday that \"the indictment of the eleven fake electors is one of the first steps required in holding these election deniers accountable for their alleged attempts to take power away from voters by disrupting our free and fair elections.\"\n\n\"Arizonans deserve to trust the election officials responsible for administering our elections and preserving our democracy,\" said Gulotta, \"and this is a positive step forward as we continue to strengthen the foundations of our democracy and restore faith in our elections.\"\n\nThe Arizona Republicreported Wednesday that \"several of the Arizona electors have previously claimed they were merely offering Congress a backup plan, though nothing in the documents they sent to Congress and the National Archives backs up that assertion.\"\n\n\"The indictment includes several statements the false electors made on social media that contradict those claims,\" the newspaper observed.\n\nJenny Guzman, director of Common Cause's Arizona program, said the indictment \"marks the start of a new chapter for the fake elector scheme that has plagued Arizona.\"\n\n\"Arizonans are still dealing with the fallout from the false electors and the Big Lie about the 2020 elections,\" said Guzman. \"We are relieved that the investigation by Attorney General Mayes has concluded and Arizonans can now know that what comes next is accountability. These efforts by these fake electors to undermine the will of Arizona's voters have had implications far beyond their failed attempt to overthrow the 2020 election.\"\n\n\"This indictment can reassure all Arizonans that if anyone, regardless of their political affiliation, attempts to undermine their vote, consequences will follow,\" Guzman added.", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType":

They're charged with nine counts each of conspiracy, fraud and forgery.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday will hear arguments on his bid to avoid federal prosecution over his efforts to reverse his loss.\n\nWith the indictments, Arizona becomes the fourth state where allies of the former president have been charged with using false or unproven claims about voter fraud related to the election. Heading into a likely November rematch with Biden, Trump continues to spread lies about the last election that are echoed by many of his supporters.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic state Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the document.\n\nOne is an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, which clearly describes Giuliani. Another is Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nDescriptions of other unnamed defendants point to Mike Roman, who was Trump's director of Election Day operations; John Eastman, a lawyer who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election; and Christina Bobb, a lawyer who worked with Giuliani. Eastman and Bobb did not respond to text messages seeking comment, nor did a lawyer who is representing Roman in a case in Georgia.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment but if Meadows is named, \"it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\" Giuliani's political adviser, Ted Goodman, decried what he called \"the continued weaponization of our justice system.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nNational Investigator says Trump, allies were uncharged co-conspirators in plot to overturn Michigan election By ED WHITE - Associated Press\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, past president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nIn a statement, Hoffman accused Mayes of weaponizing the attorney general's office in bringing the case but didn't directly comment on the indictment's allegations.\n\n\"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process,\" Hoffman said.\n\nNone of the others responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.\n\nRead more: National Arizona indicts 18 in election interference case, including Giuliani and Meadows By JACQUES BILLEAUD, JONATHAN J.

The 11 fake electors were charged with felonies for fraud, forgery and conspiracy\n\nIn a major setback, an Arizona grand jury has indicted former US President Donald Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows, lawyer Rudy Giuliani and 16 others for their alleged role in overturning the results of the 2020 US Presidential elections in the state.\n\nDuring the hearing, the courts also indictment fake electors from that state along with seven Trump allies who aided the scheme. The charges were read by Kris Mayes, Arizona's Democratic attorney general on Wednesday. The 11 fake electors were charged with felonies for fraud, forgery and conspiracy.\n\nThe former president's affiliates who were indicted in the case included: Mark Meadows, John Eastman, Boris Epshteyn, Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis, Christina Bobb and Mike Roman.\n\nTrump was not charged in the case\n\nWhile the former US President was not charged in the Arizona case, the indictment referred to him as \"unindicted co-conspirator 1\".\n\n\"In Arizona, and the United States, the people elected Joseph Biden as president on November 3 2020. Unwilling to accept this fact, defendants and unindicted co-conspirators schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency to keep unindicted co-conspirator 1 in office against the will of Arizona's voters,\" the indictment reads.\n\n\"This scheme would have deprived Arizona voters of their right to vote and have their votes counted,\" the court furthered.\n\nPresident Joe Biden won Arizona with over 10,000 votes, a close margin in the typically red state that immediately prompted allegations of voter fraud. The indictment stated that the former president schemed to keep himself in the office.\n\nThe court mentioned that those around him believed that he lost, but still aided the effort. The indictment noted that the defendants intended to use these false votes to pressure former vice-president Mike Pence into rejecting the slate of accurate electors for Biden during the vote count of the electoral college.\n\nHowever, Pence did not declare Trump the winner. If he would have used the fake electoral votes, it would have delayed the official count.\n\nSeven states saw the same fate\n\nApart from Arizona, seven states saw similar schemes. In light of this, Democratic attorney generals in Michigan and Nevada have indicated fake electors in their respective states. In the state of Giorgia, three of 16 fake electors were indicted as part of a wide-ranging racketeering indictment against Trump and allies.\n\nThe remaining were given immunity for helping the district attorney in the investigation.\n\nIn the state of Wisconsin, the fake electors acknowledged that Biden won the elections and settled the civil lawsuit over the issue. Why it took Arizona so long to deal with the matter was because Mayes herself narrowly won office in 2022.\n\nHer predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, did not pursue the line of inquiry. Hence, she confirmed the commencement of the investigation in early 2023.\n\nThe investigation has already put Mayes at odds with Arizona's Republican-led legislature, which has already established a committee to investigate Mayes and her office over concerns she was working beyond her authority as attorney general.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"},

The state grand jury returned charges on nine counts: one count of conspiracy, a class two felony; two counts of fraud, one a class two felony and one a class five felony; and six counts of forgery, a class four felony.\n\nThe indictment names Sen. Anthony Kern, R-Glendale, Sen. Jake Hoffman, R-Queen Creek; former Arizona Republican party chair Kelli Ward; her husband Michael Ward; then-executive director of the state Republican party Gregory Safsten; RNC committeeman and chief operating officer of Turning Point USA, Tyler Bowyer; chair of the Arizona Republican Presidential Electors Nancy Cottle; secretary of the electors Lorraine Pellegrino, former Senate candidate Jim Lamon; former chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee Robert Montgomery and member of Gila County Arizona Republican Party Samuel Moorhead.\n\nThe indictment also included seven redacted individuals who Mayes said have yet to be served.\n\nIn December 2020, the group of 11 met and recorded themselves signing a document logging 11 electoral votes for Trump, despite then Secretary of State Katie Hobbs and Gov. Doug Ducey already cementing President Joe Biden's narrow victory. They 11 declared themselves to be \"duly elected and qualified\" electors.\n\nThe indictment alleges that prior to signing, the defendants \"raised false claims of widespread election fraud in Arizona to pressure election officials to change the outcome of a democratic election\" and lodged a lawsuit, among eight total, challenging Biden's win.\n\n\"Defendants deceived the citizens of Arizona by falsely claiming that those votes were contingent only on a legal challenge that would change the outcome of the election. In reality, Defendants intended that their false votes for Trump Pence would encourage Pence to reject the Biden-Harris votes on January 6, 2021, regardless of the outcome of the legal challenge,\" the indictment reads. \"The scheme failed when Vice President Michael Pence accepted all certified Biden-Harris votes on January 6, 2021.\"\n\nThe charges against Ariona's slate of \"fake electors\" follows criminal charges against those who participated in similar efforts in Nevada, Georgia and Michigan. Mayes' investigation into the 11 fake electors started soon after she took office in early 2022, following more than a year of inaction from former Attorney General Brnovich.\n\nMayes told reporters earlier this month, \"We got a late start here in Arizona because my predecessor for whatever reason decided not to investigate this case. So, we were essentially two years behind.\"\n\nIn a video statement released today, Mayes said her office \"took the necessary time to thoroughly piece together the details of the events ... they followed the facts where they led.\"\n\nHoffman said in a written statement to the Arizona Capitol Times, that Mayes had \"unsurprisingly ... weaponized the once respected Attorney General's office to deliver an indictment of her Republican political opponents years after the events at issue, long after other Democrat prosecutors made their decisions, and right before Arizona's primary elections.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process.\"\n\nKern did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a statement, the state Republican party called the indictments \"a blatant and unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial power.\"\n\nMayes said, \"Arizona's election was free and fair. The people of Arizona elected President Biden, and those unwilling to accept this fact, the defendants charged by the state grand jury, allegedly schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency. Whatever their reasoning was, the plot to violate the law must be answered for and I was elected to uphold the law of this state.\"\n\nThe Associated Press determined the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the document.\n\nOne is an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, which clearly describes Giuliani. Another is Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nDescriptions of other unnamed defendants point to Mike Roman, who was Trump's director of Election Day operations; John Eastman, a lawyer who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election; and Christina Bobb, a lawyer who worked with Giuliani. Eastman and Bobb did not respond to text messages seeking comment, nor did a lawyer who is representing Roman in a case in Georgia.", "source": {"uri": "azcapitoltimes.com", "dataType": "news",

Her office stated in a press release that the names would be disclosed once those individuals were served with the charges.\n\nElectors are people selected to officially cast a state's electoral votes within the U.S. Electoral College system utilized during presidential elections.\n\nThe eleven people identified as fake electors from Arizona, namely Tyler Bowyer, Nancy Cottle, Jake Hoffman, Anthony Kern, Jim Lamon, Robert Montgomery, Samuel Moorhead, Loraine Pellegrino, Greg Safsten, Kelli Ward, and Michael Ward, each face nine felony counts. These charges encompass conspiracy, fraudulent schemes, artifices, and forgery.\n\n\"A state grand jury made up of everyday regular Arizonans, has now handed down felony indictments for all 11 Republican electors as well as several others connected to this team,\" Mr. Mayes said on Wednesday. \"These are serious indictments, but this is the first hurdle the state must pass in our constitutional criminal justice system.\"\n\nOn Dec. 14, 2020, the 11 individuals nominated as Arizona's Republican electors convened in Phoenix, where they signed a certificate during a ceremony, asserting themselves as \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and alleging that President Trump had won the state.\n\nThe Arizona Republican Party posted a one-minute video of the signing ceremony on social media. Subsequently, the document was transmitted to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nArizona GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward said at the time that her state's Republican electors, who cast their votes for President Donald Trump on Dec. 14, 2020, believe they \"represent the legally cast votes in our state.\"\n\nThe Arizona electors held their ceremony soon after U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa dismissed their lawsuit that sought to decertify the results that awarded then-candidate Biden's victory in the state. The judge dismissed their lawsuit for lack of legal standing, untimely filing, and failure to substantiate their claims with factual evidence.\n\nTheir lawsuit was one of eight that sought to challenge the integrity of the vote count in the Arizona election.\n\nThe attorney general's office launched its investigation several months after Ms. Mayes, a Democrat, took office, replacing Republican Mark Brnovich.\n\nWednesday's indictment in Arizona marks the fourth state to bring charges against individuals involved in the scheme of \"fake electors.\"", "source": {"uri":

They are accused of allegedly aiding an unsuccessful strategy to award the state's electoral votes to Trump instead of Biden after the 2020 election. Also charged are the Republicans who signed paperwork on Dec. 14, 2020, that falsely purported Trump was the rightful winner, including former state party chair Kelli Ward, state Sens. Jake Hoffman and Anthony Kern, and Tyler Bowyer, a GOP national committeeman and chief operating officer of Turning Point Action, the campaign arm of the pro-Trump conservative group Turning Point USA.\n\nTrump was not charged, but he is described in the indictment as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nThe indictments cap a year-long investigation by Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes (D) into how the elector strategy played out in Arizona, which Biden won by 10,457 votes. Arizona is the fourth state after Michigan, Georgia and Nevada to seek charges against those who formed an alternate slate of presidential electors. As those cases slowly make their way through the legal system, Trump is again running for president, and officials in Arizona and other battleground states are preparing for another likely contentious election.\n\nIn releasing the indictment, Mayes's office redacted the names of all the individuals outside of Arizona who were charged until they have been served their indictments. The Washington Post was able to identify all of them through the accounts of their alleged actions described in the indictment.\n\n\"In Arizona, and the United States, the people elected Joseph Biden as President on November 3, 2020,\" the indictment reads. \"Unwilling to accept this fact, Defendants and unindicted coconspirators schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency\" to keep Trump in office \"against the will of Arizona's voters.\"\n\n\"This scheme would have deprived Arizona voters of their right to vote and have their votes counted.\"\n\nAttorneys for several of those charged cast the indictment as politically motivated. George Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said that if his client \"is named in this indictment, it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\" Charles Burnham, an attorney for Eastman, said the lawyer \"is innocent of criminal conduct in Arizona or any other place and will fight these charges as he has all the other unjust accusations leveled against him.\" And Ted Goodman, a spokesman for Giuliani, called the indictment a \"continued weaponization of our justice system should concern every American, as it does permanent, irrevocable harm to the country.\"\n\nSteven Cheung, a spokesman for Trump, called the charges against the former president's allies \"another example of Democrats' weaponization of the legal system.\"\n\nEpshteyn declined to comment. Bobb, Hoffman, Bowyer, and attorneys for Roman and Ellis did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Kurt Altman, an Arizona-based attorney who represents eight of the 11 Republican electors, including Ward and Kern, said he is \"confident that these charges are unwarranted.\"\n\nMany of those involved in the 2020 elector strategy, which played out in Arizona and six other states, have long insisted that the tactic was legal because the Trump electors were only placeholders to be activated if legal challenges to Biden's win were successful in court. But Mayes charges that Trump's allies inside and outside of Arizona intended all along to use the electors to falsely claim that the outcome of the election was in doubt - facilitating an effort to obstruct the certification of Biden's victory in Congress on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe effort was aided by Trump, the indictment said, who \"himself was unwilling to accept that he had lost the election.\" While the charges focus on the elector strategy, the indictment spells out various ways that Trump and his allies sought to pressure state and local officials to \"encourage them to change\" the election results. Trump allies initially put pressure on members of the Phoenix-area Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, the indictment said. When it became clear that the GOP-led board would not alter the results, pressure was placed on members of the state legislature - namely then-House Speaker Rusty Bowers (R) - who heard from Trump and other allies.\n\nWhen that effort failed, Trump sought to appeal to then-Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R), who ignored a call from Trump while certifying the state's election results. That day, the indictment notes, Trump berated Ducey on social media for certifying the results.\n\nUnlike probes by state prosecutors in Michigan and Nevada, Mayes took a top-to-bottom approach with her investigation. Similar to prosecutors in the Atlanta area, Mayes targeted not just local conservatives who carried out the plan in Phoenix, but also the out-of-state middlemen in Trump's orbit who allegedly helped put it together. But unlike in Georgia, Mayes did not try to indict the former president.\n\nThis is a second round of charges for Meadows, Giuliani, Ellis, Eastman and Roman, who were all indicted alongside Trump in Georgia last year. Ellis pleaded guilty in October to illegally conspiring to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss in Georgia and has been cooperating with prosecutors. This is the first time Epshteyn - now a top 2024 campaign aide who frequently talks with the former president - has been charged for his alleged actions after the 2020 election. Same for Bobb, a former One America News correspondent who has espoused false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and last month was named the senior counsel for election integrity at the Republican National Committee.\n\nMayes's case had been squarely focused on local conservatives up until late last year. Then, Arizona prosecutors and investigators met in December with Kenneth Chesebro, an attorney and an architect of the elector strategy who pleaded guilty in Georgia in October to a single felony count of participating in a conspiracy to file false documents. Chesebro provided Mayes's team with records - some that had been previously unseen - that revealed more information about those involved in the Arizona effort, according to two people familiar with the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk about the sensitive conversations. After that, they said the Arizona investigation widened.\n\nMuch of the activity that Mayes investigated happened in the weeks after Biden was declared the winner in Arizona and Dec. 14, 2020, when the Republican electors gathered to sign paperwork. Emails, records, text messages and other documents from this time have emerged in a variety of ways, including from the U.S. House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nConversations among attorneys and Trump allies about using GOP electors to change the electoral outcome began as early as Nov. 4, 2020, the indictment said. Eastman, a pro-Trump lawyer, helped devise the multistate strategy and outlined how it could be achieved. By Dec. 12, documents for seven states had been drafted.\n\nBy the time the strategy reached Republicans in Arizona, according to the timeline in the indictment, Republicans in the state had worked to try to undermine confidence in the state's electoral outcome.\n\nBy then, Giuliani and Ellis frequently traveled together as they worked to overturn Trump's loss, state by state. Both attended a Nov. 30, 2020, event in downtown Phoenix attended by state GOP state and federal lawmakers, where they falsely claimed widespread fraud had marred the election. Then, Giuliani, Ellis and other Trump allies tried to persuade Bowers (R) to help overturn the results.\n\nBowers, speaking in 2022 before the House committee, said he remembered Giuliani saying during that meeting, \"We've got lots of theories - we just don't have the evidence.\"\n\nBobb, who has ties to Arizona, communicated with Trump allies about the strategy. After the House speaker met with Giuliani and other Trump allies, Bobb emailed the then-state Senate president with information that Giuliani believed could be used to sow doubt about the 2020 outcome.\n\nRoman, the campaign staffer who oversaw Election Day operations, circulated emails about the alternate elector plan, tracked elector participation in several states and communicated about making sure the paperwork was in Washington by Jan. 6, 2021, when Congress convened to count electoral college votes. Roman directed Chesebro to make sure that Ward, the state party chair, had the necessary paperwork to prepare for the signing of official-looking paperwork, according to emails that have been made public.\n\nIn early December 2020, Epshteyn emailed a Wisconsin-based attorney who was aiding the campaign and asked him to draft sample language for alternate electors in seven states, including Arizona. Epshteyn wrote that the request came from Giuliani, and he added, \"If that's difficult, we can have counsels in those states do it.\"\n\nMeadows, as Trump's final White House chief of staff, has sought to downplay his involvement in the elector plan. In a federal court hearing last August in Georgia, Meadows repeatedly testified under oath that he played no role in the elector effort. Prosecutors introduced into evidence December 2020 emails between Meadows and Jason Miller, a longtime Trump campaign aide that showed Meadows forwarding a memo about the plan to Miller.\n\n\"Let's have a discussion about this tomorrow,\" Meadows wrote. When Miller told him the campaign was already talking about it, Meadows replied, \"We just need to have someone coordinating the electors for the states.\" In court, Meadows sought to downplay the email, saying that his use of the term \"we\" meant the campaign, not him. Meadows also testified that he did not want to get \"yelled at\" by Trump.\n\nOn Dec. 10, 2020, the state party's executive director called Chesebro to work through logistics of the elector plan, the indictment said. Chesebro emailed the Republican information about the plan and then emailed an Arizona-based attorney to ask if an appeal was planned for an election-related lawsuit.\n\n\"Reason is that Kelli Ward & ... just spoke to the Mayor about the campaign's request that all electors vote Monday in all contested state,\" the email said, referring to Giuliani. Chesebro wrote that Ward and another person were \"concerned it could appear treasonous for the AZ electors to vote on Monday if there is no pending court proceeding that might, eventually, lead to the electors being ratified as the legitimate ones.\"\n\nBy Dec. 12, 2020, Republicans in Arizona were finalizing plans to assemble in Phoenix to stand in solidarity with Trump, according to previously released communications. Ward emailed Chesebro, Roman and others that the Trump campaign had requested the participation of Arizona electors. \"We are all prepared to meet 12/14,\" she wrote. \"It would be optimal if the campaign created and produced the documents in the ACTUAL format needed so staff can print the collateral, the electors can show up, meet/vote, and sign, and then staff can collate the documents and send to the appropriate places in the appropriate way.\"\n\nRoman responded to the group and directed Chesebro, \"Please send the full updated AZ packet,\" according to records previously made public.\n\nWard also made clear in her email that she had talked to Giuliani. She wrote that she had \"told him we were working to make sure we accomplish what we need to do.\"\n\nOn Dec. 14, 2020, the day the electoral college formally convened, Ward and other pro-Trump Republicans gathered at the state party's headquarters. The party publicized the event - which they called \"The Signing\" - on Twitter, and electors posed for photos.\n\nThe indictment said that the pro-Trump electors \"made statements directly contradicting any intention that their votes would only be used if they succeeded in legal challenge that changed the outcome of Arizona's election.\" The indictment included an image of a social media post from Ward that prosecutors said demonstrates that \"her goal was to have the Arizona Legislature certify the fake Republican electors' votes.\"\n\nLeading up to Jan. 6, 2021, the indictment said, Ward continued calling for the state legislature to change the election outcome while Bowyer made public statements \"demonstrating that the contingency plan was cover for his attempt to change the outcome of the election.\" And other electors either sought to persuade Vice President Mike Pence to delay certification, the indictment said, or recertify Biden's electors.\n\nIn the weeks following the Jan. 6 attack, prosecutors across the country weighed whether to investigate pro-Trump electors in their states. At the time in Arizona, then-Attorney General Mark Brnovich (R) chose not to do so. After Mayes won her election in 2022 - partly on a promise to investigate the elector strategy - she assigned a team of prosecutors to begin pursuing evidence.\n\nAlong the way, state prosecutors spent several hours interviewing Bowers, Republican members of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors who voted to approve election results from the Phoenix area and others familiar with how the elector maneuver unfolded inside of the state GOP.\n\nIn early March, the probe began nearing an end, and the pro-Trump electors received subpoenas requesting their testimony before a grand jury. Many had been advised to invoke their Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions.\n\nHolly Bailey in Atlanta, Amy Gardner in Portland, Ore., and Josh Dawsey, Hannah Knowles and Maegan Vazquez in

The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nCharges include felonies that range from fraud and forgery to conspiracy.\n\nSeveral Arizona politicians were named in the suit others, including the following:\n\nFive others were indicted, but their names were blacked out of records released by Mayes. Her office said the names will be released after they're served with the charges.\n\nOn Aug. 16, Mayes confirmed that there was an investigation into the fake electors in Arizona.\n\nArizona state senator Jake Hoffman issued the following response to the news of his indictment:\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in Arizona, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner in the state.\n\nIndictments against fake electors have also been made in Nevada, Michigan and Georgia.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer.

count.\n\nThe charges include felony counts of fraud, forgery and conspiracy.\n\nThe indictment states that following the election, the 11 Republican electors, plotting with electors from other states, voted for Trump on Dec. 14, 2020, and signed a false document claiming to be the \"duly elected and qualified electors for president and vice president of the United States from the State of Arizona.\"\n\nA brief video of the meeting remains on the Facebook page of the Arizona Republican Party.\n\nThe signed false document was then filed by the Arizona Republican electors with the archivist of the United States and Congress.\n\nMayers explained the defendants lied to Arizona voters by stating their votes were contingent only on a legal challenge.\n\n\"The defendants intended the false votes for Trump and Pence would encourage Vice President Pence to reject the certified Biden-Harris electors' votes regardless of the result of any legal challenge,\" she said.\n\n\"As you will recall, none of the legal challenges filed in Arizona state and federal courts regarding the 2020 election were remotely successful.\"\n\nThe scheme came to an end on Jan. 6, 2021, when Congress

It alleges the slate of Republicans, sometimes known as fake electors, engaged in a conspiracy aimed at \"preventing the lawful transfer of the presidency of the United States, keeping President Donald J. Trump in office against the will of Arizona voters, and depriving Arizona voters of their right to vote and have their votes counted.\"\n\nThe names of seven other individuals are redacted from the grand jury indictment, suggesting a broader scope of Mayes' case. Those people may not have yet been served notice of the allegations against them.\n\nThe people now facing charges include powerful and influential GOP figures: a former Republican Party of Arizona chairman; a Republican national committeeman and executive at Turning Point USA and its political arm; and two sitting state senators -- one of whom retains immense political power at the Arizona Capitol.\n\nMore:'Somewhat dicey' and 'problematic': Inside Trump's bid to have fake electors overturn 2020 election\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe grand jury's decision could levy criminal consequences for an unprecedented plot to subvert the will of Arizona voters, one that has ruptured faith in elections and fueled election conspiracies that have taken root in GOP politics in the state. It comes as Mayes has promised to aggressively combat election conspiracies, offering a sharp contrast to her predecessor.\n\nThe grand jury, a panel of Arizonans who met in secret in recent weeks, heard evidence presented by Mayes' prosecutors and ultimately decided there was enough to substantiate criminal charges.\n\nThe 11 electors are each charged with nine criminal counts, including conspiracy, fraudulent schemes and artifices, fraudulent schemes and practices, and six counts of forgery. Their lawyers, or the named defendants themselves, could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nThe fake electors in Arizona are:\n\nThe electors who claimed Trump won\n\nMayes has been under immense political pressure to bring a case. Similar slates of electors in Michigan, Georgia and Nevada have already been charged for their role in the sweeping effort to keep Trump in power.\n\nAnd a federal grand jury last year brought charges against Trump himself, alleging the former president conspired with others to disenfranchise voters and subvert Biden's win. Trump is also facing charges in the Georgia case, which alleges he led a criminal enterprise and relies on a state law normally reserved for prosecuting mobsters.\n\nSeveral of the Arizona electors have previously claimed they were merely offering Congress a backup plan, though nothing in the documents they sent to Congress and the National Archives backs up that assertion. Similar groups of electors in other states did include conditional language, but none was included in Arizona.\n\nBiden carried Arizona in November 2020 by a 10,457 vote margin with nearly 3.4 million votes cast. It was Biden's smallest margin of victory in any state, and only the second time in 70 years that a Democrat won the state.\n\nAt the time, Trump had spent months furthering doubt about the election result. In the days after his loss, he and his aides unleashed a pressure campaign on GOP leaders in Arizona and other states.\n\nThey found some support in Arizona, while others rebuffed the president's unfounded claims. That split in loyalties continues to divide the state's Republican Party and grassroots support, threatening the party's ability to win elections in the swing state.\n\nArizona actually had two different groups of illegitimate GOP electors. The indictment made public on Wednesday names the slate that included more prominent Republican figures, and some of whose involvement has already been well established by the Congressional committee investigating the violent break-in at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThose 11 GOP electors met at the Arizona Republican headquarters in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, posting videos on social media of themselves casting their votes for Trump. They signed paperwork to submit to Congress claiming they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors.\n\nBut that was a lie.\n\nThe same day, electors for Biden met to cast their votes in the Electoral College confirming the Democrat's win. They met at an undisclosed location, citing security concerns tied to Trump's refusal to accept his loss.\n\nIt was a procedural process that, prior to 2020, was a formality often overlooked by most Americans.\n\nInvestigation begins under a new attorney general in 2023\n\nMayes confirmed more than one year ago, in March 2023, that her office would investigate Arizona's electors who falsely claimed to be legitimate. A former Republican who left the party in 2019 citing the growth of Trumpism and what she saw as shrinking room for moderates in the party, Mayes had been in office for two months. She won her election in November 2022 by 280 votes -- one of the narrowest margins in state history.\n\nThat race and others on the ballot two years ago put to the test Arizonans' appetite for electing those who deny legitimate election results.\n\nMayes pledged to protect election workers and defend elections, where her Republican predecessor Mark Brnovich had tried to straddle election denialism. She promised a purposeful shift in focus within the office, which amounts to the state's largest law firm, and condemned Brnovich for sitting on a report for over a year that said his office \"did not uncover any criminality or fraud.\"\n\nHer investigation at first focused on the 11 electors, but a trickle of information that has leaked out from the grand jury proceedings over the past several weeks has suggested Mayes cast a wider net.\n\nTwo Arizona congressmen who were among the loudest voices in support of Trump's \"Stop the Steal\" campaign, Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar, received subpoenas.\n\nMayes' office turned to Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro for information. Chesebro, who also aided prosecutors in Georgia (after he was indicted) and Nevada, wrote memorandums outlining the strategy to send alternate electors to Congress.\n\nMore:Rudy Giuliani files for bankruptcy after jury orders him to pay $148 million in defamation case\n\nSending the documents from Trump electors \"can prevent Biden from amassing 270 electoral votes on January 6, and force the Members of Congress, the media, and the American people to focus on the substantive evidence of illegal election and counting activities in the six contested States,\" one memo from Dec. 6, 2020, reads. The memo suggests states that undertook the plan should also spread \"messaging that presents this as a routine measure.\"\n\nIn fact, the effort was anything but routine -- it was criminal, the grand jury said.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_fake_electors_plot", "type": "wiki",

I guess I'll never understand this. Now, the proverbial chickens have come home to roost for 11 Arizona Republicans and seven former Trump aides who thought they could finagle a scheme to keep Trump in the White House by falsely certifying that he won the state in 2020. This is, of course, not true, since Joe Biden narrowly carried the state. The efforts of the 11 fake electors and the aforementioned aides didn't sit well with an Arizona Grand jury that indicted all of them for their troubles, AZCentral reports.\n\nDemocratic Attorney General Kris Mayes announced the indictment was issued on Wednesday. Of course, for those of us hoping anyone connected to Trump will stumble, this is good news to our tired ears. The indictment alleges the slate of Republicans who'd gained the nickname \"fake electors\" engaged in a conspiracy that was meant to prevent \"the lawful transfer of the presidency of the United States, keeping President Donald J. Trump in office against the will of Arizona voters, and depriving Arizona voters of their right to vote and have their votes counted.\"\n\nThe names of the seven former aides have been redacted from the grand jury indictment, and this is likely because they have not been served notice of the charges against them.\n\nIt's always nice to see the trash taken out. While their names may be redacted, along with the charges against them, details included in the indictment make it clear that several top allies of the ex-president's, who piled on a pressure campaign to change the election results, will also be facing charges in Arizona. It's likely Rudy Giuliani, Trump's former lawyer/clown, and former chief of staff Mark Meadows, among others are among those named in the indictment.\n\nThe document also makes clear that Trump himself is \"unindicted coconspirator 1.\"\n\nMany of the Arizonans facing charges are some pretty big guns: a former Republican Party of Arizona chairman; a Republican national committeeman and aTurning Point USA executive who's a part of the group's political arm. A pair of sitting state senators -- one of whom wields immense political power at the Arizona Capitol round out the group.\n\nFor many of us, these fake electors have shaken what little confidence we still had in the democratic process. But the good news here is that the grand jury's decision could levy some heavy-duty criminal consequences for the plot to subvert the will of Arizona voters. This terrible scandal shredded faith in elections and brought forth election conspiracy theories that are now embedded in GOP politics within the state. As AZCentral reports, Mayes is promising to aggressively fight election conspiracies. But considering the conspiracies and the nutters she's up against, she's in for a tough battle.\n\nBut Mayes appears to be up to the challenge. The grand jury, a panel of Arizonans who met secretly in recent weeks, heard the evidence provided by her prosecutors and found there was enough evidence to bolster criminal charges.\n\nNow the 11 fake electors are each charged with nine criminal counts, including conspiracy, fraudulent schemes and artifices, fraudulent schemes and practices, and six counts of forgery.\n\nIf you're curious to see who the fake electors are, here's the list.\n\nThese11 electors met in Phoenix at the Arizona Republican headquarters on Dec. 14 2020, and the posted videos on social media of themselves casting votes for Trump. They even stooped so far as to sign paperwork to submit to Congress in which they claimed they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors.\n\nHow shameful. Only desperate people working for a desperate man would do this. I'm glad Trump is considered \"Co-conspirator 1.\" I hope they climb up his behind with a microscope. Because he couldn't accept loss, I believe Trump's actions may go down in history as one of the most shameful things done by any politician.\n\nI hope he sees his day in court. As well as these other so-called \"electors.\"", "source": {"uri": "politizoom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PolitiZoom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "megan_hamilton@politizoom.com", "name": "Megan Hamilton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_fake_electors_plot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trump fake electors plot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Mayes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kris Mayes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Arizona_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Arizona Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Chief of Staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Republican_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Republican Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Giuliani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://politizoom.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/trump-angry.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510566", "eventUri": "eng-9510566", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-12-14", "textStart": 3484, "textEnd": 3496}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Hoffman had in the past several weeks been pursuing a position with the RNC.\n\nHoffman told the Arizona Republic in a statement that he is \"innocent of any crime,\" and \"I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process.\"\n\nAn attorney for Lamon also told the Arizona Republic the indictment is \"a politically motivated prosecution.\"\n\nAdditional defendants' names were redacted from court documents because they had not yet been served, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, said. Some, however, could be identified by their descriptions in court documents.\n\nThe indictment described Trump as \"Unindicted Coconspirator 1.\" Trump has repeatedly called such prosecutions \"witch hunts.\"\n\n\"An attorney for Unindicted Coconspirator 1 who was often identified as 'the Mayor,'\" appears to be Rudy Giuliani. Jenna Ellis, another attorney who joined Giuliani in helping spread baseless claims of widespread voter fraud, also seems to be described in the documents.\n\nAnother unidentified defendant is referred to as Trump's chief of staff in 2020, which would have been Mark Meadows. Another unidentified defendant was the Trump campaign's Director of Election Day Operations, a title that belonged to Mike Roman.\n\nAttorney George Terwilliger, who represents Meadows, told The Associated Press that, while he hadn't seen the indictment, naming Meadows would be \"a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\"\n\nTed Goodman, a political advisor to Giuliani, told the AP the indictment shows, \"the continued weaponization of our justice system.\"\n\nThe Arizona Republican Party called the indictments a \"blatant and unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial power\" and said it \"condemns these actions in the strongest terms.\"\n\nThe charges being brought include fraud, forgery, and conspiracy, which are class 2, 4, and 5 felonies, Mayes said.\n\nArizona is one of seven states that Trump lost in 2020 where the former president's allies allegedly attempted to create a fraudulent register of electors.\n\n\"Unwilling to accept\" the fact that Biden won the 2020 presidential election, the defendants \"schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency\" by raising false claims of election fraud and organizing fake elector votes, the indictment said.\n\nThe alleged fraud was committed to prevent \"the lawful transfer of the presidency of the United States,\" keeping \"Trump in office against the will of Arizona voters, and depriving Arizona voters of their right to vote and have their votes counted,\" court documents said.\n\nThe Arizona indictments came as Trump and 18 of his associates face charges of racketeering, election fraud and other charges in Fulton County, Georgia, over an alleged effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election, including the alternate elector scheme. That indictment alleged that some of the defendants solicited legislators to appoint new electors in other states besides Georgia, including Arizona.\n\nIn August of last year, the former president was indicted by a federal grand jury over alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. That indictment, stemming from special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into Trump's actions following the 2020 election, cited a memo outlining a strategy for Trump supporters to serve as fake electors.\n\nThe former president has denied all wrongdoing in both of those cases.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Arizona Attor-ney General Kris Mayes said in a press release announcing the charges that those names would be made public after all of the defendants had been served with the indictment.\n\nGiuliani is among those whose names are redacted, a spokesperson for him, Ted Goodman, confirmed, criticizing the prosecution of the former New York mayor as political.\n\nAnother defendant whose name was redacted is described in the indictment as chief of staff in 2020, the position Mark Meadows held in the Trump White House at that time.\n\nRepresentatives for Meadows did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the indictment.\n\nTrump, Giuliani and Meadows are co-defendants in the Georgia case, where they are charged with a racketeering conspiracy to overturn Biden's victory in that state. They have pleaded not guilty there. Trump has also pleaded not guilty in the federal election-subversion case in Washington.\n\nTrump, a Republican, says all the cases are a political \"witch hunt\" to prevent him from defeating Democrat Biden in this year's presidential rematch.\n\nAnother defendant whose name is redacted is Trump lawyer Christina Bobb, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung confirmed, calling the Arizona indictment \"another example of Democrats' weaponization of the legal system.\"\n\n\"Christina Bobb is a former Marine Corps officer, who served our nation and the President with distinction. The Democrat platform for 2024: if you can't beat them, try to throw them in jail,\" Cheung said.\n\nGiuliani spokesperson Goodman also called the Arizona indictment an example of \"the continued weaponization of our justice system,\" saying it \"should concern every American as it does permanent, irrevocable harm to the country.\"\n\n\"Mayor Rudy Giuliani - one of the most effective prosecutors in American history who took down the Mafia, cleaned up the streets of New York and locked up corrupt public officials - is proud to stand up for the countless Americans who raised legitimate concerns surrounding the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election,\" Goodman said.\n\nThe indictment alleges the defendants pressured the Maricopa Board of Supervisors, the Arizona Legislature and then-Governor Doug Ducey to change the election results.\n\nU.S. presidents are chosen by electors from each state, who cast votes in the Electoral College, where votes are allotted based on each state's population.\n\nIn Arizona and almost all other states, the winner of the state's popular vote receives all of that state's electoral votes. To win the presidency a candidate needs 270 electoral votes - a majority of total 538.\n\nArizona has 11 electoral votes, and the 11 defendants named in the indictment would correspond to those people who purported to be electors for Trump.\n\nArizona is one of seven states where Biden won but Trump allies sought to award the electoral votes to Trump. Many of the races were close. Arizona was decided by little more than 10,000 votes or 0.3% of the ballots cast.\n\nThe charges include fraud, forgery and conspiracy, three classes of felony that with a conviction could have sentences ranging from 6 months to more than 12 years in prison.\n\nArizona is the fourth U.S. state where participants in the elector scheme have faced criminal charges.\n\nThree people who held themselves out as Trump electors in Georgia were charged alongside Trump in the sweeping racketeering case brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.\n\nSixteen people who falsely claimed to be legitimate Trump electors in Michigan were indicted in July 2023 by state Attorney General Dana Nessel. Authorities in Nevada charged six people, including the state Republican chair, with taking part in the scheme.\n\nThe so-called fake elector plan also plays a prominent role in the federal case against Trump brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith, accusing the former president of a multi-part scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump will press his claim that he should be immune from those charges at the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday.\n\nBesides Meadows, Giuliani and Bobb, the other defendants whose names were redacted were three attorneys and the director of election day operations for the Trump campaign. The unindicted co-conspirators also include were two former members of the Arizona legislature and two former attorneys for the Trump campaign.", "source": {"uri": "stabroeknews.com", "dataType":

Meadows, chief of staff for former President Donald Trump, was among those indicted Wednesday, April 24, 2024, in an Arizona election interference case.\n\nBy JACQUES BILLEAUD, JONATHAN J. COOPER and JOSH KELETY - Associated Press\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- An Arizona grand jury has indicted former President Donald Trump 's chief of staff Mark Meadows, lawyer Rudy Giuliani and 16 others for their roles in an attempt to overturn Trump's loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 election.\n\nThe indictment released Wednesday names 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring that Trump won Arizona in 2020. They include the former state party chair, a 2022 U.S. Senate candidate and two sitting state lawmakers, who are charged with nine counts each of conspiracy, fraud and forgery.\n\nThe identities of seven other defendants, including Giuliani and Meadows, were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the documents. They were readily identifiable based on descriptions of the defendants, however.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Heading into a likely November rematch with Biden, Trump continues to spread lies about the last election that are echoed by many of his supporters.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic state Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe indictment alludes to Giuliani as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud. Another defendant is referred to as Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nDescriptions of other unnamed defendants point to Mike Roman, who was Trump's director of Election Day operations; John Eastman, a lawyer who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election; and Christina Bobb, a lawyer who worked with Giuliani.\n\nA lawyer for Eastman, Charles Burnham, said his client is innocent. Bobb did not respond to a text message seeking comment, nor did a lawyer who is representing Roman in a case in Georgia.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment but if Meadows is named, \"it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\" Giuliani's political adviser, Ted Goodman, decried what he called \"the continued weaponization of our justice system.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump was indicted in August in federal court over efforts to cling to power after his defeat, including the fake electors scheme. The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday will hear arguments on his claim in that case that he can't be prosecuted for acts he committed while serving as president.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nThe so-called fake electors facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, past president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nIn a statement, Hoffman accused Mayes of weaponizing the attorney general's office in bringing the case but didn't directly comment on the indictment's allegations.\n\n\"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process,\" Hoffman said.\n\nNone of the others responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.\n\nAssociated Press writers Gabe Stern and Scott Sonner in Las Vegas, Kate Brumback in Atlanta and Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

All the named defendants are part of the Republican Party.\n\nSeven other defendants have not been named, but the AP stated that it has determined the identities of these unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the indictment. This includes an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, which may refer to Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThe AP also identified Meadows as among the people indicted in Arizona, as one of the unnamed co-conspirators was described as Donald Trump's \"chief of staff in 2020.\" Meanwhile, the 11 individuals who were named were the Republican fake electors who tried to submit fake electoral college votes to help Donald Trump overturn the 2020 elections.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" said Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes when she announced the sweeping election interference indictments. \"It's too important.\"\n\nAccording to NBC News, the 11 people named in the indictment included the former chair of the Arizona Republican Party herself, Kelli Ward, who was also a fake Trump elector in the state and is known for spreading false claims that Arizona's election results were rigged.\n\nREAD MORE: Donald Trump Hush Money Trial: Former Trump Friend David Pecker Makes Shocking Admissions During Testimony\n\nThe other indictees include state legislators Anthony Kern and Jake Hoffman, as well as Kelli Ward's husband, Michael Ward. Also indicted is the Republican National Committee's Arizona committeeman and the chief operating officer of Turning Point USA, Tyler Bowen.\n\nFormer Arizona Republican Party executive director Greg Safsten, former Cochise County GOP Robert Montgomery, and former candidate to the US Senate candidate Jim Lamon, were also indicted, along with known GOP operatives, Samuel Moorhead, Nancy Cottle, and Loraine Pellegrino.\n\nKenneth Chesebro, the Trump lawyer who was behind the fake elector scheme, is regarded as an unindicted co-conspirator along with former President Donald Trump himself.\n\nThis new slate of indictments brought against Donald Trump's allies is the latest in the legal battle over the former president's attempts to steal the 2020 presidential election. However, many criticized AG Mayes for her slow work. Now, Mayes has finally revealed her cards.\n\nNPR noted that these indictments are a step forward in an investigation that began a year ago, with many of her fellow Democrats slamming the Arizona AG over the slow pace of the investigation.\n\nWith the indictments, Arizona is now the fourth state to bring charges against the fake Trump electors and their co-conspirators. Previously, Georgia, Michigan, and Nevada have already indicted them. Another investigation over Donald Trump's fake electors scheme is underway in Wisconsin, another important swing state.\n\nREAD NEXT: Donald Trump Asked Supporters To Protest Hush Money Trial, But Few

The case was thrown out by a judge who called their claims of election fraud \"sorely wanting of relevant or reliable evidence.\"\n\nRusty Bowers, then the Arizona House speaker, told the House Jan. 6 committee that following the election he received calls from Trump and attorney Rudy Giuliani claiming that there was election fraud in the state.\n\n\"I was insistent that I had to have proof, real proof, judicial level,\" Bowers testified. \"That's the kind of proof I'm talking about. And the president said, 'Rudy, give the man what he wants.'\"\n\nAsked by ABC News' Jonathan Karl if Giuliani ever provided that evidence, Bowers said, \"He never gave us anything. No names, no data, nothing.\"\n\nBowers also said that Giuliani and attorney Jenna Ellis flew to Phoenix and met with him and other Arizona lawmakers, and asked them to convene the legislature to investigate their unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud.\n\nIn December, Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford announced felony charges against six alleged \"fake electors\" in that state. In Michigan, Attorney General Dana Nessel similarly charged 16 \"alternate electors\" in July for conspiracy to commit forgery, among other charges. And in Georgia, three such \"fake electors\" were among the 18 co-defendants charged, along with Trump, in a sweeping racketeering indictment for alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in that state.\n\nAll defendants charged in all three probes have pleaded not guilty, with Georgia defendants Jenna Ellis, Kenneth Chesebro, Sidney Powell and Scott Hall subsequently taking plea deals in exchange for agreeing to testify in that case. In Michigan, the attorney general dropped all charges against defendant Jim Renner in exchange for his cooperation.\n\nABC News previously reported that Trump's Georgia co-defendant Michael Roman was subpoenaed as part of the Arizona probe and that Chesebro sat for a voluntary interview with Arizona investigators in recent weeks.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a press release announcing the charges that those names would be made public after all of the defendants had been served with the indictment.\n\nGiuliani is among those whose names are redacted, a spokesperson for him, Ted Goodman, confirmed, criticizing the prosecution of the former New York mayor as political.\n\nAnother defendant whose name was redacted is described in the indictment as chief of staff in 2020, the position Mark Meadows held in the Trump White House at that time.\n\nRepresentatives for Meadows did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the indictment.\n\nINDICTMENT FOLLOWS GEORGIA, FEDERAL CASES\n\nTrump, Giuliani and Meadows are co-defendants in the Georgia case, where they are charged with a racketeering conspiracy to overturn Biden's victory in that state. They have pleaded not guilty there. Trump has also pleaded not guilty in the federal election-subversion case in Washington.\n\nTrump, a Republican, says all the cases are a political \"witch hunt\" to prevent him from defeating Democrat Biden in this year's presidential rematch.\n\nAnother defendant whose name is redacted is Trump lawyer Christina Bobb, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung confirmed, calling the Arizona indictment \"another example of Democrats' weaponization of the legal system.\"\n\n\"Christina Bobb is a former Marine Corps officer, who served our nation and the President with distinction. The Democrat platform for 2024: if you can't beat them, try to throw them in jail,\" Cheung said.\n\nGiuliani spokesperson Goodman also called the Arizona indictment an example of \"the continued weaponization of our justice system,\" saying it \"should concern every American as it does permanent, irrevocable harm to the country.\"\n\n\"Mayor Rudy Giuliani - one of the most effective prosecutors in American history who took down the Mafia, cleaned up the streets of New York and locked up corrupt public officials - is proud to stand up for the countless Americans who raised legitimate concerns surrounding the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election,\" Goodman said.\n\nThe indictment alleges the defendants pressured the Maricopa Board of Supervisors, the Arizona Legislature and then-Governor Doug Ducey to change the election results.\n\nFALSE ELECTORS SCHEME IN SEVERAL STATES\n\nU.S. presidents are chosen by electors from each state, who cast votes in the Electoral College, where votes are allotted based on each state's population.\n\nIn Arizona and almost all other states, the winner of the state's popular vote receives all of that state's electoral votes. To win the presidency a candidate needs 270 electoral votes - a majority of total 538.\n\nArizona has 11 electoral votes, and the 11 defendants named in the indictment would correspond to those people who purported to be electors for Trump.\n\nArizona is one of seven states where Biden won but Trump allies sought to award the electoral votes to Trump. Many of the races were close. Arizona was decided by little more than 10,000 votes or 0.3% of the ballots cast.\n\nThe charges include fraud, forgery and conspiracy, three classes of felony that with a conviction could have sentences ranging from 6 months to more than 12 years in prison.\n\nArizona is the fourth U.S. state where participants in the elector scheme have faced criminal charges.\n\nThree people who held themselves out as Trump electors in Georgia were charged alongside Trump in the sweeping racketeering case brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.\n\nSixteen people who falsely claimed to be legitimate Trump electors in Michigan were indicted in July 2023 by state Attorney General Dana Nessel. Authorities in Nevada charged six people, including the state Republican chair, with taking part in the scheme.\n\nThe so-called fake elector plan also plays a prominent role in the federal case against Trump brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith, accusing the former president of a multi-part scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump will press his claim that he should be immune from those charges at the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday.\n\nBesides Meadows, Giuliani and Bobb, the other defendants whose names were redacted were three attorneys and the director of election day operations for the Trump campaign. The unindicted co-conspirators also include were two former members of the Arizona legislature and two former attorneys for the Trump campaign.", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com", "dataType":

The state Republican Party documented the signing of the certificate in a social media post and sent it to Congress and the National Archives.\n\nAmong those charged is Kelli Ward, who served as chair of the Arizona GOP during the 2020 election and the immediate aftermath. She tweeted on Jan. 6, 2021, after the attack on the U.S. Capitol: \"Congress is adjourned. Send the elector choice back to the legislatures.\" Ward was a consistent propagator of false claims that Arizona's election results were rigged.\n\nOthers charged include: state legislators Anthony Kern and Jake Hoffman; Michael Ward, Kelli Ward's husband; Tyler Bowyer, the RNC's Arizona committeeman and the chief operating officer of the Trump-aligned Turning Point USA; Greg Safsten, the former Arizona GOP executive director; former U.S. Senate candidate Jim Lamon; Robert Montgomery, the former head of the Cochise County GOP; and Republican Party activists Samuel Moorhead, Nancy Cottle and Loraine Pellegrino.\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, won her election to be the state's chief prosecutor in November 2022, replacing Republican Mark Brnovich, a one-time ally of Trump who later earned the former president's scorn for not substantiating Trump's claims of election fraud in the state.\n\n\"We have to make sure that it's clear to everyone it's unacceptable to try to steal an election, to undermine and overthrow an election, and that's what happened,\" Mayes told MSNBC last year after her election victory. \"We have to make sure what happened in 2020 never happens again.\"\n\nThe Arizona charges are the latest example of Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election sprouting into legal cases during his 2024 bid to retake office.\n\nArizona was one of seven states where \"alternate electors\" signed paperwork falsely claiming Trump had won the state. \"Alternate electors\" in Nevada, Georgia and Michigan have already been charged by prosecutors in their respective states.\n\nAttorney Kenneth Chesebro, one of the planners of the alleged scheme, pled guilty last year in Georgia on conspiracy charges brought against him, Trump and 17 others in the state. He is also believed to be one of the unidentified co-conspirators described by Special Counsel Jack Smith in his federal election interference indictment of Trump last year.\n\nChesebro and others, including Trump legal adviser John Eastman, argued in the months after the 2020 election that then-Vice President Mike Pence could use the existence of the alternate electors to name Trump the winner of the election as he presided over the electoral vote count in Congress on Jan. 6.\n\nEastman wrote in a memo: \"At the end, he announces that because of the ongoing disputes in the 7 States, there are no electors that can be deemed validly appointed in those States. ... There are at this point 232 votes for Trump, 222 votes for Biden. Pence then gavels President Trump as re-elected.\"\n\nTrump lost Arizona by just under 11,000 votes. As the Republican electors sent illegitimate certifications to Washington, Trump sought to put pressure on Maricopa County officials and other Arizona Republicans, including then-state House Speaker Rusty Bowers and then-Gov. Doug Ducey.\n\nTrump placed a phone call directly to Ducey as the governor certified the state's election results. Ducey muted the call.\n\nMayes' term as Arizona attorney general has been marked by other election cases stemming from Trump's false claims about fraud in the 2020 election and after.\n\nLast fall, Mayes charged two local officials who delayed the certification of midterm election results in 2022 in Cochise County. The officials voted against certifying the county's election results by the statutory deadline, after airing baseless accusations about the integrity of the election for months. The county certified its election results only after a court ordered it to do so.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vaughn_hillyard@aol.com",

Seven others were indicted but had their names redacted.\n\nThose seven include former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and former Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman.\n\nNPR is identifying them based on information included in the indictment that pertains to them, such as being \"often identified as 'the Mayor' \" for Giuliani, who was mayor of New York City.\n\nAccording to a news release from Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, \"[a]n unredacted version of the indictment will be made available after all defendants have been served.\"\n\nThe defendants are charges with nine counts, including felony fraud, forgery and conspiracy.\n\n\"The people of Arizona elected President Biden,\" Mayes said in a video release. \"Unwilling to accept this fact, the defendants charged by the state grand jury allegedly schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency.\"\n\nThe indictment also mentions a number of unindicted co conspirators, including \"a former president of the United States who spread false claims of election fraud following the 2020 election\" -- Trump -- and former members of the Arizona Legislature.\n\nThe action makes Arizona the fourth state where charges have been brought against individuals involved in so-called \"fake elector\" schemes that sought to undermine Biden's victory over Trump.\n\nProsecutors in Georgia, Michigan and Nevada have already charged individuals accused of participating in similar schemes in those states. In another swing state, Wisconsin, fake electors admitted to their roles as part of civil settlements.\n\nThe slate of fake electors charged in Arizona includes several influential Republicans, including sitting state Sens. Jake Hoffman and Anthony Kern. Former Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward, former party Executive Director Greg Safsten and RNC Committeeman Tyler Bowyer also signed documents transmitted to the federal government. Bowyer is also an executive with Turning Point USA, an Arizona-based right wing advocacy group founded by Trump ally Charlie Kirk.\n\nThe indictments mark a significant step forward in an investigation that began a year ago after Mayes, a Democrat who was elected attorney general in 2022 by just 280 votes, took office in early 2023.\n\nSome Democrats criticized Mayes over the pace of that investigation, which proceeded largely behind closed doors as grand juries in other states indicted alleged participants in the fake electors scheme.\n\nBut Mayes urged patience, pointing out that she took office after many of the officials pursuing the case in other states. Her predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, did not investigate the case.\n\n\"The investigators and attorneys assigned to this case took the necessary time to thoroughly piece together the details of the events that began nearly four years ago,\" Mayes said.\n\nThere were signs the case was picking up steam in recent months, though. In December, the investigators met with former Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro, who was accused of being the head architect of the fake elector plot by the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack.\n\nChesebro pleaded guilty in Georgia to one felony count of conspiracy to commit filing false documents. He agreed to testify in that case and also met with prosecutors in Nevada.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a press release announcing the charges that those names would be made public after all of the defendants had been served with the indictment.\n\nGiuliani is among those whose names are redacted, a spokesperson for him, Ted Goodman, confirmed, criticizing the prosecution of the former New York mayor as political.\n\nAnother defendant whose name was redacted is described in the indictment as chief of staff in 2020, the position Mark Meadows held in the Trump White House at that time.\n\nRepresentatives for Meadows did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the indictment.\n\nINDICTMENT FOLLOWS GEORGIA, FEDERAL CASES\n\nTrump, Giuliani and Meadows are co-defendants in the Georgia case, where they are charged with a racketeering conspiracy to overturn Biden's victory in that state. They have pleaded not guilty there. Trump has also pleaded not guilty in the federal election-subversion case in Washington.\n\nTrump, a Republican, says all the cases are a political \"witch hunt\" to prevent him from defeating Democrat Biden in this year's presidential rematch.\n\nAnother defendant whose name is redacted is Trump lawyer Christina Bobb, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung confirmed, calling the Arizona indictment \"another example of Democrats' weaponization of the legal system.\"\n\n\"Christina Bobb is a former Marine Corps officer, who served our nation and the President with distinction. The Democrat platform for 2024: if you can't beat them, try to throw them in jail,\" Cheung said.\n\nGiuliani spokesperson Goodman also called the Arizona indictment an example of \"the continued weaponization of our justice system,\" saying it \"should concern every American as it does permanent, irrevocable harm to the country.\"\n\n\"Mayor Rudy Giuliani - one of the most effective prosecutors in American history who took down the Mafia, cleaned up the streets of New York and locked up corrupt public officials - is proud to stand up for the countless Americans who raised legitimate concerns surrounding the 2020 US Presidential Election,\" Goodman said.\n\nThe indictment alleges the defendants pressured the Maricopa Board of Supervisors, the Arizona Legislature and then-Governor Doug Ducey to change the election results.\n\nFALSE ELECTORS SCHEME IN SEVERAL STATES\n\nUS presidents are chosen by electors from each state, who cast votes in the Electoral College, where votes are allotted based on each state's population.\n\nIn Arizona and almost all other states, the winner of the state's popular vote receives all of that state's electoral votes. To win the presidency a candidate needs 270 electoral votes - a majority of total 538.\n\nArizona has 11 electoral votes, and the 11 defendants named in the indictment would correspond to those people who purported to be electors for Trump.\n\nArizona is one of seven states where Biden won but Trump allies sought to award the electoral votes to Trump. Many of the races were close. Arizona was decided by little more than 10,000 votes or 0.3% of the ballots cast.\n\nThe charges include fraud, forgery and conspiracy, three classes of felony that with a conviction could have sentences ranging from 6 months to more than 12 years in prison.\n\nArizona is the fourth US state where participants in the elector scheme have faced criminal charges.\n\nThree people who held themselves out as Trump electors in Georgia were charged alongside Trump in the sweeping racketeering case brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.\n\nSixteen people who falsely claimed to be legitimate Trump electors in Michigan were indicted in July 2023 by state Attorney General Dana Nessel. Authorities in Nevada charged six people, including the state Republican chair, with taking part in the scheme.\n\nThe so-called fake elector plan also plays a prominent role in the federal case against Trump brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith, accusing the former president of a multi-part scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump will press his claim that he should be immune from those charges at the US Supreme Court on Thursday.\n\nBesides Meadows, Giuliani and Bobb, the other defendants whose names were redacted were three attorneys and the director of election day operations for the Trump campaign. The unindicted co-conspirators also include were two former members of the Arizona legislature and two former attorneys for the Trump campaign.", "source": {"uri": "tbsnews.net", "dataType": "news",

Seven others were indicted but had their names redacted.\n\nThose seven include former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and former Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman.\n\nNPR was able to identify them based on information included in the indictment, such as one defendant being \"often identified as 'the Mayor.' \" Giuliani was a mayor of New York City.\n\nThe identities of other defendants need to be confirmed. According to a news release from Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, \"[a]n unredacted version of the indictment will be made available after all defendants have been served.\"\n\nThe indictment includes nine criminal counts, including felony fraud, forgery and conspiracy.\n\n\"The people of Arizona elected President Biden,\" Mayes says in a video statement. \"Unwilling to accept this fact, the defendants charged by the state grand jury allegedly schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency.\"\n\nShe adds: \"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined. It's too important.\"\n\nThe indictment also cites five unindicted co-conspirators, including \"a former president of the United States who spread false claims of election fraud following the 2020 election\" -- Trump -- and former members of the Arizona Legislature.\n\nThe indictment, which Mayes released Wednesday, makes Arizona the fourth state where charges have been brought against individuals involved in so-called \"fake elector\" schemes that sought to undermine Biden's victory over Trump.\n\nProsecutors in Georgia, Michigan and Nevada have already charged individuals accused of participating in similar schemes in those states. In another swing state, Wisconsin, fake electors admitted to their roles as part of civil settlements.\n\nThe slate of fake electors charged in Arizona includes several influential Republicans, including sitting state Sens. Jake Hoffman and Anthony Kern. Former Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward, former party Executive Director Greg Safsten and RNC Committeeman Tyler Bowyer also signed documents transmitted to the federal government. Bowyer is also an executive with Turning Point USA, an Arizona-based right wing advocacy group founded by Trump ally Charlie Kirk.\n\nOthers indicted are Nancy Cottle, James Lamon, Robert Montgomery, Samuel Moorhead, Lorraine Pellegrino and Michael Ward.\n\nHoffman quickly responded to the charges, saying in a statement: \"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process.\"\n\nThe indictments mark a significant step forward in an investigation that began a year ago after Mayes, a Democrat who was elected attorney general in 2022 by just 280 votes, took office in early 2023.\n\nSome Democrats criticized Mayes over the pace of that investigation, which proceeded largely behind closed doors as grand juries in other states indicted alleged participants in the fake electors scheme.\n\nBut Mayes urged patience, pointing out that she took office after many of the officials pursuing the case in other states. Her predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, did not investigate the case.\n\n\"The investigators and attorneys assigned to this case took the necessary time to thoroughly piece together the details of the events that began nearly four years ago,\" Mayes said.\n\nThere were signs the case was picking up steam in recent months, though. In December, the investigators met with former Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro, who was accused of being the head architect of the fake elector plot by the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack.\n\nChesebro pleaded guilty in Georgia to one felony count of conspiracy to commit filing false documents. He agreed to testify in that case and also met with prosecutors in Nevada. Chesebro also agreed to the civil settlement in Wisconsin, which required him to publish records and documents detailing interactions with the Trump campaign about the fake elector strategy.",

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a press release announcing the charges that those names would be made public after all of the defendants had been served with the indictment.\n\nGiuliani is among those whose names are redacted, a spokesperson for him, Ted Goodman, confirmed, criticizing the prosecution of the former New York mayor as political.\n\nAnother defendant whose name was redacted is described in the indictment as chief of staff in 2020, the position Mark Meadows held in the Trump White House at that time.\n\nRepresentatives for Meadows did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the indictment.\n\nINDICTMENT FOLLOWS GEORGIA, FEDERAL CASES\n\nTrump, Giuliani and Meadows are co-defendants in the Georgia case, where they are charged with a racketeering conspiracy to overturn Biden's victory in that state. They have pleaded not guilty there. Trump has also pleaded not guilty in the federal election-subversion case in Washington.\n\nTrump, a Republican, says all the cases are a political \"witch hunt\" to prevent him from defeating Democrat Biden in this year's presidential rematch.\n\nAnother defendant whose name is redacted is Trump lawyer Christina Bobb, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung confirmed, calling the Arizona indictment \"another example of Democrats' weaponization of the legal system.\"\n\n\"Christina Bobb is a former Marine Corps officer, who served our nation and the President with distinction. The Democrat platform for 2024: if you can't beat them, try to throw them in jail,\" Cheung said.\n\nThe indictment alleges the defendants pressured the Maricopa Board of Supervisors, the Arizona Legislature and then-Governor Doug Ducey to change the election results.\n\nFALSE ELECTORS SCHEME IN SEVERAL STATES\n\nU.S. presidents are chosen by electors from each state, who cast votes in the Electoral College, where votes are allotted based on each state's population.\n\nIn Arizona and almost all other states, the winner of the state's popular vote receives all of that state's electoral votes. To win the presidency a candidate needs 270 electoral votes - a majority of total 538.\n\nArizona has 11 electoral votes, and the 11 defendants named in the indictment would correspond to those people who purported to be electors for Trump.\n\nArizona is one of seven states where Biden won but Trump allies sought to award the electoral votes to Trump. Many of the races were close. Arizona was decided by little more than 10,000 votes or 0.3% of the ballots cast.\n\nThe charges include fraud, forgery and conspiracy, three classes of felony that with a conviction could have sentences ranging from 6 months to more than 12 years in prison.\n\nArizona is the fourth U.S. state where participants in the elector scheme have faced criminal charges.\n\nThree people who helped themselves out as Trump electors in Georgia were charged alongside Trump in the sweeping racketeering case brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.\n\nSixteen people who falsely claimed to be legitimate Trump electors in Michigan were indicted in July 2023 by state Attorney General Dana Nessel. Authorities in Nevada charged six people, including the state Republican chair, with taking part in the scheme.\n\nThe so-called fake elector plan also plays a prominent role in the federal case against Trump brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith, accusing the former president of a multi-part scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump will press his claim that he should be immune from those charges at the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday.\n\nBesides Meadows, Giuliani and Bobb, the other defendants whose names were redacted were three attorneys and the director of election day operations for the Trump campaign. The unindicted co-conspirators also included two former members of the Arizona legislature and two former attorneys for the Trump campaign.", "source": {"uri": "dtnext.in", "dataType": "news",

The indictment, reached on Tuesday and unsealed on Wednesday, stems from the attempt by Trump and his allies to pressure election officials in several states to overturn the presidential election won by Joe Biden, efforts for which Trump has been indicted in Georgia and in federal court.\n\nThe court papers list \"a former U.S. president,\" referring to Trump, as an unindicted co-conspirator. The indictment in Maricopa County Superior Court names 11 defendants and redacts the names of seven others. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a press release announcing the charges that those names would be made public after all of the defendants had been served with the indictment.\n\nGiuliani is among those whose names are redacted, a spokesperson for him, Ted Goodman, confirmed, criticizing the prosecution of the former New York mayor as political. Another defendant whose name was redacted is described in the indictment as chief of staff in 2020, the position Mark Meadows held in the Trump White House at that time.\n\nRepresentatives for Meadows did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the indictment. INDICTMENT FOLLOWS GEORGIA, FEDERAL CASES\n\nTrump, Giuliani and Meadows are co-defendants in the Georgia case, where they are charged with a racketeering conspiracy to overturn Biden's victory in that state. They have pleaded not guilty there. Trump has also pleaded not guilty in the federal election-subversion case in Washington. Trump, a Republican, says all the cases are a political \"witch hunt\" to prevent him from defeating Democrat Biden in this year's presidential rematch.\n\nAnother defendant whose name is redacted is Trump lawyer Christina Bobb, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung confirmed, calling the Arizona indictment \"another example of Democrats' weaponization of the legal system.\" \"Christina Bobb is a former Marine Corps officer, who served our nation and the President with distinction. The Democrat platform for 2024: if you can't beat them, try to throw them in jail,\" Cheung said.\n\nGiuliani spokesperson Goodman also called the Arizona indictment an example of \"the continued weaponization of our justice system,\" saying it \"should concern every American as it does permanent, irrevocable harm to the country.\" \"Mayor Rudy Giuliani - one of the most effective prosecutors in American history who took down the Mafia, cleaned up the streets of New York and locked up corrupt public officials - is proud to stand up for the countless Americans who raised legitimate concerns surrounding the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election,\" Goodman said.\n\nThe indictment alleges the defendants pressured the Maricopa Board of Supervisors, the Arizona Legislature and then-Governor Doug Ducey to change the election results. FALSE ELECTORS SCHEME IN SEVERAL STATES\n\nU.S. presidents are chosen by electors from each state, who cast votes in the Electoral College, where votes are allotted based on each state's population. In Arizona and almost all other states, the winner of the state's popular vote receives all of that state's electoral votes. To win the presidency a candidate needs 270 electoral votes - a majority of total 538.\n\nArizona has 11 electoral votes, and the 11 defendants named in the indictment would correspond to those people who purported to be electors for Trump. Arizona is one of seven states where Biden won but Trump allies sought to award the electoral votes to Trump. Many of the races were close. Arizona was decided by little more than 10,000 votes or 0.3% of the ballots cast.\n\nThe charges include fraud, forgery and conspiracy, three classes of felony that with a conviction could have sentences ranging from 6 months to more than 12 years in prison. Arizona is the fourth U.S. state where participants in the elector scheme have faced criminal charges.\n\nThree people who held themselves out as Trump electors in Georgia were charged alongside Trump in the sweeping racketeering case brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. Sixteen people who falsely claimed to be legitimate Trump electors in Michigan were indicted in July 2023 by state Attorney General Dana Nessel. Authorities in Nevada charged six people, including the state Republican chair, with taking part in the scheme.\n\nThe so-called fake elector plan also plays a prominent role in the federal case against Trump brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith, accusing the former president of a multi-part scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump will press his claim that he should be immune from those charges at the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday. Besides Meadows, Giuliani and Bobb, the other defendants whose names were redacted were three attorneys and the director of election day operations for the Trump campaign. The unindicted co-conspirators also include were two former members of the Arizona legislature and two former attorneys for the Trump campaign.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff

The names of several other indicted defendants remain redacted, Mayes said in a statement Wednesday, until those people have been served.\n\n\"A state grand jury made up of everyday regular Arizonans, has now handed down felony indictments for all 11 Republican electors as well as several others connected to this scheme,\" Mayes said. \"These are serious indictments, but this is the first hurdle the state must pass in our constitutional criminal justice system. We intend to prove these crimes were committed beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nWhile Trump is not among those charged in Arizona, the details in the indictment suggest he is \"Unindicted Coconspirator 1.\"\n\nThe indictment in Arizona includes nine counts, from conspiracy and forgery to engaging in fraudulent schemes. Because the indictment remains partially redacted, it is unclear what charges Trump allies such as Meadows, Epshteyn and Giuliani face.\n\n\"In Arizona, and the United States, the people elected Joseph Biden as President on November 3, 2020,\" the indictment reads. \"Unwilling to accept this fact, Defendants and unindicted coconspirators schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency to keep Unindicted Coconspirator 1 in office against the will of Arizona's voters.\"\n\nThe scheme, according to the indictment, called for the fake electors to fraudulently vote for Trump, \"falsely claiming to be the duly elected and qualified Electors for President and Vice President of the United States from the State of Arizona.\"\n\n\"Defendants deceived the citizens of Arizona by falsely claiming that those votes were contingent only on a legal challenge that would change the outcome of the election,\" the indictment continues. \"In reality, Defendants intended that their false votes for Trump-Pence would encourage Pence to reject the Biden-Harris votes on January 6, 2021, regardless of the outcome of the legal challenge.\"\n\nThis scheme failed on January 6, 2021, when then-Vice President Mike Pence accepted the electoral votes for Joe Biden, the indictment says.\n\nThe case in Arizona adds scrutiny to actions taken on Trump's behalf after the last election. It also comes as Trump's legal team will argue before the Supreme Court Thursday that he's immune from prosecution in the federal election interference case - at the same time Trump is on trial in New York related to hush money paid to cover up an alleged affair before the 2016 election.\n\nEpshteyn has not been charged before in connection with 2020 post-election efforts to reverse Trump's loss. Serving as a legal adviser to Trump, Epshteyn speaks to the former president regularly, and during certain stretches, multiple times a day. He is widely considered one of Trump's most ferociously loyal advisers, since joining Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\nEpshteyn accompanied Trump to New York after his criminal indictment and sat with him in the courtroom while he was arraigned. He was also seen traveling with Trump to arraignments in both Georgia and Washington, DC. While he does not represent him in any of his current legal cases, Epshteyn has played a critical role in the hiring of many of Trump's lawyers as well as in some of their departures.\n\nAfter withdrawing from representing Trump in the special counsel's investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents, Timothy Parlatore, who was brought on by Epshteyn, said differences with Epshteyn spurred his departure.\n\n\"He did everything he could do to try to block us,\" Parlatore said on CNN.\n\nOthers in Trump's orbit have long said that Epshteyn's brash behavior could be a liability for Trump.\n\nWhile the names of several defendants in the Arizona case remain redacted because they have not yet been served, the indictment does describe their roles in the alleged plot.\n\nOther individuals charged in the Arizona indictment but whose names have been redacted, the source familiar with the investigation told CNN, include Trump allies Mike Roman, a 2020 campaign official; Trump campaign lawyer Jenna Ellis; and conservative attorney John Eastman.\n\nRoman, Ellis and Eastman also were charged in the election subversion case in Georgia, as were Meadows and Giuliani. Ellis pleaded guilty to one charge in the Georgia case. The others have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMeadows, whose name is redacted in the indictment but is listed as Trump's chief of staff in 2020, \"worked with members of the Trump Campaign to coordinate and implement the false Republican electors' votes in Arizona and six other states,\" the indictment says, and \"was involved in the many efforts to keep (Trump) in power despite his defeat at the polls.\"\n\nThe individual who CNN has identified as Giuliani is described as spreading false claims of voter fraud across the country after the 2020 election, falsely claiming Arizona officials \"made no effort to find out\" if the vote was accurate, and encouraging \"Republican electors in Arizona and in six other contested states to vote for Trump-Pence on December 14, 2020,\" the indictment says.\n\nOther unnamed defendants allegedly worked to overthrow the 2020 election results by encouraging Pence to reject or delay the certification of the electoral vote on January 6, spreading false claims of voter fraud, encouraging the fake electors and working to implement the fake electors scheme in Arizona.\n\nEastman's attorney Charles Burnham told CNN in a statement that his client is innocent of any criminal conduct.\n\n\"The phenomenon of partisan lawfare grows more troubling by the day. Professor Eastman is innocent of criminal conduct in Arizona or any other place and will fight these charges as he has all the other unjust accusations leveled against him,\" Burnham said.\n\nArizona state Sen. Jake Hoffman, one of the fake electors charged in the indictment, released a statement on X following the indictment.\n\n\"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this disgusting political persecution by the judicial process,\" Hoffman wrote.\n\nThe Republican Party of Arizona also slammed the indictments in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\"Today's indictments by Attorney General Kris Mayes represent a blatant and unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial power, aimed solely at distracting the public from the critical policy debates our country should be focusing on as we approach the 2024 election,\" the statement said.\n\nDemocratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs told CNN's Abby Phillip Wednesday that she hoped to see those indicted held accountable.\n\n\"As Secretary of State I oversaw free, fair, secure elections in Arizona and defended the votes of millions of Arizonans,\" Hobbs said on \"NewsNight.\" \"I am confident that Attorney General Mayes conducted a fair and impartial investigation and grand jury process, and now the justice system will do its job.\"\n\nThe Arizona case is the latest state-level prosecution aimed at schemes to upend Biden's electoral victory. Prosecutors in Michigan, Georgia and Nevada also have brought criminal charges against some of the people who signed on as fake electors in those states. Investigators in Wisconsin are conducting a similar probe.\n\nA grand jury empaneled in Maricopa County, Arizona, to investigate efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the state met this week before Mayes announced the charges.\n\nCNN previously reported that Arizona prosecutors had issued a series of grand jury subpoenas to people connected to Trump's campaign and several individuals who served as fake electors from that state - a sign the probe was accelerating ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nSome of the fake electors who were ultimately charged in Arizona recently appeared before the grand jury and cited their Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination, sources familiar with the probe told CNN.\n\nMayes initially focused her investigation on the 11 fake electors from Arizona and those who helped organize them, but the sources recently told CNN she also was looking into individuals tied to the former president's national campaign.\n\n\"We conducted a thorough and professional investigation over the past 13 months into the fake electoral scheme in our state,\" Mayes said Wednesday. \"I understand for some of you today didn't come fast enough. And I know I'll be criticized by others for conducting this investigation at all. But as I've stated before, and will say here again today, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined.\"\n\nSeveral state-level officials from Arizona told the House Select Committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot that Trump and his allies tried to pressure them to decertify the state's election results.\n\nThe fake electors for Trump convened at the state Republican Party headquarters in Phoenix on December 14, 2020. They broadcast themselves preparing to sign the documents, allegedly provided by a Trump campaign attorney, claiming that they were the legitimate representatives of the state's electoral votes.\n\nBy that time, Trump's loss in the state - by fewer than 11,000 votes - had already been certified by its Republican governor, affirming that Biden won Arizona in the 2020 presidential election. But in the weeks that followed, some of the fake electors continued to push for Pence to reject the legitimate Democratic slate of electors.\n\nThe fake elector scheme and pressure campaign on Pence are focal points of special counsel Jack Smith's federal indictment of Trump. -- CNN", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Saudi Gazette"}, "authors": [],

Arizona attorney-general Kris Mayes said in a press release announcing the charges that those names would be made public after all of the defendants had been served with the indictment.\n\nGiuliani is among those whose names are redacted, a spokesperson for him, Ted Goodman, confirmed, criticising the prosecution of the former New York mayor as political.\n\nAnother defendant whose name was redacted is described in the indictment as chief of staff in 2020, the position Mark Meadows held in the Trump White House at that time.\n\nRepresentatives for Meadows did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the indictment.\n\nINDICTMENT FOLLOWS GEORGIA, FEDERAL CASES\n\nTrump, Giuliani and Meadows are co-defendants in the Georgia case, where they are charged with a racketeering conspiracy to overturn Biden's victory in that state. They have pleaded not guilty there. Trump has also pleaded not guilty in the federal election-subversion case in Washington.\n\nTrump, a Republican, says all the cases are a political \"witch hunt\" to prevent him from defeating Democrat Biden in this year's presidential rematch.\n\nAnother defendant whose name is redacted is Trump lawyer Christina Bobb, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung confirmed, calling the Arizona indictment \"another example of Democrats' weaponisation of the legal system\".\n\n\"Christina Bobb is a former Marine Corps officer, who served our nation and the president with distinction. The Democrat platform for 2024: if you can't beat them, try to throw them in jail,\" Cheung said.\n\nGiuliani spokesperson Goodman also called the Arizona indictment an example of \"the continued weaponisation of our justice system,\" saying it \"should concern every American as it does permanent, irrevocable harm to the country.\"\n\n\"Mayor Rudy Giuliani -- one of the most effective prosecutors in American history who took down the Mafia, cleaned up the streets of New York and locked up corrupt public officials -- is proud to stand up for the countless Americans who raised legitimate concerns surrounding the 2020 US presidential election,\" Goodman said.\n\nThe indictment alleges the defendants pressured the Maricopa Board of Supervisors, the Arizona Legislature and then-governor Doug Ducey to change the election results.\n\nFALSE ELECTORS SCHEME IN SEVERAL STATES\n\nUS presidents are chosen by electors from each state, who cast votes in the Electoral College, where votes are allotted based on each state's population.\n\nIn Arizona and almost all other states, the winner of the state's popular vote receives all of that state's electoral votes. To win the presidency a candidate needs 270 electoral votes -- a majority of total 538.\n\nArizona has 11 electoral votes, and the 11 defendants named in the indictment would correspond to those people who purported to be electors for Trump.\n\nArizona is one of seven states where Biden won but Trump allies sought to award the electoral votes to Trump. Many of the races were close. Arizona was decided by little more than 10,000 votes or 0.3% of the ballots cast.\n\nThe charges include fraud, forgery and conspiracy, three classes of felony that with a conviction could have sentences ranging from six months to more than 12 years in prison.\n\nArizona is the fourth US state where participants in the elector scheme have faced criminal charges.\n\nThree people who held themselves out as Trump electors in Georgia were charged alongside Trump in the sweeping racketeering case brought by Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis.\n\nSixteen people who falsely claimed to be legitimate Trump electors in Michigan were indicted in July 2023 by state attorney-general Dana Nessel. Authorities in Nevada charged six people, including the state Republican chair, with taking part in the scheme.\n\nThe so-called fake elector plan also plays a prominent role in the federal case against Trump brought by special counsel Jack Smith, accusing the former president of a multi-part scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump will press his claim that he should be immune from those charges at the US Supreme Court on Thursday.\n\nBesides Meadows, Giuliani and Bobb, the other defendants whose names were redacted were three attorneys and the director of election day operations for the Trump campaign. The unindicted co-conspirators also include were two former members of the Arizona legislature and two former attorneys for the Trump campaign.", "source": {"uri": "timeslive.co.za", "dataType":

Again! In Arizona This Time!", "body": "Arizona state Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, won her election in 2022 by 280 votes. Elections matter.\n\nA grand jury in Arizona just indicted 18 people -- 11 fake electors and seven Trump associates -- for their efforts to overturn and steal the 2020 election in that state from its rightful winner Joseph Robinette Biden, the Democrat. Donald Trump is not indicted, not yet anyway, though he is referred to throughout as an unindicted co-conspirator. He could always be indicted later. We imagine he might be.\n\nHis felony indictment schedule is just kind of busy right now.\n\nSaid Mayes:\n\n\"I understand for some of you today didn't come fast enough, and I know I'll be criticized by others for conducting this investigation at all,\" [Mayes] said in a recorded statement. \"But as I have stated before and will say here again today, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined. It's too important.\"\n\nThe counts: Conspiracy, Fraudulent Schemes And Artifices, Fraudulent Schemes and Practices, and multiple counts of forgery.\n\nThe 11 fake electors aren't names you might immediately know, except for insane batshit chemtrail Kelli Ward, who used to run the Arizona GOP. She is all over this indictment, one of the names that appears most frequently. Her husband Michael is one of the indicted fake electors. Tyler Bowyer, the CEO of Turning Point USA, is one of them. Others who were high-ranking Republican Party officials in Arizona at the time. A couple Arizona state senators. Other lunatics.\n\nThe New York Times notes that now, between Georgia, Nevada, Michigan, and Arizona, 35 of the fake electors are criminally charged.\n\nThe seven Trump associates in the Arizona indictment are mostly all your old favorites from past seasons, returning for new indictments and eventual felony convictions. Maybe some new plea deals.\n\nRudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, Jenna Ellis, John Eastman, Mike Roman! You know them from Trump's \"Let's Overthrow America: Georgia Edition\" reality show. (Ellis is currently on Twitter bellyaching about people referring to her in these stories as a convicted felon. She only PLEADED GUILTY to a felony. Totally different, according to her homeschooled Bible Jesus law school education.)\n\nEastman is so mad, via his lawyer Charles Burnham:\n\n\"The phenomenon of partisan lawfare grows more troubling by the day. Professor Eastman is innocent of criminal conduct in Arizona or any other place and will fight these charges as he has all the other unjust accusations leveled against him.\"\n\nCry more. And tell your client to go get fucking disbarred.\n\nBoris Epshteyn, longtime Trump weirdo associate/strategist/lawyer, was an unindicted co-conspirator in Georgia, but now he's fully indicted in Arizona.\n\nChristina Bobb, the former OAN idiot who left that job to become an official Trump idiot, gets her first indictment. It's funny because Bobb is the new \"election integrity\" counsel at Lara Trump's \"This is not your father's RNC, because it's Eric's father's RNC now,\" because we guess she had the \"election integrity\" skillset the Trumps were looking for.\n\nThe indictment tells a story that's familiar by now, just insert \"Arizona\" where we're used to seeing \"Georgia\" or more recently \"Michigan.\" Slates of fake electors, who conspired with and acted at the direction of Trump and his associates, scheming to submit themselves to Mike Pence as the real deal, and thus award the state's electoral votes fraudulently to Trump. Fake elector votes. Fake fraud allegations.\n\nDefendants intended that their false votes for Trump-Pence would encourage Pence to reject the Biden-Harris votes on January 6, 2021, regardless of the outcome of the legal challenge. When combined with the six other States where Republican electors sent in uncertified votes for Trump-Pence, Defendants wanted Pence to either declare Unindicted Coconspirator 1 the winner of the election, delay the proceeding and have individual state legislatures determine their electors, or have Congress resolve any claimed uncertainty about the validity of election results in Arizona and six other states in Unindicted Coconspirator1's favor. The scheme failed when Vice President Michael Pence accepted all certified Biden-Harris votes on January 6, 2021.\n\nAKA the day Mike Pence didn't have the courage.\n\nThe indictment details how the fake electors themselves acted, and how each Trump associate personally acted in Arizona specifically to further the crime. (The Trump associates are still officially redacted in the indictment, but they were easy enough for the news to figure out.)\n\nThere are a total of five as-yet unindicted coconspirators, including Trump. Here's a bit about who they likely are. The fourth one sounds a lot like that idiot Trump lawyer Kenneth Chesebro, who was indicted in Georgia for his participation, which included his super-secret plan to overturn the election. Since then he's been on a spree of a different kind, it seems, cooperating in Michigan and Nevada, and it appears, now, in Arizona.\n\nDonald Trump is absolutely certainly not cooperating, so that's not why he's (currently) an unindicted coconspirator. And we ain't nowhere NEAR the Arizona statute of limitations for what he did. But we'll be patient to see how this all shakes out and when/if Trump gets some new indictments, whenever Mayes sees fit.\n\nAnyway, it's a 58-page read, if you need to go have an extended toilet and are out of word search puzzles.\n\nWe will leave you with this fun email Mueller She Wrote tweeted in 2022, as they looked through incriminating emails obtained by the New York Times in this very scheme. A Trump lawyer named Jack Wilenchik -- who appears to be Unindicted Coconspirator #5, who organized the fake electors -- wrote to Boris Epshteyn to say hey bro, we proooooobably should not refer to these fake electors as fake electors. Let's say \"alternative.\" Kelli Ward agrees. She's got ideas for the scheme too!\n\n\"PPS -- 'alternative' votes is probably a better term than 'fake' votes.\" EMOJI!\n\nI have profiles those other places but I think I forgot how to log on.",

It shows seven other defendants whose names were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the indictment.\n\nOne is described as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, a description that clearly describes Giuliani. Another is described as Trump's \"chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nPeople are also reading...

A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nNone of the 11 responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press on Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nRead more: National Arizona indicts 18 in case over 2020 election in Arizona, including Giuliani and Meadows By JACQUES BILLEAUD and JOSH KELETY - Associated Press 5 takeaways from the Jan. 6 report 1.

It alleges the slate of Republicans sometimes known as fake electors engaged in a conspiracy aimed at \"preventing the lawful transfer of the presidency of the United States, keeping President Donald J. Trump in office against the will of Arizona voters, and depriving Arizona voters of their right to vote and have their votes counted.\"\n\nThe names of seven other individuals are redacted from the grand jury indictment, suggesting a broader scope of Mayes' case. Those people may not have yet been served notice of the allegations against them.\n\nThe people now facing charges include powerful and influential GOP figures: a former Republican Party of Arizona chairman; a Republican national committeeman and executive at Turning Point USA and its political arm; and two sitting state senators -- one of whom retains immense political power at the Arizona Capitol.\n\nThe grand jury's decision could levy criminal consequences for an unprecedented plot to subvert the will of Arizona voters, one that has ruptured faith in elections and fueled election conspiracies that have taken root in GOP politics in the state. It comes as Mayes has promised to aggressively combat election conspiracies, offering a sharp contrast to her predecessor.\n\nThe grand jury, a panel of Arizonans who met in secret, in recent weeks heard evidence presented by Mayes' prosecutors and ultimately decided there was enough to substantiate criminal charges.\n\nThe 11 electors are each charged with nine criminal counts, including conspiracy, fraudulent schemes and artifices, fraudulent schemes and practices, and six counts of forgery. Their lawyers, or the named defendants themselves, could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nThe fake electors in Arizona are:\n\nThe electors who claimed Trump won\n\nMayes has been under immense political pressure to bring a case. Similar slates of electors in Michigan, Georgia and Nevada have already been charged for their role in the sweeping effort to keep Trump in power.\n\nAnd a federal grand jury last year brought charges against Trump himself, alleging the former president conspired with others to disenfranchise voters and subvert Biden's win. Trump is also facing charges in the Georgia case, which alleges he led a criminal enterprise and relies on a state law normally reserved for prosecuting mobsters.\n\nSeveral of the Arizona electors have previously claimed they were merely offering Congress a backup plan, though nothing in the documents they sent to Congress and the National Archives backs up that assertion. Similar groups of electors in other states did include conditional language, but none was included in Arizona.\n\nBiden carried Arizona in November 2020 by a 10,457 vote margin with nearly 3.4 million votes cast. It was Biden's smallest margin of victory in any state, and only the second time in 70 years that a Democrat won the state.\n\nAt the time, Trump had spent months furthering doubt about the election result. In the days after his loss, he and his aides unleashed a pressure campaign on GOP leaders in Arizona and other states.\n\nThey found some support in Arizona, while others rebuffed the president's unfounded claims. That split in loyalties continues to divide the state's Republican Party and grassroots support, threatening the party's ability to win elections in the swing state.\n\nArizona actually had two different groups of illegitimate GOP electors. The indictment made public on Wednesday names the slate that included more prominent Republican figures, and some of whose involvement has already been well established by the Congressional committee investigating the violent break-in at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThose 11 GOP electors met at the Arizona Republican headquarters in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, posting videos on social media of themselves casting their votes for Trump. They signed paperwork to submit to Congress claiming they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors.\n\nBut that was a lie.\n\nThe same day, electors for Biden met to cast their votes in the Electoral College confirming the Democrat's win. They met at an undisclosed location, citing security concerns tied to Trump's refusal to accept his loss.\n\nIt was a procedural process that, prior to 2020, was a formality often overlooked by most Americans.\n\nInvestigation begins under a new attorney general in 2023\n\nMayes confirmed more than one year ago, in March 2023, that her office would investigate Arizona's electors who falsely claimed to be legitimate. A former Republican who left the party in 2019 citing the growth of Trumpism and what she saw as shrinking room for moderates in the party, Mayes had been in office for two months. She won her election in November 2022 by 280 votes -- one of the narrowest margins in state history.\n\nThat race and others on the ballot two years ago put to the test Arizonans' appetite for electing those who deny legitimate election results.\n\nMayes pledged to protect election workers and defend elections, where her Republican predecessor Mark Brnovich had tried to straddle election denialism. She promised a purposeful shift in focus within the office, which amounts to the state's largest law firm, and condemned Brnovich for sitting on a report for over a year that said his office \"did not uncover any criminality or fraud.\"\n\nHer investigation at first focused on the 11 electors, but a trickle of information that has leaked out from the grand jury proceedings over the past several weeks has suggested Mayes cast a wider net.\n\nTwo Arizona congressmen who were among the loudest voices in support of Trump's \"Stop the Steal\" campaign, Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar, received subpoenas.\n\nMayes' office turned to Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro for information. Chesebro, who also aided prosecutors in Georgia (after he was indicted) and Nevada, wrote memorandums outlining the strategy to send alternate electors to Congress.\n\nSending the documents from Trump electors \"can prevent Biden from amassing 270 electoral votes on January 6, and force the Members of Congress, the media, and the American people to focus on the substantive evidence of illegal election and counting activities in the six contested States,\" one memo from Dec. 6, 2020, reads. The memo suggests states that undertook the plan should also spread \"messaging that presents this as a routine measure.\"\n\nIn fact, the effort was anything but routine -- it was criminal, the grand jury said.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stacey_barchenger@azcentral.com", "name": "Stacey Barchenger", "type": "author",

Those individuals appear to include Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman, former chief of staff Mark Meadows, lawyers Jenna Ellis and Christina Bobb, and Trump advisers Boris Epshteyn and Michael Roman.\n\nTrump, who is asking voters to return him to the White House this year, is \"unindicted coconspirator 1,\" according to the indictment.\n\nThe Arizonans now facing charges include powerful and influential GOP figures: a former Republican Party of Arizona chair; a Republican national committeeman and executive at Turning Point USA and its political arm; and two sitting state senators -- one of whom retains immense political power at the Arizona Capitol.\n\nThe grand jury's decision could levy criminal consequences for an unprecedented plot to subvert the will of Arizona voters, one that has ruptured faith in elections and fueled conspiracies that have taken root in GOP politics in the state.

Each is a felony count and a conviction could mean prison time, though Arizona law allows some sentences to be reduced for people with no criminal history.\n\nMany of the electors or their attorneys could not be reached by The Arizona Republic late Wednesday to comment on the indictment.\n\nHoffman revived his previous statements claiming Mayes' investigation \"weaponized the once respected\" office.\n\n\"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process,\" Hoffman said in the statement. The statement directs reporters to contact Dhillon Law Group, the namesake firm of Harmeet Dhillon that has represented Trump and his aides in other states, for more information.\n\nLamon's lawyer, Dennis Wilenchik, said his client will be acquitted -- and they look forward to suing Mayes' office for damages over the accusations.\n\n\"It's a politically motivated prosecution,\" Wilenchik said. \"I can see no crime in any of it.\"\n\nWilenchik also represents one of two Republican Cochise County supervisors who are facing criminal charges brought by Mayes' office in another case.

Trump is one of those five.\n\nSending the documents from Trump electors \"can prevent Biden from amassing 270 electoral votes on January 6, and force the Members of Congress, the media, and the American people to focus on the substantive evidence of illegal election and counting activities in the six contested States,\" one memo from Dec. 6, 2020, reads. The memo suggests states that undertook the plan should also spread \"messaging that presents this as a routine measure.\"\n\nIn fact, the effort was anything but routine -- it was criminal, the grand

Ward and her husband are two of 11 Republicans in Arizona who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring Donald Trump had beaten Joe Biden in the state during the 2020 presidential election were charged Wednesday, April 24, 2024, with conspiracy, fraud and forgery, marking the fourth state to bring charges against \"fake electors.\"\n\nBy JACQUES BILLEAUD and JOSH KELETY - Associated Press\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- An Arizona grand jury has indicted former Donald Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows and lawyer Rudy Giuliani along with 16 others in an election interference case.\n\nThe indictment released Wednesday names 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring that Donald Trump beat Joe Biden in Arizona in the 2020 presidential election. It shows seven other defendants whose names were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.\n\nThe Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the indictment.\n\nOne is described as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud, a description that clearly describes Giuliani. Another is described as Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nPeople are also reading...

A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nIn another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nNone of the 11 responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press on Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nAssociated Press writers Jonathan J.

Some Are Notably Missing.", "body": "A grand jury in Arizona has returned an indictment for several close associates of former President Donald Trump as well as lower-level individuals who served as false electors in Arizona during the 2020 presidential election. The Office of Attorney General Kris Mayes has charged all of them with a conspiracy under Arizona state law to overturn the popular vote in the state.\n\nThe list of indicted co-defendants includes seven national figures: Mark Meadows, Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, Boris Epshteyn, Mike Roman, Jenna Ellis, and Christina Bobb.\n\nThe 11 other co-defendants are all the false electors in the 2020 election. That list notably includes Kelli Ward, who served as the chair of the Arizona Republican Party during the 2020 presidential election.\n\nNotably, like Georgia, criminal trials in Arizona can be publicly broadcast.\n\nThe two alter egos are Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Trump's absence from the indicted co-defendants list is all the more puzzling since Trump is identifiable as \"Unindicted Coconspirator 1\" in the attorney general's court filings. Coincidentally, on Wednesday, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel's office testified in that state's court that Trump, Meadows, and Giuliani are \"unindicted co-conspirators\" in the Michigan state prosecution of false electors.\n\nA great deal of evidence shows that Meadows and Giuliani helped lead the multipronged efforts to overturn the election, acting on behalf of Trump.\n\nThe federal indictment of Trump, for example, refers to Giuliani as \"Co-Conspirator 1,\" including for his allegedly helping orchestrate -- on behalf of Trump -- the false electors scheme across the seven swing states, including Arizona. The federal indictment also states that Trump worked directly with Giuliani in pressuring Arizona state officials to overturn the popular vote, including calling the Republican Speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives Rusty Bowers, in which they \"made knowingly false claims of election fraud aimed at interfering with the ascertainment of and voting by Arizona's electors.\"\n\nThe Jan. 6 House Select Committee final report has the greatest details of Meadows' deep involvement in the false electors scheme on behalf of Trump. For Meadows, indicted in Georgia, his own court filings in that state claim -- or admit -- that he was acting in service of the then president.\n\nOne can only speculate as to why Trump might be excluded from but the other two men included in the Arizona indictment. One reason might have to do with direct evidence for Meadows and Giuliani that is lacking for Trump -- especially as the former president acted in part through them as intermediaries and conduits. Another reason may be the exercise of \"prosecutorial discretion.\" Yet another could be that prosecutors submitted the question to the jury but an insufficient number of jurors approved of charging the former president. Or it could be some other reason entirely.\n\nTuesday's indictment may not be the final word on whether Trump will be indicted in Arizona. Another shoe may have yet to drop. But the current situation cries out for an explanation of how Trump's two key agents -- Giuliani and Meadows -- are included in the list of indicted individuals but Trump himself is not.\n\nKenneth Chesebro has properly been called \"a chief architect\" of the false electors scheme. He is identifiable as Co-Conspirator 5 in the federal indictment of Trump, and he has pleaded guilty in the prosecution in Fulton County, Georgia.\n\nChesebro has so far escaped prosecution in other states where false electors are under indictment. His protection from prosecution appears to be on the basis that he \"cooperated\" with those investigations. However, recent investigative reporting by CNN and others has revealed that Chesebro apparently made false statements to state prosecutors in Michigan and Nevada while feigning cooperation with their respective criminal investigations of false electors. (See also this analysis of flaws with his proffer agreement in Georgia.)\n\nThat all is now fairly well known to close observers of these cases. Why, then, the Arizona indictment excludes Chesebro is a mystery. Prosecutors in Michigan and Nevada have decided not to seek indictments of anyone at the national level and instead focused only on false electors in their states. But in Arizona that's different, as the prosecutors have now charged several out-of-state individuals who were involved in the nationally coordinated effort to overturn the election results. But not Chesebro. Earlier reports were that Chesebro was \"cooperating\" with the Arizona prosecutors, and that may explain it.\n\nTwo new figures have been added to the list of Trump's associates now under indictment for alleged efforts to overturn the presidential election: Boris Epshteyn and Christina Bobb.\n\nIn the federal indictment, it appears that Epshteyn may be unindicted \"Co-Conspirator 6\" (see this analysis by the New York Times' Maggie Haberman, Jonathan Swan, and Luke Broadwater). In the Fulton County indictment, previous analysis at Just Security identified Epshteyn as most likely one of the unindicted co-conspirators (\"Individual 3\").\n\nCriminal defendants in the Arizona 2020 election interference prosecution, as well as elsewhere, like Fulton County, Georgia, may have reasons to flip and cooperate with prosecutors due to the prospect of a Trump presidency.\n\nA president cannot issue pardons for state crimes, and his or her control over the Department of Justice does not extend to state law enforcement authorities. The state-level prosecutions of false electors and other Trump associates -- in Arizona and elsewhere -- will accordingly proceed whether or not Trump wins election. But he himself has a high likelihood of being deemed immune (by the Supreme Court if it comes to that) from state and local criminal prosecutions while in office. In other words, co-defendants and co-conspirators may be left holding the bag. That dawning reality may create incentives for some of these individuals to cooperate with law enforcement authorities sooner than later.", "source": {"uri": "slate.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Their enablers and supporters insist they were merely a backup plan, casting Arizona's electoral votes for Trump in the event that lawsuits challenging the election were successful.\n\nPayback?Fake elector uses his office to investigate Mayes\n\nThat might actually work if we were in Pennsylvania or New Mexico, where the Trump electors added that caveat to the official certifications they sent to Congress and the National Archives.\n\nIn New Mexico, the Trump electors signed \"on the understanding that it might later be determined that [they] are the duly elected and qualified Electors.\"\n\nIn Pennsylvania, they said their votes for Trump should count only \"if, as a result of a final non-appealable court order or other proceeding prescribed by law, we are ultimately recognized as being the duly elected and qualified electors.\"\n\nBut Arizona's fake electors offered no such hedge. They signed documents simply declaring themselves \"duly elected and qualified electors\" and casting their votes for the guy who didn't win.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news",

has indicted a number of former President Donald Trump's advisers over an alleged scheme to flip his defeat in the state and overturn the 2020 election result.\n\nEx-Trump advisers Rudi Giuliani and Mark Meadows were among 18 indicted on counts including conspiracy and fraud.\n\nArizona is the fourth US state to file criminal charges in a \"fake elector\" scheme.\n\nMr Trump himself is not charged in the alleged Arizona plot.\n\nThe names of seven defendants are redacted in the indictment made public on Wednesday which does name 11 others.\n\nAlthough Mr Giuliani and Mr Meadows, Mr Trump's former chief of staff, are not named, the redacted defendants are referred to in a manner that exposes their identity.\n\nThe Arizona prosecutor's office said the redacted names would be made public after all the defendants were formally presented with the charges.\n\nThe court documents also list a \"former US president\" - believed to be Mr Trump - as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nThe list of those named includes several current and former officials, such as Kelli Ward, the former chairwoman of the Arizona Republican Party, and her husband Michael Ward.\n\nTwo serving state lawmakers - Anthony Kern and Jake Hoffman - are among those charged.\n\nMr Hoffman told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that he was innocent of the charges and victim of \"naked political persecution by the judicial process\".\n\nAn Arizona grand jury had agreed to the indictments after a year-long investigation.\n\nAnnouncing the charges on Wednesday evening, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, said in a video statement: \"I'll not allow American democracy to be undermined - it's too important.\"\n\n\"The scheme, had it succeeded, would have deprived Arizona voters of their right to their votes counted for their chosen president,\" she continued. \"It would have effectively made their right to vote meaningless.\"\n\nMr Biden won the state by 10,457 votes.\n\nThree other states have filed criminal charges against the electors accused of falsely declaring Mr Trump to have won the 2020 presidential election.\n\nNevada, Michigan and Georgia - like Arizona, all swing states in the forthcoming November election - have also charged a number of Republican officials over similar schemes.\n\nAccording to a Democratic-led congressional committee that investigated the 6 January Capitol Hill riots and Mr Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the election results, the fake electors scheme was an attempt to interfere in the Electoral College system that decides presidential elections.\n\nIt centred on an attempt to persuade Republican-controlled state legislatures in seven states to select Republican electors or not name any electors in states that Mr Biden won, according to the committee.\n\nFalsified certificates were then allegedly transferred to the US Senate in an effort to have their votes counted in the place of Arizona's real electors.", "source":

Whatever they're reasoning was, the plot to violate the law must be answered for.\"\n\nShe said if the scheme had succeeded, Arizonans would have been deprived of their right to have their vote count.\n\nThe charges include felony counts of fraud, forgery and conspiracy.\n\nThe indictment states that following the election, the 11 Republican electors, plotting with electors from other states, voted for Trump on Dec. 14, 2020, and signed a false document claiming to be the \"duly elected and qualified electors for president and vice president of the United States from the State of Arizona.\"\n\nA brief video of the meeting remains on the Facebook page of the Arizona Republican Party.\n\nThe signed false document was then filed by the Arizona Republican electors with the archivist of the United States and Congress.\n\nMayers explained the defendants lied to Arizona voters by stating their votes were contingent only on a legal challenge.\n\n\"The defendants intended the false votes for Trump and Pence would encourage Vice President Pence to reject the certified Biden-Harris electors' votes regardless of the result of any legal challenge,\" she said.\n\n\"As you will recall, none of the legal challenges filed in Arizona state and federal courts regarding the 2020 election were remotely successful.\"\n\nThe scheme came to an end on Jan. 6, 2021, when Congress certified Biden's election win and which Pence accepted.\n\nIndictments in the alleged fake elector scheme have also been filed in Michigan, Georgia and Nevada.", "source": {"uri": "sacbee.com",

Meadows, chief of staff for former President Donald Trump, was among those indicted Wednesday, April 24, 2024, in an Arizona election interference case.\n\nBy JACQUES BILLEAUD, JONATHAN J. COOPER and JOSH KELETY - Associated Press\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- An Arizona grand jury has indicted former President Donald Trump 's chief of staff Mark Meadows, lawyer Rudy Giuliani and 16 others for their roles in an attempt to overturn Trump's loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 election.\n\nThe indictment released Wednesday names 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring that Trump won Arizona in 2020. They include the former state party chair, a 2022 U.S. Senate candidate and two sitting state lawmakers, who are charged with nine counts each of conspiracy, fraud and forgery.\n\nThe identities of seven other defendants, including Giuliani and Meadows, were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the documents. They were readily identifiable based on descriptions of the defendants, however.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Heading into a likely November rematch with Biden, Trump continues to spread lies about the last election that are echoed by many of his supporters.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic state Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe indictment alludes to Giuliani as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud. Another defendant is referred to as Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nDescriptions of other unnamed defendants point to Mike Roman, who was Trump's director of Election Day operations; John Eastman, a lawyer who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election; and Christina Bobb, a lawyer who worked with Giuliani.\n\nA lawyer for Eastman, Charles Burnham, said his client is innocent. Bobb did not respond to a text message seeking comment, nor did a lawyer who is representing Roman in a case in Georgia.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment but if Meadows is named, \"it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\" Giuliani's political adviser, Ted Goodman, decried what he called \"the continued weaponization of our justice system.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump was indicted in August in federal court over efforts to cling to power after his defeat, including the fake electors scheme. The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday will hear arguments on his claim in that case that he can't be prosecuted for acts he committed while serving as president.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nThe so-called fake electors facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, past president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nIn a statement, Hoffman accused Mayes of weaponizing the attorney general's office in bringing the case but didn't directly comment on the indictment's allegations.\n\n\"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process,\" Hoffman said.\n\nNone of the others responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.\n\nAssociated Press writers Gabe Stern and Scott Sonner in Las Vegas, Kate Brumback in Atlanta and Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Anthony Kern, and Jim Lamon, who ran for the U.S. Senate in Arizona in 2022. Trump has not been charged in the Arizona fake elector scheme but is listed as \"Unindicted Coconspirator 1\" throughout the document.\n\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, condemning the charges, the Republican Party of Arizona accused Mayes' office of carrying out a \"blatant abuse of legal authority aimed to disrupt, distract, and interfere\" in the 2024 election, where Trump is the presumed GOP candidate.\n\n\"The timing of these charges -- precisely four years after the 2020 election and as President Biden seeks re-election -- is suspiciously convenient and politically motivated. This is not justice; it is pure election interference,\" the group added in a statement.\n\n\"The Arizona Republican Party condemns these actions in the strongest terms. They do nothing but undermine the trust in our state's legal processes and are clearly designed to silence dissent and weaponize the law against political opponents. We will not be deterred by this overreach. We will continue to stand for the principles of fairness and integrity that are the cornerstone of our Republic.\"\n\nAbe Hamadeh, who lost the race to become Arizona's attorney general to Mayes by 280 votes in 2022, also accused the indictment of being \"politically motivated.\"\n\n\"This politically motivated indictment is yet another glaring example of deranged Democrats openly engaging in electioneering through a weaponized justice system with one goal: take down President Donald J. Trump.\n\n\"The Biden Trials, reminiscent of Soviet-style show trials, demonstrate the top down marching orders to the rest of the radical leftists: if you can't win through legitimate means, abuse the justice system to suppress your opposition,\" Hamadeh said.\n\n\"Illegitimate Attorney General Kris Mayes and her Democrat allies are shamelessly engaging in selective prosecution and manipulating the law to suit their agenda while disregarding justice and fairness. We must stand firm against this tyranny and ensure the preservation of our nation.\"\n\nThe Arizona Young Republicans group also accused Mayers of carrying out \"one of the most despicable and egregious abuses of power in our nation's history\" following the announcement of the fake elector charges.\n\n\"We will not sit idly by while our rule of law is trampled upon to solidify one-party rule in our state and our country,\" they said.\n\nMayes' office has been contacted for comment via email outside of regular office hours.\n\nIn a video announcing the charges, Mayes said the defendants and other unindicted coconspirators allegedly attempted to \"undermine the will of Arizona's voters\" during the 2020 presidential election. Arizona, where President Joe Biden defeated Trump by just over 10,000 votes, was among seven states where Republicans are accused of acting as fake electors, allegedly signing documents falsely claiming Trump had won.\n\n\"Arizona's election was free and fair. The people of Arizona elected President Biden. Unwilling to accept this fact, the defendants charged by the state grand jury allegedly schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency,\" Mayes said. \"Whatever their reasoning was, the plot to violate the law must be answered for and I was elected to uphold the law of this state.\"\n\nIn a statement to Newsweek, Ted Goodman, a spokesperson for Giuliani, hit out at the \"continued weaponization of our justice system\" after charges were filed in Arizona.\n\n\"It's unfortunate to see so many so-called 'leaders' who are willing to eviscerate our entire justice system in their quest to take down the biggest threat to their grasp on power -- President Donald Trump and anyone willing to take on the ruling regime,\" Goodman said.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment but told the Associated Press it is a \"blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\"\n\nGiuliani and Meadows, along with Trump and Eastman, have pleaded not guilty to all charges in a racketeering indictment for alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. Former Donald Trump attorney Jenna Ellis -- mentioned above -- pleaded guilty to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings in October 2023. Trump, who has been charged as well, has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nArizona is the latest state to bring forward charges in connection with a fake elector schemes.\n\nIn July 2023, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel's office charged 16 people in connection to a fake elector plot to wrongly declare Trump the winner of the state in 2020. Each individual was accused of signing off on certificates with the false claim that Trump had won the state, which would have then been taken to Washington, D.C., and passed off as legitimate. Fifteen pleaded not guilty. Charges were dropped for one individual after a cooperation deal was reached, The Associated Press reported.\n\nSix Republicans who allegedly submitted certificates to Congress falsely declaring Trump the winner of Nevada in the 2020 election were also charged in December 2023. They all pleaded not guilty.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ewan_palmer@newsweek.com", "name": "Ewan Palmer", "type": "author",

Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press\n\nPHOENIX - An Arizona grand jury on Wednesday indicted seven attorneys and aides affiliated with Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign as well as 11 Arizona Republicans on felony charges related to their alleged efforts to subvert President Biden's 2020 victory in the state, according to an announcement by the state attorney general.\n\nThose indicted include former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, attorneys Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis, John Eastman and Christina Bobb, top campaign adviser Boris Epshteyn and former campaign aide Mike Roman. They are accused of allegedly aiding an unsuccessful strategy to award the state's electoral votes to Trump instead of Biden after the 2020 election. Also charged are the Republicans who signed paperwork on Dec. 14, 2020, that falsely purported Trump was the rightful winner, including former state party chair Kelli Ward, state Sens. Jake Hoffman and Anthony Kern, and Tyler Bowyer, a GOP national committeeman and chief operating officer of Turning Point Action, the campaign arm of the pro-Trump conservative group Turning Point USA.\n\nTrump was not charged, but he is described in the indictment as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nThe indictments cap a year-long investigation by Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes (D) into how the elector strategy played out in Arizona, which Biden won by 10,457 votes. Arizona is the fourth state after Michigan, Georgia and Nevada to seek charges against those who formed an alternate slate of presidential electors. As those cases slowly make their way through the legal system, Trump is again running for president, and officials in Arizona and other battleground states are preparing for another likely contentious election.\n\nIn releasing the indictment, Mayes's office redacted the names of all of the individuals outside of Arizona who were charged until they have been served their indictments. The Washington Post was able to identify all of them through the accounts of their alleged actions described in the indictment.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If Mr. Meadows is named in this indictment, it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated,\" he said.\n\nEpshteyn declined to comment. Bobb, Hoffman, Bowyer, a spokesman for Giuliani and attorneys for Roman, Eastman and most of the Arizona Republicans did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMany of those involved in the 2020 elector strategy, which played out in Arizona and six other states, have long insisted that the tactic was legal because the Trump electors were only placeholders to be activated if legal challenges to Biden's win were successful in court. But Mayes charges that Trump's allies inside and outside of Arizona intended all along to use the electors to falsely claim that the outcome of the election was in doubt - facilitating an effort to obstruct the certification of Biden's victory in Congress on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nUnlike probes by state prosecutors in Michigan and Nevada, Mayes took a top-to-bottom approach with her investigation. Similar to prosecutors in the Atlanta area, Mayes targeted not just local conservatives who carried out the plan in Phoenix, but also the out-of-state middlemen in Trump's orbit who allegedly helped put it together. But unlike in Georgia, Mayes did not try to indict the former president.\n\nThis is a second round of charges for Meadows, Giuliani, Ellis, Eastman and Roman, who were all indicted alongside Trump in Georgia last year. Ellis pleaded guilty in October to illegally conspiring to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss in Georgia and has been cooperating with prosecutors. This is the first time Epshteyn - now a top 2024 campaign aide who frequently talks with the former president - has been charged for his alleged actions after the 2020 election.\n\nMayes's case had been squarely focused on local conservatives up until late last year. Then, Arizona prosecutors and investigators met in December with Kenneth Chesebro, an attorney and an architect of the elector strategy who pleaded guilty in Georgia in October to a single felony count of participating in a conspiracy to file false documents. Chesebro provided Mayes's team with records - some that had been previously unseen - that revealed more information about those involved in the Arizona effort, according to two people familiar with the investigation who requested anonymity to talk about the sensitive conversations. After that, they said the Arizona investigation widened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch of the activity that Mayes investigated happened in the weeks after Biden was declared the winner in Arizona and Dec. 14, 2020, when the Republican electors gathered to sign paperwork. Emails, records, text messages and other documents from this time have emerged in a variety of ways, including from the U.S. House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAfter the election, Giuliani and Ellis frequently traveled together as they worked to overturn Trump's loss, state by state. Both attended a Nov. 30, 2020, event in downtown Phoenix attended by state GOP state and federal lawmakers, where they falsely claimed widespread fraud had marred the election. Then, Giuliani, Ellis and other Trump allies tried to convince then-Arizona House Speaker Russell \"Rusty\" Bowers (R) to help overturn the results.\n\nBowers, speaking in 2022 before the House committee, said he remembered Giuliani saying during that meeting, \"We've got lots of theories - we just don't have the evidence.\"\n\nBobb, who has ties to Arizona, communicated with Trump allies about the strategy. After the House speaker met with Giuliani and other Trump allies, Bobb emailed the then-state senate president with information that Giuliani believed could be used to sow doubt in the 2020 outcome.\n\nEastman, a pro-Trump lawyer who helped devise the multi-state strategy, outlined how it could be achieved.\n\nRoman, the campaign staffer who oversaw election-day operations, circulated emails about the alternate elector plan, tracked elector participation in several states and communicated about making sure the paperwork was in Washington by Jan. 6, 2021, when Congress convened to count electoral college votes. Roman directed Chesebro to make sure that Ward, the state party chair, had the necessary paperwork to prepare for the signing of official-looking paperwork, according to emails that have been made public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn early December 2020, Epshteyn emailed a Wisconsin-based attorney who was aiding the campaign and asked him to draft sample language for alternate electors in seven states, including Arizona. Epshteyn wrote that the request came from Giuliani, and he added, \"If that's difficult, we can have counsels in those states do it.\"\n\nMeadows, as Trump's final White House chief of staff, has sought to downplay his involvement in the elector plan. In a federal court hearing last August in Georgia, Meadows repeatedly testified under oath that he played no role in the elector effort. Prosecutors introduced into evidence December 2020 emails between Meadows and Jason Miller, a longtime Trump campaign aide that showed Meadows forwarding a memo about the plan to Miller.\n\n\"Let's have a discussion about this tomorrow,\" Meadows wrote. When Miller told him the campaign was already talking about it, Meadows replied, \"We just need to have someone coordinating the electors for the states.\" In court, Meadows sought to downplay the email, saying that his use of the term \"we\" meant the campaign, not him. Meadows also testified that he did not want to get \"yelled at\" by Trump.\n\nOn Dec. 12, 2020, Republicans in Arizona were finalizing plans to assemble in Phoenix to stand in solidarity with Trump. Ward emailed Chesebro, Roman and others that the Trump campaign had requested the participation of Arizona electors. \"We are all prepared to meet 12/14,\" she wrote. \"It would be optimal if the campaign created and produced the documents in the ACTUAL format needed so staff can print the collateral, the electors can show up, meet/vote, and sign, and then staff can collate the documents and send to the appropriate places in the appropriate way.\"\n\nRoman responded to the group and directed Chesebro, \"Please send the full updated AZ packet.\"\n\nWard also made clear in her email that she had talked to Giuliani. She wrote that she had \"told him we were working to make sure we accomplish what we need to do.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Dec. 14, 2020, the day the electoral college formally convened, Ward and other pro-Trump Republicans gathered at the state party's headquarters. The party publicized the event - which they called \"The Signing\" - on Twitter, and electors posed for photos.\n\nIn the weeks following the Jan. 6 attack, prosecutors across the country weighed whether to investigate pro-Trump electors in their states. At the time in Arizona, then-Attorney General Mark Brnovich (R) chose not to do so. After Mayes won her election in 2022 - partly on a promise to investigate the elector strategy - she assigned a team of prosecutors to begin pursuing evidence.\n\nAlong the way, state prosecutors spent several hours interviewing Bowers, Republican members of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors who voted to approve election results from the Phoenix area and others familiar with how the elector maneuver unfolded inside of the state GOP.\n\nIn early March, the probe began nearing an end, and the pro-Trump electors received subpoenas requesting their testimony before a grand jury. Many had been advised to invoke their Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions.\n\nComments are not available on this story.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nfiled under: Arizona,

Those individuals have not yet been served, but details in the indictment make clear they include top Trump aides, including Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows.\n\nThese are the 11 Arizonans who signed documents claiming to be legitimate electors for Trump, though Democrat Joe Biden won Arizona's votes in the electoral college. Each is charged with the above counts.\n\nDig deeper: Learn more about Arizona's fake electors\n\nBowyer is the chief operating officer at Turning Point USA, a Phoenix-based nonprofit with a similarly named political advocacy arm. The nonprofit got its start advocating for conservative politics at high schools and universities, but it and its affiliated organizations have grown to become influential in the conservative culture wars. They have also drawn controversy for spreading false information, including about elections.\n\nBowyer is a committeeman for the Republican National Committee. He told The Arizona Republic in 2022 about the so-called fake elector plot, that he didn't know \"all the details and facts\" but confirmed he was an elector for the state GOP.\n\nCottle chaired the Arizona Trump electors.\n\nShe was also subpoenaed by the House Select Committee investigating the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Cottle has served on the Arizona GOP Executive Committee and Maricopa County Republican Committee. She led the Pledge of Allegiance at a rally for former President Donald Trump in January 2022 in Florence, Ariz.\n\nHoffman, of Queen Creek, is a state senator first elected to the Legislature in 2020. He is the founder of the Arizona Freedom Caucus, the political coalition that includes the state's most conservative lawmakers. Many of those lawmakers are aligned with Trump and the group generally supports conservative policies on social issues.\n\nHoffman is a top antagonist of Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs and is no stranger to criticizing Republicans he views as too moderate.\n\nHe announced earlier this year he would run to represent Arizona on the Republican National Committee, and he is seeking another term representing Legislative District 15 in the Arizona Senate, which includes Queen Creek, San Tan Valley and a portion of Mesa. He runs or has ownership shares of several marketing and advertising businesses, including one that was exposed years ago as a social media \"troll farm\" that spread disinformation.\n\nHe has largely avoided reporters' questions about the electors, saying in 2022 that they wanted to provide Congress and Vice President Mike Pence with \"dueling opinions,\" and earlier this year alleged Attorney General Kris Mayes was \"corrupt\" and using the office to \"persecute their political enemies.\"\n\nLearn more about the indictment: Grand jury indicts fake electors who falsely certified Donald Trump as 2020 winner\n\nKern, a state senator from Glendale, was outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when it was breached by rioters and is an ardent Trump supporter. First elected to the Arizona Legislature in 2015, he is now running for a seat in Congress in a packed GOP primary.\n\nHe was fired a decade ago from the El Mirage Police Department in Phoenix's northwest suburbs for lying to a supervisor after a string of disciplinary issues and put on a roll of officers accused of dishonesty called the Brady list.\n\nKern has brushed off questions about the electors' case, saying he didn't need a lawyer. Last month, on the plaza outside a Maricopa County courthouse, Kern decried the investigation as a \"weaponization of our government\" that he said was motivated by an attempt to bankrupt him and keep him from Congress.\n\nLamon ran to represent Arizona in the U.S. Senate in 2022 but lost in the GOP primary.\n\nHe is the founder of Scottsdale-based Depcom Power, a solar engineering and construction company that employed 1,600 people across the nation before he sold the business. Lamon, a steady financial supporter of Republican causes and candidates, helped bankroll security for the Arizona Senate's much-criticized review of ballots cast in 2020.\n\nIn 2022, Lamon claimed during an interview with KTVK-TV in Phoenix that the electors were part of a backup plan in case Trump's election fraud claims proved successful.\n\n\"The Republican electors put forth a valid document that said, in the event that the election certification was overturned, there would be no excuse not to recognize those electors,\" Lamon said.\n\nThe documents themselves did not include such conditional language, however.\n\nMontgomery is a former head of the Cochise County Republican Committee. He led GOP leadership in Arizona's rural southeast corner until he was defeated by a surprise challenger in December 2022. Montgomery has supported hand-counting ballots and pushed county leaders to ignore warnings about doing so before the 2022 election.\n\nMoorhead was the second vice chair of the Gila County Republican Party when he signed as a Trump elector, a ranking but not top position in the local Republican Party in one of Arizona's rural counties northeast of metro Phoenix.\n\nMoorhead served 17 years on the board of the Gila County Provisional Community College District before resigning in October to move closer to his daughter and grandson elsewhere in Arizona, according to meeting minutes.\n\nPellegrino was secretary for the Arizona Trump electors and has a long history of leadership in state GOP politics. She has led two conservative groups, the Arizona Federation of Republican Women, and the Ahwatukee Republican Women's Club, and was a delegate to Republican National Committee conventions in 2012, 2016 and 2020.\n\nPellegrino was subpoenaed by the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. She said in January 2022 the electors offered a contingency plan.\n\n\"We were electors for Trump and we were hoping things would change,\" she said. \"Just in case, we signed our paperwork to be ready in the event that something was overturned.\"\n\nSafsten, who has worked as an adviser to several Republican congressmen from Arizona, was executive director of the Arizona Republican Party when he signed as a Trump elector.\n\nAccording to an online biography by Legistorm, Safsten worked as a field director in 2012 for then-Congressman Matt Salmon and then took on a role as a legislative assistant. Four years later he went to work for GOP Congressman Andy Biggs' campaign, ultimately becoming deputy chief of staff.\n\nKelli Ward is a past chair of the Arizona GOP. She helped to organize the signing of the fake electors, sat at the head of the table during the \"signing\" video and boasted about the moment on Twitter, The Arizona Republic has previously reported.\n\nWard was also subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 committee related to the elector scheme and exercised her Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate herself more than 200 times when later testifying before that committee.\n\nShe is an outspoken supporter of Trump's and a promoter of election conspiracies who helped Trump aides in their efforts to pressure GOP leaders in Arizona and filed multiple lawsuits trying to overturn Trump's loss in 2020. She is a former state lawmaker who twice ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate.\n\nA well-known GOP activist, Michael Ward was subpoenaed by the Department of Justice in its investigation of Trump's election interference. He has been married to Kelli Ward since 1995 and has served as her campaign manager in bids for the Arizona Legislature.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"},

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a press release announcing the charges that those names would be made public after all of the defendants had been served with the indictment.\n\nGiuliani is among those whose names are redacted, a spokesperson for him, Ted Goodman, confirmed, criticizing the prosecution of the former New York mayor as political.\n\nAnother defendant whose name was redacted is described in the indictment as chief of staff in 2020, the position Mark Meadows held in the Trump White House at that time.\n\nRepresentatives for Meadows did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the indictment.\n\nINDICTMENT FOLLOWS GEORGIA, FEDERAL CASES\n\nTrump, Giuliani and Meadows are co-defendants in the Georgia case, where they are charged with a racketeering conspiracy to overturn Biden's victory in that state. They have pleaded not guilty there. Trump has also pleaded not guilty in the federal election-subversion case in Washington.\n\nTrump, a Republican, says all the cases are a political \"witch hunt\" to prevent him from defeating Democrat Biden in this year's presidential rematch.\n\nAnother defendant whose name is redacted is Trump lawyer Christina Bobb, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung confirmed, calling the Arizona indictment \"another example of Democrats' weaponization of the legal system.\"\n\n\"Christina Bobb is a former Marine Corps officer, who served our nation and the President with distinction. The Democrat platform for 2024: if you can't beat them, try to throw them in jail,\" Cheung said.\n\nGiuliani spokesperson Goodman also called the Arizona indictment an example of \"the continued weaponization of our justice system,\" saying it \"should concern every American as it does permanent, irrevocable harm to the country.\"\n\n\"Mayor Rudy Giuliani - one of the most effective prosecutors in American history who took down the Mafia, cleaned up the streets of New York and locked up corrupt public officials - is proud to stand up for the countless Americans who raised legitimate concerns surrounding the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election,\" Goodman said.\n\nThe indictment alleges the defendants pressured the Maricopa Board of Supervisors, the Arizona Legislature and then-Governor Doug Ducey to change the election results.\n\nFALSE ELECTORS SCHEME IN SEVERAL STATES\n\nU.S. presidents are chosen by electors from each state, who cast votes in the Electoral College, where votes are allotted based on each state's population.\n\nIn Arizona and almost all other states, the winner of the state's popular vote receives all of that state's electoral votes. To win the presidency a candidate needs 270 electoral votes - a majority of total 538.\n\nArizona has 11 electoral votes, and the 11 defendants named in the indictment would correspond to those people who purported to be electors for Trump.\n\nArizona is one of seven states where Biden won but Trump allies sought to award the electoral votes to Trump. Many of the races were close. Arizona was decided by little more than 10,000 votes or 0.3% of the ballots cast.\n\nThe charges include fraud, forgery and conspiracy, three classes of felony that with a conviction could have sentences ranging from 6 months to more than 12 years in prison.\n\nArizona is the fourth U.S. state where participants in the elector scheme have faced criminal charges.\n\nThree people who held themselves out as Trump electors in Georgia were charged alongside Trump in the sweeping racketeering case brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.\n\nSixteen people who falsely claimed to be legitimate Trump electors in Michigan were indicted in July 2023 by state Attorney General Dana Nessel. Authorities in Nevada charged six people, including the state Republican chair, with taking part in the scheme.\n\nThe so-called fake elector plan also plays a prominent role in the federal case against Trump brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith, accusing the former president of a multi-part scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump will press his claim that he should be immune from those charges at the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday.\n\nBesides Meadows, Giuliani and Bobb, the other defendants whose names were redacted were three attorneys and the director of election day operations for the Trump campaign. The unindicted co-conspirators also include were two former members of the Arizona legislature and two former attorneys for the Trump campaign.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Goudsward, Daniel Trotta, Eric Beech and Dan Whitcomb; Writing by Daniel Trotta; Editing by William Mallard)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

He carried Arizona in the 2016 election but narrowly lost here to President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nThe group of fake electors and Trump allies conspired to keep Trump in office despite losing the election, the Arizona grand jury indictment says.\n\nThe indictments, announced Wednesday afternoon by Democratic Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, shook the Arizona political landscape.\n\nThe indicted fake 2020 electors are Republican National Committeeman Tyler Bowyer; Trump electors chair Nancy Cottle; state Sen. Jake Hoffman, R-Queen Creek, who is up for reelection; state Sen. Anthony Kern, R-Glendale, who is running for Congress; unsuccessful 2022 U.S. Senate contender Jim Lamon; former Cochise County GOP chair Robert Montgomery; former Gila County GOP official Samuel Moorhead; Trump electors chair Loraine Pellegrino; former Arizona Republican Party executive director Greg Safsten; former AZ GOP chair and two-time failed U.S. Senate candidate Kelli Ward; and Ward's husband Michael Ward.\n\nSeven other Trump allies also were indicted but not named Wednesday because they hadn't been served. The Arizona Republic reported that the group appears to include attorney and Republican National Committee official Christina Bobb; Trump attorney John Eastman; attorney Jenna Ellis; Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn; Trump attorney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani; former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows; and Trump adviser Michael Roman.\n\nHow Republicans reacted on social media\n\nHoffman, one of the indicted electors, went on the social media platform X to proclaim his innocence and slam Mayes as corrupt.\n\n\"Kris Mayes & the Democrats' naked corruption and weaponization of government will long be a stain on the history of our great state and nation,\" Hoffman wrote.\n\nThe Arizona Republican Party likewise used X to decry \"Mayes' politically motivated indictments and blatant abuse of legal authority aimed to disrupt, distract, and interfere in the 2024 election.\"\n\nKari Lake, the Republican front-runner in Arizona's 2024 Senate race, commented on the indictments by saying on X, \"Meanwhile in the Banana Republic of Arizona...\"\n\nAbe Hamadeh, Mayes' 2022 Republican opponent who is now competing with Kern for the GOP nomination in the 8th Congressional District, has continued to make baseless claims that Mayes wasn't the rightful winner of the attorney general race.\n\n\"Sham Indictment by Arizona's Illegitimate Attorney General,\" Hamadeh wrote on X.\n\nLiz Harrington, a former Trump spokesperson, also continued to make baseless accusations of election fraud on X.\n\n\"Arizona's elections are rigged. They have to arrest you in order to keep their corrupt power,\" she wrote.\n\nHow Democrats reacted on social media\n\nRep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., who is expected to face Lake in the Senate race, wrote on X that \"Our country and our democracy are precious and I will do anything to defend them.\"\n\n\"No one is above the law. I respect the process and look forward to letting the legal process play out -- even though it's hard when people tweet out the crimes they're committing,\" he said.\n\nTony Cani, a veteran Arizona Democratic political strategist, attempted to add context to the social media debate.\n\n\"People need to realize exactly what the indicted fake electors did in AZ. They claim they offered some sort of conditional protest slate of electors. No. They forged a phony Certificate of Vote, signed it, and sent it to the national archives and friendly US Senators,\" Cani wrote on X. \"They did all of this as a part of a conspiracy to help Donald Trump stop a transition of power and seize the office of the presidency despite losing the election.\"\n\nMarc Elias, a well-known Democratic elections attorney, took a snarky jab at Bobb over her role with the RNC.\n\n\"The RNC's senior counsel for election integrity was indicted today in Arizona for election conspiracy and fraud,\" he wrote on X.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com",

They are accused of allegedly aiding an unsuccessful strategy to award the state's electoral votes to Trump instead of Biden after the 2020 election.\n\nAlso charged are the Republicans who signed paperwork on Dec. 14, 2020, that falsely purported Trump was the rightful winner, including former state party chair Kelli Ward, state Sens. Jake Hoffman and Anthony Kern, and Tyler Bowyer, a GOP national committeeman and chief operating officer of Turning Point Action, the campaign arm of the pro-Trump conservative group Turning Point USA.\n\nTrump was not charged, but he is described in the indictment as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nThe indictments cap a yearlong investigation by Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes (D) into how the elector strategy played out in Arizona, which Biden won by 10,457 votes. Arizona is the fourth state after Michigan, Georgia and Nevada to seek charges against those who formed an alternate slate of presidential electors. As those cases slowly make their way through the legal system, Trump is again running for president, and officials in Arizona and other battleground states are preparing for another likely contentious election.\n\nIn releasing the indictment, Mayes's office redacted the names of all of the individuals outside of Arizona who were charged until they have been served their indictments. The Washington Post was able to identify all of them through the accounts of their alleged actions described in the indictment.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment.\n\n\"If Mr. Meadows is named in this indictment, it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated,\" he said.\n\nEpshteyn declined to comment. Bobb, Hoffman, Bowyer, a spokesman for Giuliani and attorneys for Roman, Eastman and most of the Arizona Republicans did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMany of those involved in the 2020 elector strategy, which played out in Arizona and six other states, have long insisted that the tactic was legal because the Trump electors were only placeholders to be activated if legal challenges to Biden's win were successful in court. But Mayes charges that Trump's allies inside and outside of Arizona intended all along to use the electors to falsely claim that the outcome of the election was in doubt - facilitating an effort to obstruct the certification of Biden's victory in Congress on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nUnlike probes by state prosecutors in Michigan and Nevada, Mayes took a top-to-bottom approach with her investigation. Similar to prosecutors in the Atlanta area, Mayes targeted not just local conservatives who carried out the plan in Phoenix, but also the out-of-state middlemen in Trump's orbit who allegedly helped put it together. But unlike in Georgia, Mayes did not try to indict the former president.\n\nThis is a second round of charges for Meadows, Giuliani, Ellis, Eastman and Roman, who were all indicted alongside Trump in Georgia last year. Ellis pleaded guilty in October to illegally conspiring to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss in Georgia and has been cooperating with prosecutors. This is the first time Epshteyn -- now a top 2024 campaign aide who frequently talks with the former president -- has been charged for his alleged actions after the 2020 election.\n\nMayes's case had been squarely focused on local conservatives up until late last year. Then, Arizona prosecutors and investigators met in December with Kenneth Chesebro, an attorney and an architect of the elector strategy who pleaded guilty in Georgia in October to a single felony count of participating in a conspiracy to file false documents. Chesebro provided Mayes's team with records -- some that had been previously unseen -- that revealed more information about those involved in the Arizona effort, according to two people familiar with the investigation who requested anonymity to talk about the sensitive conversations. After that, they said the Arizona investigation widened.\n\nMuch of the activity that Mayes investigated happened in the weeks after Biden was declared the winner in Arizona and Dec. 14, 2020, when the Republican electors gathered to sign paperwork. Emails, records, text messages and other documents from this time have emerged in a variety of ways, including from the U.S. House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAfter the election, Giuliani and Ellis frequently traveled together as they worked to overturn Trump's loss, state by state. Both attended a Nov. 30, 2020, event in downtown Phoenix attended by state GOP state and federal lawmakers, where they falsely claimed widespread fraud had marred the election. Then, Giuliani, Ellis and other Trump allies tried to convince then-Arizona House Speaker Russell \"Rusty\" Bowers (R) to help overturn the results.\n\nBowers, speaking in 2022 before the House committee, said he remembered Giuliani saying during that meeting, \"We've got lots of theories -- we just don't have the evidence.\"\n\nBobb, who has ties to Arizona, communicated with Trump allies about the strategy. After the House speaker met with Giuliani and other Trump allies, Bobb emailed the then-state senate president with information that Giuliani believed could be used to sow doubt in the 2020 outcome.\n\nEastman, a pro-Trump lawyer who helped devise the multi-state strategy, outlined how it could be achieved.\n\nRoman, the campaign staffer who oversaw Election Day operations, circulated emails about the alternate elector plan, tracked elector participation in several states and communicated about making sure the paperwork was in Washington by Jan. 6, 2021, when Congress convened to count electoral college votes. Roman directed Chesebro to make sure that Ward, the state party chair, had the necessary paperwork to prepare for the signing of official-looking paperwork, according to emails that have been made public.\n\nIn early December 2020, Epshteyn emailed a Wisconsin-based attorney who was aiding the campaign and asked him to draft sample language for alternate electors in seven states, including Arizona. Epshteyn wrote that the request came from Giuliani, and he added, \"If that's difficult, we can have counsels in those states do it.\"\n\nMeadows, as Trump's final White House chief of staff, has sought to downplay his involvement in the elector plan. In a federal court hearing last August in Georgia, Meadows repeatedly testified under oath that he played no role in the elector effort. Prosecutors introduced into evidence December 2020 emails between Meadows and Jason Miller, a longtime Trump campaign aide that showed Meadows forwarding a memo about the plan to Miller.\n\n\"Let's have a discussion about this tomorrow,\" Meadows wrote. When Miller told him the campaign was already talking about it, Meadows replied, \"We just need to have someone coordinating the electors for the states.\" In court, Meadows sought to downplay the email, saying that his use of the term \"we\" meant the campaign, not him. Meadows also testified that he did not want to get \"yelled at\" by Trump.\n\nOn Dec. 12, 2020, Republicans in Arizona were finalizing plans to assemble in Phoenix to stand in solidarity with Trump. Ward emailed Chesebro, Roman and others that the Trump campaign had requested the participation of Arizona electors. \"We are all prepared to meet 12/14,\" she wrote. \"It would be optimal if the campaign created and produced the documents in the ACTUAL format needed so staff can print the collateral, the electors can show up, meet/vote, and sign, and then staff can collate the documents and send to the appropriate places in the appropriate way.\"\n\nRoman responded to the group and directed Chesebro, \"Please send the full updated AZ packet.\"\n\nWard also made clear in her email that she had talked to Giuliani. She wrote that she had \"told him we were working to make sure we accomplish what we need to do.\"\n\nOn Dec. 14, 2020, the day the electoral college formally convened, Ward and other pro-Trump Republicans gathered at the state party's headquarters. The party publicized the event - which they called \"The Signing\" - on Twitter, and electors posed for photos.\n\nIn the weeks following the Jan. 6 attack, prosecutors across the country weighed whether to investigate pro-Trump electors in their states. At the time in Arizona, then-Attorney General Mark Brnovich (R) chose not to do so. After Mayes won her election in 2022 - partly on a promise to investigate the elector strategy - she assigned a team of prosecutors to begin pursuing evidence.\n\nAlong the way, state prosecutors spent several hours interviewing Bowers, Republican members of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors who voted to approve election results from the Phoenix area and others familiar with how the elector maneuver unfolded inside of the state GOP.\n\nIn early March, the probe began nearing an end, and the pro-Trump electors received subpoenas requesting their testimony before a grand jury. Many had been advised to invoke their Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions.", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a press release announcing the charges that those names would be made public after all of the defendants had been served with the indictment.\n\nGiuliani is among those whose names are redacted, a spokesperson for him, Ted Goodman, confirmed, criticising the prosecution of the former New York mayor as political.\n\nAnother defendant whose name was redacted is described in the indictment as chief of staff in 2020, the position Mark Meadows held in the Trump White House at that time.Rudy Giuliani files for bankruptcy after US$148 million court judgment\n\nRepresentatives for Meadows did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the indictment.\n\nTrump, Giuliani and Meadows are co-defendants in the Georgia case, where they are charged with a racketeering conspiracy to overturn Biden\u2019s victory in that state. They have pleaded not guilty there. Trump has also pleaded not guilty in the federal election-subversion case in Washington.\n\nTrump, a Republican, says all the cases are a political \u201cwitch hunt\u201d to prevent him from defeating Democrat Biden in this year\u2019s presidential rematch.\n\nAnother defendant whose name is redacted is Trump lawyer Christina Bobb, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung confirmed, calling the Arizona indictment \u201canother example of Democrats\u2019 weaponisation of the legal system\u201d.\n\n\u201cChristina Bobb is a former Marine Corps officer, who served our nation and the President with distinction. The Democrat platform for 2024: if you can\u2019t beat them, try to throw them in jail,\u201d Cheung said.\n\nGiuliani spokesperson Goodman also called the Arizona indictment an example of \u201cthe continued weaponisation of our justice system\u201d, saying it \u201cshould concern every American as it does permanent, irrevocable harm to the country\u201d.\n\n\u201cMayor Rudy Giuliani \u2013 one of the most effective prosecutors in American history who took down the Mafia, cleaned up the streets of New York and locked up corrupt public officials \u2013 is proud to stand up for the countless Americans who raised legitimate concerns surrounding the 2020 US Presidential Election,\u201d Goodman said.\n\nThe indictment alleges the defendants pressured the Maricopa Board of Supervisors, the Arizona Legislature and then-Governor Doug Ducey to change the election results.\n\nUS presidents are chosen by electors from each state, who cast votes in the Electoral College, where votes are allotted based on each state\u2019s population.\n\nIn Arizona and almost all other states, the winner of the state\u2019s popular vote receives all of that state\u2019s electoral votes.

Many of the races were close. Arizona was decided by little more than 10,000 votes or 0.3 per cent of the ballots cast.\n\nThe charges include fraud, forgery and conspiracy, three classes of felony that with a conviction could have sentences ranging from 6 months to more than 12 years in prison.\n\nArizona is the fourth US state where participants in the elector scheme have faced criminal charges.\n\nThree people who held themselves out as Trump electors in Georgia were charged alongside Trump in the sweeping racketeering case brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.\n\nSixteen people who falsely claimed to be legitimate Trump electors in Michigan were indicted in July 2023 by state Attorney General Dana Nessel. Authorities in Nevada charged six people, including the state Republican chair, with taking part in the scheme.\n\nThe so-called fake elector plan also plays a prominent role in the federal case against Trump brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith, accusing the former president of a multi-part scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nTrump will press his claim that he should be immune from those charges at the US Supreme Court on Thursday.\n\nBesides Meadows, Giuliani and Bobb, the other defendants whose names were redacted were three lawyers and the director of election day operations for the Trump campaign.

one of those indicted as Trump's \"chief of staff in 2020,\" who is believed to be Mark Meadows.\n\nIt also lists a \"former US president\" -- presumably Trump -- as a co-conspirator who has not been

We intend to prove these crimes were committed beyond a reasonable doubt,\" she added.\n\nThe indictment includes nine counts for crimes such as conspiracy, forgery, and engaging in fraudulent schemes.\n\n\"In Arizona, and the United States, the people elected Joseph Biden as President on November 3, 2020,\" the indictment reads. \"Unwilling to accept this fact, Defendants and unindicted coconspirators schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency to keep Unindicted Coconspirator 1 in office against the will of Arizona's voters.\"\n\nA total of 18 individuals have been indicted. The scheme the 18 pursued called for the 11 fake electors to vote for Trump, \"falsely claiming to be the duly elected and qualified Electors for President and Vice President of the United States from the State of Arizona.\"\n\n\"Defendants deceived the citizens of Arizona by falsely claiming that those votes were contingent only on a legal challenge that would change the outcome of the election,\" the indictment continues. \"In reality, Defendants intended that their false votes for Trump-Pence would encourage Pence to reject the Biden-Harris votes on January 6, 2021, regardless of the outcome of the legal challenge.\"\n\nThe scheme ultimately fell apart when then-Vice President Mike Pence chose on Jan. 6th to certify the election for current President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Arizona Republican Party responded harshly to the indictments.\n\n\"Today's indictments by Attorney General Kris Mayes represent a blatant and unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial power, aimed solely at distracting the public from the critical policy debates our country should be focusing on as we approach the 2024 election,\" the party said in a statement.\n\n\"The timing of these charges -- precisely four years after the 2020 election and as President Biden seeks re-election -- is suspiciously convenient and politically motivated. This is not justice; it is pure election interference,\" the statement continued.\n\nThe party concluded its statement by condemning Mayes' indictments \"in the strongest terms.\"\n\n\"They do nothing but undermine the trust in our state's legal processes and are clearly designed to silence dissent and weaponize the law against political opponents,\" they wrote. \"We will not be deterred by this overreach. We will continue to stand for the principles of fairness and integrity that are the cornerstone of our Republic.\"\n\nDespite the right's anger, Mayes is in fact the fifth prosecutor to bring charges related to the effort to overturn the 2020 election.\n\n\"Special counsel Jack Smith has charged Trump with federal crimes for those efforts,\" Politico notes. \"Prosecutors in Georgia have charged Trump and many of his allies for their efforts to overturn the results in that state, including the fake electors plot. Prosecutors in Michigan and Nevada have also charged Republicans who posed as fake electors in those states.\"\n\nIn fact, Michigan prosecutors just revealed on Wednesday that Trump is also an unindicted co-conspirator in their own investigation.\n\n\"Former President Donald Trump, his former chief of staff Mark Meadows and his former attorney Rudy Giuliani are uncharged co-conspirators in a Michigan 'false electors' scheme tied to efforts to overturn the 2020 election, a state investigator testified, according to NBC News.\n\n\"During a hearing related to the case, Duane Silverthorn, an attorney for a defendant who was charged in the scheme, read a list of names and asked whether they were \"unindicted co-conspirators\" in Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel's investigation,\" NBC News reported.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

In fact, he lost to Democrat Joe Biden by 10,457 votes.\n\nThey also are charged with conducting fraudulent schemes and practices.\n\nThe document also says some others were indicted but have not been named because they have not been served with the court papers. It identifies some by their roles in the Trump campaign. That makes it possible to identify two of them as Rudy Giuliani, an attorney for the former president, and Mark Meadows, who was Trump's chief of staff.\n\nThe indictment also names Trump himself as an \"unindicted co-conspirator.''\n\nPeople are also reading...

They also sent that statement to the National Archives to falsely declare Trump was entitled to Arizona's 11 electoral votes.\n\nBut it has been an open question whether those acts rose to criminal activity. Some had said the plan was simply to present a backup slate to be read should litigation show Trump actually won the vote here.\n\nThat argument did not wash with prosecutors in Georgia, Nevada and Michigan, where \"fake electors\" have also been indicted. Prosecutors there said the alternative slates were part of a scheme hatched in the White House by those close to Trump to convince Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to accept the official results reported by Arizona and other states. The goal, according to indictments in those other states, was to prevent Biden from getting the necessary 270 electoral votes.\n\nArizona's Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes said her investigators \"took the necessary time to piece together the details of the events that began nearly four years ago.''\n\n\"They followed the facts where they led,'' she said in a written statement late Wednesday announcing the indictments.\n\nWhile the Arizona indictment specifically names the 11 electors, there are seven others who are not currently identified. But indictments in other states have named aides and attorneys to Trump for their roles in crafting and executing the scheme.\n\n\"Justice demands an answer to the efforts that the defendants and other unindicted co-conspirators allegedly took to undermine the will of Arizona's voters during the 2020 presidential election,'' Mayes said.\n\nThat election, she said, was run \"free and fair,'' with voters choosing Biden.\n\n\"Unwilling to accept that fact, the defendants charged by the state grand jury allegedly schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency,'' Mayes said.\n\nShe said the reason they did it is irrelevant.\n\n\"Whatever their reasoning was, the plot to violate the law must be answered for,'' Mayes said.\n\n\"The scheme, had it succeeded, would have deprived Arizona's voters of their right to have their votes counted for their chosen president,'' she said. \"It effectively would have made their right to vote meaningless.''\n\nMayes said the scheme was based on false claims of widespread voter fraud. The only reason the effort failed is because members of Congress ignored it, she said.\n\nAside from the acts of the electors in submitting the false certification, the indictment also says that someone -- identified as \"the Mayor'' -- spread false claims of election fraud, including at a \"hearing'' he conducted in downtown Phoenix less than a month after the 2020 election. That was Giuliani, the former New York City mayor.\n\nAt that time, the indictment says, he falsely claimed that Arizona election officials \"have made no effort to find out'' if the results of the presidential race were accurate.\n\nThere also were efforts -- including calls from the White House -- to induce Republican Rusty Bowers, who was the Arizona House speaker at the time, to investigate the election returns. Bowers refused, saying there was no evidence the results were inaccurate.\n\nThe indictment also includes Meadows. It says he worked with members of the Trump campaign to coordinate and implement the false Republican electors' votes in Arizona and six other states.\n\nThe Washington Post, examining descriptions of the roles of some of the other individuals whose names were not announced, said that list apparently includes Jenna Ellis, John Eastman and Christina Bobb, all also attorneys for Trump, as well as campaign adviser Boris Epshteyn and former campaign aide Mike Roman.\n\nHoward Fischer is a veteran journalist who has been reporting since 1970 and covering state politics and the Legislature since 1982.

On that day in 2020, Republicans in seven states signed ballots for Trump even though Joe Biden had won in their states. In five of the states, they claimed to be legitimate electors even though they were not. In the other two, they signed paperwork saying their states' electoral votes for Trump should be counted only if Biden's victory was overturned.\n\nState and local prosecutors have investigated and in some instances issued charges. The Justice Department is also investigating the issue. Here's a look at where the cases stand in each state.\n\nArizona: Charges filed\n\nAn Arizona grand jury in April indicted 11 state Republicans, as well as seven attorneys, aides and advisers affiliated with Trump's 2020 presidential campaign on felony charges over their alleged efforts to subvert Biden's 2020 win in the state.\n\nThe group is charged on counts pertaining to conspiracy, fraudulent schemes and forgery. The charges were announced by Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes (D), capping the end of a year-long investigation into how the elector strategy played out in Arizona. A number of those who were charged immediately denied the accusations or insisted they were politically motivated and vowed to fight them in court. George Terwilliger, a lawyer representing former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, called the indictment \"a blatantly political and politicized accusation\" that \"will be contested and defeated.\"\n\nThose indicted include Meadows, attorneys Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis, John Eastman and Christina Bobb, top campaign adviser Boris Epshteyn and former campaign aide Mike Roman.\n\nAlso charged are the Republicans who signed paperwork on Dec. 14, 2020, that falsely purported Trump was the rightful winner, including former state party chair Kelli Ward, state Sens. Jake Hoffman and Anthony Kern, and Tyler Bowyer, a GOP national committeeman and chief operating officer of Turning Point Action.\n\nTrump was not charged, but he is described in the indictment as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nGeorgia: Charges filed\n\nThree of the 16 Republicans who claimed to be electors in Georgia were charged in August 2023 as part of a sweeping indictment alleging Trump and others conspired to steal the 2020 election. The three would-be electors were charged with racketeering, impersonating a public official, forgery and other crimes. Prosecutors gave many of the others who claimed to be Georgia electors immunity deals as they conducted their broad investigation into Trump.\n\nA grand jury charged several people who assisted the would-be electors with crimes related to their activities, including Trump, Giuliani, Ellis and Roman. Most have pleaded not guilty, but two of them - Ellis and attorney Kenneth Chesebro - reached plea deals with prosecutors in October. Ellis pleaded guilty to a felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings, and Chesebro pleaded guilty to a felony count of conspiring to file false documents. The others have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn April, a state prosecutor said he was separately investigating Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones (R), who was among those who claimed to be an elector.\n\nMichigan: Charges filed\n\nState Attorney General Dana Nessel (D) in July 2023 brought the first charges in the country against those purporting to be electors. She charged each of the 16 Republicans with eight felonies, including forgery and conspiracy to commit forgery. Prosecutors in October dropped the charges against one of them, James Renner, in exchange for his testimony. The others have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMore: Trump is a co-conspirator in Michigan's 2020 false electors plot, state investigator says\n\nNevada: Charges filed\n\nA grand jury in December 2023 charged the six Republicans in Nevada who claimed to be electors with two felonies each, for forging documents and attempting to file false documents. They face up to nine years in prison and up to $15,000 in fines. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nAmong those who were charged are Michael J. McDonald, the chairman of the state Republican Party, and Jim DeGraffenreid, a Republican national committeeman. Those two received limited immunity in the separate federal investigation into election interference that special counsel Jack Smith is conducting.\n\nWisconsin: Ongoing investigation\n\nInvestigators for state Attorney General Josh Kaul (D) have interviewed Chesebro as a possible witness as part of an ongoing probe. Other details about the investigation have not been made public. Separately, Chesebro, Trump attorney James Troupis and the 10 Wisconsin Republicans who posed as electors recently settled a lawsuit brought by two of the state's legitimate electors. As part of the deals, they publicly released records about their efforts and withdrew their false filings from the National Archives. In addition, those who acted as electors agreed not to do so again this year or any time Trump is on the ballot. Troupis paid an unspecified amount of money to those who brought the suit.\n\nNew Mexico: No charges filed\n\nState Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez (D) in January announced that the five Republicans who met as electors in New Mexico were not subject to prosecution under state law. The Republicans in New Mexico included wording in their paperwork saying their electoral votes should be counted only if they were found to be legitimate electors.\n\nPennsylvania: No charges filed\n\nState investigators determined in early 2022 that Republicans in Pennsylvania probably did not violate the law because they included a caveat in their paperwork saying their electoral votes were to be counted only if a court found they were legitimate electors. The review of the matter was overseen by Democrat Josh Shapiro, who was attorney general at the time and is now governor.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

In another swing state, Wisconsin, fake electors admitted to their roles as part of civil settlements.\n\nThe slate of fake electors charged in Arizona includes several influential Republicans, including sitting state Sens. Jake Hoffman and Anthony Kern. Former Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward, former party Executive Director Greg Safsten and RNC Committeeman Tyler Bowyer also signed documents transmitted to the federal government. Bowyer is also an executive with Turning Point USA, an Arizona-based right wing advocacy group founded by Trump ally Charlie Kirk.\n\nThe indictments mark a significant step forward in an investigation that began a year ago after Mayes, a Democrat who was elected attorney general in 2022 by just 280 votes, took office in early 2023.\n\nSome Democrats criticized Mayes over the pace of that investigation, which proceeded largely behind closed doors as grand juries in other states indicted alleged participants in the fake electors scheme.\n\nBut Mayes urged patience, pointing out that she took office after many of the officials pursuing the case in other states. Her predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, did not investigate the case.\n\n\"The investigators and attorneys assigned to this case took the necessary time to thoroughly piece together the details of the events that began nearly four years ago,\" Mayes said.\n\nThere were signs the case was picking up steam in recent months, though. In December, the investigators met with former Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro, who was accused of being the head architect of the fake elector plot by the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack.\n\nChesebro pleaded guilty in Georgia to one felony count of conspiracy to commit filing false documents. He agreed to testify in that case and also met with prosecutors in Nevada. Chesebro also agreed to the civil settlement in Wisconsin, which required him to publish records and documents detailing interactions with the Trump campaign about the fake elector strategy.",

Those individuals have not yet been served, but details in the indictment make clear they include top Trump aides, including Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows.\n\nThese are the 11 Arizonans who signed documents claiming to be legitimate electors for Trump, though Democrat Joe Biden won Arizona's votes in the electoral college. Each is charged with the above counts.\n\nDig deeper: Learn more about Arizona's fake electors\n\nBowyer is the chief operating officer at Turning Point USA, a Phoenix-based nonprofit with a similarly named political advocacy arm. The nonprofit got its start advocating for conservative politics at high schools and universities, but it and its affiliated organizations have grown to become influential in the conservative culture wars. They have also drawn controversy for spreading false information, including about elections.\n\nBowyer is a committeeman for the Republican National Committee. He told The Arizona Republic in 2022 about the so-called fake elector plot, that he didn't know \"all the details and facts\" but confirmed he was an elector for the state GOP.\n\nCottle chaired the Arizona Trump electors.\n\nShe was also subpoenaed by the House Select Committee investigating the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Cottle has served on the Arizona GOP Executive Committee and Maricopa County Republican Committee. She led the Pledge of Allegiance at a rally for former President Donald Trump in January 2022 in Florence, Ariz.\n\nHoffman, of Queen Creek, is a state senator first elected to the Legislature in 2020. He is the founder of the Arizona Freedom Caucus, the political coalition that includes the state's most conservative lawmakers. Many of those lawmakers are aligned with Trump and the group generally supports conservative policies on social issues.\n\nHoffman is a top antagonist of Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs and is no stranger to criticizing Republicans he views as too moderate.\n\nHe announced earlier this year he would run to represent Arizona on the Republican National Committee, and he is seeking another term representing Legislative District 15 in the Arizona Senate, which includes Queen Creek, San Tan Valley and a portion of Mesa. He runs or has ownership shares of several marketing and advertising businesses, including one that was exposed years ago as a social media \"troll farm\" that spread disinformation.\n\nHe has largely avoided reporters' questions about the electors, saying in 2022 that they wanted to provide Congress and Vice President Mike Pence with \"dueling opinions,\" and earlier this year alleged Attorney General Kris Mayes was \"corrupt\" and using the office to \"persecute their political enemies.\"\n\nLearn more about the indictment: Grand jury indicts fake electors who falsely certified Donald Trump as 2020 winner\n\nKern, a state senator from Glendale, was outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when it was breached by rioters and is an ardent Trump supporter. First elected to the Arizona Legislature in 2015, he is now running for a seat in Congress in a packed GOP primary.\n\nHe was fired a decade ago from the El Mirage Police Department in Phoenix's northwest suburbs for lying to a supervisor after a string of disciplinary issues and put on a roll of officers accused of dishonesty called the Brady list.\n\nKern has brushed off questions about the electors' case, saying he didn't need a lawyer. Last month, on the plaza outside a Maricopa County courthouse, Kern decried the investigation as a \"weaponization of our government\" that he said was motivated by an attempt to bankrupt him and keep him from Congress.\n\nLamon ran to represent Arizona in the U.S. Senate in 2022 but lost in the GOP primary.\n\nHe is the founder of Scottsdale-based Depcom Power, a solar engineering and construction company that employed 1,600 people across the nation before he sold the business. Lamon, a steady financial supporter of Republican causes and candidates, helped bankroll security for the Arizona Senate's much-criticized review of ballots cast in 2020.\n\nIn 2022, Lamon claimed during an interview with KTVK-TV in Phoenix that the electors were part of a backup plan in case Trump's election fraud claims proved successful.\n\n\"The Republican electors put forth a valid document that said, in the event that the election certification was overturned, there would be no excuse not to recognize those electors,\" Lamon said.\n\nThe documents themselves did not include such conditional language, however.\n\nMontgomery is a former head of the Cochise County Republican Committee. He led GOP leadership in Arizona's rural southeast corner until he was defeated by a surprise challenger in December 2022. Montgomery has supported hand-counting ballots and pushed county leaders to ignore warnings about doing so before the 2022 election.\n\nMoorhead was the second vice chair of the Gila County Republican Party when he signed as a Trump elector, a ranking but not top position in the local Republican Party in one of Arizona's rural counties northeast of metro Phoenix.\n\nMoorhead served 17 years on the board of the Gila County Provisional Community College District before resigning in October to move closer to his daughter and grandson elsewhere in Arizona, according to meeting minutes.\n\nPellegrino was secretary for the Arizona Trump electors and has a long history of leadership in state GOP politics. She has led two conservative groups, the Arizona Federation of Republican Women, and the Ahwatukee Republican Women's Club, and was a delegate to Republican National Committee conventions in 2012, 2016 and 2020.\n\nPellegrino was subpoenaed by the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. She said in January 2022 the electors offered a contingency plan.\n\n\"We were electors for Trump and we were hoping things would change,\" she said. \"Just in case, we signed our paperwork to be ready in the event that something was overturned.\"\n\nSafsten, who has worked as an adviser to several Republican congressmen from Arizona, was executive director of the Arizona Republican Party when he signed as a Trump elector.\n\nAccording to an online biography by Legistorm, Safsten worked as a field director in 2012 for then-Congressman Matt Salmon and then took on a role as a legislative assistant. Four years later he went to work for GOP Congressman Andy Biggs' campaign, ultimately becoming deputy chief of staff.\n\nKelli Ward is a past chair of the Arizona GOP. She helped to organize the signing of the fake electors, sat at the head of the table during the \"signing\" video and boasted about the moment on Twitter, The Arizona Republic has previously reported.\n\nWard was also subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 committee related to the elector scheme and exercised her Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate herself more than 200 times when later testifying before that committee.\n\nShe is an outspoken supporter of Trump's and a promoter of election conspiracies who helped Trump aides in their efforts to pressure GOP leaders in Arizona and filed multiple lawsuits trying to overturn Trump's loss in 2020. She is a former state lawmaker who twice ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate.\n\nA well-known GOP activist, Michael Ward was subpoenaed by the Department of Justice in its investigation of Trump's election interference. He has been married to Kelli Ward since 1995 and has served as her campaign manager in bids for the Arizona Legislature.\n\nArizona Republic reporters Ryan Randazzo, Richard Ruelas and Robert Anglen

"Arizona has charged 18 people over a scheme to subvert the 2020 election in favor of Donald Trump, the state's attorney general said Wednesday, with US media identifying the ex-president's lawyer Rudy Giuliani among those indicted.\n\nThe felony indictments, which allege a conspiracy to award Arizona's slate of electors to the defeated real estate magnate, are the latest effort by a state to hold accountable those who backed Trump's false claim that he won the presidential vote.\n\nArizona's Attorney General Kris Mayes said a grand jury had returned indictments on 11 local Republicans, including the party's former state chair, and seven others from out of state, whose names were redacted until all have been served with papers.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the seven include former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, attorneys Jenna Ellis, John Eastman and campaign adviser Boris Epshteyn, as well as Giuliani, who acted as Trump's personal lawyer.\n\nThe former president himself was not charged, but was named as an unindicted co-conspirator, the Post said.\n\nDemocrat Joe Biden won Arizona, a critical election battleground, by just over 10,000 votes, but many Republican Party officials insisted -- without evidence -- that there had been fraud and that Trump had been the real winner.\n\nElectors -- representatives of the winning candidate in each state -- sign official documents that are sent to Congress after presidential elections.\n\nDespite Trump's loss in Arizona, his representatives nonetheless signed documents saying he had won.\n\nThe fake electors strategy was allegedly part of a plan to obstruct the certification of Biden's presidential victory by Congress on January 6, 2021.\n\nArizona is the fourth state to seek charges against people who tried to form an alternative slate of electors, after Michigan, Georgia and Nevada.\n\nMeadows, Giuliani, Ellis and Eastman have all been charged in Georgia, alongside Trump in what is probably the most explosive of the four criminal trials he faces.\n\nWednesday's charges come as Trump is once again running for the White House, and still baselessly insisting that he won in 2020.\n\nOpinion polls show he is in a close race with an unpopular Biden.\n\nAs a swing state and something of a ground zero for election conspiracy theories peddled by rightwing Republicans, Arizona is once again expected to be closely contested this November when Americans head to the polls.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The court papers list a \"former U.S. president,\" Trump, as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nA grand jury has charged 18 people with allegedly taking part in an Arizona fake elector scheme to re-elect then-U.S. President Donald Trump in 2020, the state's attorney general said on Wednesday.\n\nThe court papers list a \"former U.S. president,\" Trump, as an unindicted co-conspirator. The indictment stems from efforts to reverse Democrat Joe Biden's victory in several states in 2020, based on Republican Trump's false claims that he had been re-elected.\n\nThe names of seven defendants are redacted in an indictment that names 11 others. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a press release announcing the charges that those names would be made public after all of the defendants had been served with the indictment. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani is among those indicted, said his spokesperson Ted Goodman, although the former New York mayor's name is redacted.\n\n\"The continued weaponization of our justice system should concern every Americans as it does permanent, irrevocable harm to the country. Mayor Rudy Giuliani - one of the most effective prosecutors in American history who took down the Mafia, cleaned up the streets of New York and locked up corrupt public officials - is proud to stand up for the countless Americans who raised legitimate concerns surrounding the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election,\" Goodman said. The indictment also identifies one defendant as chief of staff in 2020, the position Mark Meadows held in the Trump White House at that time.\n\nRepresentatives for Meadows and Trump did not immediately respond to requests for comment. U.S. presidents are chosen by electors from each state, who cast votes in the Electoral College, where votes are allotted based on each state's population.\n\nIn Arizona and almost all other states, the winner of the state's popular vote receives all of that state's electoral votes. To win the presidency a candidate needs 270 votes - a majority of total 538 electoral votes. Arizona has 11 electoral votes, and the 11 defendants named in the indictment would correspond to those people who purported to be Arizona's electors for Trump.\n\nArizona was one of seven states where Trump allies sought to award those state's electoral votes to Trump even those states were won by Biden. The false electors scheme figures in two criminal trials, in Washington, D.C., and Georgia, charging Trump with unlawfully seeking to overturn Biden's victory.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@devdiscourse.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_conspiracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Criminal conspiracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Giuliani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Mayes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kris Mayes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Mafia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Mafia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of New York City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief of staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State Relations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_05_2019_11_50_05_8739542.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510566", "eventUri": "eng-9510566", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Trump is not charged.\n\nProsecutors gave enough details in the indictment, dated Tuesday and posted on social media by a Politico reporter, to reveal Meadows as one of the defendants whose names are redacted.\n\nTrump is consistently referred to in the indictment as \"Unindicted Coconspirator 1.\" A description of one of the defendants with redacted names describes him as that co-conspirator's chief of staff.\n\nCharges for the group include conspiracy, fraudulent schemes and artifices, fraudulent schemes and practices and forgery.\n\nSince Meadows' name is redacted, the full scope of the allegations against him is not immediately clear.\n\nThis is the second time Meadows has been indicted for allegations that he tried to overturn the 2020 election. The other case is in Georgia, where he's facing two charges of racketeering and solicitation of violation of oath of a public officer, according to that indictment.\n\nMeadows has defended himself, saying the actions he is accused of taking were within the purview of his job as a chief of staff.\n\nThe fake electors\n\nThe latest indictment details how those close to Trump worked with a fake group of electors from Arizona to try to overthrow the election results, where Biden won by more than 10,000 votes.\n\n\"In Arizona, and the United States, the people elected Joseph Biden as President on November 3, 2020,\" the indictment states. \"Unwilling to accept this fact, Defendants and unindicted coconspirators schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency to keep Unindicted Coconspirator 1 in office against the will of Arizona's voters.\"\n\nThe indictment further states that the scheme would have deprived Arizonans of their right to vote and have their votes counted.\n\nAmong those indicted are 11 people described as the Arizona Fake Electors. They're accused of declaring Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence as the winners of the 2020 election in Arizona, despite voter intent.\n\nThe other seven people indicted include Meadows, Trump's director of election day operations and five attorneys, one of whom was a campaign aide. Their names have been redacted from the indictment, though The Washington Post is identifying them as Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis, John Eastman, Christina Bob, Trump's campaign adviser Boris Epshteyn and former campaign aide Mike Roman.\n\nMeadows is specifically accused of working \"with members of the Trump campaign to coordinate and implement the false Republican electors' votes in Arizona and six other states.\" It further accuses him of being involved in many efforts to keep Trump in power, despite losing the election.\n\nBefore working in the Trump administration, Meadows represented North Carolina's 11th Congressional District, in the state's farthest southwestern counties. He was succeeded by former Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who lost his reelection in 2022 to Rep. Chuck Edwards.\n\nTrump faces four criminal indictments in other cases, including accusations of interference in the 2020 election and an alleged hush-money scheme in a case on trial now.", "source":

Heading into a likely November rematch with Biden, Trump continues to spread lies about the last election that are echoed by many of his supporters.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic state Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nThe indictment alludes to Giuliani as an attorney \"who was often identified as the Mayor\" and spread false allegations of election fraud. Another defendant is referred to as Trump's \" chief of staff in 2020,\" which describes Meadows.\n\nDescriptions of other unnamed defendants point to Mike Roman, who was Trump's director of Election Day operations; John Eastman, a lawyer who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election; and Christina Bobb, a lawyer who worked with Giuliani.\n\nA lawyer for Eastman, Charles Burnham, said his client is innocent. Bobb did not respond to a text message seeking comment, nor did a lawyer who is representing Roman in a case in Georgia.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment but if Meadows is named, \"it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\" Giuliani's political adviser, Ted Goodman, decried what he called \"the continued weaponization of our justice system.\"\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans.\n\nTheir lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and \"failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.\"\n\nDays after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThe Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.\n\nIn December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMichigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThree fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump was indicted in August in federal court over efforts to cling to power after his defeat, including the fake electors scheme. The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday will hear arguments on his claim in that case that he can't be prosecuted for acts he committed while serving as president.\n\nIn early January, New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.\n\nThe so-called fake electors facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, past president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.\n\nIn a statement, Hoffman accused Mayes of weaponizing the attorney general's office in bringing the case but didn't directly comment on the indictment's allegations.\n\n\"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process,\" Hoffman said.\n\nNone of the others responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.\n\nAssociated Press writers Gabe Stern and Scott Sonner in Las Vegas, Kate Brumback in Atlanta and Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Those individuals have not yet been served, but details in the indictment make clear they include top Trump aides, including Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows.\n\nThese are the 11 Arizonans who signed documents claiming to be legitimate electors for Trump, though Democrat Joe Biden won Arizona's votes in the electoral college. Each is charged with the above counts.\n\nDig deeper: Learn more about Arizona's fake electors\n\nTyler Bowyer\n\nBowyer is the chief operating officer at Turning Point USA, a Phoenix-based nonprofit with a similarly named political advocacy arm. The nonprofit got its start advocating for conservative politics at high schools and universities, but it and its affiliated organizations have grown to become influential in the conservative culture wars. They have also drawn controversy for spreading false information, including about elections.\n\nBowyer is a committeeman for the Republican National Committee. He told The Arizona Republic in 2022 about the so-called fake elector plot, that he didn't know \"all the details and facts\" but confirmed he was an elector for the state GOP.\n\nNancy Cottle\n\nCottle chaired the Arizona Trump electors.\n\nShe was also subpoenaed by the House Select Committee investigating the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Cottle has served on the Arizona GOP Executive Committee and Maricopa County Republican Committee. She led the Pledge of Allegiance at a rally for former President Donald Trump in January 2022 in Florence, Ariz.\n\nJake Hoffman\n\nHoffman, of Queen Creek, is a state senator first elected to the Legislature in 2020. He is the founder of the Arizona Freedom Caucus, the political coalition that includes the state's most conservative lawmakers. Many of those lawmakers are aligned with Trump and the group generally supports conservative policies on social issues.\n\nHoffman is a top antagonist of Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs and is no stranger to criticizing Republicans he views as too moderate.\n\nHe announced earlier this year he would run to represent Arizona on the Republican National Committee, and he is seeking another term representing Legislative District 15 in the Arizona Senate, which includes Queen Creek, San Tan Valley and a portion of Mesa. He runs or has ownership shares of several marketing and advertising businesses, including one that was exposed years ago as a social media \"troll farm\" that spread disinformation.\n\nHe has largely avoided reporters' questions about the electors, saying in 2022 that they wanted to provide Congress and Vice President Mike Pence with \"dueling opinions,\" and earlier this year alleged Attorney General Kris Mayes was \"corrupt\" and using the office to \"persecute their political enemies.\"\n\nLearn more about the indictment: Grand jury indicts fake electors who falsely certified Donald Trump as 2020 winner\n\nAnthony Kern\n\nKern, a state senator from Glendale, was outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when it was breached by rioters and is an ardent Trump supporter. First elected to the Arizona Legislature in 2015, he is now running for a seat in Congress in a packed GOP primary.\n\nHe was fired a decade ago from the El Mirage Police Department in Phoenix's northwest suburbs for lying to a supervisor after a string of disciplinary issues and put on a roll of officers accused of dishonesty called the Brady list.\n\nKern has brushed off questions about the electors' case, saying he didn't need a lawyer. Last month, on the plaza outside a Maricopa County courthouse, Kern decried the investigation as a \"weaponization of our government\" that he said was motivated by an attempt to bankrupt him and keep him from Congress.\n\nJim Lamon\n\nLamon ran to represent Arizona in the U.S. Senate in 2022 but lost in the GOP primary.\n\nHe is the founder of Scottsdale-based Depcom Power, a solar engineering and construction company that employed 1,600 people across the nation before he sold the business. Lamon, a steady financial supporter of Republican causes and candidates, helped bankroll security for the Arizona Senate's much-criticized review of ballots cast in 2020.\n\nIn 2022, Lamon claimed during an interview with KTVK-TV in Phoenix that the electors were part of a backup plan in case Trump's election fraud claims proved successful.\n\n\"The Republican electors put forth a valid document that said, in the event that the election certification was overturned, there would be no excuse not to recognize those electors,\" Lamon said.\n\nThe documents themselves did not include such conditional language, however.\n\nRobert Montgomery\n\nMontgomery is a former head of the Cochise County Republican Committee. He led GOP leadership in Arizona's rural southeast corner until he was defeated by a surprise challenger in December 2022. Montgomery has supported hand-counting ballots and pushed county leaders to ignore warnings about doing so before the 2022 election.\n\nSamuel Moorhead\n\nMoorhead was the second vice chair of the Gila County Republican Party when he signed as a Trump elector, a ranking but not top position in the local Republican Party in one of Arizona's rural counties northeast of metro Phoenix.\n\nMoorhead served 17 years on the board of the Gila County Provisional Community College District before resigning in October to move closer to his daughter and grandson elsewhere in Arizona, according to meeting minutes.\n\nLoraine Pellegrino\n\nPellegrino was secretary for the Arizona Trump electors and has a long history of leadership in state GOP politics. She has led two conservative groups, the Arizona Federation of Republican Women, and the Ahwatukee Republican Women's Club, and was a delegate to Republican National Committee conventions in 2012, 2016 and 2020.\n\nPellegrino was subpoenaed by the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. She said in January 2022 the electors offered a contingency plan.\n\n\"We were electors for Trump and we were hoping things would change,\" she said. \"Just in case, we signed our paperwork to be ready in the event that something was overturned.\"\n\nGreg Safsten\n\nSafsten, who has worked as an adviser to several Republican congressmen from Arizona, was executive director of the Arizona Republican Party when he signed as a Trump elector.\n\nAccording to an online biography by Legistorm, Safsten worked as a field director in 2012 for then-Congressman Matt Salmon and then took on a role as a legislative assistant. Four years later he went to work for GOP Congressman Andy Biggs' campaign, ultimately becoming deputy chief of staff.\n\nKelli Ward\n\nKelli Ward is a past chair of the Arizona GOP. She helped to organize the signing of the fake electors, sat at the head of the table during the \"signing\" video and boasted about the moment on Twitter, The Arizona Republic has previously reported.\n\nWard was also subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 committee related to the elector scheme and exercised her Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate herself more than 200 times when later testifying before that committee.\n\nShe is an outspoken supporter of Trump's and a promoter of election conspiracies who helped Trump aides in their efforts to pressure GOP leaders in Arizona and filed multiple lawsuits trying to overturn Trump's loss in 2020. She is a former state lawmaker who twice ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate.\n\nMichael Ward\n\nA well-known GOP activist, Michael Ward was subpoenaed by the Department of Justice in its investigation of Trump's election interference. He has been married to Kelli Ward since 1995 and has served as her campaign manager in bids for the Arizona Legislature.\n\nArizona Republic reporters Ryan Randazzo, Richard Ruelas and Robert Anglen

During the December 2020 meetings, the Republicans passed \"alternate\" states of electors claiming that Trump won their state, and those certificates were then sent to Congress and the National Archives for when lawmakers certified the election results. The effort was overseen by the Trump campaign and its attorneys, including Giuliani and Chesebro, and was made public at the time. Though none of the slates were actually used in the final vote count -- Congress instead certified the actual slates of electors stating Biden won -- the effort has raised legal questions since the elector meetings took place, and false electors in Michigan and Georgia were ultimately indicted on charges related to conspiracy, forgery, impersonating public officers and making false statements and writings. Nevada's electors have been charged with offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument. The \"fake electors\" scheme was part of a broader effort by Trump and his allies to overturn the election results in battleground states, which also included efforts to pressure state officials and legislators, breach election equipment and bring dozens of lawsuits that ultimately failed in court.\n\nThe defendants in Arizona have not yet been arraigned and pleaded guilty or not guilty in the case. Criminal proceedings are still moving forward in Georgia, Michigan and Nevada, and electors in Michigan and Georgia who still have charges pending and have not reached deals with prosecutors have pleaded not guilty. It's also still possible that even states where charges have already been brought could still bring additional indictments; in addition to Wisconsin, Chesebro has reportedly cooperated with investigations in Arizona, Michigan and Nevada in hopes of avoiding charges in those states.\n\nEven though charges have been brought, it still remains to be seen if electors will ultimately be convicted in Arizona, Michigan, Georgia and Nevada. Legal experts suggested Democratic Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel may have undermined the state's case when she said in a September event with activists that she believed the electors were \"brainwashed\" and their cases would be heard by jurors from a \"very Democratic-leaning county.\" \"It undermines the validity of her prosecution theory,\" former federal prosecutor Shan Wu told CNN. \"If you think these people are brainwashed, then they didn't have the right state of mind and couldn't form the criminal intent to break the law.\" (Nessel has not commented on the remarks.)\n\nProsecutors in New Mexico also investigated fake electors in that state, but said in a January hearing they concluded that no criminal charges would be brought. New Mexico's officials didn't face charges because GOP officials in the state and Pennsylvania took more steps to protect themselves legally than false electors in other states. Most states' alternate electors filed certificates declaring they were the state's \"duly elected\" electors -- even though they weren't, since Biden was their state's actual winner and not Trump. Pennsylvania and New Mexico's certificates hedged by saying they're an alternate slate of electors just in case Biden's win in the states was invalidated, however, according to documents published by watchdog group American Oversight. That means that while most electors are now facing scrutiny for forging government documents -- since they claimed to be legitimate electors when they weren't -- the electors in those two states likely couldn't be prosecuted, Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, then attorney general, told CNN in 2022.\n\nRudy Giuliani And Mark Meadows Indicted In Arizona Fake Electors Case (Forbes)\n\nNevada attorney general is investigating false electors who

(RELATED: 'Trial By Ambush': Former Federal Prosecutors Say Alvin Bragg's Strategy Is Unlike Anything They've Seen Before)\n\n\"We're here because justice demands an answer to the efforts that the defendants and other unindicted co-conspirators allegedly took to undermine the will of Arizona's voters during the 2020 presidential election. Arizona's election was free and fair. The people of Arizona elected President Biden. Unwilling to accept this fact the defendants charged by the state grand jury allegedly schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency,\" Mayes stated.\n\n\"Whatever their reasoning was, the plot to violate the law must be answered for and I was elected to uphold the law of the state. The scheme, had it succeeded, would have deprived Arizona's voters of their right to have their votes counted for their chosen president. It effectively would have made their right to vote meaningless,\" she continued.\n\nWithin the charges released, 11 Arizona Republicans were named for allegedly submitting a document to Congress which falsely declared that Trump beat President Joe Biden in the state's election, according to Fox 10.\n\nThose affiliated with the state's GOP party charged in this case reportedly include in part former Arizona GOP chair Kelli Ward and husband Michael Ward, Turning Point USA executive Tyler Bowyer, Arizona Federation of Republican Women VP Nancy Cottle and State Sens. Jacob Hoffman and Anthony Kern. Former Senate candidate James Lamon, former Cochise County Republican Committee Chairman Robert Montgomery, precinct committee member Samuel Moorhead, Ahwatukee Republican Women President Lorraine Pellegrino and former Arizona Republican Party Executive Director Gregory Safsten were also charged, according to the outlet.\n\nThe charges come as Mayes' year-long investigation came to an end, joining three other states, Michigan, Georgia and Nevada, in seeking accountability from those allegedly involved in the 2020 elector strategy, The Washington Post reported. During a state GOP electors meeting on Dec. 14, 2020, members had allegedly signed a certificate claiming they were \"duly elected and qualified\" electors who believed Trump won the state election and sent the documents to Congress and National Archives, which were dismissed, according to Fox 40.\n\n\"Before an investigation had even been conducted and with no evidence, Kris Mayes declared that she believed electors such as myself were guilty of a crime, that it was her job to get Biden re-elected, and that she would control the timing of the indictment,\" Hoffman told Fox 10 in a response to the allegations.\n\n\"Now, unsurprisingly, we see that she has weaponized the once respected Attorney General's office to deliver an indictment of her Republican political opponents years after the events at issue, long after other Democrat prosecutors made their decisions, and right before Arizona's primary elections. Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process,\" Hoffman told the outlet.\n\nThe additional names were redacted from the indictment due to charges not being released to them, Fox 40 reported. The Washington Post reported that they were allegedly seven attorneys or aides associated with Trump. These names allegedly included former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, campaign advisor Boris Epshteyn, former campaign staffer Mike Roman, and attorneys Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis, John Eastman and Christina Bobb, according to the outlet.\n\nWhile Trump was reportedly not named in the document, but Mayes alleged him to be a co-conspirator in the allegations.\n\nNot all Trump connections responded to a request for comment from the Post. George Terwilliger, an attorney for Meadows, told the outlet that if his client \"is named in this indictment, it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\" Charles Burnham, Eastman's legal counsel, relayed that his client \"is innocent of criminal conduct in Arizona or any other place and will fight these charges as he has all the other unjust accusations leveled against him.\" Giuliani's spokesman, Ted Goodman, told the Post the indictment is a \"continued weaponization of our justice system should concern every American, as it does permanent, irrevocable harm to the country.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailycaller.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Caller"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The answer may not be as straightforward as you think.\n\nSource: Spencer Platt / Getty\n\nW\n\nelp, the hits just keep on coming for the band of rabid MAGA thugs who tried to steal an election by spreading propaganda about it being stolen from Donald Trump.\n\nAccording to AZ Central, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes (D) announced Wednesday that a grand jury had issued the nine-count indictment against seven top Trump aides and 11 Arizona Republicans who are accused of falsely certifying votes for the ex-president despite President Joe Biden narrowly winning the state.\n\nThe names and charges against the Trump aides are redacted in the indictment, but the document makes it clear who they are by describing in detail the roles they played in Trump's failed attempt at canceling democracy. Those defendants include Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman, former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, lawyers Jenna Ellis and Christina Bobb, and Trump advisers Boris Epshteyn and Michael Roman. Five of these individuals, Giuliani, Eastman, Meadows, Ellis and Roman, were also previously included in the sweeping election interference RICO indictment in Georgia. (Ellis pleaded guilty and threw all the other lawyers under the bus, so her co-defendants in this case should probably be keeping an eye on that one.)\n\nAs for the 11 fake electors, here's the list provided by AZ Central:\n\nTyler Bowyer, an executive with Turning Point USA and a committeeman for the Republican National Committee Nancy Cottle, who chaired the Arizona Trump electors State Sen. Jake Hoffman, R-Queen Creek State Sen. Anthony Kern, R-Glendale Jim Lamon, former U.S. Senate candidate Robert Montgomery, former chair of the Cochise County Republican Committee Samuel Moorhead, a former leader of the Gila County Republican Party Loraine Pellegrino, the secretary of the Arizona Trump electors Greg Safsten, former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party Kelli Ward, former chair of the Arizona Republican Party Michael Ward, her husband and a GOP activist\n\n\"Defendants and unindicted coconspirators schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency to keep Unindicted Coconspirator 1 in office against the will of Arizona's voters,\" the 58-page indictment reads.\n\nOf course, at least a couple of the defendants and their attorneys are already calling this a political witch hunt, because that's pretty much the go-to for Republicans who just can't stand being held accountable for the crimes they likely committed.\n\nHoffman, for example, claimed Mayes' investigation \"weaponized the once respected\" office.\n\n\"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process,\" Hoffman said in a statement.\n\nDennis Wilenchik, an attorney for Lamon, called his client's indictment a \"politically motivated prosecution,\" which is kind of an odd statement to make considering his client is a politician whose alleged crimes were carried out in the political sphere while declaring the results of the political process in which we elect our presidents and other officials. Calling a case like this \"politically motivated\" is like calling a murder investigation \"death motivated.\" Just saying -- these defendants and their representatives need to be a little more creative with their rhetoric because the cheat sheet they're all copying their homework from now sounds really, well, politically motivated.\n\nAnyway, it's worth mentioning that Mayes is the fifth prosecutor to bring criminal charges against numerous defendants accused of conspiring to overturn a legal and fair election.\n\nFrom Politico:\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith has charged Trump with federal crimes for those efforts. Prosecutors in Georgia have charged Trump and many of his allies for their efforts to overturn the results in that state, including the fake electors plot. Prosecutors in Michigan and Nevada have also charged Republicans who posed as fake electors in those states.\n\nMichigan prosecutors revealed Wednesday that Trump is an unindicted co-conspirator in their own investigation as well.\n\nAnother thing worth noting is the comedic irony that Christina Bobb, one of the indicted Trump aides, was recently promoted to a senior position at the Republican National Committee, which focuses on \"election integrity.\" (It's like if you hired Bill Cosby to watch your drink for you while you went to the bathroom.)\n\nAlso, can we just talk about how much Giuliani must wish he just sat there and ate his food at this point?\n\nI mean, this man was already drowning in litigation for lying about voting machines being rigged to favor Biden before he ended up owing former Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Wandrea Arshaye \"Shaye\" Moss $148 million after a judge found that he defamed the mother and daughter with baseless claims that they were involved in non-existent election fraud in 2020. (Although, that didn't stop him from continuing to defame them as recently as earlier this month.) Last August, it was reported that Giuliani was begging Trump to pay his legal fees, which probably had something to do with why his former lawyers filed a lawsuit against him a month later alleging that he had only paid a small fraction of the legal fees he owes, which amounts to nearly $1.6 million. Seriously, Giuliani's journey of L's might just be unmatched.\n\nAnd to think, all of this could have been avoided if Trump and his team of Trumpanzees would have simply accepted the reality that the MAGA messiah lost in 2020. It really is just that simple.\n\nSee Also:\n\nGiuliani On The Hook For $43M After Lying About 2020 Elections And Election Workers, Ruby Freeman and Daughter\n\nGiuliani Lied About Black People And Is

The indictment also appeared to list former President Donald Trump as \"Unindicted Coconspirator 1.\"\n\nProsecutors charged Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, and a slate of Arizona Republicans with multiple felonies in a 58-page indictment made public on Wednesday. The charges are related to what prosecutors allege were efforts to overturn the 2020 election in favor of Donald Trump, who was also deemed an unindicted coconspirator in the case.\n\nThe indictment, which was obtained by The Washington Post, was handed up by a grand jury on Wednesday in Maricopa County, Arizona. Prosecutors charged the defendants with conspiracy, fraudulent schemes and artifices, fraudulent schemes and practices, and forgery.\n\nIn the indictment, prosecutors accused the defendants of trying to keep Trump in the office of the presidency \"against the will of Arizona's voters.\"\n\nEleven Arizona GOP \"fake electors\" were named as defendants; they were each charged with nine felony counts.\n\nOther defendants' names were redacted. The Post reported that they included former Trump lawyers Jenna Ellis, John Eastman, and Christina Bobb; former Trump campaign aide Mike Roman; and Trump campaign advisor Boris Epshteyn. Giuliani's and Meadows' names were also redacted from the indictment. The Post said descriptions of the individuals' actions made their identities evident, and that the names were redacted until the individuals could be served the indictment\n\nTed Goodman, a political advisor to Giuliani, said in a statement to Business Insider when reached about the indictment: \"The continued weaponization of our justice system should concern every Americans as it does permanent, irrevocable harm to the country.\"\n\nMeadows, Ellis, Bobb, Roman, and Epshteyn, or their representatives, did not respond to requests for comment from BI. The Arizona Republicans did not respond to requests for comment or could not be reached.\n\nCharles Burnham, an attorney for Eastman told Business Insider: \"The phenomenon of partisan lawfare grows more troubling by the day. Professor Eastman is innocent of criminal conduct in Arizona or any other place and will fight these charges as he has all the other unjust accusations leveled against him.\"\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer for Meadows, told the Post he hadn't seen the indictment but said, \"If Mr. Meadows is named in this indictment, it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\"\n\nThe indictment also referred to \"Unindicted Coconspirator 1,\" who is described as \"a former president of the United States who spread false claims of election fraud following the 2020 election.\" Another four people who are not named are referred to as unindicted coconspirators.\n\nA representative for Trump and the Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BI.\n\nArizona was one of several states, including Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Nevada, in which so-called fake electors tried to cast electoral votes for Trump despite Joe Biden winning the election in their state.\n\nThe Arizona attorney general's office did not respond to a request for comment from BI.\n\nThe indictment comes as Trump runs for president again while also facing several criminal cases, including two cases related to efforts to overturn the election -- one in Georgia and one at the federal level -- and one related to documents found at Mar-a-Lago. Trump is currently on trial in New York for a case related to a hush-money payment.\n\nHe has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty in all four cases.\n\nRead the original article on

The Arizona indictment, charging a slew of felonies, shows that weeks after the 2020 election, concerns about \"legal exposure\" were raised by Pennsylvania lawyers but were scoffed at by a Trump ally who remarked \"f -- these guys.\"\n\nThe indictment began by hitting former Arizona GOP chair Kelli Ward, her husband Michael Ward, Tyler Bowyer, Nancy Cottle, Jacob Hoffman, Anthony Kern, James Lamon, Robert Montgomery, Samuel Moorhead, Lorraine Pellegrino, and Gregory Safsten with nine felony counts each in the state conspiracy, fraud, forgery, and public record tampering case that stemmed from \"The Signing,\" which the Arizona GOP publicly posted on Dec. 14, 2020.\n\nBut beyond the signers of a document holding themselves out as legitimate electors, several of Trump's post-2020 election lawyers and advisors were also hit with indictments (though their names were redacted since they had not yet been served, as Arizona AG Kris Mayes, a former Republican who became a Democrat in 2019, explained).\n\nStill, it was easy to identify former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, top Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, Trump campaign lawyer Boris Epshteyn, former Trump campaign lawyer Jenna Ellis, former OAN reporter turned Trump lawyer Christina Bobb (recently minted as the Republican National Committee's \"election integrity\" lawyer), former Trump campaign aide Mike Roman, and John Eastman, the retired law professor facing possible disbarment over the so-called Jan. 6 \"coup memo.\"\n\n\"Defendants' attempts to declare Unindicted Coconspirator 1 and Pence the winners of the 2020 Presidential Election contrary to voter intent and the law, involved numerous other charged and uncharged coconspirators,\" the indictment said, alleging a \"scheme to keep [Trump] in office against the will of Arizona voters.\"\n\nThe indictment, which you can read here, identified Trump as \"Unindicted Coconspirator 1,\" but there are several other unindicted figures, including attorney Ken Chesebro (\"Unindicted Coconspirator 4\"), a central behind-the-scenes figure in fake elector schemes across the key states that Trump lost. The documents detailed how Trump's son, though it did not say which one, texted on Nov. 5, 2020, a way to overturn the election with one \"very simple\" trick.\n\n\"It's very simple if through our lawsuits and recounts the Secretary of States [sic] on each state cannot 'certify' that states vote the State Assemblies can step in and vote to put forward the electoral slate Republicans control Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina etc. we get Trump electors,\" the text said.\n\nOne day later, an Arizona congressional rep pushed the fake \"a look doors\" scheme and received and \"I love it\" response.\n\nChesebro's communications in the weeks the followed appeared to clearly establish that there were worries in some Republican quarters about signing documents claiming, without \"contingency language,\" that the fake electors were \"duly elected and qualified.\" But those concerns were casually disregarded two days before \"The Signing.\"\n\n\"During a conference call on December 12, 2020, a Pennsylvania attorney expressed concern that the certificate of vote falsely claimed that the Republican electors were the 'duly elected and certified electors,'\" the indictment said. \"He requested adding language to the certificates indicating that the Trump-Pence electors' votes were contingent on being certified the duly elected and qualified electors.\"\n\nKen Chesebro then texted \"Mike,\" appearing to be Mike Roman, about those concerns.\n\n\"Mike, I think the language at start of certificate should be changed in all states. Let's look at the language carefully,\" Chesebro said.\n\n\"I don't,\" the text recipient replied.\n\nThe indictment added that when Chesebro said he could \"help with drafting in a couple hours,\" the answer he got was: \"f -- these guys,\" seeming to refer to the Pennsylvania lawyers who pointed out potential legal issues.\n\nThe next day, Chesebro said in an email: \"Mike, here is my suggested language for dealing with the concern raised in the PA conference call about Electors possibly facing legal exposure (at the hands of a partisan AG) if they seem to certify that they are currently valid Electors.\"\n\n\"Easily fixed ....\" he added, \"It strike [sic] me that if inserting these few words is a good idea for PA, it might be worth suggesting to Electors in other states.\"", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They include Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows and former Trump attorney John Eastman -- as well Boris Epshteyn, who remains one of Trump's closest advisers and a current member of his 2024 campaign team.\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes also announced charges against 11 named alleged fake electors and seven people whose names are redacted in the filing for their alleged role in efforts to subvert Joe Biden's 2020 victory in the state.\n\nThe charges include fraud, forgery, and conspiracy.\n\n\"Unindicted Coconspirator 1\" in the indictment appears to be Trump as the language of the document says they were involved in a scheme to keep him and former Vice President Mike Pence \"in office against the will of Arizona's voters.\"\n\nBased on a review of descriptions of the seven redacted names in the Arizona indictment, the additional co-defendants are Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, Boris Epshteyn (Trump 2024 senior adviser), John Eastman, Christina Bobb (RNC senior counsel for election integrity), Jenna Ellis and Mike Roman.\n\nRudy Giuliani\n\nThe indictment described one individual, appearing to match the description of Rudy Giuliani, as \"the mayor\" who \"spread false claims of election fraud.\"\n\nThe full description from the filing reads: \"An attorney for Unindicted Coconspirator 1 who was often identified as 'the Mayor.' He spread false claims of election fraud in Arizona and nationally shortly after November 3, 2020. He presided over a 'hearing' in downtown Phoenix on November 30, 2020, where he falsely claimed that Arizona's election officials 'have made no effort to find out' if the results of the recent presidential election were accurate. He pressured the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors and Arizona legislators to change the outcome of Arizona's election, and he was responsible for encouraging Republican electors in Arizona and in six other contested states to vote for Trump-Pence on December 14, 2020.\"\n\nIn a statement to ABC News Wednesday night, an adviser to Giuliani said, \"The continued weaponization of our justice system should concern every American, from Arizona to Michigan and everywhere in between, as it does permanent, irrevocable harm to the country.\"\n\nMark Meadows\n\nThe indictment also described another indicted individual as the \"chief of staff\" in 2020 -- appearing to match Mark Meadows's description.\n\nFull description: \"[REDACTED] was Unindicted Coconspirator 1's Chief of Staff in 2020. He worked with members of the Trump Campaign to coordinate and implement the false Republican electors' votes in Arizona and six other states. was involved in the many efforts to keep Unindicted Coconspirator 1 in power despite his defeat at the polls.\"\n\nBoris Epshteyn\n\nThe charging document details an attorney and adviser for Trump's 2016 and 2020 campaigns who helped implement \"the scheme to submit false Republican electors.\"\n\nFull description: \"[REDACTED] was an attorney and was an advisor to the Trump Campaigns in 2016 and 2020. in implementing the scheme to submit false Republican electors' votes for Trump-Pence in Arizona and to obstruct the certification process during the January 6, 2021, Joint Session of Congress in Washington.\"\n\nJohn Eastman\n\nThe indictment details an attorney who \"spread false claims of widespread election fraud\" and pressured former Arizona Speaker of the House Rusty Bowers to convene a Special Session. Bowers has detailed how Eastman told him to \"just do it and let the court sort it out.\"\n\nFull description: \"[REDACTED] was an attorney who encouraged the Republican electors to vote on December 14, 2020, and spread false claims of widespread election fraud. He also pressured the legislature in Arizona and six other states to change the outcome of the election. For example, on January 4, 2021, pushed then-Arizona Speaker of the House Rusty Bowers to convene a Special Session to decertify Arizona's presidential electors, telling him to 'just do it and let the court sort it out.' Bowers declined to do so. Also on January 4, met at the White House with Unindicted Coconspirator 1, Pence, and others to convince Pence to reject or at least delay the confirmation of the lawfully chosen electors two days later at the Joint Session of Congress.\"\n\nChristina Bobb\n\nThe indictment describes an attorney for Trump who \"lobbied\" Arizona legislators and also helped organize the fake electors plot. Bobb was a part of the Trump campaign until recently being named the Republican National Committee's senior counsel for \"election integrity.\"\n\nFull description: \"[REDACTED] Campaign and worked closely with was an attorney for the Trump lobbied Arizona's Republican legislators after the 2020 presidential election to disregard the popular vote in Arizona. She additionally helped organize the false Arizona Republican electors' votes on December 14, 2020.\"\n\nJenna Ellis\n\nThe charging document also lists an attorney who \"worked closely\" with another individual who was also charged and spread false election claims in AZ and six other states.\n\nFull description: \"[REDACTED] was an attorney for the Trump Campaign and worked closely with She made false claims of widespread election fraud in Arizona and in six other states. encouraged the Arizona Legislature to change the outcome of the election. She also encouraged Pence to accept the false Arizona Republican electors' votes on January 6, 2021.\"\n\nMike Roman\n\nThe indictment lists the \"director of election day operations for the Trump Campaign,\" which was Roman's position.\n\nFull description: \"[REDACTED] was the Director of Election Day Operations for the Trump Campaign. He worked closely with Unindicted Coconspirator 4, and others to organize the false Republican electors' votes in Arizona and in six other states.\"\n\nMayes said in a release all the names would be unredacted when all defendants have been served.\n\nIn a video posted to X Wednesday night, Mayes said the defendants charged were \"unwilling to accept Arizona's election was free and fair\" and allegedly schemed to \"prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency.\"\n\n\"We're here because justice demands an answer to the efforts of the defendants and other unindicted co-conspirators allegedly took to undermine the will of Arizona's voters during the 2020 presidential election,\" Mayes said.\n\n\"Arizona's election was free and fair. The people of Arizona elected President Biden. Unwilling to accept this fact, the defendants charged by the state grand jury, allegedly schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency,\" she continued.\n\n\"Whatever their reasoning was, the plot to violate the law must be answered for and I was elected to uphold the law of this state,\" Mayes added. \"The scheme, had it succeeded, would have deprived Arizona's voters of their right to have their votes counted for their chosen president.\"\n\nIn filing the indictment, Arizona becomes the fourth state to file criminal charges against the so-called \"fake electors\" who allegedly announced they were ready to pledge electoral votes to Donald Trump in their respective states during the 2020 election, despite Joe Biden winning those states.\n\nThe 11 current named defendants in the indictment whose names are visible on the court document are Kelli Ward, Tyler Bower, Nancy Cottle, Jacob Hoffman, Anthony Kern, James Lamon, Robert Montgomery, Samuel Moorhead, Lorraine Pellegrino, Gregory Safsten and Michael Ward.\n\nAccording to the indictment, 11 Republicans met in Arizona in December 2020, including then-Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward, two Republican lawmakers, and a top official with the Republican National Committee, and signed documents that falsely claimed they were Arizona's rightful electors.\n\n\"Today, Arizona's 11 Republican presidential electors met to cast their votes for President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence,\" the Arizona GOP tweeted in December 2020. \"With ongoing legal challenges to the 2020 presidential election still being heard in the courts across the country holding hearings on election fraud and voting irregularities, it is imperative that the proper elections are counted by Congress.\"\n\nAll 11 alleged fake electors were also part of a legal challenge in the state that sought to challenge the election results based on allegations of voter fraud. The case was thrown out by a judge who called their claims of election fraud \"sorely wanting of relevant or reliable evidence.\"\n\nRusty Bowers, then the Arizona House speaker, told the House Jan. 6 committee that following the election he received calls from Trump and attorney Rudy Giuliani claiming that there was election fraud in the state.\n\n\"I was insistent that I had to have proof, real proof, judicial level,\" Bowers testified. \"That's the kind of proof I'm talking about. And the president said, 'Rudy, give the man what he wants.'\"\n\nAsked by ABC News' Jonathan Karl if Giuliani ever provided that evidence, Bowers said, \"He never gave us anything. No names, no data, nothing.\"\n\nBowers also said that Giuliani and attorney Jenna Ellis flew to Phoenix and met with him and other Arizona lawmakers, and asked them to convene the legislature to investigate their unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud.\n\nIn December, Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford announced felony charges against six alleged \"fake electors\" in that state. In Michigan, Attorney General Dana Nessel similarly charged 16 \"alternate electors\" in July for conspiracy to commit forgery, among other charges. And in Georgia, three such \"fake electors\" were among the 18 co-defendants charged, along with Trump, in a sweeping racketeering indictment for alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in that state.\n\nAll defendants charged in all three probes have pleaded not guilty, with Georgia defendants Jenna Ellis, Kenneth Chesebro, Sidney Powell and Scott Hall subsequently taking plea deals in exchange for agreeing to testify in that case. In Michigan, the attorney general dropped all charges against defendant Jim Renner in exchange for his cooperation.\n\nABC News previously reported that Trump's Georgia co-defendant Michael Roman was subpoenaed as part of the Arizona probe and that Chesebro sat for a voluntary interview with Arizona investigators in recent weeks.", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The indicted individuals face charges of fraud, forgery and conspiracy. The indictment names 11 of the 18 individuals, but seven names remain redacted and shielded from public knowledge.\n\nThe indictment centers around the individuals' collective effort to \"prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency to keep [Trump] in office against the will of Arizona's voters.\" The indictment charges the 11 named individuals with nine counts each for their involvement in the scheme, which the indictment claims \"would have deprived Arizona voters of their right to vote and have their votes counted.\"\n\nThe 11 named individuals include Kelli Ward, Tyler Bowyer, Nancy Cottle, Jacob Hoffman, Anthony Kern, James Lamon, Robert Montgomery, Samuel Moorhead, Lorraine Pellegrino, Gregory Safsten and Michael Ward. The other seven individuals have not yet been publicly identified, but based on media reports and details within the indictment, the other seven include Mark Meadows, Rudy Giuliani, Boris Epshteyn, John Eastman, Jenna Ellis, Christina Bobb and Mike Roman. Trump is not included in the indictment, though there is speculation that he is referred to throughout the indictment as \"Unindicted CoConspirator 1.\"\n\nThe 58-page indictment alleges that the indicted individuals wrongly engaged in electing a false slate of presidential electors to represent Trump -- despite Trump losing the state's popular vote, and therefore its presidential electors. This was part of a larger scheme by Trump loyalists to have former Vice President Mike Pence reject the certification of current President Joe Biden's electoral victory on January 6, 2021. The plan was for Pence to reject states' real electoral slates. Pence was then to either \"delay the proceeding and have individual state legislatures determine their electors, or have Congress resolve any claimed uncertainty about the validity of election results in Arizona and six other states in [Trump's] favor.\" If Congress were to do the latter, the false slate of electors would be needed.\n\nArizona prosecutors assert that the indicted individuals' efforts to establish a false slate of electors were illegal. The indictment centers around American election law, including the federal Electoral Count Act of 1887 (ECA), which establishes the vote-counting procedures for the presidential eleciton.\n\nIn the US, would-be presidents are not selected based solely on the popular vote (the total amount of votes they receive across the country), but rather on how many electoral college votes they receive. In order to win the office of the presidency, a candidate must win 270 electoral college votes out of the total 538 votes available across all US states and territories.\n\nDifferent states and territories determine how their electoral college votes are awarded based off of different systems, but Arizona awards its electoral college votes to whichever candidate wins the state's popular vote. Arizona prosecutors allege that all 11 named individuals participated in a Republican-led effort to put forward an alternate slate of presidential for Trump even though the former president lost the state's popular vote. As a result, the 11 individuals now face nine criminal counts each. The charges include conspiracy, fraudulent schemes and artifices, fraudulent schemes and practices, and five instances of forgery. All nine counts are felony offenses in the state of Arizona.\n\nThe indictment also details the actions undertaken in Arizona by the 18 indicted individuals in the months leading up to and following the November 3, 2020 presidential election, including multiple legal challenges and a pressure campaign. Neither the legal challenges nor the pressure campaign were ultimately successful.\n\nFollowing the release of the indictment, Attorney General Mayes said, \"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined. It is too important.\" Mayes also stated that the investigation into efforts to undermine Arizona's 2020 election process remains ongoing.", "source": {"uri": "jurist.org", "dataType": "news",

general said Wednesday, with US media identifying the ex-president's lawyer Rudy Giuliani among those indicted.\n\nThe felony indictments, which allege a conspiracy to award Arizona's slate of electors to the defeated real estate magnate, are the latest effort by a state to hold accountable those who backed Trump's false claim that he won the presidential vote.\n\nArizona's Attorney General Kris Mayes said a grand jury had returned indictments on 11 local Republicans, including the party's former state chair, and seven others from out of state, whose names were redacted until all have been served with papers.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the seven include former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, attorneys Jenna Ellis, John Eastman and campaign adviser Boris Epshteyn, as well as Giuliani, who acted as Trump's personal lawyer.\n\nThe former president himself was not charged, but was named as an unindicted co-conspirator, the Post said.\n\nDemocrat Joe Biden won Arizona, a critical election battleground, by just over 10,000 votes, but many Republican Party officials insisted -- without evidence -- that there had been fraud and that Trump had been the real winner.\n\nElectors -- representatives of the winning candidate in each state -- sign official documents that are sent to Congress after presidential elections.\n\nDespite Trump's loss in Arizona, his representatives nonetheless signed documents saying he had won.\n\nMore from this section Exhausted Korda withdraws from LA stop after fifth win in a row WADA reject cover-up charge, China labels reports 'fake news' In Ecuadoran Amazon, butterflies provide a gauge of climate change\n\nThe fake electors strategy was allegedly part of a plan to obstruct the certification of Biden's presidential victory by Congress on January 6, 2021.\n\nArizona is the fourth state to seek charges against people who tried to form an alternative slate of electors, after Michigan, Georgia and Nevada.\n\nMeadows, Giuliani, Ellis and Eastman have all been charged in Georgia, alongside Trump in what is probably the most explosive of the four criminal trials he faces.\n\nWednesday's charges come as Trump is once again running for the White House, and still baselessly insisting that he won in 2020.\n\nOpinion polls show he is in a close race with an unpopular Biden.\n\nAs a swing state and something of a ground zero for election conspiracy theories peddled by rightwing Republicans, Arizona is once again expected to be closely contested this November when Americans head to the polls.\n\nhg/mlm", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@reformer.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse",

The indictment includes charges against Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, and others in connection with the scheme Trump was pursuing in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election. Trump is named an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nThe indictment is posted online here. Politico's story on the indictment deciphers the names redacted from the indictment at present.\n\nPolitico also identifies defendants whose names are visible in the version of the indictment released by the Arizona attorney general's office Wednesday evening as the 11 Republicans who posed as the state's presidential electors. They include former Arizona GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward, state senators Jake Hoffman and Anthony Kern, and Arizona's RNC committeeman Tyler Bowyer.\n\nI asked my friend Andrew McCarthy to comment on the indictment. This is what he had to say:\n\nI think it's revisionist history and tells half a story. In real time, January 2021, nobody believed the cobbling together of Trump electors in contested states was a coup effort. It was a contingency: If Trump had prevailed in any of his unlikely challenges, the Trump electors could be swapped in for the prior Biden elector slates.\n\nI think whatever documents they executed were with that understanding. No one thought those slates would be operative unless Trump prevailed in state court or the state legislature.\n\nI've always thought this was a big tell: If the so-called fake electors scheme was a crime, why has Smith not indicted it? It's mentioned in the Trump indictment, but it's not charged as a crime, nor have any electors or those coordinating them been indicted for fraud, false statements, or manipulating evidence.\n\nIn other words -- one more front in the Democrats' election interference and lawfare campaign .", "source": {"uri": "powerlineblog.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Power Line"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_johnson@powerlineblog.com", "name": "Scott Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Giuliani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Hoffman_(Arizona_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Hoffman (Arizona politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Kern", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Kern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelli_Ward", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kelli Ward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_fake_electors_plot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trump fake electors plot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State legislature (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.powerlineblog.com/ed-assets/2024/04/Investigation-2.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510566", "eventUri": "eng-9510566", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

attorney general said Wednesday, with US media identifying the ex-president's lawyer Rudy Giuliani among those indicted.\n\nThe felony indictments, which allege a conspiracy to award Arizona's slate of electors to the defeated real estate magnate, are the latest effort by a state to hold accountable those who backed Trump's false claim that he won the presidential vote.\n\nArizona's Attorney General Kris Mayes said a grand jury had returned indictments on 11 local Republicans, including the party's former state chair, and seven others from out of state, whose names were redacted until all have been served with papers.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the seven include former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, attorneys Jenna Ellis, John Eastman and campaign adviser Boris Epshteyn, as well as Giuliani, who acted as Trump's personal lawyer.\n\nThe former president himself was not charged, but was named as an unindicted co-conspirator, the Post said.\n\nDemocrat Joe Biden won Arizona, a critical election battleground, by just over 10,000 votes, but many Republican Party officials insisted -- without evidence -- that there had been fraud and that Trump had been the real winner.\n\nElectors -- representatives of the winning candidate in each state -- sign official documents that are sent to Congress after presidential elections.\n\nDespite Trump's loss in Arizona, his representatives nonetheless signed documents saying he had won.\n\nThe fake electors strategy was allegedly part of a plan to obstruct the certification of Biden's presidential victory by Congress on January 6, 2021.\n\nArizona is the fourth state to seek charges against people who tried to form an alternative slate of electors, after Michigan, Georgia and Nevada.\n\nMeadows, Giuliani, Ellis and Eastman have all been charged in Georgia, alongside Trump in what is probably the most explosive of the four criminal trials he faces.\n\nWednesday's charges come as Trump is once again running for the White House, and still baselessly insisting that he won in 2020.\n\nOpinion polls show he is in a close race with an unpopular Biden.\n\nAs a swing state and something of a ground zero for election conspiracy theories peddled by rightwing Republicans, Arizona is once again expected to be closely contested this November when Americans head to the polls.\n\nhg/mlm\n\nMore

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a press release announcing the charges that those names would be made public after all of the defendants had been served with the indictment.\n\nTrump lawyer Rudy Giuliani is among those indicted, said his spokesperson Ted Goodman, although the former New York mayor's name is redacted.\n\n\"The continued weaponization of our justice system should concern every Americans as it does permanent, irrevocable harm to the country. Mayor Rudy Giuliani - one of the most effective prosecutors in American history who took down the Mafia, cleaned up the streets of New York and locked up corrupt public officials - is proud to stand up for the countless Americans who raised legitimate concerns surrounding the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election,\" Goodman said.\n\nThe indictment also identifies one defendant as chief of staff in 2020, the position Mark Meadows held in the Trump White House at that time.\n\nRepresentatives for Meadows and Trump did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nU.S. presidents are chosen by electors from each state, who cast votes in the Electoral College, where votes are allotted based on each state's population.\n\nIn Arizona and almost all other states, the winner of the state's popular vote receives all of that state's electoral votes. To win the presidency a candidate needs 270 votes - a majority of total 538 electoral votes.\n\nArizona has 11 electoral votes, and the 11 defendants named in the indictment would correspond to those people who purported to be Arizona's electors for Trump.\n\nArizona was one of seven states where Trump allies sought to award those state's electoral votes to Trump even those states were won by Biden.\n\nThe false electors scheme figures in two criminal trials, in Washington, D.C., and Georgia, charging Trump with unlawfully seeking to overturn Biden's victory.\n\n(Reporting by Daniel Trotta, Eric Beech and Dan Whitcomb; Editing by William Mallard)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Those individuals have not yet been served, but details in the indictment make clear they include top Trump aides, including Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows.\n\nThese are the 11 Arizonans who signed documents claiming to be legitimate electors for Trump, though Democrat Joe Biden won Arizona's votes in the electoral college. Each is charged with the above counts.\n\nBowyer is the chief operating officer at Turning Point USA, a Phoenix-based nonprofit with a similarly named political advocacy arm. The nonprofit got its start advocating for conservative politics at high schools and universities, but it and its affiliated organizations have grown to become influential in the conservative culture wars. They have also drawn controversy for spreading false information, including about elections.\n\nBowyer is a committeeman for the Republican National Committee. He told The Arizona Republic in 2022 about the so-called fake elector plot, that he didn't know \"all the details and facts\" but confirmed he was an elector for the state GOP.\n\nShe was also subpoenaed by the House Select Committee investigating the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Cottle has served on the Arizona GOP Executive Committee and Maricopa County Republican Committee. She led the Pledge of Allegiance at a rally for former President Donald Trump in January 2022 in Florence, Ariz.\n\nJake Hoffman\n\nHoffman, of Queen Creek, is a state senator first elected to the Legislature in 2020. He is the founder of the Arizona Freedom Caucus, the political coalition that includes the state's most conservative lawmakers. Many of those lawmakers are aligned with Trump and the group generally supports conservative policies on social issues.\n\nHoffman is a top antagonist of Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs and is no stranger to criticizing Republicans he views as too moderate.\n\nHe announced earlier this year he would run to represent Arizona on the Republican National Committee, and he is seeking another term representing Legislative District 15 in the Arizona Senate, which includes Queen Creek, San Tan Valley and a portion of Mesa. He runs or has ownership shares of several marketing and advertising businesses, including one that was exposed years ago as a social media \"troll farm\" that spread disinformation.\n\nHe has largely avoided reporters' questions about the electors, saying in 2022 that they wanted to provide Congress and Vice President Mike Pence with \"dueling opinions,\" and earlier this year alleged Attorney General Kris Mayes was \"corrupt\" and using the office to \"persecute their political enemies.\"\n\nLearn more about the indictment:Grand jury indicts fake electors who falsely certified Donald Trump as 2020 winner\n\nAnthony Kern\n\nKern, a state senator from Glendale, was outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when it was breached by rioters and is an ardent Trump supporter. First elected to the Arizona Legislature in 2015, he is now running for a seat in Congress in a packed GOP primary.\n\nHe was fired a decade ago from the El Mirage Police Department in Phoenix's northwest suburbs for lying to a supervisor after a string of disciplinary issues and put on a roll of officers accused of dishonesty called the Brady list.\n\nKern has brushed off questions about the electors' case, saying he didn't need a lawyer. Last month, on the plaza outside a Maricopa County courthouse, Kern decried the investigation as a \"weaponization of our government\" that he said was motivated by an attempt to bankrupt him and keep him from Congress.\n\nJim Lamon\n\nLamon ran to represent Arizona in the U.S. Senate in 2022 but lost in the GOP primary.\n\nHe is the founder of Scottsdale-based Depcom Power, a solar engineering and construction company that employed 1,600 people across the nation before he sold the business. Lamon, a steady financial supporter of Republican causes and candidates, helped bankroll security for the Arizona Senate's much-criticized review of ballots cast in 2020.\n\nIn 2022, Lamon claimed during an interview with KTVK-TV in Phoenix that the electors were part of a backup plan in case Trump's election fraud claims proved successful.\n\n\"The Republican electors put forth a valid document that said, in the event that the election certification was overturned, there would be no excuse not to recognize those electors,\" Lamon said.\n\nThe documents themselves did not include such conditional language, however.\n\nRobert Montgomery\n\nMontgomery is a former head of the Cochise County Republican Committee.

Ken Chesebro, an attorney who helped devise Trump's post-election strategy, is described as \"unindicted coconspirator 4.\n\n\"The only defendants whose names are visible in the version of the indictment released by the Arizona attorney general's office Wednesday evening are the 11 Republicans who falsely posed as the state's presidential electors despite Joe Biden's narrow victory there. Among them: former Arizona GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward, state senators Jake Hoffman and Anthony Kern, and Arizona's RNC committeeman Tyler Bowyer.\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, has been helming the aggressive investigation. Though she initially appeared to be focused primarily on the false electors, in recent months she issued a wave of subpoenas to figures in Trump's national orbit.\n\nMayes is the fifth prosecutor to bring criminal charges over the sprawling, multi-state bid by Trump and his allies to upend the 2020 results.

The Office of Attorney General Kris Mayes has charged all of them with a conspiracy under Arizona state law to overturn the popular vote in the state.\n\nThe list of indicted co-defendants includes seven (7) national figures: Mark Meadows, Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, Boris Epshteyn, Mike Roman, Jenna Ellis, and Christina Bobb.\n\nThe eleven (11) other co-defendants are all the false electors in the 2020 election. That list notably includes Kelli Ward, who served as the chair of the Arizona Republican Party during the 2020 presidential election.\n\nNotably, like Georgia, criminal trials in Arizona can be publicly broadcast.\n\nSome highlights follow.\n\n1. The conspicuous absence of Donald Trump\n\nThe Arizona indictment raises a question. How is it possible that Trump's two alter egos have been indicted but the former president -- the ego in that equation -- has not?\n\nThe two alter egos are Trump White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. *Trump's absence from the indicted co-defendants list is all the more puzzling since Trump is identifiable as \"Unindicted Coconspirator 1\" in the Attorney General's court filings. Coincidentally, on Wednesday, April 24, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel's office testified in that state's court that Trump, Meadows, and Giuliani are \"unindicted co-conspirators\" in the Michigan state prosecution of false electors.\n\n*snip*", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Mayes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kris Mayes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Meadows_(Michigan_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Meadows (Michigan politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Ellis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jenna Ellis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelli_Ward", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kelli Ward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_America_News_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "One America News Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Epshteyn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boris Epshteyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Republican_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Republican Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Giuliani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Chief of Staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510566", "eventUri": "eng-9510566", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 1497, "textEnd": 1505}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

-the former mayor of New York City turned Trump attorney - alongside a group of other Trump allies and 11 \"alternate electors\" who signed documents purporting to be the state's valid electors in December 2020.\n\nAmong those indicted includes Boris Epshteyn, a longtime Trump adviser, whom Cobb noted is still \"very much\" in Trump's \"inner circle.\"\n\n\"And very protective of the former president and protective to the point that Giuliani reached when he arguably sold his soul to protect the president under circumstances that were improper,\" he continued.\n\nThe Arizona grand jury indictment accuses seven Trump aides and 11 pro-Trump Arizona Republicans of allegedly attempting to prevent the lawful transfer of power from Trump to President Biden following the 2020 election.\n\nThe 18 defendants are accused of carrying out a scheme to raise false claims of election fraud to pressure Arizona election officials to overturn Biden's slim win in the state by just more than 10,000 votes.\n\n\"In Arizona, and the United States, the people elected Joseph Biden as President on November 3, 2020,\" the indictment read.\n\n\"Unwilling to accept this fact, Defendants

The term of the day, explained", "body": "Americans commonly think the popular vote is what elects presidents. Win the vote in a certain number of states and you take over the Oval Office, right?\n\nWell, there's a technicality: one of the processes built into the U.S. Constitution by the nation's founders. It's called the Electoral College.\n\nEach state receives the same number of votes in the Electoral College as the number of representatives it has in Congress. Arizona has nine members of the House of Representatives and two U.S. senators. Hence, it has 11 electoral votes. The District of Columbia has three electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College, according to the National Archives and Records Administration.\n\nThat adds up to 538 electoral votes, meaning a candidate has to pick up 270 to win.\n\nArizona indictments:Grand jury indicts fake electors who falsely certified Donald Trump as 2020 winner\n\nWho selects the electors?\n\nEach presidential candidate in Arizona has 11 electors on the ballot under the candidate's name. Political parties in the state select their slates of electors from among elected officials, state party leaders or other notable party members.\n\nThe winning candidate's electors are appointed as the electors in Arizona, and almost every other state, in a winner-take-all format. Nebraska and Maine have proportional distribution of the electors.\n\nAfter an election is decided and the results are approved by the state, the slate of electors for the winning candidate gets to do its job. It certifies the election with a document sent to Congress and the National Archives.\n\nIn Arizona, then-Gov. Doug Ducey and other state officials certified the election in Arizona on Nov. 30, 2020. President-elect Joe Biden's 0.3 percentage-point margin was easily the closest presidential contest in state history. Then-Secretary of State Katie Hobbs signed the official election results, compiled from the final tallies of Arizona's 15 counties, alongside Ducey, Attorney General Mark Brnovich and Chief Justice Robert Brutinel.\n\nWhat did the electors meetings look like in Arizona in 2020?\n\nThe meeting of the electors takes place on the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December after the general election, according to the National Archives.\n\nAt noon on Dec. 14, 2020, Arizona's Democratic electors certified the election in Arizona was won by Biden. Their votes were recorded on what is called a Certificate of Vote.\n\nBut on the same day, a group of prominent Republicans, including the state party's former chair, Kelli Ward, and current state lawmakers Anthony Kern and Jake Hoffman signed a document falsely declaring themselves Arizona's electors, in favor of Trump.\n\nBut Trump had lost Arizona.

The indictment released names of 11 Republicans who falsely claimed in writing Trump had defeated President Biden in the state and posed as electors in 2020. The document contained redacted names of seven others who were nonetheless identifiable by the descriptions of their positions and roles.\n\nGiuliani \"spread false claims of election fraud in Arizona and nationally shortly after November 3, 2020,\" the indictment stated. He also \"presided over a 'hearing' in downtown Phoenix\" in which he claimed falsely that Arizona's election official had not tried to find out whether the election results were accurate, and he pressured the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors and Arizona legislators to change the election's outcome, prosecutors said.\n\nTrump was described as Unindicted Co-Conspirator 1, \"a former president of the United States who spread false claims of election fraud following the 2020 election.\"\n\nAll of those in the indictment \"schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency to keep Unindicted Co-Conspirator 1 in office against the will of Arizona's voters,\" the 57-page document read. The goal was to prevent the lawful and peaceful transfer of power of the U.S. presidency, \"keeping President Donald J. Trump in office against the will of Arizona voters, and depriving Arizona voters of their right to vote and have their votes counted under the United States Constitution.\"\n\nThe others mentioned, but not by name, in the document included Trump advisor John Eastman and Mike Roman, an operative in Trump's 2020 campaign. Post-election strategist Ken Chesebro was also discernible from the list. Attorneys Boris Epshteyn, a Trump adviser, Christina Bobb, who currently works for the Republican National Committee, were indicted, too.\n\nThe group filed lawsuits, penned messages -- some threatening -- to county and state officials and signed the \"fake elector\" documents in December 2020, prosecutors said.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nGrand jury proceedings are by necessity secret, but one witness who testified told Politico on condition

Those individuals have not yet been served, but details in the indictment make clear they include top Trump aides, including Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows.\n\nThese are the 11 Arizonans who signed documents claiming to be legitimate electors for Trump, though Democrat Joe Biden won Arizona's votes in the electoral college. Each is charged with the above counts.\n\nDig deeper: Learn more about Arizona's fake electors\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nTyler Bowyer\n\nBowyer is the chief operating officer at Turning Point USA, a Phoenix-based nonprofit with a similarly named political advocacy arm. The nonprofit got its start advocating for conservative politics at high schools and universities, but it and its affiliated organizations have grown to become influential in the conservative culture wars. They have also drawn controversy for spreading false information, including about elections.\n\nBowyer is a committeeman for the Republican National Committee. He told The Arizona Republic in 2022 about the so-called fake elector plot, that he didn't know \"all the details and facts\" but confirmed he was an elector for the state GOP.\n\nShe was also subpoenaed by the House Select Committee investigating the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Cottle has served on the Arizona GOP Executive Committee and Maricopa County Republican Committee. She led the Pledge of Allegiance at a rally for former President Donald Trump in January 2022 in Florence, Ariz.\n\nJake Hoffman\n\nHoffman, of Queen Creek, is a state senator first elected to the Legislature in 2020. He is the founder of the Arizona Freedom Caucus, the political coalition that includes the state's most conservative lawmakers. Many of those lawmakers are aligned with Trump and the group generally supports conservative policies on social issues.\n\nHoffman is a top antagonist of Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs and is no stranger to criticizing Republicans he views as too moderate.\n\nHe announced earlier this year he would run to represent Arizona on the Republican National Committee, and he is seeking another term representing Legislative District 15 in the Arizona Senate, which includes Queen Creek, San Tan Valley and a portion of Mesa. He runs or has ownership shares of several marketing and advertising businesses, including one that was exposed years ago as a social media \"troll farm\" that spread disinformation.\n\nHe has largely avoided reporters' questions about the electors, saying in 2022 that they wanted to provide Congress and Vice President Mike Pence with \"dueling opinions,\" and earlier this year alleged Attorney General Kris Mayes was \"corrupt\" and using the office to \"persecute their political enemies.\"\n\nLearn more about the indictment:Grand jury indicts fake electors who falsely certified Donald Trump as 2020 winner\n\nAnthony Kern\n\nKern, a state senator from Glendale, was outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when it was breached by rioters and is an ardent Trump supporter. First elected to the Arizona Legislature in 2015, he is now running for a seat in Congress in a packed GOP primary.\n\nHe was fired a decade ago from the El Mirage Police Department in Phoenix's northwest suburbs for lying to a supervisor after a string of disciplinary issues and put on a roll of officers accused of dishonesty called the Brady list.\n\nKern has brushed off questions about the electors' case, saying he didn't need a lawyer. Last month, on the plaza outside a Maricopa County courthouse, Kern decried the investigation as a \"weaponization of our government\" that he said was motivated by an attempt to bankrupt him and keep him from Congress.\n\nJim Lamon\n\nLamon ran to represent Arizona in the U.S. Senate in 2022 but lost in the GOP primary.\n\nHe is the founder of Scottsdale-based Depcom Power, a solar engineering and construction company that employed 1,600 people across the nation before he sold the business. Lamon, a steady financial supporter of Republican causes and candidates, helped bankroll security for the Arizona Senate's much-criticized review of ballots cast in 2020.\n\nIn 2022, Lamon claimed during an interview with KTVK-TV in Phoenix that the electors were part of a backup plan in case Trump's election fraud claims proved successful.\n\n\"The Republican electors put forth a valid document that said, in the event that the election certification was overturned, there would be no excuse not to recognize those electors,\" Lamon said.\n\nThe documents themselves did not include such conditional language, however.\n\nRobert Montgomery\n\nMontgomery is a former head of the Cochise County Republican Committee. He led GOP leadership in Arizona's rural southeast corner until he was defeated by a surprise challenger in December 2022. Montgomery has supported hand-counting ballots and pushed county leaders to ignore warnings about doing so before the 2022 election.\n\nSamuel Moorhead\n\nMoorhead was the second vice chair of the Gila County Republican Party when he signed as a Trump elector, a ranking but not top position in the local Republican Party in one of Arizona's rural counties northeast of metro Phoenix.\n\nMoorhead served 17 years on the board of the Gila County Provisional Community College District before resigning in October to move closer to his daughter and grandson elsewhere in Arizona, according to meeting minutes.\n\nLoraine Pellegrino\n\nPellegrino was secretary for the Arizona Trump electors and has a long history of leadership in state GOP politics. She has led two conservative groups, the Arizona Federation of Republican Women, and the Ahwatukee Republican Women's Club, and was a delegate to Republican National Committee conventions in 2012, 2016 and 2020.\n\nPellegrino was subpoenaed by the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. She said in January 2022 the electors offered a contingency plan.\n\n\"We were electors for Trump and we were hoping things would change,\" she said. \"Just in case, we signed our paperwork to be ready in the event that something was overturned.\"\n\nGreg Safsten\n\nSafsten, who has worked as an adviser to several Republican congressmen from Arizona, was executive director of the Arizona Republican Party when he signed as a Trump elector.\n\nAccording to an online biography by Legistorm, Safsten worked as a field director in 2012 for then-Congressman Matt Salmon and then took on a role as a legislative assistant. Four years later he went to work for GOP Congressman Andy Biggs' campaign, ultimately becoming deputy chief of staff.\n\nKelli Ward\n\nKelli Ward is a past chair of the Arizona GOP. She helped to organize the signing of the fake electors, sat at the head of the table during the \"signing\" video and boasted about the moment on Twitter, The Arizona Republic has previously reported.\n\nWard was also subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 committee related to the elector scheme and exercised her Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate herself more than 200 times when later testifying before that committee.\n\nShe is an outspoken supporter of Trump's and a promoter of election conspiracies who helped Trump aides in their efforts to pressure GOP leaders in Arizona and filed multiple lawsuits trying to overturn Trump's loss in 2020. She is a former state lawmaker who twice ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate.\n\nMichael Ward\n\nA well-known GOP activist, Michael Ward was subpoenaed by the Department of Justice in its investigation of Trump's election interference. He has been married to Kelli Ward since 1995 and has served as her campaign manager in bids for the Arizona Legislature.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"},

The charges are related to what prosecutors allege were efforts to overturn the 2020 election in favor of Donald Trump, who was also deemed an unindicted coconspirator in the case.\n\nThe indictment, which was obtained by The Washington Post, was handed up by a grand jury on Wednesday in Maricopa County, Arizona. Prosecutors charged the defendants with conspiracy, fraudulent schemes and artifices, fraudulent schemes and practices, and forgery.\n\nIn the indictment, prosecutors accused the defendants of trying to keep Trump in the office of the presidency \"against the will of Arizona's voters.\"\n\nEleven Arizona GOP \"fake electors\" were named as defendants; they were each charged with nine felony counts.\n\nOther defendants' names were redacted. The Post reported that they included former Trump lawyers Jenna Ellis, John Eastman, and Christina Bobb; former Trump campaign aide Mike Roman; and Trump campaign advisor Boris Epshteyn. Giuliani's and Meadows' names were also redacted from the indictment. The Post said descriptions of the individuals' actions made their identities evident, and that the names were redacted until the individuals could be served the indictment\n\nTed Goodman, a political advisor to Giuliani, said in a statement to Business Insider when reached about the indictment: \"The continued weaponization of our justice system should concern every Americans as it does permanent, irrevocable harm to the country.\"\n\nMeadows, Ellis, Bobb, Roman, and Epshteyn, or their representatives, did not respond to requests for comment from BI. The Arizona Republicans did not respond to requests for comment or could not be reached.\n\nCharles Burnham, an attorney for Eastman told Business Insider: \"The phenomenon of partisan lawfare grows more troubling by the day. Professor Eastman is innocent of criminal conduct in Arizona or any other place and will fight these charges as he has all the other unjust accusations leveled against him.\"\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer for Meadows, told the Post he hadn't seen the indictment but said, \"If Mr. Meadows is named in this indictment, it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.\"\n\nThe indictment also referred to \"Unindicted Coconspirator 1,\" who is described as \"a former president of the United States who spread false claims of election fraud following the 2020 election.\" Another four people who are not named are referred to as unindicted coconspirators.\n\nA representative for Trump and the Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BI.\n\nArizona was one of several states, including Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Nevada, in which so-called fake electors tried to cast electoral votes for Trump despite Joe Biden winning the election in their state.\n\nThe Arizona attorney general's office did not respond to a request for comment from BI.\n\nThe indictment comes as Trump runs for president again while also facing several criminal cases, including two cases related to efforts to overturn the election -- one in Georgia and one at the federal level -- and one related to documents found at Mar-a-Lago. Trump is currently on trial in New York for a case related to a hush-money payment.\n\nHe has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty in all four cases.", "source": {"uri":

Wednesday's filing lists 11 named defendants and seven redacted defendants who are charged with six counts of forgery, one count of conspiracy, one count of fraudulent schemes and artifices, and one count of fraudulent schemes and practices.\n\nThe filing redacted the names of defendants who live outside of Arizona who had not been served with the charges, but The Washington Post reported the names of the redacted parties given the paragraph description of each defendant provided in the indictment. The other indicted members the publication identified include former Trump attorney attorney Jenna Ellis, recent-RNC appointee Christina Bobb, Trump campaign adviser Boris Epshteyn, and campaign aide Mike Roman.\n\nAdditional named defendants include former Arizona GOP chair Kelli Ward and her husband Michael Ward; Arizona state senators Anthony Kern and Jake Hoffman; and Tyler Bowyer, an RNC committeeman and Chief Operating Officer of Turning Point Action, the campaign arm of the Pro-Trump conservative youth group Turning Point USA. Donald Trump himself is discussed in the indictment but not charged, instead being referred to as \"Unindicted Coconspirator 1.\"\n\n\"In Arizona, and the United States, the people elected Joseph

keep Unindicted Coconspirator 1 in office against the will of Arizona's voters. \"\n\nSources with knowledge of the investigation told Rolling Stone last year that investigators had been looking into Ward's actions as a fake elector, including a fateful meeting in Dec. 2020 where she and 10 other Republicans signed documents claiming to be Arizona's legitimate electors and casting their votes for Donald Trump, who lost the general election by 10,457 votes in the state.\n\n\"Defendants deceived the citizens of Arizona by falsely claiming that those votes were contingent only on a legal challenge that would change the outcome of the election,\" the indictment reads. \"In reality, Defendants intended that their false votes for Trump-Pence would encourage Pence to reject the Biden-Harris votes on January 6, 2021, regardless of the outcome of the legal challenge.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They have pleaded not guilty there. Trump has also pleaded not guilty in the federal election-subversion case in Washington.\n\nTrump, a Republican, says all the cases are a political \"witch hunt\" to prevent him from defeating Democrat Biden in this year's presidential rematch.\n\nAnother defendant whose name is redacted is Trump lawyer Christina Bobb, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung confirmed, calling the Arizona indictment \"another example of Democrats' weaponization of the legal system.\"\n\n\"Christina Bobb is a former Marine Corps officer, who served our nation and the President with distinction. The Democrat platform for 2024: if you can't beat them, try to throw them in jail,\" Cheung said.\n\nGiuliani spokesperson Goodman also called the Arizona indictment an example of \"the continued weaponization of our justice system,\" saying it \"should concern every American as it does permanent, irrevocable harm to the country.\"\n\n\"Mayor Rudy Giuliani - one of the most effective prosecutors in American history who took down the Mafia, cleaned up the streets of New York and locked up corrupt public officials - is proud to stand up for the countless Americans who raised legitimate concerns surrounding the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election,\" Goodman said.\n\nThe indictment alleges the defendants pressured the Maricopa Board of Supervisors, the Arizona Legislature and then-Governor Doug Ducey to change the election results.\n\nFalse electors scheme in several states\n\nUS presidents are chosen by electors from each state, who cast votes in the Electoral College, where votes are allotted based on each state's population.\n\nIn Arizona and almost all other states, the winner of the state's popular vote receives all of that state's electoral votes. To win the presidency a candidate needs 270 electoral votes - a majority of total 538.\n\nArizona has 11 electoral votes, and the 11 defendants named in the indictment would correspond to those people who purported to be electors for Trump.\n\nArizona is one of seven states where Biden won but Trump allies sought to award the electoral votes to Trump. Many of the races were close. Arizona was decided by little more than 10,000 votes or 0.3 per cent of the ballots cast.\n\nThe charges include fraud, forgery and conspiracy, three classes of felony that with a conviction could

The video, posted by the Arizona Republican Party on December 14, 2020, is titled, \"The Signing,\" and shows former state party chair Kelli Ward declaring, falsely, that she and others in the video are the \"duly elected and qualified electors\" and that the winner of Arizona, lo and behold, was the man who received 10,000 fewer votes.\n\nOn Wednesday, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said she had enough. \"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined, it's too important,\" Mayes, a Democrat elected in 2022, said in a video announcing that she had indicted Ward and others involved in the conspiracy to keep the loser of the 2020 election in power. Among the 18 individuals charged with felonies include Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, Christina Bobb, John Eastman and Jenna Ellis, who are accused of helping to orchestrate the fraud, which aimed - through forged documents falsely claiming election deniers were legitimate electors - to provide Republicans at the federal level just enough cover to reject the 2020 results and engage in a congressional coup d'\u00e9tat.\n\n\"Defendants deceived the citizens of Arizona by falsely claiming that those votes were contingent only on a legal challenge that would change the outcome of the election,\" the indictment states. \"In reality, Defendants intended that their false votes for Trump-Pence would encourage Pence to reject the Biden-Harris votes on January 6, 2021, regardless of the outcome of the legal challenge.\"\n\nLeft unindicted, but clearly identifiable as a co-conspirator in the 58-page charging document, is the former president who stood to gain from the conspiracy (is it still only \"alleged\" when you can see it on Twitter?). But he's not the only big name missing but nonetheless clearly present in the indictment.\n\n\"It reeks of Ken Chesebro,\" MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin commented after the indictment was unveiled. The document cites multiple emails involving Chesebro, a lawyer who worked for the 2020 Trump campaign and helped organize fake-elector plots in battleground states, including one that spells out that the fake electors would be useful even in the absence of litigation; that is, the electors were never a real backstop, only to be invoked if a court threw out the 2020 results, but a fig leaf.\n\nChesebro was charged in the Georgia election interference case, pleading guilty in October 2023 to a felony county of conspiring to file false documents. He has since sat down for interviews with investigators in other states and, while his honesty has been called into question, legal experts say he appears to have been useful to the attorney general and her case.\n\nJoyce Vance, who served as a U.S. attorney under President Barack Obama, said the indictment suggests \"Chesebro may be cooperating with prosecutors.\" And that, she wrote Wednesday, could make it easier to convict others - including other Trump attorneys - who were charged. Indeed, it could even break the case wide open, for if \"that cooperation is fulsome, it could lead to a situation where people he is able to testify against become highly motivated to cooperate as well.\"\n\nChesebro has already impacted the scope of the Arizona case. As The Washington Post reported, the Arizona attorney general had zeroed in on \"local conservatives\" until late last year, when Chesebro sat down with investigators and \"provided Mayes's team with records -- some that had been previously unseen -- that revealed more information about those involved in the Arizona effort,\" the Post reported, citing two sources familiar with the investigation.\n\nIf Chesebro's apparent cooperation leads others to cooperate, that could spell trouble for a far better known but similarly unindicted co-conspirator, currently standing trial in lower Manhattan.\n\n\"It's not simply that they are in great peril, they of course imperil Trump because they are people who could cooperate and really don't have that many options or that much money,\" Harry Litman, a former U.S. deputy assistant attorney general, told MSNBC. Particularly vulnerable are the seven Arizona Republicans who were indicted for posing as electors, he said, arguing that they are far more likely to seek plea deals and cooperate with investigators, potentially sharing damning information on not just Trump's inner circle, but the man himself.\n\n\"They are people who presumably want futures in their individual states,\" Litman said of the local fake electors, \"and therefore they are not going to fall on their swords for Trump.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

What happens to them now?", "body": "Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes didn't indict members of a lesser-known group that submitted papers in Washington, D.C., claiming the state voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020, seemingly ending the potential legal saga for a group quickly overshadowed by those more closely connected to Trump's bid to overturn the election.\n\nThe group led by Mesa resident Lori Osiecki sent documents from its would-be electors to Washington before the better-known group featuring members of the Arizona Republican Party and GOP loyalists sent theirs.\n\nBut Osiecki's group, known as \"AZ Protect the Vote,\" had no apparent coordination with the Trump campaign, the White House or the state party. That key difference may be what kept that group of 11 from facing charges similar to the false-documents indictment unveiled against the state GOP's \"fake electors\" and others close to the Trump campaign on Tuesday.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how seriously the attorney general's investigation ever examined the Osiecki group. Mayes didn't address their effort in her videotaped remarks after her office announced its indictment and only said her team would continue to examine \"efforts to legally subvert the results of the 2020 presidential election.\"\n\nCatch up:Grand jury indicts fake electors who falsely certified Donald Trump as 2020 winner in Arizona\n\nA Mayes spokesperson could not be reached for comment Wednesday evening.\n\nOsiecki also was not immediately available for comment.\n\nGov. Katie Hobbs, who was secretary of state at the time, sent Osiecki a cease-and-desist letter shortly after they sent their documents to the National Archives and asked the state attorney general to investigate potential criminal charges for improper use of the state seal.\n\nThat never led to any legal fallout under former Attorney General Mark Brnovich.\n\nWhile the Osiecki group wasn't formally working with Trump's allies, they were influenced by them in ways parallel to events noted in the indictment.\n\nOsiecki's group, for example, attended post-election rallies protesting the results of the 2020 election, including a daylong public meeting in Phoenix that included Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, who was among those indicted on Wednesday.\n\nThat meeting was part of the pressure campaign led by Trump himself and exerted on state lawmakers as Trump sought to sidestep official results showing President Joe Biden won the election.\n\nBut Osiecki's group eagerly did what the 11 Republican electors only did after some deliberation with lawyers connected to the state party and discussion with Trump allies.\n\nThe Osiecki effort didn't feature the names of electors who actually appeared on the 2020 ballot. The submission of the state GOP electors, made in consultation with Trump's lawyers and campaign allies, always put the spotlight on that slate, rather than hers.\n\nOsiecki, who received recognition in Mesa for her neighborhood preservation efforts a generation earlier, didn't step back from politics.\n\nIn 2021, she worked with the congressional campaign for Republican Walt Blackman and months later for the Senate campaign for Republican Blake Masters in 2022.\n\nIn a 2020 interview with The Arizona Republic, Osiecki cast her fake electors effort as trying to address the problem of an election they viewed as stolen.\n\n\"One thing I will say about conservatives, is if something is wrong, and we have lost -- a true loss -- then we accept,\" she said. \"We're not going to drag people through the mud and fight it. But this clearly has got issues. I saw it with my own eyes and my own research. After that (Giuliani) hearing, I was shocked we didn't have any other marching orders.\"\n\nThe Osiecki electors sent their choices using documents notarized by Melanie Hunsaker, who works in real estate. Her husband, Jamie Hunsaker, is a Trump enthusiast and one of the purported electors.\n\nDonald Paul Schween, another would-be elector, has been active in Republican Party politics.\n\nFederico Buck, another real estate veteran, is among the signatories. Others include Cynthia Franco, Sarai Franco, Stewart A. Hogue, Carrie Lundell, Christeen Taryn Moser, Danjee J. Moser, Jessica Panell and Peter Wang.\n\nOsiecki attested to the group's eligibility as electors.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ronald_j_hansen@azcentral.com", "name": "Ronald J.

Will it hurt or help?", "body": "The indictments of 11 Republican \"fake electors,\" including a state senator who is running for Congress, who tried to falsely certify the 2020 presidential election in Arizona was met with condemnation, or silence, from across the GOP.\n\nArizona Republicans largely did not address the underlying act of submitting official paperwork that falsely suggested they were the legal presidential electors, which prosecutors characterize as an unprecedented plot to subvert the will of Arizona voters that has stoked mistrust in U.S. elections.\n\nInstead, they called the indictments judicial overreach by Democratic Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes.\n\nThe Arizona Republican Party put out a statement calling the indictment part of an \"unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial power\" meant to hurt the prospects of former President Donald Trump as he seeks another term in office.\n\nThe 11 indicted fake electors include state Sen. Anthony Kern, R-Glendale, who is running for the congressional seat being vacated by U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., and state Sen. Jake Hoffman, R-Queen Creek, who is seeking another term in the Arizona Legislature.\n\nBoth candidates for public office have been indicted on felony counts of conspiracy, fraud and forgery.\n\nThere's nothing disqualifying people from serving in U.S. Congress if they've been indicted or convicted of a felony, according to the Congressional Research Service. In some cases, House rules restrict their participation in congressional activities such as voting or leadership posts.\n\nHoffman would not be able to serve in the Arizona Legislature if he were convicted, but he could continue to serve until that point.\n\nAnother possibility is that if those candidates win, their colleagues could expel them from their posts, said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond.\n\n\"It can't be good news for them,\" Tobias said in an interview.\n\nTrump is an unindicted co-conspirator in the case. Seven Trump allies also were indicted along with fake electors.\n\nTrump and his allies have faced similar charges in states where other \"fake elector\" schemes happened, such as Georgia and Michigan.\n\nDozens of lawsuits across the country have failed to surface evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Still the Arizona \"fake electors\" have stood by their unsupported claims about the elections, and their views are shared by a passionate portion of the GOP electorate.\n\nTobias speculated that the case against the \"fake electors\" seems strong based on the fact that numerous prosecutors across the country have come to the same conclusions. Many of the people charged in the grand jury indictments announced Wednesday by Mayes, including some of Trump's top allies, are facing similar charges in other states.\n\n\"It's not an accident that some of these same players keep reappearing as defendants in various states,\" Tobias said.\n\nKern is part of a crowded GOP primary race in the West Valley's solidly Republican 8th Congressional District. The indictment put his rivals in the awkward position of deciding whether to criticize Kern over the charges or support him and risk making him a hero to the conservative voters they are courting.\n\nAmong his primary competitors is Arizona House Speaker Ben Toma, R-Glendale.\n\nIn a 2021 interview with The Arizona Republic, former House Speaker Rusty Bowers, R-Mesa, said Toma asked Trump's allies questions at the Dec. 1, 2020, closed-door meeting at the state Senate that included Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nReached for comment, Toma said he wasn't familiar with the details of the case but wrote in a text message that Mayes has made her office \"highly political\" and that \"everyone should be highly suspect of everything that comes out of this AG's office.\"\n\nBlake Masters, Kern's Republican rival who unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Senate in 2022, similarly accused Mayes of \"persecuting her political enemies.\"\n\nAbe Hamadeh, the Trump-endorsed candidate in the race who unsuccessfully ran against Mayes in 2022, released a statement calling the indictment a \"sham\" and an effort to \"abuse the justice system.\" Hamadeh has challenged his narrow election loss in the attorney general's race to no avail.\n\nAn aide to former U.S. Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., another candidate running against Kern, did not respond to a request for comment on the indictments. Franks has equivocated as to whether he believes President Joe Biden was the legitimate winner of the 2020 election.\n\nRon Smith, a spokesperson for Kern's campaign, shrugged off the charges and said he doesn't expect Kern will suspend his campaign as a result.\n\n\"Senator Kern did not do anything wrong, and we're full-steam ahead,\" Smith said.\n\nLikewise, Hoffman wrote in a statement Wednesday evening that he was \"innocent of any crime.\"\n\nThe indictments allege that the two lawmakers falsely claimed they were \"duly elected and qualified\" and urged Arizona officials and former Vice President Mike Pence to accept their elector votes in favor of Trump, a move which would have undermined the legitimate election result.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news",

They are charged with nine counts each of conspiracy, fraud and forgery.\n\nThe identities of the seven others, including Giuliani and Meadows, were redacted by the attorney general because they had not yet been officially served with the documents, but they were easily identifiable based on their descriptions.\n\nThe indictment mentions the chief of staff in 2020, the position Meadows held in the Trump White House at that time.\n\nTrump himself was not charged but was referred to as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nThe charges were filed after a yearlong investigation by Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, on the handling of the election by Republicans in the key swing state that President Joe Biden won in 2020 by a mere 10,457 votes.\n\nThe southwestern state now becomes the fourth after Michigan, Georgia and Nevada to pursue charges against Trump allies who used false or unproven claims about voter fraud.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" Mayes said in a video released by her office. \"It's too important.\"\n\nBut Trump and his supporters continue to make claims against Biden's victory in the 2020 election as the former president gears up to face off again against the Democratic incumbent in the November election.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment but if Meadows is named, \"it is a blatantly political and politicised accusation and will be contested and defeated.\"\n\nTed Goodman, a spokesman for Giuliani, responded: \"Continued weaponisation of our justice system should concern every American as it does permanent, irrevocable harm to the country.\"\n\nTrump himself has been charged in four criminal cases. The first went to trial this month in New York. It concerns alleged \"hush money\"payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence after she alleged a sexual encounter with Trump, which he has denied. He is charged with falsifying business records to cover up the payments before the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe former president was also indicted in August in federal court over efforts to cling to power after being defeated in the 2020 election. The US Supreme Court on Thursday will hear arguments on Trump's claim in that case that he can't be prosecuted for acts he committed while serving as president.\n\nThe other two indictments are an election interference case in the state of Georgia and a federal case in Florida involving the mishandling of classified documents.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The group included Kelli Ward, then Arizona GOP chair, who disputed the legitimacy of the election results.

It comes as a grand jury indicted Trump's close allies, Boris Epshteyn, Mark Meadows, and Rudy Giuliani, for allegedly attempting to subvert his 2020 election loss in the state.\n\nTrump is currently facing trial for allegedly falsifying company records to make a $130,000 payment to former adult film star Stormy Daniels in a bid to buy her silence over an alleged affair they had.\n\nAccording to CNN, the former president has been named as an \"Unindicted Coconspirator 1\" in the 2020 Arizona election fraud case. In the documents, several pro-Trump electors were indicted for their efforts to overturn his 2020 loss at the polls in the state.\n\nA source close to the investigation said those that were handed an indictment include Boris Epshteyn, a former White House aide and one of Trump's trusted allies; former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows; and Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThe names of other individuals who were indicted in the case remain redacted, as they had not been served their indictment notice.\n\n\"A state grand jury made up of everyday regular Arizonans has now handed down felony indictments for all 11 Republican electors as well as several others connected to this scheme,\" Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"These are serious indictments, but this is the first hurdle the state must pass in our constitutional criminal justice system. We intend to prove these crimes were committed beyond a reasonable doubt,\" she added.\n\nTrump's Allies came under legal scrutiny when they led a vocal campaign to subvert the billionaire politician's 2020 election loss in the state.\n\nAt the time, Trump's loss in Arizona, by less than 11,000 votes, had already been certified by the state's Republican governor. However, the 11 \"Republican Electors,\" as they called themselves, pushed for then-Vice President Mike Pence to reject the legitimate electors and accept them.\n\nThey would go on to broadcast a session where they prepared to sign documents claiming they were the legitimate representatives of the state's electoral votes.\n\nAccording to CNN, the indictment now alleges that all eleven of them \"deceived the citizens of Arizona\" by their actions.\n\nThe indictment read, \"Defendants deceived the citizens of Arizona by falsely claiming that those votes were contingent only on a legal challenge that would change the outcome of the election.\"\n\nIt continued, \"In reality, Defendants intended that their false votes for Trump-Pence would encourage Pence to reject the Biden-Harris votes on January 6, 2021, regardless of the outcome of the legal challenge.\"\n\nFollowing the announcement by Mayes, several reactions have trailed the notice as the Arizona Republican party slammed the indictment in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"Today's indictments by Attorney General Kris Mayes represent a blatant and unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial power, aimed solely at distracting the public from the critical policy debates our country should be focusing on as we approach the 2024 election,\" the statement read.\n\nArizona Governor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, also opened up about her desire to see the perpetrators brought to book.\n\n\"As Secretary of State, I oversaw free, fair, secure elections in Arizona and defended the votes of millions of Arizonans,\" Hobbs told CNN's Abby Phillip.\n\nShe added, \"I am confident that Attorney General Mayes conducted a fair and impartial investigation and grand jury process, and now the justice system will do its job.\"\n\nThe presumptive Republican party has reportedly defied the gag order placed on him by Judge Juan Merchan in his hush money trial.\n\nAccording to CNN, Tuesday's court session saw Trump being pressed to 10 alleged violations of the gag order, which has since been expanded to cover Merchan's family after Trump attacked his daughter.\n\nTrump's attorney, Todd Blanche, argued that the posts about Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen were political, but the judge rejected it.\n\nBlanche added that Trump's response to Cohen's post about Michael Avenatti, Daniel's former lawyer, was political because the issue of a state pardon was raised, but Merchan didn't accept that stand.\n\n\"So the pardon is what makes it political?\" Merchan asked Blanche. \"Of course,\" Blanche responded.\n\n\"When your client is violating a gag order, I expect more than one word,\" the judge retorted after Blanche argued that pardons were political.\n\nTrump is undergoing trial over a $130,000 payment he allegedly made to Daniels for her to keep quiet about an alleged affair they had before his 2016 election win.", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Who are they?", "body": "Eighteen people were indicted in a criminal case brought by Attorney General Kris Mayes involving the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election in Arizona.\n\nFive others were named as unindicted co-conspirators.\n\nThe designation means these five were believed to be involved in plans to present an alternate slate of presidential electors, but were not charged with a crime for their activities.\n\nHere's what we know about the possible identities of the five co-conspirators, based on information pulled from the public records and other sources.\n\nUnindicted co-conspirator 1 is clearly former President Donald Trump. The indictment describes this individual as \"A former president of the United States who spread false claims of election fraud following the 2020 election.\"\n\nUnindicted co-conspirator 2 closely resembles former state Sen. Kelly Townsend, a Mesa Republican. This coconspirator \"spread false claims of election fraud following the 2020 election\" and \"helped organize and distribute a false document on December 14, 2020,\" titled, \"Joint Resolution of the 54th Legislature.\"\n\nTownsend was a leading skeptic of the 2020 election results. Along with former Rep. Mark Finchem, R-Oro Valley, she urged her fellow lawmakers in early December 2020 to overturn the 2020 results. She then demanded then-Attorney General Mark Brnovich investigate each of the claims of election fraud aired at a late November 2020 \"hearing\" conducted by Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and later pressured him to release results of a Senate-requested investigation into claims raised by the Senate's ballot review of Maricopa County's 2020 election results.\n\nOn Dec. 7, 2020, she sent an email to fellow lawmakers asking them to sign a document stating that \"not enough was done to ensure the public of a clean and fair election, and that every vote counted.\"\n\nIt resulted in a joint resolution, signed by 31 Republicans, urging congressional members to accept the \"alternate 11 electors\" or to have all electoral results voided pending \"a full forensic audit.\"\n\nTownsend on Wednesday said \"it's best that I don't make any comments\" after The Republic sent her a copy of the indictment.\n\nUnindicted co-conspirator 3 is identified as a former lawmaker who also spread false claims of 2020 election fraud and \"helped organize a 'hearing' at a hotel in Phoenix on November 30, 2020.\" Finchem was a key organizer of that event and also hosted a hearing in Tucson that sought to prove voting fraud in the 2020 election.\n\nThe indictment said unindicted co-conspirator 3 also signed the joint resolution, which is borne out in the document obtained by The Republic.\n\nUnindicted co-conspirator 4 closely matches Kenneth Chesebro, a former Trump attorney. The indictment states this person \"drafted memos that encouraged having the fake Republican electors vote on December 14, 2020\" and helped organize fake electors' vote in seven states, including Arizona.\n\nChesebro met with Mayes' investigators in a December trip to Arizona. He authored memos that described how states could put forward electors who would back Trump, even though Trump lost in those states. And Chesebro cooperated with fake elector probes in Nevada and Georgia.\n\nUnindicted co-conspirator 5 is portrayed in the indictment as an Arizona attorney who worked for the Trump campaign and helped set up the Dec. 14, 2020, vote by the 11 fake electors. This attorney also previously represented the state Republican Party and Kelli Ward in a lawsuit that challenged the validity of Arizona's 11 Democratic electors.\n\nThat description closely matches Jack Wilenchik, an Arizona attorney who helped organize the fake electors' meeting.\n\nReach the reporter at maryjo.pitzl@arizonarepublic.com or at 602-228-7566 and follow her on Threads as well as on

Another person heavily mentioned in the Arizona indictment is Unnamed Conspirator 4, who is believed to be Kenneth Chesebro, a Trump lawyer who took a plea deal in October 2023 after being charged in the Georgia election interference case alongside Trump and 18 others.\n\nAfter pleading guilty to a single felony charge, Chesebro is reported to have cooperated with investigators looking into fake elector schemes during the 2020 presidential election in at least four states. In March, Chesebro was reported by ABC News to have voluntarily sat for an interview with investigators from Mayes' office as part of the fake electors plot investigation.\n\nWriting in her Civil Discourse blog, Vance said that Chesebro not being charged in Arizona suggests that he did cooperate with authorities, and that other defendants could be persuaded to follow.\n\n\"Kenneth Chesebro may be cooperating with prosecutors. He is not charged -- but seems to be one of the unindicted co-conspirators in the case,\" Vance wrote.\n\n\"There were earlier reports that he was cooperating with Arizona prosecutors. If that cooperation is fulsome, it could lead to a situation where people he is able to testify against become highly motivated to cooperate as well.\"\n\nFormer FBI general counsel Andrew Weissmann also suggested that the \"main reason\" Chesebro wasn't indicted in Arizona is that he is cooperating.\n\n\"Or maybe I should say at least cooperating enough to not be charged,\" Weissmann told MSNBC's The Last Word With Lawrence O'Donnell.\n\n\"Otherwise hard to explain why his name does not appear and presumably it's because he has counsel who has said, 'Look, if you do not want to be 'on the other side of a v,' meaning United States versus or in this case Arizona versus, you need to start finding religion and join team America,\" Weissmann added.\n\n\"So, it's possible that is the main reason that you don't see his name here, because otherwise... he was in the thick of things and we know that actually also from his own plea in Georgia.\"\n\nChesebro's legal team has been contacted for comment via email.\n\nChesebro was found to have written a series of memos in late 2020 instructing several states how to install a group of alternative electors to falsely declare Trump the winner of the respective states in the last election.\n\nFollowing his plea deal in Georgia, Chesebro is said to have testified to a grand jury in Nevada, where Attorney General Aaron D. Ford announced that six people have been indicted as part of a fake elector plot in the state.\n\nChesebro also allegedly cooperated with investigators in Michigan, where Attorney General Dana Nessel charged 16 Republicans with felony offenses as part of a fake elector scheme last July.\n\nMayes revealed on Wednesday that 18 people have been charged with felony offenses including fraud, forgery and conspiracy in connection with the fake elector scheme in Arizona.\n\nAs well as Giuliani and Meadows, the names of five other defendants, including Trump lawyers John Eastman, Christina Bobb and Jenna Ellis, are redacted in the indictment. These defendants are identifiable from facts outlined in the document, or have issued statements condemning the charges against them.\n\nGiuliani, Meadows, Ellis, Eastman, Trump and Chesebro were among the 19 defendants charged in Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' 2020 election interference investigation in Georgia. Chesebro and Ellis both took plea deals, with Trump, Giuliani, Eastman and Meadows pleading not guilty to all charges against them.\n\nThe 11 names in the Arizona fake elector indictment include former Arizona GOP chair Kelli Ward, state Sen. Anthony Kern, and Jim Lamon, who ran for the U.S. Senate in Arizona in 2022.\n\nIn a statement, Mayes said the 18 defendants and five unindicted coconspirators allegedly attempted to \"undermine the will of Arizona's voters\" during the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\"Arizona's election was free and fair. The people of Arizona elected President Biden, unwilling to accept this fact that defendants charged by the state grand jury, allegedly schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency,\" Mayes said.\n\n\"Whatever their reasoning was, the plot to violate the law must be answered for and I was elected to uphold the law of this state.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType":

Jake Hoffman and Anthony Kern, are two of the individuals indicted.\n\nFormer Arizona Republican Party Chairwoman Kelli Ward, her husband Michael Ward, Turning Point Action Chief Operating Officer Tyler Bowyer, Loraine Pellegrino, former Senate candidate Jim Lamon, Robert Montgomery, Samuel Moorhead and Greg Safsten were also indicted.\n\nOthers were also indicted but their names are not being released until they're served papers, Mayes said.\n\n\"I will not allow American Democracy to be undermined,\" Mayes said in a video comment. \"We're here because justice demands an answer to the efforts that the defendants and other unindicted co-conspirators allegedly took to undermine the will of Arizona's voters during the 2020 presidential election.\"\n\nThe accused gathered in Arizona's state GOP headquarters in December 2020 and signed a certificate claiming to be Arizona's electors and sent it to Congress. Trump lost to President Joe Biden by 10,457 votes, and the results were certified by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey and other state officials.\n\nThe indictments in Arizona aren't the only ones made in different swing states that Trump lost in 2020. \"Alternate electors\" have been charged with similar crimes in Nevada, Michigan and Georgia.\n\nHoffman released a statement after publication.\n\n\"Before an investigation had even been conducted and with no evidence, Kris Mayes declared that she believed electors such as myself were guilty of a crime, that it was her job to get Biden re-elected, and that she would control the timing of the indictment,\" said Senator Hoffman. \"Now, unsurprisingly, we see that she has weaponized the once respected Attorney General's office to deliver an indictment of her Republican political opponents years after the events at issue, long after other Democrat prosecutors made their decisions, and right before Arizona's primary elections. Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process.\"\n\nMore from this section\n\nTrump tried to 'corrupt' the 2016 election, prosecutor alleges as hush money trial gets underway Imagine IT Launches Redesigned Website and Brand Identity to

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a press release announcing the charges that those names would be made public after all of the defendants had been served with the indictment.\n\nGiuliani is among those whose names are redacted, a spokesperson for him, Ted Goodman, confirmed, criticizing the prosecution of the former New York mayor as political.\n\nAnother defendant whose name was redacted is described in the indictment as chief of staff in 2020, the position Mark Meadows held in the Trump White House at that time.\n\nTrump, Giuliani and Meadows are also co-defendants in the Georgia case, where they are charged with a racketeering conspiracy to overturn Biden's victory in that state. They have pleaded not guilty there. Trump has also pleaded not guilty in the federal election-subversion case in Washington.\n\nTrump, a Republican, says all the cases are a political \"witch hunt\" to prevent him from defeating Democrat Biden in this year's presidential rematch.\n\nAnother defendant whose name is redacted is Trump lawyer Christina Bobb, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung confirmed, calling the Arizona indictment \"another example of Democrats' weaponization of the legal system.\"\n\n\"Christina Bobb is a former Marine Corps officer, who served our nation and the President with distinction. The Democrat platform for 2024: if you can't beat them, try to throw them in jail,\" Cheung said.\n\nGiuliani spokesperson Goodman also called the Arizona indictment an example of \"the continued weaponization of our justice system,\" saying it \"should concern every American as it does permanent, irrevocable harm to the country.\"\n\n\"Mayor Rudy Giuliani - one of the most effective prosecutors in American history who took down the Mafia, cleaned up the streets of New York and locked up corrupt public officials - is proud to stand up for the countless Americans who raised

They were not.\n\nThough the relevant players didn't know it at the time, the controversy has become one of the most consequential political scandals in a generation, racking up indictment totals unseen since Watergate and Iran-Contra.\n\nConsider, for example, this week's developments.\n\nLast fall, Kris Mayes, Arizona's Democratic state attorney general, told CNN that her office was overseeing a \"robust\" investigation related to alleged criminal misconduct in the fake elector scheme. Evidently, she wasn't kidding: NBC News reported on her office filing a series of new criminal charges in this case, including conspiracy, fraud, and forgery.\n\nThe former president is described as \"Unindicted Coconspirator 1\" in the indictment.\n\nAs NBC News' report added, the indictment also described people a variety of prominent Republican figures who've been charged in the case but have not yet been served and whose names are redacted, including Meadows, Giuliani, Epshteyn, former Trump campaign and White House official Mike Roman, former Trump attorney Jenna Ellis, former Trump attorney Christina Bobb, and John Eastman.\n\nWhile there have been other indictments in the fake elector scandal, for some of these GOP figures, the Arizona charges represent their first confrontation with legal jeopardy.\n\nAlso charged in the Grand Canyon State yesterday was former Arizona GOP Chair Kelli Ward and Tyler Bowyer, the Republican National Committee's Arizona committeeman and the chief operating officer of the Trump-aligned Turning Point USA.\n\nAll of this news coincided with news out of Michigan, where several Republicans were charged last summer in the fake elector scandal, and where an official from Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel's office confirmed yesterday that Trump, Meadows, and Giuliani are uncharged co-conspirators in the state prosecutors' case.\n\nFor those keeping score, let's count up the number of indictments currently pending in the fake elector scandal across multiple jurisdictions:\n\nArizona: 18 people have been indicted, including 11 fake electors and seven Trump aides.\n\nGeorgia: 19 people were initially indicted, including Trump, though some have since reached plea agreements with prosecutors.\n\nA Washington Post report noted overnight that an investigation launched by Wisconsin's attorney general is still ongoing -- suggesting the total number of indictments might yet grow -- though the scandal appears unlikely to lead to charges in New Mexico and Pennsylvania.", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Can they continue to serve?", "body": "Two Arizona state senators were indicted this week related to their claims to be legitimate electors four years ago in what a grand jury alleges was a coordinated effort to keep former President Donald Trump in power.\n\nThey are not required by Arizona law to resign their elected offices because of the indictment, though history shows some public officials have chosen to do so facing public pressure -- and hoping to avoid negative attention.\n\nArizona law says elected officials must step aside after a conviction. Specifically, an elected office \"shall be deemed vacant\" if there is a conviction \"of a felony or an offense involving a violation of the person's official duties.\"\n\nSen. Jake Hoffman, R-Queen Creek, and Sen. Anthony Kern, R-Glendale, were each charged with nine felony counts including conspiracy and forgery. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, announced the grand jury indictment on Wednesday after a roughly yearlong investigation.\n\nThe indictments:Grand jury indicts fake electors who falsely certified Donald Trump as 2020 winner in Arizona\n\nKern has not commented on the indictment.\n\nBut Hoffman said he was innocent and alleged Mayes timed the case to harm her political opponents.\n\n\"Kris Mayes' sham political witch hunt will not have any impact on my service to the people of my district and this state,\" he said in a text message. \"I am innocent of any crime, and will fight these politically motivated charges vigorously.\"\n\nPublic scrutiny and pending charges may not be a motivating factor for either lawmaker to step down. Both are candidates for office and may be counting on a loyal Republican base that may see the prosecutions as politically motivated.\n\nKern and Hoffman had already sought to send that message about Mayes' case before the indictment was issued.\n\nLate last month, Kern delivered a campaign speech that echoed rhetoric of Trump's bid to return to the White House. He cast himself as the victim of \"weaponization of our government\" that was fueled by Democratic state leaders trying to bankrupt him and keep him from Congress. Kern is seeking the GOP nomination in a crowded primary to represent Arizona's Congressional District 8.\n\nLikewise, Hoffman, who is running for another two-year term in the state Senate and for a seat on the Republican National Committee, had accused Mayes and the U.S. Department of Justice, which is prosecuting Trump, of corruption. He claimed they are seeking to \"persecute their political enemies, and it's reprehensible.\"\n\nNeither has meaningfully answered questions from The Arizona Republic about why they signed documents in December 2020 falsely claiming to be legitimate electors from Arizona.\n\nArizona's votes in the Electoral College by law go to the presidential candidate who wins the popular vote. The people who cast the votes -- the electors -- take an oath and sign certificates for the office of president and vice president, which are sent to the U.S. Senate and National Archives.\n\nCongress then meets on Jan. 6 to tally those votes. That date was routine until 2021, when protesters fueled by Trump's false claims that he won the race breached the U.S. Capitol. Congress convened early the next morning to finish its work, discounting the slates of Trump electors and certifying Democrat Joe Biden's win.\n\nHoffman's charges are noteworthy in part because of the immense political power he commands through committee assignments and his role as founder of the Arizona Freedom Caucus. The caucus is the coalition of both the House and Senate's most conservative members.\n\nBut Hoffman and Kern are not the only sitting lawmakers to face indictment in Arizona in recent years.\n\nState Sen. Otoniel \"Tony\" Navarrete, D-Phoenix, was arrested in August 2021 on charges he had sexual conduct with two teenagers. He resigned a few days later, and was in February found guilty of one count of sexual conduct with a minor.\n\nRep. Ceci Velasquez, D-Litchfield Park, was indicted in 2016 on charges of welfare fraud involving the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, commonly called food stamps. Velasquez pleaded guilty to one count and was put on a year's probation, The Arizona Republic previously reported. Velasquez did not resign, but said while the case was pending that she would not seek reelection.\n\nGoing deeper into the history books, Republican Gov. Fife Symington stuck it out in office while facing criminal charges alleging he defrauded lenders to his real estate business. He was forced to resign after being convicted of making false financial statements in 1997.\n\nOther lawmakers have resigned while facing the Legislature's ethics investigation process, which can lead to an expulsion vote.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stacey_barchenger@azcentral.com", "name": "Stacey Barchenger", "type":

(Alyssa Pointer/Getty Images)\n\nDonald Trump's Arizona allies didn't just take notes on an alleged criminal conspiracy - they videotaped themselves engaged in one and straight up posted it on social media, boasting of their scheme to have Republican partisans pose as legitimate electors in order to rob President Joe Biden of his 2020 victory in the state.\n\nThey were pompous about it, too. The video, posted by the Arizona Republican Party on December 14, 2020, is titled, \"The Signing,\" and shows former state party chair Kelli Ward declaring, falsely, that she and others in the video are the \"duly elected and qualified electors\" and that the winner of Arizona, lo and behold, was the man who received 10,000 fewer votes.\n\nOn Wednesday, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said she had enough. \"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined, it's too important,\" Mayes, a Democrat elected in 2022, said in a video announcing that she had indicted Ward and others involved in the conspiracy to keep the loser of the 2020 election in power. Among the 18 individuals charged with felonies include Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, Christina Bobb, John Eastman and Jenna Ellis, who are accused of helping to orchestrate the fraud, which aimed - through forged documents falsely claiming election deniers were legitimate electors - to provide Republicans at the federal level just enough cover to reject the 2020 results and engage in a congressional coup d'\u00e9tat.\n\n\"Defendants deceived the citizens of Arizona by falsely claiming that those votes were contingent only on a legal challenge that would change the outcome of the election,\" the indictment states. \"In reality, Defendants intended that their false votes for Trump-Pence would encourage Pence to reject the Biden-Harris votes on January 6, 2021, regardless of the outcome of the legal challenge.\"\n\nLeft unindicted, but clearly identifiable as a co-conspirator in the 58-page charging document, is the former president who stood to gain from the conspiracy (is it still only \"alleged\" when you can see it on Twitter?). But he's not the only big name missing but nonetheless clearly present in the indictment.\n\n\"It reeks of Ken Chesebro,\" MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin commented after the indictment was unveiled. The document cites multiple emails involving Chesebro, a lawyer who worked for the 2020 Trump campaign and helped organize fake-elector plots in battleground states, including one that spells out that the fake electors would be useful even in the absence of litigation; that is, the electors were never a real backstop, only to be invoked if a court threw out the 2020 results, but a fig leaf.\n\nChesebro was charged in the Georgia election interference case, pleading guilty in October 2023 to a felony county of conspiring to file false documents. He has since sat down for interviews with investigators in other states and, while his honesty has been called into question, legal experts say he appears to have been useful to the attorney general and her case.\n\nJoyce Vance, who served as a U.S. attorney under President Barack Obama, said the indictment suggests \"Chesebro may be cooperating with prosecutors.\" And that, she wrote Wednesday, could make it easier to convict others - including other Trump attorneys - who were charged. Indeed, it could even break the case wide open, for if \"that cooperation is fulsome, it could lead to a situation where people he is able to testify against become highly motivated to cooperate as well.\"\n\nChesebro has already impacted the scope of the Arizona case. As The Washington Post reported, the Arizona attorney general had zeroed in on \"local conservatives\" until late last year, when Chesebro sat down with investigators and \"provided Mayes's team with records -- some that had been previously unseen -- that revealed more information about those involved in the Arizona effort,\" the Post reported, citing two sources familiar with the investigation.\n\nIf Chesebro's apparent cooperation leads others to cooperate, that could spell trouble for a far better known but similarly unindicted co-conspirator, currently standing trial in lower Manhattan.\n\n\"It's not simply that they are in great imperil, they of course imperil Trump because they are people who could cooperate and really don't have that many options or that much money,\" Harry Litman, a former U.S. deputy assistant attorney general, told MSNBC. Particularly vulnerable are the seven Arizona Republicans who were indicted for posing as electors, he said, arguing that they are far more likely to seek plea deals and cooperate with investigators, potentially sharing damning information on not just Trump's inner circle, but the man himself.\n\n\"They are people who presumably want futures in their individual states,\" Litman said of the local fake electors, \"and therefore they are not going to fall on their swords for Trump.\"", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The news prompted former Trump White House lawyer Ty Cobb to say that Trump's former personal attorney \"sold his soul\" for his former boss.\n\nAmong those charged were 11 Republican electors prosecutors say falsely signed paperwork declaring Trump the winner of the state. Seven others were also indicted, but their names were redacted. However, the Washington Post reported those defendants are \"former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, attorneys Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis, John Eastman and Christina Bobb, top campaign adviser Boris Epshteyn and former campaign aide Mike Roman.\"\n\n\"They are accused of allegedly aiding an unsuccessful strategy to award the state's electoral votes to Trump instead of Biden after the 2020 election,\" the Post said.\n\nCobb offered his thoughts on Wednesday's edition of OutFront on CNN.\n\n\"I could see them fashioning this in a way that tries to scope in all the people who actually contacted fake electors, organized fake electors, helped policy-wise in terms of how they were going to do this, which would include Epshteyn. So, I think that's- that seems to be the distinction that they use in identifying the people that they were going to mention in the indictment, either as unindicted co-conspirators or actual defendants. I do think that Epshteyn is fascinating as a defendant in this case.\"\n\n\"He's been with Trump a lot,\" host Erin Burnett observed. \"I remember he was on the plane going down for the Mar-a-Lago indictment appearances. He's - of all these people - still in his inner circle.\"\n\n\"Very much in his inner circle,\" Cobb replied. \"And very protective of the former president and protective to the point that Giuliani reached when he arguably sold his soul to protect the president under circumstances that were improper.\"\n\nIn the weeks after the 2020 election, Trump and his allies attempted to subvert election results in states he lost. The former president falsely claimed the contest was rigged against him.", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Giuliani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Cobb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ty Cobb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_fake_electors_plot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trump fake electors plot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Ellis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jenna Ellis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_America_News_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "One America News Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Chief of Staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Epshteyn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boris Epshteyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobb_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cobb County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cobb County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_conspiracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal conspiracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Burnett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erin Burnett"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screen-Shot-2024-04-24-at-5.25.21-PM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510566", "eventUri": "eng-9510566", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

The former president has not been charged as part of the probe but is referred to as \"Unindicted Coconspirator 1\" throughout the indictment.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Trump's team via email for comment.\n\nFormer Pentagon special counsel Ryan Goodman noted one section of the indictment suggesting that those close to Donald Trump were aware of a plan to certify \"illegal votes\" as part of their alleged scheme.\n\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, Goodman highlighted a section of the indictment that discussed how some members of Trump's inner circle refused to support the alleged fake electors scheme.\n\n\"Gold in hands of Arizona (and federal) prosecutors: Trump campaign draft announcement to have false electors vote, White House lawyer Eric Herschmann texted: 'Certifying illegal votes,'\" Goodman posted.\n\n\"Those on texts refuse to put their names on it. Leave it to Rudy [Giuliani], Boris [Epshteyn], Jenna [Ellis] to do that.\"\n\nThe indictment stated that on December 13, 2020, Herschmann, Trump advisor Jason Miller, campaign deputy manager Justin Clark, and campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh were texting each other about the alleged plot.\n\nPer the indictment, Murtaugh was preparing to release a statement the following day stating: \"As election contests continue in various states, the only prudent course was to have the President's electors vote in those places to preserve the campaigns [sic] rights.\"\n\nIn the text chain, Clark responded: \"Now, I am not sure what Rudy is telling the president on this stuff so I'm not sure what his expectations are ....

Prosecutors present evidence to a grand jury for consideration. Sometimes, people with ties to a case are subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury.\n\nAn indictment is followed up by a series of court appearances: an initial appearance and subsequent status hearings leading up to a plea agreement, in which a person admits guilt, or a trial. In court, those accused in a state criminal case have the right to an attorney, and the state must appoint one if a defendant cannot afford representation.\n\nAll defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty in court and convicted by a jury of their peers, as the Arizona Attorney General's Office said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nAll indictments are heard in a particular court. This case was filed in Maricopa County Superior Court. The state has Superior Courts in every county, and cases are heard in the location where a crime is alleged to have occurred.\n\nAttorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, unveiled the charges on Wednesday, saying the grand jury had issued the nine-count indictment against the 11 people who were Republican electors in Arizona in 2020 and attorneys and other allies of Trump.\n\nIt alleges the slate of Republicans, sometimes known as fake electors, and the Trump aides engaged in a conspiracy aimed at \"preventing the lawful transfer of the presidency of the United States, keeping President Donald J.

Trump has not been charged in the Arizona fake elector scheme but is listed as \"Unindicted Coconspirator 1\" throughout the indictment.\n\nIn March, Bobb, a former Trump lawyer and former reporter for One America News Network (OAN), who has been vocal in her denial of the results of the 2020 election, was appointed as the GOP governing body's senior counsel for election integrity.\n\n\"I'm honored to join the RNC and thrilled the new leadership is focused on election integrity. I look forward to working to secure our elections and restore confidence in the process,\" Bobb said in a statement to CNN at the time.\n\nOn Wednesday, she was named as part of the indictment alongside other Trump allies in the state where Biden defeated Trump by more than 10,000 votes. Arizona was also among seven states where Republicans are accused of acting as fake electors, allegedly signing documents falsely claiming Trump had won.\n\nTrump Campaign Communications Director Steven Cheung said to Newsweek: \"Another example of Democrats' weaponization of the legal system. Christina Bobb is a former Marine Corps officer, who served our nation and the President with distinction. The Democrat platform for 2024: if you can't beat them, try to throw them in jail.\"\n\nThe indictment described a tweet Bobb published on Dec. 6, 2020, criticizing the Arizona House speaker at the time of using the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to close the chamber for a week.\n\n\"Sounds like he needs an excuse to give his angry constituents about why he's refusing to call a session and examine the fraud in his state,\" the tweet stated. \"First time it's been closed the whole pandemic.\"\n\nWhile this was not mentioned in the indictment, Bobb also wrote a book making baseless claims about the election called Stealing Your Vote: The Inside Story of the 2020 Election and What It Means for 2024.\n\nShe also signed a sworn affidavit on Trump's behalf falsely alleging that there were no classified documents at Mar-a-Lago when federal authorities were trying to recover them.\n\nWhile at OAN, she also promoted claims that the election was rigged and was sued in two cases by the voting technology companies Dominion and Smartmatic over her remarks. OAN and Bobb denied wrongdoing in these cases.\n\nIn a video announcing the indictments shared on X, formerly Twitter, Mayes accused the defendants of attempting to undermine the votes cast by Arizona residents.\n\n\"We're here because justice demands an answer to the efforts the defendants and other unindicted co-conspirators allegedly took to undermine the will of Arizona's voters during the 2020 presidential election,\" Mayes said. \"Arizona's election was free and fair. The people of Arizona elected President Biden, unwilling to accept this fact that defendants charged by the state grand jury, allegedly schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency. Whatever their reasoning was, the plot to violate the law must be answered for and I was elected to uphold the law of this state.\"\n\nThe attorney general continued: \"The scheme had it succeeded would have deprived Arizona's voters of their right to have their votes counted for their chosen president. It effectively would have made their right to vote meaningless.\"\n\nAside from Bobb, 10 people were named in the indictment while seven additional names were redacted from records released by Mayes.\n\nThe defendants named in the documents include Kelli Ward, former chair of the Arizona Republican Party, and her husband Michael Ward; ex-U.S. Senate candidate Jim Lamon; two current state senators, Jake Hoffman and Anthony Kern; and Tyler Bowyer, the Republican National Committee's Arizona committeeman and chief operating officer of the pro-Trump Turning Point Action organization.",

The people of Arizona elected President Biden,\" said Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, on Wednesday in a video from Phoenix.\n\n\"Unwilling to accept this fact, the defendants charged by the state grand jury allegedly schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency,\" she continued. \"Whatever their reasoning was, the plot to violate the law must be answered for, and I was elected to uphold the law of this state.\"\n\nEighteen Republicans were indicted, but officials initially released only 11 names because the rest were not yet notified.

Trump is listed as an un-indicted co-conspirator.\n\nThe charges include felony counts of conspiracy, fraud, and forgery.\n\nTrump spokesman Steven Cheung released a brief statement criticizing the indictments.\n\n\"Another example of Democrats' weaponization of the legal system. Christina Bobb is a former Marine Corps officer, who served our nation and the President with distinction. The Democrat platform for 2024: if you can't beat them, try to throw them in jail,\" Cheung said.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith has charged the former president with alleged crimes related to the effort to overturn the election while Republicans have been charged by several states, including Georgia, Michigan, and Nevada.\n\n\"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,\" said Mayes in the video Wednesday. \"It's too important.\"", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The state Republican Party documented the signing of the certificate in a social media post and sent it to Congress and the National Archives.\n\nAmong those charged is Kelli Ward, who served as chair of the Arizona GOP during the 2020 election and the immediate aftermath. She tweeted on Jan. 6, 2021, after the attack on the U.S. Capitol: \"Congress is adjourned. Send the elector choice back to the legislatures.\" Ward was a consistent propagator of false claims that Arizona's election results were rigged.\n\nOthers charged include: state legislators Anthony Kern and Jake Hoffman;

Why didn't former AG Mark Brnovich?", "body": "The contrast -- and legal stakes -- couldn't be more striking.\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, announced the indictment of 11 Republicans who acted together and in public to submit documents falsely claiming to be the state's rightful presidential electors in 2020.\n\nHer predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, left that matter in the hands of the U.S. Justice Department while records show he dispatched dozens of staffers and more than 10,000 hours of their work to investigate claims of election fraud that proved almost entirely without support.\n\nWhile Brnovich's approach netted almost no one, Mayes has brought the most politically tremulous case to Arizona perhaps since the AzScam bribery cases more than 30 years ago.\n\nRead indictment:Arizona grand jury's indictment of fake electors\n\nIn a video her office released with the announcement of the indictment, Mayes defended the importance of the case.\n\n\"I understand for some of you today didn't come fast enough. I know I will be criticized by others for conducting this investigation at all,\" she said. \"But as I have stated before and will say here again today, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined. It's too important.\"\n\nBrnovich could not be immediately reached for comment about his approach.\n\nIt played out while Brnovich ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 2022.\n\nIn other states, authorities also pursued the \"fake electors\" from 2020, alongside the federal probe.\n\nIt's largely why Georgia, Michigan and Nevada have already brought criminal charges against would-be electors in those states.\n\nFake electors in New Mexico and Pennsylvania used less-definitive language asserting their claim to the presidential votes and won't face charges there.\n\nTen fake electors in Wisconsin reached a civil settlement in December ending a 2022 lawsuit targeting them and two lawyers aligned with former President Donald Trump for unlawful use of public resources stemming from the effort there.\n\nA separate criminal investigation there is ongoing.\n\nArizona, a state that actually had two sets of fake electors, now seeks its own consequences for those involved in a plan intended to help justify delaying or setting aside the certified election results in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021. When then-Vice President Mike Pence refused to consider the fake electors, a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol. The indictment unveiled Wednesday charges 11 would-be electors and seven Trump allies.\n\nThe case against Arizona's fake electors remained a nonissue for years while baseless allegations of election fraud commanded official attention and as Brnovich ran for the U.S. Senate under Trump's watchful eye.\n\nFor months, Trump, who in 2018 named Brnovich's wife to a lifetime position as a federal judge, remained publicly coy about Brnovich's political future.\n\nHe urged Brnovich to bring charges for election fraud growing out of Arizona's high-profile 2021 recount of Maricopa County's ballots. Trump resisted an early endorsement in the Senate race, unlike the governor's race, where he quickly backed Republican Kari Lake in a crowded primary.\n\nIn July 2021, his first visit to Arizona after leaving the White House, Trump put pressure on Brnovich by pointing to the state Senate's partisan and amateurish ballot review, which was winding down.\n\n\"Hopefully -- and I say this, and I have confidence in it -- hopefully, your attorney general, Mark Brnovich ... will take this incredible information given by these incredible warriors and patriots, and he's going to take it and he's going to do what everybody knows needs to be done.\"\n\nFour months later, after the ballot review concluded President Joe Biden won Maricopa County by a slightly larger margin than the county's official results showed, Trump lashed out at Brnovich again.\n\n\"Whatever happened to the rigged and stolen Arizona Presidential Election that is being investigated, or maybe the words should properly be 'looked at,' by Attorney General Mark Brnovich? When will the legislature vote to decertify?\" Trump said in a statement at the time.\n\nIn January 2022, during an appearance in Florence, Trump repeated his hope that Brnovich would take action on the state Senate's ballot review. At the same time, he mentioned Senate candidate Blake Masters in a sign of who was best positioned for his eventual support.\n\nIn the end, Brnovich's staff could not find evidence supporting election fraud and it wasn't scrutinizing charges against the fake electors.\n\nTrump ultimately endorsed Masters, who cast doubt on the 2020 election and won the GOP's Senate nomination before losing to U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., along with other election deniers on the ballot.\n\nBrnovich finished a distant third in the GOP primary and left office at the end of the year.\n\nBy contrast, Mayes made preserving democracy a key theme of her 2022 campaign and cast herself as a bulwark against a coup. She defeated election denier Abe Hamadeh by 280 votes, the narrowest margin in a statewide contest in Arizona's history.\n\nShortly after taking office, Mayes released records of Brnovich's investigation of election fraud. They showed his staff couldn't find credible evidence of any widespread fraud, including leads provided by Cyber Ninjas, the Florida-based company heading the ballot review, and other conservative groups.\n\nThe head of the Special Investigations section under Brnovich summarized his department's work this way in a September 2022 report released once Mayes took office:\n\n\"Of the 430 investigations, 22 cases were submitted for prosecution. Agents and support staff have spent more than 10,000 hours investigating allegations of voting irregularities and reviewing alleged instances of illegal voting submitted to our office by private parties. Some of the more high-profile matters involved Cyber Ninjas Incorporated, True the Vote, Verity Vote, and elected officials. In each instance and in each matter, the aforementioned parties did not provide any evidence to support their allegations. The information that was provided was speculative in many instances and when investigated by our agents and support staff, was found to be inaccurate.\"\n\nWhy The Republic kept fighting:It took years for truth about election 'audit' to emerge\n\nBy March 2023, Mayes had opened an investigation into the fake electors matter that Brnovich left essentially untouched.\n\n\"I'm not certain that my predecessor did an investigation into the fake electors,\" Mayes told the Arizona Mirror at the time. \"I will investigate the fake electors' situation, and I will take very seriously any effort to undermine our democracy. Those are the cases that I will take most seriously.\"\n\nTo that end, Mayes' office cast a wide net.\n\nIn July, her office confirmed to The Arizona Republic that it was examining the ballot review as part of the probe of the fake electors.\n\nIn October, the Washington Post reported that investigators talked to those subjected to Trump's pressure campaign, including former Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, R-Mesa.\n\nIn March, Politico reported that Mayes' team subpoenaed fake electors themselves to face the grand jury, a very rare move that predictably led the potential targets to invoke their 5 Amendment rights against self-incrimination.\n\nRepublican U.S. Reps. Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar of Arizona, two of the most prominent voices amplifying false claims saying the 2020 election was stolen, were subpoenaed, too.\n\nWhile those involved in the effort to erase Arizona's actual electors from congressional consideration wouldn't talk to the grand jury in public, at least some have accused Mayes' office of wrongdoing in her probe.\n\n\"I'm not commenting on the elector situation or the ongoings of the court proceedings,\" said state Sen. Jake Hoffman, R-Queen Creek, one of Arizona's fake electors.\n\n\"However, what I can tell you is that we have a wildly corrupt Department of Justice and now a corrupt attorney general who are weaponizing our justice system both nationally and now at the state level to persecute their political enemies, and it's reprehensible. It's immoral. It's evil.\"\n\nElsewhere, pressure has mounted on the other fake electors across the country.\n\nIn July, Michigan's Democratic attorney general charged 16 Republicans with felonies including forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery.\n\nIn August, a Democratic prosecutor in Georgia's Fulton County brought a racketeering case against Trump and 18 others, including some of that state's fake electors. Other fake electors escaped indictment because of their cooperation with the prosecution.\n\nIn December, Nevada's Democratic attorney general announced the indictment of six Republicans who participated in the fake elector plan there.\n\nThe Georgia case carries up to 20 years behind bars. The most serious charge in Michigan carries up to 14 years in prison. In Nevada, some of the charges carry up to five years in prison.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ronald_j_hansen@azcentral.com", "name": "Ronald J.

But these probes have gotten very little national attention - until tonight.\n\nThis evening prosecutors in Arizona and Michigan had grand juries bring criminal indictments against numerous Trump world figures. The indictments in Michigan were generally lower level people whose names you don't know. But Arizona decided to indict big names like Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, Jenna Ellis, John Eastman, Boris Epshteyn, and Christina Bobb.\n\nNotably absent from the Arizona list is Donald Trump, who is referred to as an unindicted co-conspirator in the indictment. What does this mean? It's not clear yet. As I've long tried to explain, every state has its own set of laws when it comes to this kind of thing. For instance Trump was indicted on serious charges in Georgia because the state has strong RICO laws that make it easy for prosecutors to nail the \"crime boss\" who orchestrates a criminal plot but doesn't get his hands dirty. In other states, where the laws are different, getting a conviction against Trump would be much harder.\n\nSo it's possible that Arizona prosecutors simply concluded that Arizona law wasn't going to let them get a conviction against Trump. But it's also possible that Arizona indicted all these Trump world figures first, with the intention of getting some of them to flip on Trump, so he can be indicted and convicted as well.\n\nWe'll see where this goes.

Anthony Kern and Jake Hoffman, former state GOP Chair Kelli Ward and her husband, plus people outside of Arizona who are described in the indictment but not named. The unnamed defendants appear to include former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and other allies of former President Donald Trump associated with similar cases in Georgia and Michigan.\n\nRead the indictment: Arizona grand jury's indictment of fake electors\n\nEach of the defendants was served with the indictment and most, if not all, already have attorneys.\n\nThe next step is for each defendant to negotiate a time and day to self-surrender to a jail facility for booking.\n\nDefendants will submit to booking photos and fingerprinting, and they will see a judge about terms of release on their own recognizance.\n\nMost likely, they will have an arraignment hearing at the same time, letting a judge know they are pleading not guilty, McDonald said.\n\nThose not in Arizona, like Giuliani, must travel to Arizona for the booking at their own expense or face a likely bench warrant, McDonald said.\n\nAfter that will come numerous court dates and discovery of evidence by each side that will probably include voluminous documents by Mayes' office.\n\n\"It's going to be massive,\" McDonald said.\n\nWhile each defendant will face their own challenges, Mayes and her office must decide how to manage the case. A single venue won't be large enough to try 18 defendants at once, so attorney motions are likely to request severing the defendants into groups with \"common threads,\" McDonald said.\n\nIn addition, \"picking a jury in this case is going to be a nightmare\" because the public is so politically divided, he added. Plus, many Arizonans are somewhat familiar with the basic facts of the case and some of the people involved.\n\nMcDonald expected Mayes to argue how the case represents a serious threat to the election system. But her opponents are likely to push for a different prosecution agency, alleging that Mayes, a Democrat, is politically biased.\n\n\"Everybody's been living this stolen election stuff for years,\" McDonald said. \"A lot of people out there believe the election was stolen. Others believe those people are crazy.\"\n\nRead more about the charges: Grand jury indicts fake electors who falsely certified Donald Trump as 2020 winner in Arizona\n\nReach the reporter at rstern@arizonarepublic.com or 480-276-3237.

I wonder why", "body": "Arizona just can't stay out of the news, and Wednesday was further proof.\n\nWhat a day for Arizona news. And honestly, aside from being a reminder that the state will play a central role in the 2024 election and everything involved with it, it all made Arizona look pretty dismal.\n\nTo put it another way, anyone who pays attention to the news outside Arizona -- anyone inside it for that matter -- might wonder what the heck is going on here. Aside from Fox News viewers, who probably have no clue, but more on that later. Man, you can't help but wonder if that network's viewers have any idea of what's going on in the world at all.\n\nThe stories began with The Republican-led Arizona House voting to repeal the 1864 abortion ban. It got some cable-news coverage, appropriate for an important, if ongoing, story. In fact, it was still the lead story on the New York Times website Wednesday afternoon -- when, over on the Washington Post website, the lead story was about an Arizona grand jury indicting 11 Republicans and seven former aides to Donald Trump in a scheme to falsely certify that Trump won the election. (The indictment story was eventually the lead story on the Times homepage, as well.)\n\nSo we bounced from coverage of trying to repeal a law from when women couldn't vote -- from when Arizona wasn't even a state -- to a reminder of just how crazy the fallout from Joe Biden winning Arizona, and indeed winning the presidency, in 2020 was. And all of it was viewed through a political lens.\n\nOr, as CNN's Jeff Zeleny put it, \"Arizona is always going to be ground zero of this election.\"\n\nAren't Arizonans the lucky ones.\n\nCNN and MSNBC jumped all over the indictment story, as well they should. MSNBC's Vaughn Hillyard, an Arizona State University graduate who has thoroughly covered the election and its ramifications -- he was watching as former Gov. Doug Ducey signed the paperwork to certify the real electors when Ducey's phone rang and played \"Hail to the Chief,\" Ducey's ringtone for a Trump call, a call Ducey didn't take.\n\nHillyard explained why the indictments came now when the election was in 2020: Because Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, was elected in 2022. Her predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, showed no interest in pursuing the fake electors. (He did show an interest in nunchucks, though.)\n\nTalking about the fake electors who were indicted, which include former Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward and onetime One America News Network \"journalist\" Christina Bobb, Hillyard said, \"This is for all intents and purposes the Republican Party of Arizona.\"\n\nGood on CNN for quickly reaching Rusty Bowers, the Republican and former Arizona House speaker who withstood pressure from Trump and others, and whose testimony before the Jan. 6 committee was among the most compelling given. Bowers didn't want to say much -- he anticipates having to testify at some point, he said -- but he did say, \"It's sad to see it come to this. Other than that, I better not comment other than yeah, they did call me,\" meaning Trump and others who pressured him.\n\n\"For some that might have been real troubling,\" Bowers said of the pressure. \"I don't know how I feel about it now, but at the time it was certainly demanding of my staff, my assistants. They had to put up with thousands -- not hundreds, but thousands -- of emails and calls. They're troupers.\"\n\nTy Cobb, once part of Trump's legal team, praised the focus of the Arizona indictments in comparison to cases made against fake electors in other states. \"I think this is a laser,\" Cobb said, \"and not a kitchen sink.\"\n\nDemocracy in Doubt series: White House phone calls, baseless fraud charges: The origins of the Arizona election review\n\nAll good stuff, important information and context. Breaking news can be tricky to cover, but CNN and MSNBC did a good job of it.\n\nSo around 4 p.m. and after, that's how coverage broke down: CNN, Arizona indictments. MSNBC, Arizona indictments. Fox News? \"The problem with Alvin Bragg's prosecution.\"\n\nTo be fair, the story broke during \"The Ingraham Angle,\" Laura Ingraham's show, so she was busy defending Trump and ridiculing Biden. Sample quote: \"Trump has been stuck in New York, thanks to this sham trial.\"\n\nWait, what fairness? That's ridiculous. Granted, a show like this puts its lineup together hours before, but if you purport to cover the news, you have to cover the news. You break into programming. Ingraham, meanwhile, moved on to the \"liberal\" media's hypocrisy in covering the Trump trial, and later did an entire segment on \"media obsession\" with Melania Trump's clothes.\n\nAmazing. And not in a good way.\n\nHow long is Arizona going to be at the center of this surreal media storm? I'll tell you: at least until Nov. 5, Election Day. And if 2020 is any indication, a lot longer than that.\n\nVaughn Hillyard: He left Arizona for NBC News.

I wonder why", "body": "Arizona just can't stay out of the news, and Wednesday was further proof.\n\nWhat a day for Arizona news. And honestly, aside from being a reminder that the state will play a central role in the 2024 election and everything involved with it, it all made Arizona look pretty dismal.\n\nTo put it another way, anyone who pays attention to the news outside Arizona -- anyone inside it for that matter -- might wonder what the heck is going on here. Aside from Fox News viewers, who probably have no clue, but more on that later. Man, you can't help but wonder if that network's viewers have any idea of what's going on in the world at all.\n\nArizona news led the New York Times and Washington Post homepages\n\nThe stories began with The Republican-led Arizona House voting to repeal the 1864 abortion ban. It got some cable-news coverage, appropriate for an important, if ongoing, story. In fact, it was still the lead story on the New York Times website Wednesday afternoon -- when, over on the Washington Post website, the lead story was about an Arizona grand jury indicting 11 Republicans and seven former aides to Donald Trump in a scheme to falsely certify that Trump won the election. (The indictment story was eventually the lead story on the Times homepage, as well.)\n\nSo we bounced from coverage of trying to repeal a law from when women couldn't vote -- from when Arizona wasn't even a state -- to a reminder of just how crazy the fallout from Joe Biden winning Arizona, and indeed winning the presidency, in 2020 was. And all of it was viewed through a political lens.\n\nOr, as CNN's Jeff Zeleny put it, \"Arizona is always going to be ground zero of this election.\"\n\nAren't Arizonans the lucky ones.\n\nCNN and MSNBC jumped all over the indictment story, as well they should. MSNBC's Vaughn Hillyard, an Arizona State University graduate who has thoroughly covered the election and its ramifications -- he was watching as former Gov. Doug Ducey signed the paperwork to certify the real electors when Ducey's phone rang and played \"Hail to the Chief,\" Ducey's ringtone for a Trump call, a call Ducey didn't take.\n\nHillyard explained why the indictments came now when the election was in 2020: Because Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, was elected in 2022. Her predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, showed no interest in pursuing the fake electors. (He did show an interest in nunchucks, though.)\n\nTalking about the fake electors who were indicted, which include former Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward and onetime One America News Network \"journalist\" Christina Bobb, Hillyard said, \"This is for all intents and purposes the Republican Party of Arizona.\"\n\nGood for CNN for reaching Rusty Bowers\n\nGood on CNN for quickly reaching Rusty Bowers, the Republican and former Arizona House speaker who withstood pressure from Trump and others, and whose testimony before the Jan. 6 committee was among the most compelling given. Bowers didn't want to say much -- he anticipates having to testify at some point, he said -- but he did say, \"It's sad to see it come to this. Other than that, I better not comment other than yeah, they did call me,\" meaning Trump and others who pressured him.\n\n\"For some that might have been real troubling,\" Bowers said of the pressure. \"I don't know how I feel about it now, but at the time it was certainly demanding of my staff, my assistants. They had to put up with thousands -- not hundreds, but thousands -- of emails and calls. They're troupers.\"\n\nTy Cobb, once part of Trump's legal team, praised the focus of the Arizona indictments in comparison to cases made against fake electors in other states. \"I think this is a laser,\" Cobb said, \"and not a kitchen sink.\"\n\nDemocracy in Doubt series:White House phone calls, baseless fraud charges: The origins of the Arizona election review\n\nWhere was Fox News? Busy defending Trump\n\nAll good stuff, important information and context. Breaking news can be tricky to cover, but CNN and MSNBC did a good job of it.\n\nSo around 4 p.m. and after, that's how coverage broke down: CNN, Arizona indictments. MSNBC, Arizona indictments. Fox News? \"The problem with Alvin Bragg's prosecution.\"\n\nTo be fair, the story broke during \"The Ingraham Angle,\" Laura Ingraham's show, so she was busy defending Trump and ridiculing Biden. Sample quote: \"Trump has been stuck in New York, thanks to this sham trial.\"\n\nWait, what fairness? That's ridiculous. Granted, a show like this puts its lineup together hours before, but if you purport to cover the news, you have to cover the news. You break into programming. Ingraham, meanwhile, moved on to the \"liberal\" media's hypocrisy in covering the Trump trial, and later did an entire segment on \"media obsession\" with Melania Trump's clothes.\n\nAmazing. And not in a good way.\n\nHow long is Arizona going to be at the center of this surreal media storm? I'll tell you: at least until Nov. 5, Election Day. And if 2020 is any indication, a lot longer than that.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_goodykoontz@azcentral.com", "name":

Actually, they contested the election.\n\nDemocrat Attorney General Kris Mayes said a grand jury approved criminal charges against eleven Republicans for submitting a document to Congress falsely declaring Trump carried the battleground state.\n\nSeven others were charged, but their names were redacted since they haven't been served yet. The Wall Street Journal said portions of the indictment made it clear that Giuliani and Meadows were among the indicted.\n\nIn a statement, Democrat Mayes said he understood he would be criticized for not working fast enough or for conducting the investigation at all. \"But as I have stated before and will say here again today, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined. It's too important.\"\n\nDemocrats are the threat to democracy.\n\nThere are similar indictments in Nevada and Michigan, thanks to Democrats.\n\nEverything these Republicans did was above board and in the open. On December 14, 2020, the eleven people came together and signed a certificate saying they were the state's \"duly elected and qualified\" electors. They documented this in a social media post and sent it to Congress and the National Archives.\n\nMayes said they've been charged with fraud, forgery, and conspiracy. It's exactly what they are doing in the other states, and it's BS. How can it be any of these things if it's open and according to legal opinion?\n\nCan't these fools find some actual criminals to indict?

Who are they?", "body": "Eighteen people were indicted in a criminal case brought by Attorney General Kris Mayes involving the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election in Arizona.\n\nFive others were named as unindicted co-conspirators.\n\nThe designation means these five were believed to be involved in plans to present an alternate slate of presidential electors, but were not charged with a crime for their activities.\n\nHere's what we know about the possible identities of the five co-conspirators, based on information pulled from the public records and other sources.\n\nUnindicted co-conspirator 1: former President Donald Trump\n\nUnindicted co-conspirator 1 is clearly former President Donald Trump. The indictment describes this individual as \"A former president of the United States who spread false claims of election fraud following the 2020 election.\"\n\nUnindicted co-conspirator 2: former state Sen. Kelly Townsend\n\nUnindicted co-conspirator 2 closely resembles former state Sen. Kelly Townsend, a Mesa Republican. This coconspirator \"spread false claims of election fraud following the 2020 election\" and \"helped organize and distribute a false document on December 14, 2020,\" titled, \"Joint Resolution of the 54th Legislature.\"\n\nTownsend was a leading skeptic of the 2020 election results. Along with former Rep. Mark Finchem, R-Oro Valley, she urged her fellow lawmakers in early December 2020 to overturn the 2020 results. She then demanded then-Attorney General Mark Brnovich investigate each of the claims of election fraud aired at a late November 2020 \"hearing\" conducted by Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and later pressured him to release results of a Senate-requested investigation into claims raised by the Senate's ballot review of Maricopa County's 2020 election results.\n\nOn Dec. 7, 2020, she sent an email to fellow lawmakers asking them to sign a document stating that \"not enough was done to ensure the public of a clean and fair election, and that every vote counted.\"\n\nIt resulted in a joint resolution, signed by 31 Republicans, urging congressional members to accept the \"alternate 11 electors\" or to have all electoral results voided pending \"a full forensic audit.\"\n\nTownsend on Wednesday said \"it's best that I don't make any comments\" after The Republic sent her a copy of the indictment.\n\nUnindicted co-conspirator 3: former Rep. Mark Finchem\n\nUnindicted co-conspirator 3 is identified as a former lawmaker who also spread false claims of 2020 election fraud and \"helped organize a 'hearing' at a hotel in Phoenix on November 30, 2020.\" Finchem was a key organizer of that event and also hosted a hearing in Tucson that sought to prove voting fraud in the 2020 election.\n\nThe indictment said unindicted co-conspirator 3 also signed the joint resolution, which is borne out in the document obtained by The Republic.\n\nUnindicted co-conspirator 4: Kenneth Chesebro\n\nUnindicted co-conspirator 4 closely matches Kenneth Chesebro, a former Trump attorney. The indictment states this person \"drafted memos that encouraged having the fake Republican electors vote on December 14, 2020\" and helped organize fake electors' vote in seven states, including Arizona.\n\nChesebro met with Mayes' investigators in a December trip to Arizona. He authored memos that described how states could put forward electors who would back Trump, even though Trump lost in those states. And Chesebro cooperated with fake elector probes in Nevada and Georgia.\n\nUnindicted co-conspirator 5: Jack Wilenchik\n\nUnindicted co-conspirator 5 is portrayed in the indictment as an Arizona attorney who worked for the Trump campaign and helped set up the Dec. 14, 2020, vote by the 11 fake electors. This attorney also previously represented the state Republican Party and Kelli Ward in a lawsuit that challenged the validity of Arizona's 11 Democratic electors.\n\nThat description closely matches Jack Wilenchik, an Arizona attorney who helped organize the fake electors' meeting.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Anthony Kern and Jake Hoffman, former state GOP Chair Kelli Ward and her husband, plus people outside of Arizona who are described in the indictment but not named. The unnamed defendants appear to include former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and other allies of former President Donald Trump associated with similar cases in Georgia and Michigan.\n\nRead the indictment:Arizona grand jury's indictment of fake electors\n\nWhat's the next step in the legal process for the fake electors?\n\nEach of the defendants was served with the indictment and most, if not all, already have attorneys.\n\nThe next step is for each defendant to negotiate a time and day to self-surrender to a jail facility for booking.\n\nDefendants will submit to booking photos and fingerprinting, and they will see a judge about terms of release on their own recognizance.\n\nMost likely, they will have an arraignment hearing at the same time, letting a judge know they are pleading not guilty, McDonald said.\n\nWhat about the unnamed defendants who don't live in Arizona?\n\nThose not in Arizona, like Giuliani, must travel to Arizona for the booking at their own expense or face a likely bench warrant, McDonald said.\n\nAfter that will come numerous court dates and discovery of evidence by each side that will probably include voluminous documents by Mayes' office.\n\n\"It's going to be massive,\" McDonald said.\n\nWhile each defendant will face their own challenges, Mayes and her office must decide how to manage the case. A single venue won't be large enough to try 18 defendants at once, so attorney motions are likely to request severing the defendants into groups with \"common threads,\" McDonald said.\n\nWho will serve on the jury?\n\nIn addition, \"picking a jury in this case is going to be a nightmare\" because the public is so politically divided, he added. Plus, many Arizonans are somewhat familiar with the basic facts of the case and some of the people involved.\n\nMcDonald expected Mayes to argue how the case represents a serious threat to the election system. But her opponents are likely to push for a different prosecution agency, alleging that Mayes, a Democrat, is politically biased.\n\n\"Everybody's been living this stolen election stuff for years,\" McDonald said. \"A lot of people out there believe the election was stolen.

She joined Trump's legal team after the 2020 election and pushed the roundly debunked claims that the election was stolen, led audits in states like Arizona, and later went on to be a key figure in Trump's classified documents case - having signed the certified letter claiming no more classified documents were in Trump's possession, which, of course, precipitated an FBI raid and turned out to be blatantly false.\n\nLast month, a week after Trump managed to install his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, as co-chair of the Republican National Committee, Bobb was hired by the RNC to lead the party's \"election integrity\" unit.\n\nThe Guardian detailed what Bobb's new role is believed to include:\n\nBobb's \"election integrity\" post at the RNC is expected to involve teams of poll workers, poll watchers and other efforts in swing states and she has begun talking with key Maga allies with similar missions. Bobb last month told the far-right reporter Breanna Morello that her top goal is \"empowering the grassroots\".\n\nEven before her recent indictment, Bobb's hiring raised some eyebrows. Charlie Dent, a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania, blasted the RNC hiring Bobb as a \"further indication of how the RNC has not only become an arm of the Trump campaign, but an outlet for the most extreme elements of the election denial movement.\"\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) reacted to the news saying, \"Putting Christina Bobb in charge of election integrity is like putting Donald Trump in charge of integrity.\"\n\nThe Arizona indictment charged 17 other individuals alongside Bobb, including former top Trump aides like former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, attorneys Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis, John Eastman, and top campaign adviser Boris Epshteyn. The indictment also charged the 11 fake electors that Trump and his allies set up to replace the legitimately elected Biden electors on Jan. 6th - had Vice President Mike Pence followed the plan and thrown out the swing states' electors to be replaced by the fake electors.

Sign up for the Morning Memo newsletter\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes has obtained a state grand jury indictment in her probe of the Trump's 2020 fake electors scheme - and she went higher up the chain than might have been expected.\n\nThe names of the most tantalizing defendants are redacted in the indictment because they haven't been served yet, but reading in context and based on other news reports, they are Trump White Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, Rudy Giuliani, Boris Epshteyn, John Eastman, Christina Bobb, Jenna Ellis and Mike Roman.\n\nEpshteyn's indictment is particularly striking. He has coordinated much of Trump's legal defense as a quasi-general counsel and had not been previously been charged in any of the Trump-related cases.\n\nAnother 11 people including, former state GOP Chair Kelli Ward, are also named in the indictment. Not named, but obviously a cooperator in the investigation, is former Trump campaign attorney Kenneth Chesebro.", "source": {"uri": "talkingpointsmemo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Talking Points Memo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_kurtz@talkingpointsmemo.com", "name": "David Kurtz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Mayes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kris Mayes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_fake_electors_plot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trump fake electors plot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Points_Memo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talking Points Memo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Meadows_(Michigan_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Meadows (Michigan politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_America_News_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "One America News Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Chief of Staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Epshteyn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boris Epshteyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hispanic whites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Giuliani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Select_Committee_on_the_January_6_Attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Ellis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jenna Ellis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelli_Ward", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelli Ward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-623228414-scaled.jpg?w=804", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510566", "eventUri": "eng-9510566", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

They are accused of allegedly aiding an unsuccessful strategy to award the state's electoral votes to Trump instead of Biden after the 2020 election. Also charged are the Republicans who signed paperwork on Dec. 14, 2020, that falsely purported Trump was the rightful winner, including former state party chair Kelli Ward, two state senators and Tyler Bowyer, a GOP national committeeman and chief operating officer of Turning Point Action, the campaign arm of the pro-Trump conservative group Turning Point USA.\n\nTrump was not charged, but he is described in the indictment as an unindicted co-conspirator...\n\nFormer Weld County traffic attorney and ex-Colorado Christian University law professor Jenna Ellis is already facing a renewed threat to her Colorado law license under a complaint filed with state attorney regulators after Ellis' guilty plea to a felony charge in the Georgia election interference case last October. Ellis has already been censured by the state for her \"at least reckless\" false statements while on the clock as an attorney for Trump. Fellow Trump coup plotter and ex-University of Colorado conservative scholar John Eastman, in the latter stages of being disbarred by the state of California, has less to lose now notwithstanding possible jail time-but unlike Ellis has remained totally unrepentant while his career has been steadily dismantled since January 6th, 2021.\n\nBut the Colorado connections to these indictments don't end there! Readers will recall that now-indicted Trump lawyer Boris Epshteyn served as an advisor to Heidi Ganahl's campaign for governor in 2022. And Trump attorney Christina Bobb, recently hired by the Republican National Committee to be their \"election integrity\" lawyer, was a keynote speaker at the Colorado Republican Party's state assembly earlier this month, enthusiastically spreading the \"Big Lie\" as the Colorado Times Recorder's Heidi Beedle reported from the scene:\n\n\"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize the election was stolen in 2020,\" said Bobb, to enthusiastic cheers from the Colorado delegates and party members. \"Donald Trump won that.\"\n\nWell folks, now Bobb gets to, as they say, tell it to the judge. Although the \"Big Lie\" plays well at Republican assemblies with no fact-checking present, as former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters can tell you, in a court of law it holds up like a snowball in a blast furnace.\n\nEllis has already learned this lesson the hard way, and unlike the rest of these defendants has no loyalty remaining to Trump. That's why we'll be watching for her swift plea deal, even if Rudy Giuliani, Eastman and the rest of the Trump loyalists go down with the ship.\n\nAnd then...maybe more charges in more states. Each state line marks a chance to do a new crime.", "source": {"uri": "coloradopols.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Pols"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Also charged are the Republicans who signed the paperwork for the false electors, including GOP state party chair Kelli Ward, state Senator Jake Hoffman and state Senator Anthony Kern, and a GOP national committeeman and CEO of Turning Point Action, Tyler Bowyer. Trump was not charged, but was listed as \"unindicted co-conspirator.\"\n\nMany of those indicted plotted in numerous other states and quite a few of them actually face charges in Fulton County, Georgia for similar charges. In Georgia, Jenna Ellis already pleaded guilty. This is Boris Epshteyn's first set of charges.\n\nA name that is not in the indictment: Kenneth Chesebro. The Post reports that Arizona prosecutors met with him in late 2023 and he provided them \"with records -- some that had been previously unseen -- that revealed more information about those involved in the Arizona effort.\"\n\nThe news of the indictments broke during the 7pm news hour, so Joy Ann Reid carried the story live, as Vaughn Hillyard had to rapidly read the document and discuss it live on air. Here is a bit of the back and forth with Joyce Vance and Joy Ann Reid:\n\nREID: And joining me now is Joyce Vance, former US attorney and MSNBC legal analyst. Joyce, I'll go to you first for your reaction.\n\nVANCE: Well, I think it's not surprising that we've seen this indictment. What's surprising in some regards is some of the expansion here, the inclusion of Boris Epshtyn, the apparent sense that Kenneth Chesebro may be finally cooperating since he is not indicted but is discussed in the indictment. This suggests that prosecutors in Arizona have amassed the evidence that they need to go even a step further on prosecuting one of the many fake slates of electors conspiracies that took place across the country. It is horrible news for Donald Trump in the middle of his criminal trial in Manhattan. He's an unindicted co-conspirator in this case.\n\nREID: And very quickly, to stay with you for a minute, Joyce, I mean, there was a lot of criticism of Fani Willis when she brought a case against 19 people, a RICO case. This has got one more than that. This is 20 people, 11 in the state, and then nine additional people whose names were originally under seal. I mean, this is an even more sprawling case, as you said, with even more people that we hadn't heard before. Christina Bobb had not been in before, Boris Epshtyn.So kind of to me is pretty much a vindication, in my mind at least, of what she did in Georgia.\n\nVANCE: Well, I think it suggests that Fani Willis was the immaculate career prosecutor that we know her to be. Tim will tell you this, too. When you're a prosecutor, there's no arbitrary limit on the number of people that you indict in a case. You indict the people who you have evidence against, core participants when you've got a conspiracy setting like this, and you don't arbitrarily say, well, I've only got room for 12 people, or I've only got room for 13 people. Your job as a prosecutor is to hold people accountable for criminal conduct, and that appears to be what's happening in Arizona tonight.\n\nAs the old saying goes: The wheels of justice turn slowly,

This turn of events highlights the Orwellian meaning of the phrase \"election integrity,\" as used by Trump and the Republican Party: An effort to win at all costs.\n\nBobb endeared herself to the former president as a fervent supporter who worked as both a Trump associate and a journalist as part of various efforts to help Trump overturn the 2020 results.

But Bobb was not just a purveyor of the Big Lie -- she was also part of the operation. Weeks after the 2020 election, Trump brought in a new team of lawyers, including Rudy Giuliani, to help him subvert the results and remain in office. Though Bobb has not been charged with any crimes, she worked with that team to help coordinate the scheme to certify fake slates of electors in states Biden won, a plot that is part of both the criminal indictment against Trump in Georgia and the federal charges brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith.\n\nNow Bobb has joined the list of Trumpists who have been charged with a crime. (Bobb's name and charges have been redacted in the indictment until she is served, but multiple outlets have reported she is among the Trump allies charged.) Arizona charged each of the state's 11 fake electors, which include sitting members of the state legislature and leaders in the state GOP. Arizona also charged Trump allies Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, Boris Epshteyn, Mike Roman, John Eastman, and Jenna Ellis with related crimes.\n\nWhile the indictment does not detail attempts to overturn the election after January 6, 2021, Bobb's work in Arizona continued after that point. As we wrote last month:\n\nAfter Biden was certified the winner on January 6, Bobb remained a pro-Trump activist, raising money for bogus election audits while also touting the Big Lie in her on-air role at OAN. In Arizona, Bobb played a significant part in the GOP-controlled state senate's audit of Maricopa County's votes, all while covering it as a reporter. As the Arizona Republic's Laurie Roberts recently recounted, Bobb helped orchestrate the audit, raised money for it, and then surreptitiously advised the auditor, Cyber Ninjas, throughout the process. Ultimately, the audit confirmed that Biden had won Arizona. It's the upside down version of journalistic ethics.\n\nIt was apparently this type of record that the RNC was looking for when staffing out its election integrity team, which tells you everything you need to know about the true motives of that effort. Indeed, Bobb's indictment doesn't appear to jeopardize her current role working for Trump.\n\n\"Another example of Democrats' weaponization of the legal system,\" Trump campaign communications director Steven Cheung said in response to a request for comment from Bobb or the RNC. \"Christina Bobb is a former Marine Corps officer, who served our nation and the President with distinction. The Democrat platform for 2024: if you can't beat them, try to throw them in jail.\"", "source": {"uri": "motherjones.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mother Jones"}, "authors": [{"uri":

While Hawaii certified Nixon as the winner of the state's electoral votes, Democrats claimed otherwise. They assembled their own slate of electors and submitted their votes to DC to be counted while the state worked out the contest in the courts. Importantly, this worked. After initially cerifying Nixon's electors, Hawaii's recount concluded that Kennedy had won the state by just 150 votes. The state's governor retracted the Nixon certification, and submitted a new one in favor of Kennedy.\"\n\nAttorney Mike Davis suggested Mayes \"stole her 2022 election by disenfranchising voters on Election Day,\" and called the new indictments blatant \"lawfare and election interference.\"\n\n\"This is a criminal conspiracy by these Democrat politicians. This is unacceptable. There must be severe legal, political, and financial consequences,\" Davis wrote.\n\nRepublican Arizona State Senator Jake Hoffman, who is a defendant in the case, wrote, \"Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this disgusting political persecution by the judicial process. Kris Mayes & the Democrats' naked corruption and weaponization of government will long be a stain on the history of our great state and nation.\"\n\nThe official Republican Party of Arizona X account also labeled the indictments \"politically motivated\" and a \"blatant abuse of legal authority aimed to disrupt, distract and interfere in the 2024 election.\"\n\nSenior Donald Trump Advisor Stephen Miller joked, \"Remember when the voting machines in Maricopa County AZ malfunctioned en masse on Election Day, disenfranchising thousands of GOP voters? The Dem AG of Arizona was declared winner by a margin of 280 votes.\"\n\nThe Democrat plot to support their frail candidate Joe Biden is clearly to unleash judicial attacks against the GOP in order to take up their time and money in addition to painting the entire party as a band of criminals.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democrats and establishment Republicans are working together to subvert the will of the American people who elected Trump in 2020 and hope to overwhelm the system so that it can't steal the nomination from him again this year.", "source": {"uri": "infowars.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InfoWars"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kelen_mcbreen@infowars.com", "name": "Kelen McBreen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John F.

(Frederic Legrand - COMEO / Shutterstock.com)\n\nThe Arizona indictment released on Wednesday for the fake elector scheme charges several of former President Donald Trump's lawyers and strategists, including Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, Jenna Ellis, Christina Bobb, and Boris Epshteyn, as well as Arizona GOP officials like Kelli Ward, and names Trump himself as an unindicted co-conspirator -- but there's a conspicuous hole in the indictments, as a major architect of the fake elector scheme, attorney Kenneth Chesebro, is missing.\n\nThat's not by accident, NYU Law professor Ryan Goodman wrote for his Just Security site.\n\n\"Chesebro has so far escaped prosecution in other states where false electors are under indictment,\" wrote Goodman. \"His protection from prosecution appears to be on the basis that he 'cooperated' with those investigations. However, recent investigative reporting by CNN and others has revealed that Chesebro apparently made false statements to state prosecutors in Michigan and Nevada while feigning cooperation with their respective criminal investigations of false electors (see also this analysis of flaws with his proffer agreement in Georgia).\"\n\nALSO READ: 'Fraudulent': Trump tormentor Lincoln Project loses big money in cybertheft scheme\n\n\"That all is now fairly well known to close observers of these cases. Why then the Arizona indictment excludes Chesebro is a mystery,\" he continued. \"Prosecutors in Michigan and Nevada have decided not to seek indictments of anyone at the national level and instead focused only on false electors in their states. But in Arizona that's different, as the prosecutors have now charged several out-of-state individuals who were involved in the nationally coordinated effort to overturn the election results. But not Chesebro.\"\n\nGoodman concluded that the likeliest explanation was that he did provide help to the Arizona prosecutors specifically.\n\nThis comes as former federal prosecutor Andrew Weissmann speculates that Chesebro might also have some degree of utility as a witness in the federal case brought against Trump by special counsel Jack Smith, which is currently on hold pending the

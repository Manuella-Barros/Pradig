One participant in the nostalgic celebration in Southwick, Hampshire even played the role of Winston Churchill, smoking a cigar and making a V for Victory gesture with his fingers. The commemoration of the momentous landings in June 1944 has long been a summer highlight in the picturesque south coast village, which played a pivotal role in the decision to send an invasion force to Europe. Southwick House became the headquarters of the immense operation to target Normandy while top officers, including US General Dwight D Eisenhower, often enjoyed a pint at the nearby Golden Lion pub. This year the event, known as the Southwick Revival, turned back the clock 80 years with locals driving old Austin motorcars and khaki armoured vehicles through the streets.

The historic recreation contrasted with modern-looking spectators who lined the pavements, holding their smartphones in the air hoping to get a good shot of the display. Shortly after, a motorcade of bikes came riding past with one even boasting a sidecar, where a man dressed in khaki gear operated a machine gun. And there was even a role for the instantly recognisable Winston Churchill, played by a history enthusiast, who wore a black bowtie while puffing away on a cigar and waving to the adoring crowd. This year's celebration, which spanned the entire weekend, also involved a panel discussion featuring Susan Eisenhower, granddaughter of General Eisenhower, as well as homemade cakes and guided trips to some of the town's historic wartime spots. The Southwick Revival website says that, as of 2023, the events have raised \u00a3229,000 and the fundraising continued this year. The nostalgic scenes in Southwick round off an emotional week of ceremonies commemorating the 80th anniversary of D-Day.

Accompanied by buglers and bagpipe players, bright lights shone out around the UK in tribute to the fallen soldiers who stormed Normandy's beaches in 1944.

Talking about the campaign, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak urged communities to support the cause. On Thursday, world leaders, including US President Joe Biden, gathered to mark the sacrifice made by troops arriving on the Normandy beaches in 1944. But the UK was represented by Foreign Secretary, Lord Cameron \u2013 while Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer also rubbed shoulders with international politicians. Rishi Sunak was forced to issue an apology over social media and repeated it in an awkward exchange with broadcasters during an election campaign event in Wiltshire. He suggested it had always been his intention to leave before the international ceremony on Omaha Beach, even before he called the General Election. Earlier, D-Day veterans had been left in tears as the memories of decades past came flooding back while they were honoured for their service by world leaders and royals.

Soldiers who took part in the Normandy landings 80 years ago wept as they remembered their fallen comrades and were given standing ovations by the grateful younger generations at a series of touching commemorative events in northern France. At the British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer, tribute was paid to the 'remarkable wartime generation', before wreaths of poppies were laid in memory of the more than 25,000 soldiers who lost their lives in the first stages of the invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe. The number of veterans in attendance was only a few dozen, as the numbers of survivors dwindles with each year that passes - at the 75th anniversary five years ago 255 travelled to France, compared to the 50 who have made the journey this time around.

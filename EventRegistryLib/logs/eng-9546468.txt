Speaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, Griffin emphasized that \"stickier inflation in services\" and the upcoming U.S. presidential elections could complicate the timing of any potential rate reduction. Inflation may ease around the election period, he noted, but this could deter the Fed from adjusting rates due to concerns over perceived political interference. \"Big picture, we're making the right call by being more hesitant to cut rates,\" Griffin told the audience.\n\nGriffin, who refrained from endorsing a specific presidential candidate for the 2024 elections, commended the potential names being considered for Donald Trump's cabinet as \"really good.\" The hedge fund titan also expressed skepticism regarding the Federal Reserve's rate decisions due to the political climate surrounding the elections. He noted that political considerations could delay the central bank's rate cuts until the end of the year.\n\nMarket Overview:\n\n-Citadel CEO Ken Griffin predicts a potential Fed rate cut in December, citing service sector inflation and upcoming U.S. elections.\n\nKey Points:\n\n-Griffin highlights concerns about persistent inflation in service industries as a hurdle for earlier rate cuts.\n\n-He suggests the November presidential election could make the Fed wary of rate cuts due to potential political interpretations.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\n-Griffin remains undecided on endorsing a presidential candidate but expresses approval for potential Trump cabinet picks.\n\n-He maintains his halt on donations to Harvard University due to their handling of antisemitism concerns.\n\nBeyond monetary policy, Griffin reiterated his decision to halt donations to Harvard University due to its handling of antisemitism on campus. He attributed the student protests against Israel's war in Gaza to systemic failures within the education system, specifically highlighting Ivy League institutions. \"The failure of the education system is what you're seeing play out on the campuses of the Ivy League schools,\" Griffin said.\n\nHis remarks come amid widespread student demonstrations across U.S. universities, emphasizing a growing polarization over international conflicts. Griffin, who has donated more than half a billion dollars to Harvard University, remains critical of the institution's response, calling for greater accountability and action.", "source": {"uri": "quiverquant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "quiverquant.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_C._Griffin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth C.

Griffin, 55, is now worth $37 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nHe also founded Citadel Securities, a market maker, that handles about 20% of stock trades. And he's a major philanthropist, with total donations of more than $2 billion.\n\nSo when Griffin talks, people listen, and he had some things to say about Federal Reserve policy on May 6.\n\nWhat's ahead for the Federal Reserve?\n\nAt the beginning of the year, futures traders anticipated six interest-rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year. That's because inflation was sliding, and it looked like economic growth would do the same.\n\nBut now that inflation has proven to be sticky and the economy has remained strong, The CME FedWatch tool points to only two rate reductions in 2024. The Fed's target for the federal funds rate on interbank overnight bank loans is now 5.25% to 5.5%.\n\nThe last forecast from Fed officials came in March when the median prediction was for three rate cuts this year. That number could well go down in the central bank's June forecast.\n\nRelated: Ex-Treasury official unveils startling interest rate outlook\n\nSome economists, notably Torsten Slok of Apollo Global Management, began predicting in March that the Fed wouldn't move this year.\n\nAnd Harvard economist Larry Summers, former Treasury secretary, has even said there's a 15%-25% chance that the Fed's next move will be to raise rates.\n\nInterest rates are vitally important to individuals, of course. Higher rates mean higher income payouts from savings accounts, money-market funds, and bonds. But they also mean higher payments for mortgage, credit card, auto, student, and general loans.\n\nKen Griffin's view of Fed policy\n\nGriffin has been saying for the past couple of months that the Fed was right to leave rates at their elevated level. The central bank hasn't changed rates since it increased them last July, capping 11 rate hikes in a row.\n\n\"Wage growth is sticky, core inflation is sticky, de-globalization is happening -- that takes away from the constant deflationary trend ... for most of our adult lifetime,\" Griffin said at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles.\n\nMore Economic Analysis:\n\nWatch out for 8% mortgage ratesHot inflation report batters stocks; here's what happens nextInflation report will disappoint markets (and the Fed)\n\nHe projects a rate cut in September or December but said it's not a sure thing. \"There is still a question of will inflation actually decelerate enough by then.\"\n\nInvestment opportunities in bonds\n\nIf Griffin is right that the Fed will be cautious about cutting rates. Now could be an ideal time to buy bonds, which carry their highest yields in 15 years. They also complement your stock portfolio, providing diversification.\n\n\"What owning bonds does is it gives you the positioning for a scenario where the economy goes into recession and risk is off,\" i.e., stocks fall, said Chris Alwine, Vanguard's global head of credit.\n\n\"In typical recessions, equities fall maybe up to 30%...

Griffin, 55, is now worth $37 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nHe also founded Citadel Securities, a market maker, that handles about 20% of stock trades. And he's a major philanthropist, with total donations of more than $2 billion.\n\nSo when Griffin talks, people listen, and he had some things to say about Federal Reserve policy on May 6.\n\nWhat's ahead for the Federal Reserve?\n\nAt the beginning of the year, futures traders anticipated six interest-rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year. That's because inflation was sliding, and it looked like economic growth would do the same.\n\nBut now that inflation has proven to be sticky and the economy has remained strong, The CME FedWatch tool points to only two rate reductions in 2024. The Fed's target for the federal funds rate on interbank overnight bank loans is now 5.25% to 5.5%.\n\nThe last forecast from Fed officials came in March when the median prediction was for three rate cuts this year. That number could well go down in the central bank's June forecast.\n\nRelated: Ex-Treasury official unveils startling interest rate outlook\n\nSome economists, notably Torsten Slok of Apollo Global Management, began predicting in March that the Fed wouldn't move this year.\n\nAnd Harvard economist Larry Summers, former Treasury secretary, has even said there's a 15%-25% chance that the Fed's next move will be to raise rates.\n\nInterest rates are vitally important to individuals, of course. Higher rates mean higher income payouts from savings accounts, money-market funds, and bonds. But they also mean higher payments for mortgage, credit card, auto, student, and general loans.\n\nKen Griffin's view of Fed policy\n\nGriffin has been saying for the past couple of months that the Fed was right to leave rates at their elevated level. The central bank hasn't changed rates since it increased them last July, capping 11 rate hikes in a row.\n\n\"Wage growth is sticky, core inflation is sticky, de-globalization is happening -- that takes away from the constant deflationary trend ... for most of our adult lifetime,\" Griffin said at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles.\n\nMore Economic Analysis:\n\nHe projects a rate cut in September or December but said it's not a sure thing. \"There is still a question of will inflation actually decelerate enough by then.\"\n\nInvestment opportunities in bonds\n\nIf Griffin is right that the Fed will be cautious about cutting rates. Now could be an ideal time to buy bonds, which carry their highest yields in 15 years. They also complement your stock portfolio, providing diversification.\n\n\"What owning bonds does is it gives you the positioning for a scenario where the economy goes into recession and risk is off,\" i.e., stocks fall, said Chris Alwine, Vanguard's global head of credit.\n\n\"In typical recessions, equities fall maybe up to 30%... That's where bonds come into play as a diversifier to equities, but also producing very respectable income today.\"\n\nRelated: Should you buy bonds now? Here's what Vanguard thinks\n\nStocks historically outperform bonds, but if Griffin proves correct that the Fed won't lower rates until September or December, you may have plenty of time to buy bonds with attractive yields.\n\nAcquiring Treasuries and/or investment-grade corporate bonds (those that are unlikely to default) may provide a good, safe entry into the bond market.\n\nThe five-year Treasury yielded 4.47% Tuesday, and a five-year single-A-minus Bank of America bond yielded 5.5%.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024", "source": {"uri": "islandpacket.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Island Packet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_weil@islandpacket.com", "name": "Dan Weil", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_C._Griffin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth C.

Attorney Charles O'Hara argued that Griffin wouldn't do well in prison because he suffers from a number of physical and mental health issues, including developmental disabilities, schizophrenia, a personality disorder, an alcohol use disorder, diabetes and a brain injury.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, pointed out that despite the ailments, Griffin had functioned in society fairly well leading up to the deadly shooting. He drove, interacted with friends, had romantic relationships, worked and lived independently, Sedgwick County Assistant District Attorney Robert Short said before the 150-month sentence was pronounced.\n\nThose things, the judge said, all demonstrated that Griffin had the knowledge and wherewithal to know the consequences of his actions.\n\nGriffin also had amassed a \"lengthy\" criminal history, Magana said, before he fatally shot Lawrukiewicz in the head shortly before midnight on March 3, 2017.\n\n\"That criminal history has now culminated in the most serious crime ... murder,\" the judge said, finding there was no substantial and compelling reason to depart to probation.\n\nGriffin pleaded guilty to one count of second-degree murder in October 2022.\n\nAlthough the judge ordered a 12 1/2-year prison sentence, Griffin will be incarcerated only for about five more years because he will receive credit for the time he's spent in jail waiting for the case to resolve. His case was delayed repeatedly over the last seven years while Griffin's competency was in question.\n\nRelatives of Lawrukiewicz sobbed as they made tearful pleas to the court Wednesday to sentence Griffin to more time in prison.\n\nLawrukiewicz's mother said she didn't \"think it's fair that he (Griffin) can walk free after 12 years\" when her only son had been robbed of milestones like graduating from high school, getting married and meeting his nieces and nephews.\n\nSeeing a child dying shouldn't be a last thing a parent sees, she told the judge.\n\nShort told the court that while Lawrukiewicz \"wasn't a perfect kid\" he did nothing to contribute to his death. He had been sitting on a couch at a neighbor's house at 1704 S. Yale, talking to a girl on the phone, when Griffin picked up a 9mm semi-automatic handgun off of a computer desk, pointed it at him and pulled the trigger, he said.\n\nLawrukiewicz, a Wichita East High School student, died at 1:35 a.m. March 4, 2017, at Wesley Medical Center.\n\nAfter the shooting, Griffin told police he thought the gun, which belonged to his neighbor, had been loaded with blanks, according to an affidavit released by the court.\n\nGriffin told police he'd previously fired blanks from the gun and that he and his friends sometimes pulled pranks on one another in the style of the television show \"Jackass,\" the affidavit says. Authorities have said Griffin didn't mean to kill the teen but he was handling the gun unsafely.\n\n\"He feels terrible about what happened. ... It was an accident,\" O'Hara said Wednesday, adding that drinking, drug use and stunts were likely involved that night.\n\nLawrukiewicz's family members said in court they doubted the shooting was unintentional. Several said Griffin had been warned that the gun was loaded before he pulled the trigger and questioned how he could point a weapon at a person he claimed to have cared for so much.\n\nWhen it was his turn to address the court, Griffin apologized and asked Lawrukiewicz's family to forgive him. He said he was not a killer.\n\n\"I wish none of it would've happened. ... He was a great friend to me,\" Griffin said.\n\nIn addition to the prison sentence, Magana ordered Griffin to pay $5,000 in restitution to reimburse the Kansas Crime Victims Compensation Board for payments made to Lawrukiewicz's family.", "source": {"uri": "kansas.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wichita Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amy_renee_leiker@kansas.com", "name": "Amy Renee Leiker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Short_(make-up_artist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Short (make-up artist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Casey James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_O'Hara", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles O'Hara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personality disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developmental disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcoholism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Schizophrenia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_damage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brain damage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedgwick_County,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sedgwick County, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sedgwick County, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita_East_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wichita East High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9\u00d719mm_Parabellum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "9\u00d719mm Parabellum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Medical_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wesley Medical Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-automatic_pistol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Semi-automatic pistol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yale University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://www.kansas.com/latest-news/z2gk35/picture215715760/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/WICStanding%20gavel%20court%20justice.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546468", "eventUri": "eng-9546468", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-03-03", "textStart": 1236, "textEnd": 1249}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-03-04", "textStart": 2682, "textEnd": 2695}], "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

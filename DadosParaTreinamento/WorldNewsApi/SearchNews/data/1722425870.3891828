It\u2019s a journey undertaken daily by thousands of patients in B.C.\u2019s health-care system. It\u2019s also the incredible path taken by two of the province\u2019s newest doctors. Marco Law and Peter Nguyen both graduated from medical school in May, earning their MDs. Somehow, both of them managed to pull off that already difficult task while working as paramedics in the B.C. Ambulance Service. \u201cIt was a lot easier than people would expect,\u201d said Nguyen, who starts a residency in anesthesiology in Victoria next month. \u201cI found that when I was in medical school the first two years is pretty clinical so we would learn a lot from our lectures and slides \u2026 but working as a paramedic gave me context for what we were learning in class, so it was almost like learning while on the job as well.\u201d Law, who already has a master\u2019s degree in biomedical engineering, said that training fortunately prepared him for the workload. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy journey,\u201d he said. Both men cited their time in the back of the ambulance in helping them transition from paramedic to doctor. Nguyen added that the experience helped him choose his specialty as an anesthesiologist \u2014 where he\u2019ll have to build trusting relationships with individuals undergoing operations. \u201c(You) make them feel comfortable and be able to build that rapport \u2026 when sometimes you are taking away their awareness with medication, sometimes you are taking their ability to breathe and they have to trust you to do that all for them, to be their advocate in the operating room,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich I found very similar to as a paramedic.\u201d Law is headed to Nelson where he\u2019ll start a residency in family medicine, working in rural clinics and hospitals. His experience working as a paramedic stationed in the Sea-to-Sky also helped influence that decision \u2014 though in a different way. \u201cYou never know how the day is going to go, and I kind of like that unpredictability,\u201d he said. \u201cI definitely want to do a bit of rural medicine to start, I like that very broad scope of being able to do a bit of everything.\u201d Long term, Law said he hopes to be able to transition into the policy side of the health-care system, where his experience working in both pre-hospital and hospital care settings could prove valuable. And while both men move into a highly demanding new career, neither is quite ready to give up the blue uniform of the B.C. Ambulance Service quite yet. \u201cI\u2019d love to stay employed with them and be able to pick up shifts here and there, mix it up,\u201d Law said. \u201cIt\u2019s really tough to leave the job, I find it is so rewarding and it gives a very different perspective on medicine,\u201d added Nguyen. \u201cI hope to work while in Victoria just a few shifts every month \u2026 but eventually I will have to close the chapter.\u201d", "summary": "Two of B.C.'s newest doctors are preparing to start their new careers.

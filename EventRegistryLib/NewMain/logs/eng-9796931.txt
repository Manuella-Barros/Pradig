In one clip, a woman is carried out of the building by an emergency worker, while another snippet shows a baby being taken out of the damaged hotel building.\n\nAccording to regional broadcaster SWR, witnesses reported hearing a bang and seeing a large cloud of dust at the time of the collapse.

They are being cared for by emergency services and crisis interventionists.\n\nImages from the scene show that parts of the multi-story timber-framed building have collapsed. Concrete rubble lies on the ground, and emergency services have arrived with multiple vehicles.\n\nAccording to an \"SWR\" report, the fire department was initially unable to enter the building due to the risk of further collapse. The Technical Relief Agency has set up monitoring points in front of the hotel to observe any movement in the building or whether it can be safely entered. Due to fears that more parts of the hotel could collapse and cause damage to adjacent buildings, neighboring houses are being evacuated.\n\nThe incident occurred in the Bernkastel-Wittlich district of Germany.

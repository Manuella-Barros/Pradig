Villa players - at least those who haven't been called up to represent their countries this summer - are currently enjoying a well-earned break after guiding the club into the Champions League under Unai Emery last season.\n\nThe new season kicks off in late August, to accommodate the ongoing Euro 2024, and while many players are currently away on holiday or relaxing at home, young defender Nedeljkovic is making a head start on preparations before he joins up with his new teammates later this summer.\n\nNedeljkovic agreed a permanent move to Villa Park in January, in a deal which could cost the Lions up to \u00a310m, but he remained with Red Star Belgrade on a loan basis in the second half of last season. Sadly, Nedeljkovic's remaining time with the Serbian side was ravaged by an injury picked up in the winter. He did have the opportunity to bid farewell and make a late return to action in May.\n\nREAD: Weston McKennie to Aston Villa transfer hits new snag\n\nREAD: Watkins speaks out on media treatment as he reveals Harry Kane belief\n\nNow, though, Nedeljkovic is looking to get up to speed ahead of schedule this summer. Wearing a Villa training top and a pair of Red Star shorts, he is seen in the gym getting ready for the first of the five years that he is signed up for. Nedeljkovic will travel to the US with the Villa squad for their pre-season tour and then take on Athletic Bilbao in Walsall and Borussia Dortmund in Germany, before the curtain raiser at West Ham.\n\nIt remains to be seen what sort of role Nedeljkovic, who is only 18 but has Champions League experience with Red Star and played against Manchester City last season, will have immediately under Emery in his first campaign; the teenager will compete for a place at right-back, although fellow defender Matty Cash has interest himself this summer.\n\nWhat do you expect from Nedeljkovic this summer?

Teenager Nedeljkovic agreed a long-term deal with Villa in the winter before returning to Red Star Belgrade in his native Serbia on a loan basis for the remainder of last season.\n\nRight-back Nedeljkovic, who made his long awaited return from injury in May to help Red Star at the end of the campaign, has since been over to watch his new teammates in action in the Premier League as they secured Champions League football - a competition Nedeljkovic has previous experience of - ahead of the forthcoming campaign.\n\nAs he flew over to Birmingham, and was handed a tour of Bodymoor, the young Serb admits he was blown away by the facilities on offer to the Villa players: \"I was speechless,\" he told Nogomania. \"They built it almost, renovated it three, four years ago. Twenty courts, a spa centre, dentists, many offices, a basketball court in the hall - the highest level.\"\n\nREAD: Ian Maatsen to Aston Villa transfer: Release clause, Duran deal, 'big clubs' claim\n\nREAD: Weston McKennie has just summed up what he'd bring to Aston Villa\n\nAlthough he's 18, and - at this moment in time at least - has Matty Cash ahead of him in the Villa first-team squad's right-back department, Nedeljkovic has mapped out a clear intention to make an immediate impact in Unai Emery's starting XI. He hopes to make a sufficient impression while away with Villa in pre-season.\n\n\"I believe that I will be able to fight in Aston Villa, just like I did in Zvezda,\" he continued. \"I always give my best and I think it will pay off. I have always done excellent preparations, now there is a tour to America, so we will see how it will look like. For me, the Premier League is the ideal league.\n\n\"In England, it's important to be energetic, speed, especially since it's my greatest quality, as well as duel play. Dribbling, shots and actions. Strong intensity describes me and that's my style of play. In Spain and other countries are more important, the players are lower in my position and it is different. The Premier League has always been the most demanding of all. I think I will do well.\"\n\nNedeljkovic also praised Emery, who he'll be working under, and explained his first impression of the manager was a highly positive one. The defender has been particularly taken by Emery's renowned attention to detail and level of commitment by way of working hours each day.\n\n\"What I have seen in the past month is that he is a great professional,\" Nedeljkovic added. \"I have never seen such dedication anywhere. He draws for the players in the gym what they should do while they are working, on the field he also draws everything himself and shows, he thinks. He does all the analysis.\n\n\"When I was injured, gym at 9:00am, then therapy in the afternoon. When I used to come to the stadium at 6:00pm, he's still there from 8:00am. I return to the hotel later, and he's further in the stadium. That was fascinating to me, that 12 hours is so dedicated.\"\n\nHow many players do Villa need this summer?

Teenager Nedeljkovic signed a long-term deal when he joined in January, but he remained with Red Star Belgrade for the second half of last season.\n\nNow, though, the Serbian is in England and readying himself for Villa's substantial pre-season campaign, during which time they come up against the likes of Borussia Dortmund, Athletic Bilbao, Columbus Crew and RB Leipzig. Nedeljkovic, 18, has plenty of experience despite his young age and played in the Champions League last season.\n\nIt remains to be seen exactly what his role will look like upon arrival, though. Villa are entertaining interest from abroad in Matty Cash and the full-back department in general is expected to be heavily scrutinised by Unai Emery this summer. Nedeljkovic could hit the ground running and be involved on the opening day - equally, he might be sent out to gain experience of English football. He'll be ready for every scenario.\n\nREAD: Aston Villa face ten crucial days as their transfer restructure begins to take shape\n\nREAD: Villa's new signing was 'speechless' after transfer as he makes clear his intention\n\n\"I expect myself to be in the starting 11 from August,\" he told Serbian outlet Nogomania. \"If I am in the combination at all, it will really be a success and if I enter the Premier League. In Belgrade, I have two or three training sessions a day, I train to be never better.\n\n\"I want to be at a higher level level, to the maximum, so that I could show myself at the preparations and cement the place. Wherever the loan is, I have no problem with that. Ideally, I would be there [at Villa].\"\n\nAsked if he would be content with a loan spell in the Championship, Nedeljkovic added: \"If it happens, I don't have a problem with that.

Will he be traded?\n\nThese are reasonable questions after the team announced the deal late Thursday afternoon.\n\nPenguins general manager/president of hockey operations Kyle Dubas hinted at his postseason news conference that bringing Nedeljkovic back would be difficult because of Jarry's presence and because of the goaltending talent in the Penguins' system.\n\nPerhaps he didn't think he could sign Nedeljkovic on this kind of a deal. It would seem that Nedeljkovic probably could have made more money on the open market, where many teams will be thirsting for good goaltending. But his career turned around in Pittsburgh last season, and he apparently had little interest in leaving.\n\nNedeljkovic, 28, overtook Jarry as the Penguins' starting goaltender last season, starting every game from March 26 through the end of the season, guiding the Penguins on a stunning run that nearly led them to an improbable playoff berth.\n\nHe finished last season with an 18-7-7 record, a 2.97 goals against average and a .906 save percentage.\n\nThe questions around Jarry are going to intensify. He has four years remaining on his contract at an annual rate of $5.35 million. The Penguins were not pleased with his performance in the second half of last season, which has become a trend as Jarry has been unable to turn his traditionally hot starts to the season into long-lasting reliability.\n\nMany teams need goaltending, and though Jarry has never won a playoff series, his lifetime numbers are strong and he's only 29.\n\nIt could simply be that the Penguins are going to enter the season with Jarry and Nedeljkovic as their goaltending duo, which would give them one of the better goaltending situations in the NHL.\n\nHowever, given the holes in their lineup and the amount of money Jarry makes, it's fair to wonder if Dubas is going to dangle him in the coming days. The NHL Draft is June 28 and 29, and free agency opens July 1.\n\nNedeljkovic, like Jarry, handles the puck extremely well and was a second-round draft pick.\n\nA native of Ohio, Nedeljkovic said he immediately felt comfortable in Pittsburgh and played some of the finest hockey of his career, putting up good numbers despite playing behind a Penguins team that was less than impressive defensively.\n\nPerhaps the most telling illustration of Penguins bosses' feelings about their goaltenders came on April 17, when the Penguins played a meaningless regular-season finale on the road against the Islanders.\n\nNedeljkovic had played in every game for almost a month and looked exhausted. Jarry was fresh and healthy.\n\nPenguins coach Mike Sullivan gave Nedeljkovic the start.\n\nHe'll have plenty of opportunities to do so moving forward.

He signed a two-year deal worth $2.5 million per season, rewarding him for his solid work between the pipes behind starter Tristan Jarry. Combined, that tandem will make $7.875 million against the salary cap through the 2025-26 season.\n\nA 28-year-old backup, Nedeljkovic showed flashes for the Penguins. What does this signing mean for them?\n\nFor the Penguins, Nedeljkovic was great as a backup. He had a .902 save percentage (SV%), 2.97 goals-against average (GAA), minus-1.2 goals saved above average (GSAA), and minus-3.9 goals saved above expected along with an 18-7-7 record in 38 games. Those numbers might not look the best, but most backups do worse -- with a borderline starter-level workload, he took care of business.\n\nIn his first 18 games with the Penguins, Nedeljkovic had a .919 SV%, a 2.54 GAA, 2.0 GSAA, and 4.6 GSAx. It all went a bit downhill for him afterward, but the point stands that he was a very good netminder for a significant portion of the season. If Pittsburgh is getting this version of their backup, there should be no concerns whatsoever.\n\nAssuming he and Jarry can stay healthy, the Penguins should have good goaltending at the very least. That was one of their strengths in 2023-24 despite missing the playoffs, even if their play in goal did regress as a whole as the season went on. With two competent netminders, they probably shouldn't be in a position where they are in a pickle because they can't make a save over the course of the season. While goaltending tends to be somewhat unpredictable aside from the truly elite starters in the league, Pittsburgh should be confident with what they have.\n\nWith a little bit over $10 million in cap space to spend in the 2024 offseason without a single major free agent to bring back, the Penguins have some flexibility. They can add a quality roster player or some depth throughout the lineup to end their two-year postseason drought -- this is the first time that they have missed the playoffs in back-to-back campaigns in Sidney Crosby's 19-year career in Pittsburgh.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justin_giampietro@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Justin Giampietro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Nedeljkovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Nedeljkovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Penguins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_Jarry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tristan Jarry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Crosby", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sidney Crosby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Alex-Nedeljkovic-Penguins-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669298", "eventUri": "eng-9669298", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 3, "textEnd": 10}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

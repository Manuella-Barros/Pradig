The title takes place between A Quiet Place: Day One and the original film. The game's main character is asthmatic, which will make keeping quiet and hiding from enemies even more difficult.\n\nA release date of October 17, 2024 has been set for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, the upcoming survival horror game set in the universe of the A Quiet Place film series. Developed by Stormind Games and published by Saber Interactive, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is a solo horror title that will let players experience the silent dread seen in A Quiet Place first-hand.\n\nA Quiet Place: The Road Ahead puts players into the shoes of a young woman attempting to navigate and survive in a world after the arrival of aliens causes a collapse in society. Slotting in-between A Quiet Place: Day One and the original movie, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is set on day 105 of the apocalypse. Being set several months after the initial alien attack, it can be inferred that A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is aiming to be a more character-driven story, using the worldbuilding of A Quiet Place as a backdrop to build tension and entice fans of the franchise into the game.\n\n3:24\n\nRelated\n\n6 Best Horror Games To Play If You Love A Quiet Place\n\nFor fans thrilled by A Quiet Place: Day One in theatres, these great video games can provide a similar horror-themed experience.\n\nAs the latest trailer reveals, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead will launch on October 17 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. With the recent release and success of A Quiet Place: Day One, many fans are clamoring for more stories set within the universe, and the upcoming title seeks to deliver by putting the player right in the heart of the action. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead has the opportunity to give fans more insight into areas of the world that aren't heavily detailed in the films.\n\nA Quiet Place: The Road Ahead Launch Date\n\nOctober 17 (PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S)\n\nAs displayed in the above trailer and previous reveal trailers for The Road Ahead, one unique challenge that the game will throw at players is the fact that protagonist Alex is asthmatic. Silence is key in A Quiet Place, and players will have to manage Alex's condition if they wish to survive encounters with the aliens. Stealth is a staple of horror games, and A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead has the perfect formula to make stealth more important and terrifying than in many other titles in the genre.\n\nClose\n\nA video game for A Quiet Place was initially announced back in 2021, and since then, the release of the prequel story A Quiet Place: Day One has revitalized interest in the franchise. As a result, the game's launch on October 17 proves to be a fortuitous one that will capitalize on the current hype the franchise is generating.\n\nSaber Interactive\n\nDate Founded 2001-00-00\n\nHeadquarters Fort Lauderdale, Florida, U.S\n\nParent Company Embracer Group\n\nSubsidiaries 4A Games , Aspyr , New World Interactive\n\nKnown For World War Z , Halo", "source": {"uri": "gamerant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Game Rant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "luke_greenfield@gamerant.com", "name": "Luke Greenfield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place:_Day_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A Quiet Place: Day One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place_(opera)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A Quiet Place (opera)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Extraterrestrial life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RoboCop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_horror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Survival horror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Potter (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horror game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saber_Interactive", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saber Interactive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embracer_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Embracer Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Halo (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_Interactive", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New World Interactive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4A_Games", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4A Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspyr", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aspyr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stealth_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stealth game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Periodicals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Periodicals", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/october-17-will-be-a-big-day-for-a-quiet-place-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793918", "eventUri": "eng-9793918", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-17", "textStart": 1556, "textEnd": 1566, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-10-", "textStart": 62, "textEnd": 72, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

The game tells its own story, focusing on Alex & Martin as they navigate a treacherous apocalypse with personal conflicts. Pre-orders for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead are available, offering digital content like in-game items and behind-the-scenes material.\n\nStormind Games and Saber Interactive's A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead sees players venturing into the world of Paramount Pictures' critically acclaimed A Quiet Place movies. These films show a world invaded by aliens called Death Angels, who hunt through sound, forcing everyone to go silent in order to survive. The franchise has been praised for its suspenseful sequences and intense sound design, and many would agree that the premise alone would translate extremely well to the world of stealth-based gaming.\n\nA Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is just that, a first-person, single-player horror adventure game in which players hide, distract, and sneak past brutal, predatory creatures. Much like the films, the game will heavily involve stealth, with players having to be extremely mindful of their surroundings, as its reveal trailer showed that even the slightest sound, like treading on a piece of broken glass, can result in near-instant death at the hands of a Death Angel.\n\nRelated\n\nA Quiet Place: The Road Ahead Release Window, Platforms, & Gameplay Details\n\nDetails about A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead were revealed, including its release window, platforms, and how the survival horror gameplay will work.\n\nHow Does A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead Connect To The Movies?\n\nA Story Trailer Gives A Better Idea Of The Game's Timeline\n\nClose\n\nWhile A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead may take place in the same universe as the movies, it seems to be largely telling its own story, much like A Quiet Place: Day One did for the most part. In Day One, there were some characters from the previous films, such as Henri, but it primarily focused on a different protagonist, Sam.\n\nIt's likely that this will also be the case in The Road Ahead, as its synopsis only states that it will follow the journey of a young woman, Alex Taylor, an asthmatic college student survivor, who must endure a treacherous apocalypse with her boyfriend Martin in the midst of interpersonal family conflicts, all while coming to terms with her own inner fears, with one sequence showing her fearfully taking a pregnancy test - something that will immediately evoke memories of Evelyn Abbott's intense labor sequence in the first film.\n\nNo characters from the movies have been confirmed to appear, but there's still plenty of potential for a cameo considering when in the timeline it takes place.\n\nTimeline-wise, the story trailer started off with a sequence showing the protagonists on the day the Death Angels invaded, something that has now been seen through the eyes of the Abbott family in A Quiet Place: Part 2, Sam in A Quiet Place: Day One, and this unnamed character in A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead. This sequence is different from those shown in the movies, as it doesn't take place on a busy street but rather at a family barbeque, offering smaller but more personal stakes.\n\nAs for the rest of the game, the trailer jumped forward to Day 105, which falls between the shocking opening moments of A Quiet Place - which occurred on Day 89 -, and the rest of that film, which jumped forward to Day 473. This would place the main events of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead sometime in October 2020.\n\nRelated\n\nA Quiet Place Complete Timeline Explained\n\nAs the franchise continues to expand, A Quiet Place's timeline becomes more explored. We break down the movie's complete, chronological timeline.\n\nWhen Is A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead Releasing?\n\nAnd What Platforms Will It Be On?\n\nDespite only being announced back in June 2024, players won't have to wait much longer to get their hands on the game. A new trailer on the official Saber Interactive YouTube channel confirmed A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead will launch in time for Halloween on October 17, 2024, which is fitting considering the horror tone of the game. The title is a multiplatform release, coming to Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S, and will be retailing at $29.99.\n\nWhile the PC version of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is digital-only, those on PS5 and Xbox Series X will be able to order either a digital or physical copy of the game.\n\nRelated\n\nEvery Known Weakness The Aliens Have In A Quiet Place\n\nThe aliens, known as Death Angels, are the main antagonists of A Quiet Place franchise. Here's their known weakness and how to defeat them.\n\nA Quiet Place: The Road Ahead Has Pre-Order Bonuses\n\nPre-Orders Are Available Now On All Platforms\n\nWith October mere months away, pre-orders for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead are available now on all platforms. Those who purchase the game early will receive digital content, such as items that can be used in the game and other development materials to provide a look at the creation process behind it.\n\nFor the in-game items, these are items that can be found throughout The Road Ahead, but players are granted access to them far earlier than usual. This includes an inhaler - an essential item for Alex considering her asthma, and one that ties directly into The Road Ahead's gameplay, with players needing to keep track of the status bar of her lungs in intense situations so she doesn't have an asthma attack - and batteries, which will come in useful when exploring dark locations with a flashlight, or monitoring sound levels with a sound detection device to find a safe path around the alien threats.\n\nThe other pre-order content consists of exclusive digital concept art, with the image shown depicting a design for Alex, and a creature animation showcase, showing how Stormind Games translated the fearsome Death Angels from film to game. While these aren't essential for those who just want to play A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, they are nice for those interested in the creative process behind the game, seeing how early concepts and ideas evolve before their final appearance in the completed product.\n\nA Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is available for pre-order now on Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. With the October 17 release date drawing near, there will likely be far more promotional material to provide further insight into Alex and Martin's story before the game's launch.\n\nSources: Saber Interactive/YouTube, Steam, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S\n\nA Quiet Place\n\nA Quiet Place is a film franchise that centers on a post-apocalyptic Earth following an alien invasion by ruthless creatures that are blind but have unparalleled hearing.

This new first-person horror game based on the hit A Quiet Place film-turned-franchise is heading to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on October 17th, 2024 - just in time for spooky season.\n\nThe game is being developed by Stormind Games, which also made the Remothered games as well as Batora: Lost Haven, and will cast players as a young survivor attempting to survive in the post-apocalyptic world of the films, where twisted creatures hunt using only sound and the only way to stay alive is to be dead silent. Players will have to use their ingenuity and wits to observe their surroundings, use makeshift tools and slip by the creatures unnoticed.\n\nThe game's had some new glimpses here and there since the initial reveal trailer, showing off its tense, first-person gameplay which looks appropriately spooky and sounds appropriately quiet - at least until the \"shh\" hits the fan.\n\nI'm actually quite keen for this one. The whole concept of A Quiet Place definitely lends itself quite well to a tense, immersive first-person horror game ala Alien Isolation, so hopefully the folks at Stormind and Saber can do the idea justice.\n\nA Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is a single-player horror adventure game inspired by the critically acclaimed blockbuster movie franchise that highlights a unique survivor story after an invasion of deadly creatures. In this exclusive spin-off, experience the journey of a young woman who must endure a treacherous apocalypse in the midst of interpersonal family conflicts, all while coming to terms with her own inner fears.\n\nUnnerving Atmosphere -- Experience absolute terror as you strive for silence when hiding from, and sneaking by, horrific creatures who hunt using only sound.\n\nUntold Story -- Embark on a dramatic adventure inspired by the A Quiet Place movie franchise as a young survivor trying to navigate the new, eerily tranquil, post-apocalyptic landscape.", "source": {"uri": "press-start.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Press Start"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kieron_verbrugge@press-start.com.au", "name": "Kieron Verbrugge", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place_(opera)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A Quiet Place (opera)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First-person (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horror game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alien (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-player_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-player video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horror fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adventure game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Fantasy", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://press-start.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/a-quiet-place.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793918", "eventUri": "eng-9793918", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

However, the team behind the game has been keeping the release date close to its chest, only saying that it's set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC later this year. Today, the PlayStation Twitter account posted a new six-second teaser for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, and officially revealed the game's release date. Fans will be able to jump into the single-player horror adventure on October 17th.\n\nThe announcement seemingly came out of nowhere but was posted by the official PlayStation account. However, the post has since been taken down, suggesting that PlayStation may have jumped the gun slightly. That said, outside of the release date reveal, there's not much in this update. You can see a few seconds of footage of the franchise's famous extraterrestrial creatures, but there's nothing else to learn in this info dump. Fortunately, the team at Saber Interactive has previously shared a few story details in an earlier trailer, giving fans a great idea of what to expect in October.\n\nWhile we don't know too much about the game's story, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead features Anairis Quinones as Alex Taylor. The veteran voice actress has previously worked in video games like Fire Emblem Heroes, Street Fighter 6, Genshin Impact, and New Pok\u00e9mon Snap, among many others. She's also worked in fan-favorite anime like Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia. In A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, her character is a college student with asthma who has survived the initial attacks. The player must work alongside her boyfriend Martin to avoid the alien creatures and survive. Most likely, the character having asthma will be a key gameplay mechanic, as fans of the A Quiet Place franchise will know that the creatures react to any sound with ruthless aggression. It's also worth noting that pre-release footage has featured Alex taking a pregnancy test, so childbirth might come into play in the gameplay. It's also possible that it will simply be a part of Alex's story before the aliens land, but we'll have to wait and find out when the game launches later this year.\n\nA Quiet Place: The Road Ahead launches on October 17th on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place_(opera)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A Quiet Place (opera)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saber_Interactive", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saber Interactive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halloween"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-player_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-player video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horror fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extraterrestrial life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adventure game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anairis_Qui\u00f1ones", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anairis Qui\u00f1ones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_6", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Street Fighter 6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Pok\u00e9mon_Snap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Pok\u00e9mon Snap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genshin_Impact", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genshin Impact"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attack on Titan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Game mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anime"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Fighting", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Fighting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action-Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action-Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2024/07/02/99d8107a-e8e9-47cd-b6c1-bf9bbbc867cd/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793918", "eventUri": "eng-9793918", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-17", "textStart": 664, "textEnd": 676, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

than others, such as the recent leak of The Patrick Star Game, which was found on the online storefront Igabiba.\n\nWhile this leak seemed obvious, it was only spotted in Slovenia, so it had a chance to go under the radar.\n\nOn the other hand, the leak of the video game tie-in for A Quiet Place's release date was seen by players around the globe.\n\nPeople can be very fanatical about their favourite console, and they keep a close eye on everything that is announced for it.\n\nThis usually means following the main accounts for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo on all social media platforms.\n\nBecause of how closely people follow these accounts, a post is bound to be seen by someone even if it's only up for a few seconds.\n\nThis is exactly what happened when PlayStation accidentally posted the release date for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead on Twitter.\n\nThe tweet read: \"A Quiet Place: A Road Ahead creeps onto PS5 October 17.\"\n\nAlongside this sentence, there was a short six-second teaser video for the game.\n\nIt was deleted after only a few minutes, but people had already screenshotted and shared it.\n\nWhat likely happened is that PlayStation scheduled the post alongside another announcement, but the tweet ended up going out early.\n\nThe release date has since been confirmed by the publisher alongside pricing and platforms.\n\nTwitter users pointed out that it's \"just in time for Halloween\" claiming they \"can't wait.\"\n\nThere has been a lot of speculation about the length of the game, due to it appearing at a low price point on some online storefronts.\n\nIt appeared for just $29.99 on US Amazon and the price has now been confirmed as $29.99/\u00a324.99\n\nA Quiet Place is a stealth-based single-player game, meaning it is more likely to be a shorter game.\n\nWhile PlayStation leaked the release date, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead will also be released on Xbox Series X|S and Steam.\n\nIf you want to read more about upcoming games,

Written text logs in horror games provide valuable world-building, atmosphere, and lore. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead benefits from its connection to the well-known IP, allowing for creative storytelling within established parameters.\n\nHorror tends to have the same tropes and motifs across most media and in games it is no different. Different subgenres and gameplay direction can orient a horror game one way or another, but comparisons and similarities are incredibly rampant between entries. It seems more difficult for horror games to be unique nowadays, too, with big-name monuments in the industry laying the brickwork for clones and remakes to follow. Horror isn't the only genre in games that prominently features written notes or text legs, for example, but it's certainly a genre that can make the most of them with haunting admissions and harrowing documents.\n\nIn many ways, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead looks like a horror game that's been seen countless times now. Its degree of polish from what has been shown thus far is commendable, to be sure, but without the allure of its looming science-fiction IP it wouldn't necessarily be unique in a stack of like-minded first-person horror. That said, what A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead has going for it, and what it should relish in, is the titular quiet moments of reflection and world-building that written text logs can provide in abundance.\n\n3:24\n\nRelated\n\n6 Best Horror Games To Play If You Love A Quiet Place\n\nFor fans thrilled by A Quiet Place: Day One in theatres, these great video games can provide a similar horror-themed experience.\n\nWritten Text Log Entries Can Be the Bulk of A Quiet Place's Lore Dump\n\nClose\n\nMany horror games are privy to written text logs that profoundly ascribe lore or context to their world -- for example, Resident Evil 's iconic diary entry reading \"Itchy. Tasty.\"\n\nBecause Stormind and Saber's A Quiet Place game will at least chiefly need to abide by the rules established by its IP, The Road Ahead could afford to stuff its world-building with plenty of written notes for players to read and gain an understanding of established events from the three months before it takes place. Three months isn't a ton of time in the grand scheme, but for Alex Taylor and her companions that will have felt like a lifetime as they continue to live day to day in pure silence and avoid common pitfalls of sound-making.\n\nLikewise, any number of fathomable occurrences would be fascinating to read about from other characters' experiences, such as anyone who was holed up somewhere that Alex happens to pass through in The Road Ahead. One of the reasons why the original Quiet Place is so immediately compelling is because of the tragically avoidable loss that the Abbott family suffers in the prologue, and similar circumstances are likely to have befallen any number of people whose critical missteps resulted in sorrow.\n\nA Quiet Place: The Road Ahead Has the Luxury of a Well-Known, Underdeveloped IP\n\nIf The Road Ahead doesn't take the opportunity to indulge in text logs, though, its storytelling won't necessarily be in jeopardy. The Road Ahead is fortunate enough to be inserting itself into A Quiet Place's canon, which is currently highly elementary: aliens suddenly struck the Earth in a meteor shower. This gives an open interpretation to whatever overarching science-fiction logic there could be to explain how such creatures arrived, but A Quiet Place hasn't concerned itself with matters of that scale yet and The Road Ahead isn't expected to, either.\n\nStill, it's smaller matters like how a family is coping in such devastation and terror that could come across as lovely bits of world-building in A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, and since characters will hopefully be mindful of their sound output at all times it would be great if written notes are not only how they communicate with one another but also how players receive lore about other characters they may not interact with.\n\nA Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is scheduled for a release in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "gamerant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Game Rant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jared_stewart@gamerant.com", "name": "Jared Stewart", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_Ahead", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Road Ahead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horror game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place_(opera)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A Quiet Place (opera)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(narrative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motif (narrative)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horror fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trope_(literature)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trope (literature)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Worldbuilding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Theft Auto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_remake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game remake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place:_Day_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A Quiet Place: Day One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Taylor_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Taylor (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First-person (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Resident Evil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Periodicals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Periodicals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Europe", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Oceania", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Oceania", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/a-20.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793918", "eventUri": "eng-9793918", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The movie franchise is getting a new addition, but this time it's in the gaming sphere. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead launches 17 October.\n\nThis upcoming title is being developed by the Italian developer Stormind Games, the creators of games such as Batora: Lost Haven and the Remothered franchise. The game is being published by Saber Interactive, the publishers for games such as Vampyr, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Kingdom Come: Deliverance.\n\nFor those wanting to know more about A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, a 50 second trailer has been released on YouTube, showcasing some of the survival horror elements that players can expect to run into. From doors slamming shut and alerting the Death Angels, to having to try and shuffle away from them as they are on high alert searching for you, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead looks like it'll be the perfect game for those who were fans of Alien: Isolation.\n\nA Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is a spin-off from the movie franchise, where you play as a character who has asthma, which, just by using the inhaler is enough to alert the Death Angels to her presence. She is going through interpersonal family conflict, and must deal with her emotions of that while navigating an apocalyptic world.\n\nFor those that haven't seen the movies, the Death Angels use sound to locate their prey, and have a heightened sense of hearing, meaning they can hear every little noise you make. In this survival horror game, that may be the thing that makes or breaks her survival.\n\nIf you are interested in purchasing A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, the game will be released on October 17 and will cost $29.99. Pre-orders for the game are currently available, which will allow those who have pre-ordered to get exclusive content in the game and get their hands on some digital art from the upcoming video game.\n\nIn addition to the trailer, the developers also released a 10-minute game play video in July, a video that is exclusive to IGN. In this video, you get to see the protagonist navigate Northwood Hospital, where she has to overcome her own fears in order to survive the horrors of the post-apocalyptic world she has been plunged into.", "source": {"uri": "wccftech.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wccftech"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amy_eastland@wccftech.com", "name": "Amy Eastland", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place_(opera)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A Quiet Place (opera)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_3:_Wild_Hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampyr_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vampyr (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saber_Interactive", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saber Interactive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_horror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Survival horror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horror fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_game_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perfect game (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alien (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_isolation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social isolation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asthma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Come:_Deliverance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kingdom Come: Deliverance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pre-order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IGN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AQP_key-art_16x9_no-logo-728x410.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793918", "eventUri": "eng-9793918", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-17", "textStart": 300, "textEnd": 310, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

date", "body": "VIDEO games are known for their leaks as everyone has their eyes on everything from new trademarks to secrets hidden in a game's code.\n\nHowever, some leaks are easier to spot than others, such as the recent leak of The Patrick Star Game, which was found on the online storefront Igabiba.\n\nWhile this leak seemed obvious, it was only spotted in Slovenia, so it had a chance to go under the radar.\n\nOn the other hand, the leak of the video game tie-in for A Quiet Place's release date was seen by players around the globe.\n\nPeople can be very fanatical about their favourite console, and they keep a close eye on everything that is announced for it.\n\nThis usually means following the main accounts for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo on all social media platforms.\n\nBecause of how closely people follow these accounts, a post is bound to be seen by someone even if it's only up for a few seconds.\n\nThis is exactly what happened when PlayStation accidentally posted the release date for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead on Twitter.\n\nThe tweet read: \"A Quiet Place: A Road Ahead creeps onto PS5 October 17.\"\n\nAlongside this sentence, there was a short six-second teaser video for the game.\n\nIt was deleted after only a few minutes, but people had already screenshotted and shared it.\n\nWhat likely happened is that PlayStation scheduled the post alongside another announcement, but the tweet ended up going out early.\n\nAs it comes from PlayStation's official account, it is likely that the release date is final, but sometimes people adjust release dates when they leak early.\n\nHowever, if the other pieces for the game are set in stone, then the release date will remain the same and we'll likely see the tweet again at a later date.\n\nTwitter users pointed out that it's \"just in time for Halloween\" claiming they \"can't wait.\"\n\nThere has been a lot of speculation about the length of the game, due to it appearing at a low price point on some online storefronts.\n\nIt has appeared for just $29.99 on US Amazon, which usually translates to \u00a324.99 in the UK.\n\nA Quiet Place is a stealth-based single-player game, meaning it is more likely to be a shorter game.\n\nWhile PlayStation leaked the release date, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead will also be released on Xbox Series X|S and Steam.\n\nIf you want to read

It is one of the most anticipated game adaptations from a movie, with its early rumors stemming to 2021, amidst the coronavirus pandemic when it was first made known to the world.\n\nCurrently, there are already three movies in regards to the film franchise, with its third one, A Quiet Place: Day One, recently released to theaters worldwide.\n\nSaber Interactive has released a new trailer for its upcoming A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead game, now confirming that the game will be available in two months come October 17. This latest teaser gave snippets about what the game will offer the world once it is available, centering on this new single-player horror adventure title.\n\nThe game will be available on multiple platforms and it will only take a little over two months before it drops, centering on the first adaptation of the renowned movie franchise from John Krasinski, Scott Beck, and Bryan Woods.\n\nThree years in the making, Saber Interactive's upcoming release will be available via PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and PCs via Steam.\n\nRead Also: Mortal Kombat 1's Ed Boon Hopes to Get Arnold Schwarzenegger to Voice Conan the Barbarian\n\nThe multiple trailer releases from Saber Interactive on A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead gave the world a massive preview of what to expect from this adaptation, centering on the protagonist, Alex Taylor. Here, Taylor would traverse the same world as what the movies depicted, with the ultimate goal of surviving the dystopian world and making as little noise as possible, as it could attract the highly sensitive monsters.\n\nThe world was captivated by A Quiet Place when it first dropped in 2018 from Paramount Pictures, best known for being co-written, directed, and starred by John Krasinski, best known for his role as Jim Halpert in 2005's The Office (US). It surpassed box office expectations back then and became an instant hit, already prompting a sequel based on the story by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods.\n\nIt was followed by A Quiet Place: Part II, which still has Emily Blunt portraying Evelyn Abbott in the film, but this time, moving on without Lee Abbott (Krasinski) and left to raise their children alone. The renowned sequel initially faced significant theater release delays because of the coronavirus pandemic, and it was among those that were releasedstraight to on-demand streaming platforms.\n\nBack in 2021, there were initial rumors about a video game spinoff from the movie franchise, and it was previously rumored to be on track for 2022 by the same developers and publishers. Almost three years have passed and it is only now that its trailer was dropped, significantly followed by PlayStation's revelation of its October release date and the developers going along with this confirmation.", "source": {"uri": "techtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tech Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isaiah_richard@techtimes.com", "name": "Isaiah Richard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place_(opera)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A Quiet Place (opera)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place:_Day_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A Quiet Place: Day One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Beck_and_Bryan_Woods", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scott Beck and Bryan Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saber_Interactive", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saber Interactive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Krasinski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Krasinski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_franchise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Media franchise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steam (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Boon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ed Boon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_the_Barbarian", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conan the Barbarian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortal Kombat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arnold Schwarzenegger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adventure game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place_Part_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A Quiet Place Part II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Office (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Blunt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emily Blunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dystopia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action-Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action-Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Strategy", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Strategy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://1734811051.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/450008/820/0/0/0/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793918", "eventUri": "eng-9793918", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-17", "textStart": 717, "textEnd": 727}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The prequel film earned positive reviews and has been a box office success. It's unclear what the future of the franchise is, but A Quiet Place: Day One 's reception suggests that another film will get the green light.\n\nA Quiet Place: Day One has become a major success on VOD after its strong box office performance. After two previous films directed by John Krasinski released in 2018 and 2020, director Michael Sarnoski took the reins for the new prequel film that chronicles the aliens' arrival on Earth. Lupita Nyong'o and Joseph Quinn lead the Quiet Place: Day One cast as Samira and Eric, respectively, following the two unlikely allies as they attempt to survive in New York City. After a strong box office run, the prequel hit VOD on July 30.\n\nNew data shared by IndieWire now reveals that A Quiet Place: Day One has been a top performer on both iTunes and Fandango at Home since its digital release. The film occupies the number one position on the iTunes chart for Monday, August 5, and the number one position on the Fandango at Home chart for the week of July 29 - August 4.

The film currently enjoys a strong 86% on Rotten Tomatoes, and the audience score, while lower, is also respectable at 73%. This generally positive reception is reflected in the film's box office performance.\n\nRelated A Quiet Place's New $245 Million Hit Helps Prove A Quiet Place 3 Can't Be The End\n\nA Quiet Place: Day One is a massive hit for the sci-fi/horror franchise, and it proves that A Quiet Place 3 can't be the end of the series.\n\n1\n\nThough A Quiet Place: Day One's box office currently stands as the lowest in the franchise, the film has still been an undeniable success. The movie was made on an estimated budget of $67 million and has now made $258.8 million at the box office worldwide. This result certainly suggests that audience interest in the franchise remains high, and it bodes well for future films.\n\nAs of writing, nothing has been announced regarding the future of the Quiet Place franchise. The latest prequel tells a complete story that largely wraps up the arcs of its main characters, so a new movie would presumably follow new characters or continue the story of Emily Blunt's Evelyn and her children from the first two films. With A Quiet Place: Day One having been a success, an announcement about the future of the franchise could arrive over the next few months.\n\nSource: IndieWire\n\nA Quiet Place: Day One 2.0 PG-13DramaHorror Sci-Fi\n\nA Quiet Place: Day One is a spin-off of the A Quiet Place franchise conceived by John Krasinski. The film is set at the beginning of the invasion as humanity scrambles to survive, before the events of the original film, with Lupita Nyong'O leading the cast, directed by Michael Sarnoski.\n\nDirector Michael Sarnoski Release Date June 28, 2024 Studio(s) Paramount Pictures , Platinum Dunes , Sunday Night Productions Distributor(s) Paramount Pictures Writers Michael Sarnoski

Publisher Saber Interactive has revealed that the game, developed by Stormind Games, will be released on October 17 for the PC via Steam, along with Microsoft's Xbox Series S and X consoles and Sony's PS5 console. The game is being released in the middle of the Halloween season.\n\nAlong with the release date, Saber has also dropped a new trailer for the game on YouTube. It shows a mix of cinematic and gameplay sequences. As we have reported before, this game takes place in the same universe as the movie A Quiet Place, where mysterious creatures have invaded the Earth who have super advanced hearing and incredible quick speed to take out humans.\n\nThe game itself tells a new story of another survivor of this post-apocalyptic Earth. She has to navigate this world in silence, while also dealing with some personal issues of her own.\n\nThe trailer reveals that preorders for the game will get some in-game bonuses, with two extra batteries and three extra inhalers. The preorders also come with some digital concept artwork from the game, along with an animation showcase for the game's lethal creatures.\n\nSaber Interactive recently broke away from Embracer Group, and is now an independent developer and publisher of games. Saber's next game, published by Focus Entertainment, is Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine II. The sci-fi third-person shooter is due for release in just over a month on September 9.\n\nSaber is also developing the first-person zombie-themed action game John Carpenter's Toxic Commando. It was first announced over a year ago in June 2023, with a launch date for sometime in 2024. Since then there's been no word on the game's current status or if it will make its 2024 release date.", "source": {"uri": "neowin.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Neowin"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_callaham@neowin.net", "name": "John Callaham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horror game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steam (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saber_Interactive", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saber Interactive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stealth_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stealth game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First-person (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halloween"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Action game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_40,000:_Space_Marine_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Focus Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embracer_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Embracer Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indie game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-person_shooter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Third-person shooter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carpenter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Carpenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2024/06/1718629993_a-quiet-place-game_story.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793918", "eventUri": "eng-9793918", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-17", "textStart": 226, "textEnd": 236}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-09", "textStart": 1516, "textEnd": 1527}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

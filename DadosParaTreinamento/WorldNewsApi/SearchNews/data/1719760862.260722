The former Ibrox gaffer made the move to the Saudi Pro League last year in his return to the managerial game following his sacking by English Premier League outfit Aston Villa. The Liverpool legend landed his big shot back in England's top flight after a successful stint north of the border where he most notably ended Celtic's hopes of landing 10-in-a-row to end Rangers' long wait for Scottish Premiership success. That triumph also came as part of an unbeaten league campaign. His exploits in Europe also earned many plaudits. After his Villa exit, Gerrard bided his time before returning to management and it is his current role that ticked the boxes. He revealed FIVE questions that he asked himself that hit the nail on the head. An offer to go back to the English Premier League did arrive but he knew after his Villa spell that had he not got the reaction required, it would have been another major blow on his CV off the back of a tough time. Explaining how the opportunity felt similar to the Rangers project he was presented, he told The Telegraph: \"I think the opportunities to go straight back in quickly when I probably wasn\u2019t ready, they were high-risk, really high-risk in terms of they could again have been a tough knock if it wasn\u2019t the right opportunity. \u201cSo, I needed to sit down with people who shared a lot of things with me, maybe in terms of wanting to build something, in being given a little more time\u2026 that felt a bit more like Rangers. Now, I am not comparing clubs and sizes but in terms of a project. Can you build something special? Can you build a team? Can you build an infrastructure? Can you give academy people opportunities? Can you share your experiences and let people grow? \u201cFor example, I was offered the chance to go back into the Premier League late on, where a team had very little time to go, where a team needed to have that lift and that reaction. But if I didn\u2019t get that reaction and they went down it would have felt like another blow on the back of Villa.\u201d He continued: \u201cThere are no guarantees but I believe with time with support and with the same people being on the same page, I\u2019ve experienced it before, I have the confidence and belief that I can build something and make a difference.\" Gerrard boasts familiar faces to Scottish football fans in the shape of former Celtic pair Moussa Dembele and Jack Hendry while Jordan Henderson \u2013 who has since left \u2013 made the switch alongside Demarai Gray and Georgino Wijnaldum from PSG.", "summary": "The former Ibrox gaffer has opened up on his new role and the similarities of when he took over in Govan.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/steven-gerrard-compares-rangers-al-32916865", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32916942.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS332894857.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:13:08", "author": "Alan Galindo", "authors": ["Alan Galindo"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.166}

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has promised to create 100,000 more apprenticeships a year by axing some \u201crip-off\u201d university degrees if the Tories stay in power after the General Election. University leaders have warned the policy could \u201crun down and undermine\u201d the higher education sector and deter people from studying for degrees. Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK (UUK), which represents vice-chancellors at 142 universities, said she was \u201cfed up of people talking down universities\u201d. In a post on the Conservative Party\u2019s pledge on X, formerly Twitter, Ms Stern said: \u201cI just don\u2019t get the determination to put people off going to university. \u201cThis is especially frustrating when it is driven by people who have degrees (Gillian Keegan has two). Generally it is other people\u2019s kids they don\u2019t want to go. \u201cFinally, Rishi Sunak keeps saying he is fed up of people talking down Britain. Well, I am fed up of people talking down universities \u2013 which are one of the things the UK can be genuinely proud of.\u201d The Prime Minister said a regulator would look at the progression and drop-out rates of university courses, as well their future earnings potential, to determine whether they are underperforming. Speaking at a train depot in Cornwall on Wednesday, Mr Sunak said: \u201cI\u2019m not someone who believes that you have to go to university, and all the apprentices I\u2019ve been talking to this morning are proof of that, describing it as the best decision they ever made. \u201cAnd what we do know is that there are university degrees that are letting young people down.\u201d Despite being asked to name a specific example of an underperforming degree, the Prime Minister did not do so. Rachel Hewitt, chief executive of the MillionPlus group of universities, said: \u201cApprenticeships are an important part of the skills landscape. However, pitting them in opposition to higher education is self-defeating. \u201cModern universities across the country already deliver excellent degree apprenticeships which combine degree-level study and industry experience, meaning students can earn as they learn.\u201d She added: \u201cInstead of seeking to run down and undermine Britain\u2019s world-leading university sector at every turn, the Conservative Party should focus on policies that would help these institutions boost skills, social mobility and businesses to the betterment of Britain.\u201d The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said funding 100,000 more apprenticeships a year through a \u201ccrackdown\u201d on degree courses would be challenging. It is \u201cunclear\u201d whether savings from scrapping \u201clow-value\u201d courses would be large enough to fund the Tories\u2019 expansion plan of apprenticeships \u2013 which could cost around \u00a3900 million each year \u2013 as students could still switch to other higher education courses rather than apprenticeships, the IFS said. Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union (UCU), said: \u201cHigher education provides a ladder of opportunity to working-class communities, so it is no wonder the Conservative Party continues to attack it.\u201d She added: \u201cWe need an end to Tory MPs playing politics with further and higher education, and sustainable funding for the whole sector.\u201d", "summary": "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has promised to create 100,000 more apprenticeships a year by shutting down some university courses.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/universities-uk-rishi-sunak-higher-education-prime-minister-britain-b1160821.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/05/29/12/59cc65feb79269f32f6cee455ee829dbY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE3MDY3MDA2-2.76361452.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:21:06", "author": "Eleanor Busby", "authors": ["Eleanor Busby"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.121}

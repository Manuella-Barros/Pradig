In the heart of Ishikawa Prefecture, Suzu City stands at the tip of the Noto Peninsula. Its community is now defined by an unyielding resilience and deep solidarity in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake.

The food, rich in local flavour, carries stories of perseverance and heritage, each dish a testament to the region's commitment to preserve its culinary identity despite recent trials. Patrons, many returning for the first time since the quake, share heartfelt stories over their meals. One diner tearfully remarks, \"I\u2019m so glad to eat sashimi,\" her relief palpable, highlighting the contrast between the current cosy comfort of the restaurant and the stark conditions of evacuation shelters.

Hiroyoshi Sakurada, the fourth-generation owner, is battling to revive his family\u2019s 100-year-old legacy. The brewery was severely damaged, yet amidst the ruins, Sakurada found hope\u2014over 800 bottles of sake survived, a symbol of resilience that has inspired him to plan a comeback. With the support of fellow distillers across Ishikawa, he aims to restart production by spring, rekindling a craft that is a cornerstone of local heritage and an attraction for tourism, which remains vital for Suzu\u2019s recovery. The spirit of Suzu is mirrored in the broader community initiatives that focus on sustainable rebuilding and preparedness for future calamities.

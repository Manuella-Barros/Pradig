In Pennsylvania, perhaps a lot\n\nPrior to President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race, he and Trump had been scheduled to debate each other a second time on ABC News on Sept. 10. Trump said Tuesday that he is willing to debate Harris at least once and possibly a second time, but that he now has issues with doing so on ABC News.\n\n\"I'm not thrilled with ABC,\" Trump said during a Tuesday conference with reporters, calling the network \"fake news.\" \"I guess they committed but I have at least equal say, and I don't like the idea of ABC.\"\n\nTrump wrote on his Truth Social platform Sunday that he wanted Fox News to host a debate.\n\nFox News reportedly extended the invitation to both campaigns to work out details about the location, time, date and format of a debate -- including whether there would be an audience. In a letter sent to the campaigns, Fox News executives suggested that hosts Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum would likely be chosen to moderate the debate.\n\nHarris previously had agreed to a vice presidential debate with JD Vance that would have taken place on CBS News either on July 23 or Aug. 13. Those plans were scrapped when Biden dropped out of the race, a move that was precipitated by his disastrous performance in his CNN debate with Trump on June 27.\n\nIt's unknown whether a vice presidential debate will take place. The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to take place in Chicago from Aug. 19-22. The party's choice of a vice presidential candidate -- potentially Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro -- may not come until that time.\n\nA debate in Pennsylvania would hold added significance after Trump was shot in an attempted assassination at a campaign rally in Butler Township, north of Pittsburgh, earlier this month.\n\nThe last presidential debate to be held in Pennsylvania was at Philadelphia's Walnut Street Theatre in September 1976, when incumbent Republican Gerald Ford debated Democrat Jimmy Carter, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California-Santa Barbara. A vice presidential debate was held in the city in 1984 and Philadelphia also hosted Democratic primary debates in 2008.

The former president earlier this week told reporters he \"absolutely\" would debate Harris, but he also suggested that Fox News should host.\n\nIn their letter, Wallace and Loker noted that even though the network did not host a Democratic primary debate in 2016 or 2020, it did feature town halls with Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Julian Castro, Amy Klobuchar and Kirsten Gillibrand.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Muir", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Muir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Baier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bret Baier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Klobuchar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amy Klobuchar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Castro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julian Castro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirsten_Gillibrand", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kirsten Gillibrand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Communication", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Communication", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Fox-News-Proposes-Donald-Trump-Kamala-Harris-Debate.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759911", "eventUri": "eng-9759911", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-17", "textStart": 109, "textEnd": 121}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 519, "textEnd": 526}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-10", "textStart": 564, "textEnd": 576}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

That set in motion a series of events that led the incumbent POTUS to ultimately drop out of the 2024 race. (In a TVLine poll, nearly 70% said that Trump bested Biden in that first debate of the election cycle.)\n\nIn announcing his withdrawn bid for reelection on July 21, Biden threw his support behind veep Harris, who promptly secured the support of enough Democratic delegates to become her party's nominee. The Democratic National Convention should make things official, when it kicks off Aug. 19 in Chicago.\n\nAssuming Harris does lock down her party's nomination, she could square off against Trump as soon three weeks later. Both Trump and Biden had agreed in the spring to a second presidential debate to be held Sept. 10 and air on ABC, with ABC News' David Muir and Linsey Davis moderating, but soon after Biden dropped out of the race, Trump said on Truth Social that any next debate \"should be held on Fox News, rather than very biased ABC.\"\n\nThen, during a Tuesday press call (per Politico and others), Trump said that while he is \"not thrilled with ABC\" -- \"They're actually trying to make a hero out of Joe Biden,\" he opined, and framing Harris' candidacy as a \"wonderful thing\" -- he did affirm that he \"would be willing to do more than one debate\" against his new opponent.\n\nFox News has since sent a letter to the Harris and Trump campaigns proposing a debate on Sept. 17 in Pennsylvania, \"just as early voting is getting underway there and in other key battlegrounds,\" Fox News Media president Jay Wallace and Fox News VP of Politics Jessica Loker wrote.\n\nThe cable newser pitched Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum as moderators, but, \"We are open to discussion on the exact date, format and location -- with or without an audience,\" the letter read.\n\nNeither Trump nor Harris have yet to officially agree to the Fox News debate;

The network described its invitation as an amendment of its proposal for a debate during the 2024 campaign and suggested that hosts Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum would be the \"best choices\" to moderate.\n\nRead more: https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/24/fox-news-debate-harris-trump-00170958", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_MacCallum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martha MacCallum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Baier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bret Baier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759911", "eventUri": "eng-9759911", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-17", "textStart": 168, "textEnd": 176}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-10", "textStart": 361, "textEnd": 369}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Donald Trump debate? Here's what we know", "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- Before President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him, Biden and former President Donald Trump had agreed to one final showdown. Then everything changed.\n\nNow, the general public is left wondering: Will the previously scheduled presidential debate still go on? Will the public have an opportunity to watch Harris and Trump -- who have already made public jabs at each other -- go toe-to-toe on political positions on the national stage?\n\nHere's what we know -- and what we don't -- about a presidential debate between Harris and Trump.\n\nHarris, who has quickly become the presumptive Democratic nominee, has not spoken about a debate yet, while Trump has seemed wishy-washy since Biden ended his reelection bid.\n\nTrump expressed hesitancy in a series of Truth Social posts, remarking that he didn't know who he'd be debating after Biden bowed out and calling for debates to be hosted by the right-leaning Fox News. The original debate was scheduled to be hosted by ABC.\n\nIn an interview with CBS, Trump said, \"I think whoever it is, I'd like to debate. Yeah, sure.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the Associated Press reported that Trump said he'd like to debate Harris \"more than once\" but wouldn't commit to appearing at the September debate. He added in a press call that he was \"not thrilled about ABC.\"\n\n\"I think debating's important for a presidential race,\" Trump said. \"You sort of have an obligation to debate.\"\n\nWhen is the next presidential debate?\n\nThe next Trump v. Biden debate was scheduled to air on ABC on Sept. 10.\n\nIt was intended to be moderated by ABC World News Tonight anchor David Muir and ABC News Live Prime anchor Linsey Davis. ABC has not publicized any updates as of publication time.\n\nWhat else do we know?\n\nJason Miller, a senior member of Trump's campaign team, told NBC there would \"definitely\" be another debate. But at least one other GOP source has expressed skepticism.\n\nWhat about a vice presidential debate?\n\nAs you can see, everything is sort of in flux right now.\n\nAbout a week ago, Harris and Trump's veep choice, Sen. JD Vance, R., Ohio, were in the process of selecting potential dates for a vice presidential debate. Now that she's seeking the presidency, Harris' debate with Vance appears to be a moot point.\n\nDuring his first solo speech as a vice presidential candidate in Ohio on Monday, Vance expressed his disappointment he wouldn't get to debate Harris after all.\n\n\"I was told I was going to debate Kamala Harris,\" Vance said. \"And now President Trump is going to get to debate her?\"\n\nWhat happened when Kamala Harris debated Mike Pence?\n\nIn 2020, Harris' debate against Trump's then-running mate, Mike Pence, lasted 90 minutes and was largely unmemorable (which is typically the case for vice presidential debates). A recap from BBC at the time said both candidates had strong moments and stumbles.\n\nOne sticking point was Pence's tendency to speak over or interrupt both Harris, the first Black woman vice presidential candidate, and moderator Susan Page.\n\n\"Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking,\" Harris said at one point. \"If you don't mind letting me finish, then we can have a conversation.\"\n\nWhat happened in the first presidential debate this year?\n\nBiden's poor performance at the debate with Trump in Atlanta on June 27 is said to be the catalyst to his dropping out of the race.", "source":

The former president earlier this week told reporters he \"absolutely\" would debate Harris, but he also suggested that Fox News should host.\n\nIn their letter, Wallace and Loker noted that even though the network did not host a Democratic primary debate in 2016 or 2020, it did feature town halls with Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Julian Castro Amy Klobuchar and Kirsten Gillibrand.", "source": {"uri": "deadline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ted_johnson@deadline.com", "name": "Ted Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_A._Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henry A.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON -- Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump during a Tuesday call with reporters committed to a debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic presidential candidate.\n\n\"I would be willing to do more than one debate,\" the former president said.\n\nHarris, who says she is the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, won pledges from enough Democratic delegates by late Monday night to gain the nomination. President Joe Biden on Sunday dropped his reelection bid and endorsed Harris.\n\nDuring the call, Trump also said that he's not worried about campaigning against Harris because \"she's the same as Biden\" in her policies.\n\nTrump later in the call criticized Harris for the Biden administration's immigration approach, a topic that he has made a core part of his platform in his third run for the White House.\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond to States Newsroom's request for comment on Trump's remarks about debating.\n\nTrump also said he is not sure he wants to take part in a debate hosted by ABC News that was scheduled for Sept. 10 with then-presumptive Democratic nominee Biden.\n\nBiden's shaky performance in a June 27 debate with Trump led to weeks of growing Democratic unease with his campaign. A growing chorus of Democrats calling for the president to drop his reelection included members of the U.S. House and Senate.\n\nTrump also noted that he hasn't agreed to the ABC debate because he \"agreed to a debate with Joe Biden,\" and not Harris.\n\nHarris held her first campaign rally Tuesday in Milwaukee, where she leaned into her prior work as a prosecutor and the attorney general for the state of California.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/south_carolina_daily_gazette_articles_179/a055d4952ead4918d1d270da1c3d8ab1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759911", "eventUri": "eng-9759911", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-10", "textStart": 1415, "textEnd": 1423}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 1504, "textEnd": 1511}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

All through June and most of July, he was good with ABC. He expressed no issue with ABC. Now that Biden has dropped out of the race and he is looking at a debate with Harris instead, suddenly, he can't stop talking about how horrible ABC is and how he wants Fox News to be the host, and, well, most people don't seem to be buying it. In fact, all Trump has really done is get folks on social media speculating that he is afraid to debate Kamala Harris.\n\n\"ABC Fake News is such a joke, among the absolute WORST in the business. They then tried to make 'Sleepy' look like a great President -- he was the WORST, and Lyin' Kamala into a competent person, which she is not. ABC, the home of George Slopadopolus, is not worthy of holding a Debate, of which I hope there will be many!\" Trump wrote on his Fact-Proof Social platform. (I'm just kind of tired of calling it \"Truth Social.\" It's like calling an apple an orange. It's like calling a tsunami a dry spell. It's like calling Gargamel's house a five-star Smurf hotel. It's like Trump calling himself a 215-pound 35-year-old.)\n\nTemper Tantrum Trump\n\nIt's worth noting that Trump has already been dragged across social media for referring to Harris as \"'Dumb as a Rock' Kamala Harris,\" which only prompted people en mass to point out that the guy who thinks windmills cause cancer, disinfectant injections might cure COVID, and that batteries are too big for military boats and would cause them to sink causing passengers to be electrocuted and/or eaten by sharks should probably STFU about anyone else's intelligence. Now, he's calling her \"Lyin' Kamala,\" and if he weren't dumb as a rock, he'd know referring to Harris that way might have a similar effect as there absolutely is no modern president who has made fact-checkers work overtime the way Trump has.\n\nAnyway, on Tuesday, Trump reiterated his fear of an ABC debate during a news conference. This time, he said he \"absolutely\" would debate Harris, but he still repeated his sudden objection to ABC moderating the event.\n\n\"I agreed to debate with Joe Biden. But I want to debate her and she'll be no different because they have the same policies,\" Trump told reporters on a press call organized by the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News. \"I would be willing to do more than one debate actually.\"\n\nSo, here, Trump has acknowledged that it shouldn't matter whether he debated Biden or Harris since they have the same general democratic policies. So, why does the venue matter? Again, he agreed to the ABC debate when he thought he would be debating Biden. He also didn't throw a tantrum like those when another network conservatives love to hate, CNN, hosted his first debate against the now-former incumbent. So, why is he crying about the network now?\n\n\"I'm not thrilled with ABC,\" Trump added, \"I guess they committed but I have at least equal say, and I don't like the idea of ABC.\"\n\nTrump probably should have run his sudden concerns over with the other members of his party, because they are not on the same page.\n\nFrom NBC:\n\nRNC Chair Michael Whatley told ABC News on Sunday that \"we've made it very clear we welcome\" the ABC debate. And Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller told NBC News' Lester Holt on Sunday that \"there's definitely going to be another debate.\"\n\nAlso, if Trump is so sure that Biden and Harris are interchangeable because their policies are the same, why is he whining that his campaign should be \"reimbursed\" for all of the time and money it spent mud-slinging against Biden only for the Democratic party and the \"Fake News Media\" to hit him with the bait and switch and run Harris instead? (Trump seriously demonstrates every day that he does not understand how anything in the political world works. It's almost fascinating.)\n\n\"Shouldn't the Republican Party be reimbursed for fraud in that everybody around Joe, including his doctors and the Fake News Media, knew he was not capable of running for, or being, President?\" he wrote on Baffons-in-the-Booth Social.\n\nNah, Trump is shaking in his boots. His little baby hands are trembling. He's going to sweat out his spray tan if he's not careful. His toupee is going to slip right off of his forehead.\n\nIt's clear that Trump has lost a little of his confidence over the prospect of going up against someone who is 20 years younger than him and more capable than he is of stringing together cohesive thoughts instead of debating a doddery octogenarian who he can easily shout over while taking pot-meets-kettle shots at his mental and cognitive acuity. And Trump isn't self-aware enough to realize how transparent his fear is while he's doing all of his sudden whining. He doesn't realize that the optics of his whining have people calling him a \"coward\" in these internet streets.\n\nThe Cult Leader Has Had Years To Do What The Vice President Has Months To Do\n\nThe fact is, Trump has the deck stacked in his favor. He has been running his campaign for nearly two years while Harris has a few months to convince the country that she's the best person to lead it. Trump has a cult-like MAGA following whereas even the democratic base has largely been split on how it feels about Harris. He's a white man running for an office that has only seen one non-white male president in 235 years. His party gives him free rein to run his campaign on lies, bigotry and wilful ignorance, which are conservative America's favorite love languages. Why does he seem to be so afraid to go up against a Black and Southeast Asian woman who is, by a wide margin, the underdog in this race?\n\nIt can't be emphasized enough that this is a debate and debate venue that Trump already agreed to with zero objections when he thought he was going up against the old, feeble-looking white guy.\n\nWhat a difference a Black Woman Magic day makes.\n\nSee

The event would take place in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"We are open to discussion about the exact date, format and location -- with or without an audience,\" Wallace said. The letters to campaign officials included statistics on Fox News' reach among independent voters in key states.\n\nABC News had reached an agreement between the Trump campaign and President Joe Biden's campaign to televise a debate scheduled for September 10. Trump has suggested in recent days that a debate would take place on Fox News Channel.\n\nBetween 1988 and 2020, the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan organization, organized the presidential debate process, choosing its own moderators. Modern politics, however, is so rife with outrage that both Republicans and Democrats have been eager to bypass the organization their own parties set up in 1987, after several elections in which debates were organized by the League of Women Voters.\n\nThese events should not be taken lightly. In June, CNN televised a debate that ultimately brought down Biden. The president appeared angry and tired, even though the debate was held without an audience and with microphones cut off when a candidate's time to speak or respond was up. CNN's telecast was picked up by many of its competitors and was punctuated by commercial breaks, once considered taboo. According to Nielsen, an estimated 51.27 million viewers tuned in to watch the 90-minute spectacle, which was broadcast simultaneously on 22 networks.\n\nMore soon...\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "George Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_MacCallum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martha MacCallum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_on_Presidential_Debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commission on Presidential Debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Baier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bret Baier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_voter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent voter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpartisanism", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonpartisanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Women_Voters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "League of Women Voters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MixCollage-24-Jul-2024-01-24-PM-6546-e1721841886466.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759911", "eventUri": "eng-9759911", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-17", "textStart": 37, "textEnd": 49}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-10", "textStart": 1008, "textEnd": 1020}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Here's what we know - ExBulletin", "body": "Donald Trump has agreed to participate in a second debate with Joe Biden on September 10 on ABC News. However, now that Biden has withdrawn from the race, there has been much speculation as to whether Trump will agree to debate Kamala Harris, who has announced her intention to run for president.\n\nThe confusion began on Monday, July 22, when author and Democrat Stephen King posted on X (formerly Twitter): Trump has announced he will not debate Kamala Harris. At the time of publication, the post had been viewed more than 18 million times. King, who has more than seven million followers, was roundly criticized by the Trump team. \"Stephen King is a moron,\" Trump 2024 campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Newsweek.\n\nKings' post came after Trump took to Truth Social, his own social media platform, to express his displeasure with ABC's September debate. On Sunday, July 21, he wrote: My debate with Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, was scheduled to air on Fake News ABC, the home of George Slopadopolus, sometime in September. Now that Joe has unsurprisingly dropped out of the race, I think the debate, with whomever the radical left Democrats choose, should be on FoxNews, rather than the highly biased ABC. Thanks! DJT.\n\nU.S. Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris speaks at West Allis Central High School during her first campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on July 23, 2024. Kamil KrzaczynskiGetty Images\n\nTrump reemphasized this view on Tuesday, again misspelling Stephanopoulos' last name.

The agreement unfolded within a matter of hours after Biden officially challenged Trump to debates following months of prodding by Trump. The campaigns agreed that the debate hosts must have hosted previous Democratic and Republican primary debates in which both Trump and Biden participated. Fox did not host a Democratic primary debate in 2020 (when Harris also ran for president), but the network noted in its Wednesday proposal to the campaigns it hosted town halls with Democratic candidates, not including Harris, in 2016 and 2020.\n\nBacklash surrounding Biden's disastrous performance in his June 27 debate with Trump on CNN ultimately led him to drop his reelection bid Sunday and endorse Harris as his replacement. By Monday, the majority of Democratic delegates had announced plans to support her, making it all but certain she officially becomes the nominee when the party votes in August to formalize its candidate.\n\nBiden Loses Train Of Thought And Corrects Himself Repeatedly In Debate With Trump (Forbes)\n\nTrump Says He Will Debate Harris, Maybe More Than Once (Forbes)\n\nTrump Accepts Biden's Challenge To Debate Twice -- Starting Next Month (Forbes)", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66a157ee688c5947afb6bb36/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759911", "eventUri": "eng-9759911", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 1196, "textEnd": 1203}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Credit - Bill Pugliano -- Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump agreed to a second scheduled debate with Joe Biden for Sep. 10 on ABC News. However, now that Biden has withdrawn from the race, much speculation has risen around whether Trump will agree to debate Kamala Harris -- who has announced she intends to run for President -- instead.\n\nThe confusion kickstarted on Monday, July 22, when author and Democrat Stephen King posted on X (formerly Twitter): \"Trump has announced he won't debate Kamala Harris.\" At the time of publication, the post has received over 18 million views. King, who has over seven million followers, was sharply criticized by the Trump team. \"Stephen King is a dumba**,\" Trump 2024 campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung is quoted as telling Newsweek.\n\nKing's post came after Trump had spoken out on Truth Social, his own social media platform, about being dissatisfied with the September debate being hosted by ABC. On Sunday, July 21, he wrote: \"My debate with Crooked Joe Biden, the Worst President in the history of the United States, was slated to be broadcast on Fake News ABC, the home of George Slopadopolus, sometime in September. Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC. Thank you! DJT.\"\n\nTrump again emphasized this view on Tuesday, again misspelling Stephanopoulos' surname. \"ABC, the home of George Slopadopolus, is not worthy of holding a Debate, of which I hope there will be many! MAGA2024,\" he said in another Truth Social post.\n\nBut later on Tuesday, during a conference call with the press, Trump told reporters that he \"would be willing to do more than one debate actually,\" according to Politico.

This came after he, and everyone else, learned that Joe Biden would no longer be the Democratic nominee.\n\nAt a minimum, Trump said, if there was to be a debate, it should be on Fox News.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Trump said he was willing to debate Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. In fact, Trump has said this repeatedly.\n\nIn a conference call with reporters, Trump said at one point: \"I would actually be willing to do more than one debate.\"\n\nHe also said, \"Yes, absolutely, I would and I think whether you're the Democratic or Republican candidate, you really have an obligation to debate and that's very important.\"\n\nHowever, Trump reiterated his concerns about the debate hosted by ABC News. He said: \"I'm not thrilled with ABC because of the fake news that I watched last night. They're actually trying to make Joe Biden a hero when he was the worst president in history, and they did things like with Kamala, like it's wonderful that she's running.\"\n\nHe added: \"I don't like the idea of the ABC.\"\n\nThe June 27 debate between Trump and Biden had considerable political repercussions. Biden's performance was so weak that it triggered the wave that pushed him out of the race.\n\nAlthough the debate is ultimately considered one of the most important in American political history, its audience was small compared to other recent presidential debates. Approximately 51.2 million viewers tuned in for the first debate, which was hosted by CNN and carried on all major news and cable networks.\n\nWhile 51 million viewers is a pretty big number, it's down 30% from the first 2020 debate between Biden and Trump, which drew over 73 million viewers. Fast forward four years to 2016, and a record 84 million viewers tuned in for the debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton.\n\nSo what might a Trump-Harris debate look like? It's hard to imagine the numbers coming close to those of Trump and Clinton, but it's possible that they could. Presumably, it would easily surpass the 51 million viewers who watched last month's Biden-Trump debate.\n\nBiden will address the nation tonight from the Oval Office to explain his decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, as well as, as he wrote in an article on X, what lies ahead and how I will finish the job for the American people.\n\nThe speech is scheduled for 8 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nBiden is in Delaware, self-isolating due to COVID-19. White House physician Dr. Kevin O'Connor released a statement Tuesday saying Biden had taken Paxlovid and had recovered, adding: \"During the course of his infection, he never developed a fever and his vital signs remained normal, including pulse oximetry. His lungs remained clear.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden was seen in public for the first time since announcing Sunday that he was dropping out of the race. Back in Washington, he gave reporters a thumbs-up and said, \"I feel great.\"\n\nHe didn't answer any questions.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris speaking in Wisconsin on Tuesday. (AP Photo/Kayla Wolf)\n\nKamala Harris delivered what amounted to her first presidential campaign speech on Tuesday, speaking to a receptive and enthusiastic crowd in the key swing state of Wisconsin.\n\nHarris has highlighted the contrast between herself and Trump, saying, for example, \"It's a choice between freedom and chaos.\" And \"In this campaign, I promise you that I will proudly compare my record to his any day of the week.\"\n\nBut there was another notable moment during Harris' speech.\n\nShe referred to what appears to be a questionable move by those who produced the 2025 Project, a nearly 900-page document that broadly outlines the agenda for the next Republican administration. Trump has tried to distance himself from it, but CNN's Steve Contorno recently reported that six of Trump's former cabinet secretaries helped write or collaborated on the 900-page playbook for a second Trump term, published by the Heritage Foundation. Four of Trump's ambassadorial appointees were also involved, as were several officials responsible for his controversial immigration crackdown. And about 20 pages are attributed to his first deputy chief of staff. In fact, at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration participated in the 2025 Project.\n\nHarris wasted no time on the campaign trail trying to draw a connection between Project 2025 and Trump. Then, in what appeared to be an off-the-cuff moment, she said of the document: \"Can you believe they put that in writing?\"\n\nHarris then cited some of the reasons why she thinks Project 2025 is so dangerous.\n\nI bring up the part about the 2025 project that is written because it is almost the same thing that someone allegedly said in a Washington Post article written by Josh Dawsey and Hannah Knowles on July 8. And who said it? A Trump adviser.\n\nIn the article, the anonymous adviser told the Post: \"It makes no sense to put down on paper all the crazy things you're going to be attacked for while you're running. Who thinks, let's put it all down on paper so we can be attacked in advance, even though we haven't submitted it to the president yet?\"\n\nDan Pfeiffer, a former adviser to former President Barack Obama, told the Washington Post: \"The 2025 project is a political gift from heaven. Donald Trump's political strength is that he is a Rorschach test for many voters, and the Heritage Foundation has done Democrats the favor of spelling out his agenda in incredibly clear and precise terms.\"\n\nAgain, this article is about the good humor of the Posts Dawsey and Knowles who wrote a few weeks ago that Project 2025 was something Democrats could attack. On Tuesday, in her first campaign speech, Harris did just that.\n\nIn recent days and weeks, figures including George Clooney and Barbra Streisand have weighed in on President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race and endorsed Kamala Harris for president.\n\nKid Rock and Hulk Hogan were both on stage at the Republican National Convention.\n\nSo it's clear that celebrity still matters when it comes to presidential politics.\n\nBut the big question now is whether the biggest celebrity of all time will use her powerful voice to influence the presidential race. In fact, the biggest question of all was the headline of Kase Wickman's Vanity Fair article: Will Taylor Swift Endorse Kamala Harris?\n\nDon't underestimate the influence the pop superstar could have. As Wickman noted, in 2023, Swift was named the fifth most powerful woman in the world by Forbes magazine. (Harris was third.)\n\nWickman wrote: \"Swift's support would be an incomparable asset to Harris's nascent 2024 campaign.\"\n\nSwift's voice resonates with millions of people, especially young women. She has the ability to influence a significant number of people, not only to vote, but also for Harris.\n\nIn 2020, Swift took aim at Trump in a tweet, writing, \"After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, do you have the nerve to feign moral supremacy before threatening violence? When the looting starts, the shootings start??? We will vote to impeach you in November.\" And she tagged Trump.\n\nThis tweet generated nearly 2 million likes.\n\nWickman wrote: \"So the world (and especially Democratic organizers) is waiting with bated breath to see if Swift will throw her considerable cultural weight behind Harris, the Democratic Party's newly crowned great hope. A Swifties for Harris account on X (formerly Twitter) has already been created, unaffiliated with Swift herself, and the Swifties are ready to do their leadership bidding in stilettos.\"\n\nCaitlin Clark, left, at Saturday's WNBA All-Star Game. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)\n\nThe WNBA, with the help of rookie star Caitlin Clark, continues to break television ratings records.\n\nLast Saturday's WNBA All-Star Game on ABC averaged 3.44 million viewers, making it the highest number of viewers ever for a WNBA All-Star Game. The previous record was in 2003, when 1.4 million viewers watched the game on ABC. That means this year's game saw a 139% increase over the previous record.\n\nThis year's All-Star Game was a bit of an odd one. It featured the U.S. Olympic team and the WNBA All-Stars who aren't on the national team. The WNBA team beat the Olympic team, 117-109. Clark, who plays for the WNBA team, scored just four points but led all players in scoring with 10 assists. Arike Ogunbowale, who plays for the WNBA team, led all teams in scoring with 34 points. Breanna Stewart led Team USA in scoring with 31 points.\n\nBut Clark's appearance in the match can't be stopped from increasing the record television audience.\n\nMicah Loewinger has been named co-host of WNYC's On the Media, the award-winning weekly public radio talk show and podcast that analyzes the media. He will join Brooke Gladstone, who has hosted the show for more than 20 years. Loewinger joined On the Media eight years ago as a producer and later became the show's first-ever reporter. He has also served as a guest host.\n\nHave feedback or advice? Email Poynter Media Editor Tom Jones at [email protected].\n\nThe Poynter Report is our daily newsletter.

The former Republican president worked from the assumption that he'd fare well against the Democratic incumbent -- and as it turned out, Biden's stumbles during his showdown with Trump were so significant that they helped push him from the 2024 race.\n\nIn theory, there's no need to dramatically alter the schedule, since the GOP nominee can simply debate Vice President Kamala Harris instead of Biden. In practice, it's proving to be a bit more complicated than that.\n\nA few hours after the incumbent president ended his re-election bid, Trump published an item to his social media platform, noting that the next debate is currently scheduled to air on ABC News in September. He apparently has a problem with that: The Republican called the network \"fake\"; he deliberately misspelled George Stephanopoulos' name in a juvenile way; and he concluded, \"I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC.\"\n\nSoon after, Politico reported, \"One GOP source tells me he doubts Trump will debate Vice President Kamala Harris -- he'll likely call her an illegitimate candidate.\"......\n\nSo, which is it? Will Trump face off against Harris, the likely Democratic nominee, or not?\n\nOne possibility is the former president is scared of the Californian and looking for excuses to bow out. Another possibility is that Trump is engaging in a mind-numbing \"work the refs\" exercise, whining incessantly about ABC, in part in the hopes that the network will tilt the debate in his favor and in part to preemptively have an excuse in case Harris fares well in an upcoming standoff.\n\nEither way, the Republican appears a lot less eager to share a stage with the incumbent vice president than he did with Biden.", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759911", "eventUri": "eng-9759911", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

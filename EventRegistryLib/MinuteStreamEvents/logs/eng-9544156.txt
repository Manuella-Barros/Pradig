The latest news on his recovery | Entertainment - ExBulletin", "body": "It's been nearly two weeks since the country music world last heard from breakout artist Colt Ford, and it's not entirely unexpected.\n\nWhen Ford spoke to fans on April 24 he did so from his hospital bed, and he was visibly weak and speaking softly. This was no surprise because, at that point, Ford had been hospitalized in Arizona for three weeks after collapsing following a show there in early April.\n\nThis week brought many revelations and, all things considered, it was a great week for Ford and his fans. And that's because the singer revealed to the world that he died twice after collapsing and that doctors gave him less than a 1% chance of surviving after bringing him back.\n\nFans have continued to send prayers and well wishes to Ford since he appeared on X, formerly Twitter, to address them. But, once again, everything has been calm since.\n\nSo how's Ford doing? What do we know about what has happened since then?\n\nWell, the answer is: not much more than what Ford left us that day. But Ford told fans he was going to have to take time, be selfish and try to heal when he left his video message.\n\nAgain, completely understandable.\n\nI just wanted to say to you guys, thank you everyone for all the prayers, the love, the comments, the messages, Ford said then. I still have a long way to go, but I promise you this old country boy will come back. It probably won't be this year, and I hate to have to miss all these shows, but I'll be back.\n\nThis happened after he called into the Big D & Bubba radio show on April 23 to talk about what happened to him.\n\nFord said he had just gotten back on his tour bus after playing at Dierks Bentleys Whiskey Row bar in Mesa, Arizona, when he texted his fianc\u00e9e, Hi baby.\n\nAnd then I dropped dead, he said.\n\nFord said luckily his group came to him and found him. And, he said, country music star Brantley Gilbert was involved in getting him to the hospital and, ultimately, making sure he was transferred to another hospital when the one where They found themselves did not have the proper equipment to deal with Ford's heart condition.\n\nHe said, I don't care what you do, take him to the other hospital, Ford said of Gilbert.\n\nFord said he died during transport to the other hospital.\n\nHowever, it wasn't just the revelation of death and return that got people talking. This was Ford's religious revelation in the days that followed.\n\nThey brought me back, he said on the Big D & Bubba show. They saved my life. The Lord had more to do for me.\n\nHe said one of his doctors told him they wouldn't have given him a 1% chance of living.\n\nHe said, 'I'd give you a 0.1 percent chance that you survived,'\" Ford said.\n\nI had so much trauma in my body and in my heart, he said. I had three stents installed (in my heart).\n\nThe trauma his fans continue to pray over will be healed as they look forward to the next update from Ford himself.\n\nFord, who has worked closely with Toby Keith, Jamey Johnson and Jason Aldean, has had his share of health issues. Taste of Country reported last year that he was battling myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease.\n\nHe also reportedly had eye cancer and required surgery three years ago to correct it.\n\nFord, whose real name is Jason Farris Brown, is a former professional golfer. He has released eight studio albums, the first of which was released in 2008, and his most recent, Must Be Country, released in 2023.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_Ford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colt Ford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brantley_Gilbert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brantley Gilbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Talk radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mesa, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mesa, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamey_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamey Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_Keith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toby Keith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Aldean", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Aldean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myasthenia_gravis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myasthenia gravis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townsquare_Media", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Townsquare Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autoimmune disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_golfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional golfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/dailyitem.com/content/tncms/custom/image/49694cfa-ad01-11e7-9c96-3b6781bae985.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544156", "eventUri": "eng-9544156", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 162, "textEnd": 170}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-23", "textStart": 1522, "textEnd": 1530}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

The artist said during an April 23 interview on the \"Big D & Bubba\" syndicated radio show that he essentially died twice. However, he was brought back to life in the intensive care unit at the Banner Desert Medical Center in Mesa, Arizona.\n\nFord said doctors initially told him he had a 0.1% chance of surviving in his condition, but he said, \"God couldn't have had me in a better place.\"\n\nThe country star believes the Lord gave him a chance to live in order to use him to do even more great things through God's divine plan.\n\n\"The Lord had more for me to do, more music for me to make, hopefully more differences to make in some people's lives,\" Ford said on the show. \"It's been life-changing. It's been spiritually changing. Obviously, it's been physically changing.\"\n\nEven though he survived, doctors told him he needs to prioritize his health as he is on the road of recovery.\n\nOn the night of the incident, Ford said he doesn't remember having performed. But, memories of him walking back to his bus and sending a text to his fianc\u00e9e came back to him after the incident.\n\n\"I walked back to the bus, texted my fianc\u00e9e, 'Hi baby,' and fell over dead,\" he said. \"I died two times. Luckily, my band came out to check on me.\"\n\nFord said if he had his heart attack in a different location, he probably would not have been able to receive the medical attention he required to survive.\n\nFord didn't shy away from his faith even before the health scare.\n\n\"Colt Ford is about God, family, friends, and America,\" the performer states on his official bio. \"I'm just a guy who loves life.

It is caused by a defect in the action of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions.\n\nThe autoimmune disorder mainly affects his face, eyes and throat.\n\n\"It hadn't really affected my throat, but it really affected my eye,\" Ford told Taste of Country last May.\n\n\"[I] had no control over my right eye. It really messes with your vision,\" he added.\n\n\"I could see perfectly out of either eye, but then I would look together, and I'd see three of you, and you would be melting together like a lava lamp.\"", "source": {"uri": "christianpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_Ford", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colt Ford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_rap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Country rap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intensive care unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dierks_Bentley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dierks Bentley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_syndication", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broadcast syndication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talk radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mesa, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mesa, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gilbert, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gilbert, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular_junction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neuromuscular junction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acetylcholine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myasthenia_gravis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myasthenia gravis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atrophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townsquare_Media", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Townsquare Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autoimmune disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/original/thumbnail/25/93/259351.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544156", "eventUri": "eng-9544156", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-05", "textStart": 226, "textEnd": 233}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-23", "textStart": 338, "textEnd": 346}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

It's a place where you get the strength to go on,\" said Henry Ford, pioneer of modern motoring and manufacturing -- and a house and home obsessive.\n\nWhile we are all somewhat guilty of striving to recapture past memories through our homes, furnishing and interior choices, Ford took built nostalgia to extremes, not only through the vast house he made for himself and the dozens of homes he bought, but also his rude interventions into the private homes of his own workers and those of his family.\n\nHis obsession with households would produce a 'Neverland'-style nostalgia village and a vast dystopia of sepia-tinted Americana recreated in the middle of an Amazonian jungle.\n\nFord was house-mad. And he wanted to own everyone else's house too.\n\nThis year, after more than a decade of restoration work (phase one cost \u20ac35m), the doors of Ford's Fair Lane mansion will finally open some of its interior rooms to the public for the first time.\n\nIn its day, the 56-room, 31,770 sq ft mansion completed in 1915 at Dearborn in Michigan was one of the largest private homes America had ever seen and was certainly one of the most unusual.\n\nIts internal floor spaces are the equivalent of 32 average Irish family abodes.\n\nFor its design, he hired Frank Lloyd Wright, who was sketching it in his famous Prairie style as early as 1908.\n\nLater, the project was passed to industrial designer William Van Tine. After Ford and his wife Clara returned from a trip to Europe, Van Tine was ordered to throw in a load of hokey Tudor flourishes.\n\nVan Tine departed the project before completion and Joseph Nathaniel French was brought in for the finish.\n\nThe result is a lumpen mish-mash monstrosity of a limestone exterior, but with enthralling interiors -- likely thanks to the influences of Ford's wife.\n\nBut before starting construction on his Fair Lane dream home, Ford first had a mission to undertake in Ireland to locate its first building block.\n\nOn an evening in August 1912, Ford, with his long-suffering son Edsel in tow, could be found rummaging in a ruin in a field in remote Ballinascarthy, Co Cork.\n\nWith four walls standing, these were the ruins of his grandfather's modest birthplace.\n\nAlready one of the richest men in America, Ford had been spurned by three local bachelor farmer brothers in his attempt to buy the ruin.\n\nLocal legend has it that the brothers conferred with the parish priest, who told them to hold out for more money, judging that Ford could be milked for extra cash.\n\nNever one to be taken for a ride, Ford returned to the homestead, extracted the hearthstone and made off with it.\n\nThey never saw him again. The stone would be installed like a talisman the following year in the rising walls of Fair Lane.\n\nHe couldn't have the ruin shipped back to the States, but he could steal back the home's hearth.\n\nToday, Fair Lane (named after the Cork City street on which his maternal grandfather was born) provides a fascinating journey into the psyche of an American legend, illuminating his darker sides as much as his genius.\n\nFollowing the success of his Model T, Ford had transformed his previously sleepy town of Dearborn into a vast, smoke-belching industrial complex.\n\nHis River Rouge factory was the largest factory in the world at a mile wide by a mile-and-a-half long, and employed 100,000 at its peak.\n\nIronically, Ford would despise the brave new world he had created and over the next decades would disappear down a self-made rabbit hole, devoted to recreating a domestic-past idyll of home experiences that he pined after.\n\nAt Fair Lane, there were seven bedrooms, but 15 baths. Ford installed 13,750 sq ft of solid oak herringbone floors.\n\nIn an effort to keep Edsel at home, Ford built an indoor pool complex, a billiards room and even a bowling alley, all favoured pursuits of Edsel's.\n\nFor green-fingered Clara, there were vast rose gardens and conservatories. Despite Clara's deft touch, many of the interiors feature comically-outsized chimneypieces and fireplaces straight from scenes in Citizen Kane (ironic that Rosebud Ltd is involved in the restoration today).\n\nIn the grounds, he installed a hydraulic power station by Edison, a laboratory and garage.\n\nAt Fair Lane, Ford escaped from his vast factory (run by Edsel) to a fantasy domain of vast domestic projects.\n\nOn its grounds, he recreated a working farm using old-fashioned methods just like the Ford family holding of his youth.\n\nIn 1919, he got to work on the modest white clapboard farm house at Springwells, Michigan, in which he was born; trying desperately to restore it exactly as it was.\n\nHe sent agents around the world scouring exact versions of the original furniture as he remembered it.\n\nFinding broken shards of crockery in the garden, he had experts make replica sets of his mother's dinner service and had it stacked on a faithfully-reproduced dresser exactly as she did.\n\nFord also began intervening in the homes of his workers.\n\nCompany officials visited to ensure the houses adhered to a list of Ford's demands on tidiness and living arrangements, to see whether they had lodgers and even whether the homes contained bottles of wine or alcohol.\n\nA corrections list was supplied to transgressors. Put on half-wages until the next visit, failure to comply got them fired.\n\nEven Edsel, by now the Ford company president, wasn't immune.\n\nHis father would break into his son's house and later admonish Edsel for leisure aspects and drinks cabinets, which he would smash up with his walking cane.\n\nEventually, Ford's nostalgic retreat world at Fair Lane wasn't enough. He wanted the town of his childhood back, so he got going on a bigger Neverland.\n\nHis Greenfield Village project at Dearborn commenced in 1929.\n\nFord began acquiring and moving period homes and buildings of his childhood era to this site. Today, there are more than 80 buildings here.\n\nHe disassembled the house he was born in and had it rebuilt at Greenfield. He bought his childhood school house and moved it there, along with his favourite teacher's house.\n\nHe moved his father's barn there and began acquiring other historic homes.\n\nThese included Orville and Wilbur Wright's childhood home, their bicycle shop and even the Wright's domestic garden shed.\n\nIncreasingly, Ford 'lived' at Greenfield during the day. The shops and buildings were staffed up for his benefit.\n\nLater, he admitted the public to appreciate the recreation of a lost world he had destroyed.\n\nFinally, he would scale up yet again with Fordl\u00e2ndia, what some described as a 'corporate country' that Henry created from scratch deep in the jungle of the Amazon.\n\nEager to cultivate rubber for his cars, Ford negotiated the purchase of 5,500 square miles of jungle from the Brazilian authorities with the plan of building a rubber plantation and an industrial town.\n\nWith specially-designed ships, he began to transport the components for an entire American-style town with traditional houses, a caf\u00e9, a dance hall, shops, administrative town buildings and the materials to build a swimming pool and golf course.\n\nAll sailed from America to Brazil and then up the Amazon. A US State Department official was told by Ford that the project was not a rubber plantation but a \"work of civilization\".\n\nHundreds of workers arrived to start burning off the jungle with industrial flamethrowers. But Ford's olde worlde American town houses were not suited to the climate. His domestic interventions angered his Brazilian workers.\n\nFord had stipulated a diet they weren't familiar with and banned soccer in favour of square dancing (for which he laid on classes).\n\nStress built up until a fight erupted over new rules about how food was served at the restaurant.\n\nThe native workers erupted and chased the Ford management into the jungle with machetes before returning to Fordl\u00e2ndia to destroy its buildings.\n\nFord had to use a Pan Am contact to provide planes to get the Brazilian army down there to retake the town.\n\nNo rubber was ever produced at Fordl\u00e2ndia and eventually it was abandoned at a loss equivalent today of about $350m.\n\nAt his 75th birthday party in 1938, at which he received an award sent by Hitler (Ford's antisemitic book The International Jew partly inspired Mein Kampf), hundreds turned out to celebrate Henry's life.\n\nBut the motor magnate looked uncomfortable. He yearned to escape and go back in time, so he quietly slipped away to spend the rest of the day at Greenfield Village.\n\nWhat is perhaps ironic is that dozens of experts are today employed at Fair Lane, just like the ones Ford once hired to furnish it; to go forth and seek out wholly authentic furniture and fittings and recreate perfect Ford reproductions from old photos taken inside Fair Lane in the 1920's. So that yet another old house can be artificially regenerated with pristine accuracy to take us back in time. And at massive expense.

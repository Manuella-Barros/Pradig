But the EPA has been slower to act, frustrating some environmental and public health advocates.\n\nIn an interview, Freedhoff said that EPA scientists have tried for years to get more information on health risks from the sole manufacturer of the pesticide, AMVAC Chemical. But she said the company refused to turn over the data, including a study on the effects of DCPA on thyroid development and function, until November 2023.\n\n\"We did make some good-faith efforts to work with the company,\" Freedhoff said. \"But in the end, we didn't think any of the measures proposed by the company would be implementable, enforceable or effective.\"\n\nAMVAC, which sells the pesticide under the brand name Dacthal, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe company had sought to avoid the emergency action. In December, AMVAC voluntarily pulled all Dacthal used on turf, reducing the risks to golfers, other athletes and workers who maintain turf fields.\n\nBut in a March letter to AMVAC, EPA officials wrote that this voluntary step was not sufficient to protect farmworkers and others exposed to the herbicide. The officials wrote that changes to thyroid hormone levels in the fetuses of pregnant rats exposed to DCPA suggested \"serious risks of concern in humans.\"\n\nDCPA has been used in the United States since the late 1950s. After the pesticide is applied, it can linger in the soil, contaminating crops later grown in those fields, including broccoli, cilantro, green onions, kale and mustard greens.\n\nIn 2017, the Agriculture Department identified DCPA residue on nearly 6 in 10 kale samples it tested. The agency also found the pesticide on many collard green and mustard green samples.\n\nIn April, the EPA warned farmworkers about the risks of DCPA, saying it planned to take emergency action \"as quickly as possible.\" The emergency order Tuesday temporarily suspends all registrations of the pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. The agency plans to permanently suspend these registrations within the next 90 days.\n\nMily Trevi\u00f1o Sauceda, executive director of Alianza Nacional de Campesinas, also known as the National Farmworkers Women's Alliance, praised the agency's action Tuesday, calling it \"a great first step\" to protect the reproductive health of farmworkers.\n\nBut Jeannie Economos, coordinator of the pesticide safety and environmental health program at the Farmworker Association of Florida, said the emergency order came too late for workers who have been exposed to DCPA for decades.\n\n\"It shouldn't have taken this long, but we are glad that they did it finally,\" she said. \"How many people got sick in the meantime? How many babies were born with low birth weight? We don't know.\"\n\nEconomos said she hopes the EPA will ban more widely used, harmful pesticides and that the industry will move away from toxic agrochemicals.\n\n\"We cannot keep going this way because we're hurting farmworkers, wildlife, the planet and ourselves,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pesticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Herbicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyl_tetrachloroterephthalate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_hormones", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thyroid hormones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabbage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabbage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_sprout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brussels sprout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaceae", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poaceae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Onion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broccoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broccoli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fetus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low birth weight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thyroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica_juncea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brassica juncea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Insecticide,_Fungicide,_and_Rodenticide_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scallion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Non-Toxic_Living", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Non-Toxic Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.adn.com/resizer//G86RnUvViMN3234kcIKi7Xh3oy4=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/LYGNLHKDGCKQLRJNOX7AU4DDGE.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795302", "eventUri": "eng-9795302", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

This marked the first time the EPA has employed such emergency measures in nearly four decades.\n\nThe suspension came after years of efforts by the Biden-Harris Administration to assess and address the dangers posed by DCPA.

This is the first time in almost 40 years the EPA has taken this type of emergency action, following several years of unprecedented efforts by the Biden-Harris Administration to require the submission of long-overdue data, and then assess and address the risk the pesticide poses.\n\nThe EPA has taken this action because unborn babies whose pregnant mothers are exposed to DCPA, sometimes without even knowing the exposure has occurred, could experience changes to fetal thyroid-hormone levels, and these changes are generally linked to small birth weight, impaired brain development, decreased IQ, and impaired motor skills later in life, some of which may be irreversible.\n\n\"DCPA is so dangerous that it needs to be removed from the market immediately,\" said Michal Freedhoff, assistant administrator for the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention. \"It's EPA's job to protect people from exposure to dangerous chemicals. In this case, pregnant women who may never even know they were exposed could give birth to babies that experience irreversible lifelong health problems. That's why for the first time in almost 40 years, EPA is using its emergency suspension authority to stop the use of a pesticide.\"\n\nDCPA is a pesticide registered to control weeds in both agricultural and non-agricultural settings, but is primarily used on crops such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage and onions. DCPA is currently undergoing registration review, a process that requires reevaluating registered pesticides every 15 years to ensure they cause no unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment.\n\nIn deciding whether to issue the Emergency Order, the EPA consulted with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to understand how growers use DCPA and alternatives to the pesticide. In 2013 the agency issued a Data Call-In to AMVAC Chemical Corporation, the sole manufacturer of DCPA, requiring it to submit more than 20 studies to support the existing registrations of DCPA.\n\nThe required data included a comprehensive study of the effects of DCPA on thyroid development and function in adults and in developing young before and after birth, that was due by January 2016. Several of the studies that AMVAC submitted from 2013-2021 were considered insufficient to address the Data Call-In. And the thyroid study and other studies were not submitted at all.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nDewormers losing effectiveness in sheep, goats Missouri State Fair a mix of old and new Rainfall may have unfavorable effects on pastureland and cattle Cattle expansion has not started Ag Valley Co-op expands grain storage capacity with new Chief Agri bin in Maywood, Nebraska Flagship of Blackburn Manufacturing's success is customers and employees Grandpa's childhood tractor becomes Wayne County 4-H project Never a dull moment Dairy farmers run small-town ice cream institution West River heartstrings Study: 24% of Illinois farmland owned by farmers Grateful for every drop of rain in western Nebraska Farmer finds success in manure management Way We Live: Everyone plays a part on the farm Spring wheat market takes path of least resistance\n\nThe EPA issued in April 2022 a rarely used Notice of Intent to Suspend the DCPA technical-grade product in based on AMVAC's failure to submit the complete set of required data for almost 10 years, including the thyroid study. AMVAC then submitted the required thyroid study in August 2022 but the EPA suspended the registration Aug. 22, 2023, based solely on AMVAC's continued failure to submit other outstanding data, following an administrative hearing. In November 2023 the data-submission suspension was lifted after AMVAC submitted sufficient data. Most DCPA use on turf was voluntarily canceled by AMVAC in December 2023, but unacceptable risks from other uses remained.\n\nThe EPA released in May 2023 its assessment on the risks of occupational and residential exposure to products containing DCPA, following its analysis of the thyroid study submitted by AMVAC. The assessment found health risks associated with DCPA use and application, even when personal protective equipment and engineering controls are used. The most serious risks are to the unborn babies of pregnant individuals. The EPA estimates that some pregnant individuals handling DCPA products could be subjected to exposures four to 20 times greater than what the EPA has estimated is safe for unborn babies.\n\nAlso of concern are risks to unborn babies of pregnant individuals entering or working in areas where DCPA has already been applied -especially post-application workers involved in tasks such as transplanting, weeding and harvesting. Current product labels specify that entry into treated fields must be restricted for 12 hours after application. But the evidence indicates that for many crops and tasks, levels of DCPA in a treated field remain at unsafe levels for 25 days or more. Spray drift - the movement of pesticide through the air at the time of application or soon after, to any site other than the area intended - from pesticide application could also put at risk the unborn babies of pregnant individuals living near areas where DCPA is used.\n\nSince the release of EPA's 2023 assessment, AMVAC has proposed several changes to the DCPA registrations, including the cancellation of DCPA products registered for use on turf. Those cancellations practically eliminate exposures to DCPA from recreational activities on and around turf. But according to the EPA's analysis, AMVAC's proposed changes to agricultural uses of DCPA do not adequately address the serious health risks for people who work with and around DCPA.\n\nThe EPA issued in April 2024 a public warning regarding the significant health risks to unborn babies of pregnant individuals exposed to DCPA and its intent to pursue action to address the serious, and in some instances permanent, and irreversible health risks associated with the pesticide as quickly as possible. In a letter to AMVAC dated March 27, 2024, the EPA restated the risks the agency found and noted that the agency would be pursuing regulatory options as soon as possible - which could include canceling the pesticide or seeking an emergency suspension.\n\nWhen serious risks are identified, the EPA can take action under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act to suspend or cancel a pesticide. Taking such action is resource- and time-intensive, partly due to the procedural requirements of the act. A cancelation proceeding may take at least several months - if uncontested by the registrant - or potentially several years - if contested by the registrant thus triggering an administrative hearing and any subsequent appeal of a cancellation order. The act also allows the EPA to seek a suspension of a pesticide product while cancelation proceedings are ongoing if the administrator determines it's necessary to prevent an imminent hazard. EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan has determined that, due to the serious and imminent harm posed by DCPA, an emergency exists such that this order of suspension effective immediately is necessary. The EPA intends to issue a notice of intent to cancel the DCPA products within the next 90 days.\n\nThe Emergency Order is effective immediately. The EPA has determined that the continued sale and use of DCPA products during the time it would take to follow the normal cancelation process poses an imminent hazard to unborn babies. While AMVAC has attempted to address these concerns, the EPA has determined there are no practical mitigation measures that can be put in place to allow DCPA's continued use.\n\nVisit

Truman.\n\nThis decision by the EPA arrived due to the fact, the federal agency says, evidence is indicating how pregnant women exposed to the DCPA pesticide can possibly lead to irreversible fetus damage when exposed in utero, with changes linked to it like low birth weight, impaired brain development, decreased IQ and impaired motor skills later in life, some of which may be irreversible.\n\nNearly 20% of fresh, frozen and canned fruits and vegetables that Americans eat contain concerning levels of pesticides, a new report finds.\n\nFarmworkers, in particular, face burdensome conditions in the fields and often face exposure to harmful pesticides while working to feed others, according to Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz.., who hailed Tuesday's EPA action which he says \"prioritizes farmworker health and safety, especially for pregnant women, by suspending this harmful chemical from our agricultural systems.\"\n\nIt comes after \"unprecedented efforts\" by the White House over the last few years to get what it called \"long-overdue\" data on the pesticide from its sole manufacturer, U.S- based AMVAC Chemical Corporation, in order to assess its overall risk.\n\nIn April of 2022, the Biden EPA issued the hardly-used Notice of Intent to Suspend DCPA based on AMVAC's failure to submit the complete set of required data almost 10 years after the EPA's 2013 request and January 2016 due date for the new data went unanswered. By April this year, the EPA was warning farmworkers about the risks of the pesticide as it reveled the government agency was developing \"next steps\" to address the risks of Dacthal.\n\n\"We must continue to build on this progress and ensure all farmworkers are given the protection, worker's rights, and overtime pay they deserve,\" said Grijalva.\n\nThe EPA says it consulted with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to better understand how growers use DCPA and its likely alternatives to the pesticide.\n\nIt was first introduced in 1958 to control weeds in agricultural and non-agricultural settings for crops such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage and onions, according to an EPA report.\n\n\"This emergency decision is a great first step that we hope will be in a series of others that are based on listening to farmworkers, protecting our reproductive health, and safeguarding our families,\" Mily Trevi\u00f1o Sauceda, executive director of Alianza Nacional de Campesinas, said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_benson@yahoo.com", "name": "Chris Benson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pesticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyl_tetrachloroterephthalate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra\u00fal_Grijalva", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ra\u00fal Grijalva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low birth weight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry S.

This is the first time in almost 40 years EPA has taken this type of emergency action, following several years of unprecedented efforts by the Biden-Harris Administration to require the submission of long-overdue data and then assess and address the risk this pesticide poses.\n\nEPA has taken this action because unborn babies whose pregnant mothers are exposed to DCPA, sometimes without even knowing the exposure has occurred, could experience changes to fetal thyroid hormone levels, and these changes are generally linked to low birth weight, impaired brain development, decreased IQ, and impaired motor skills later in life, some of which may be irreversible.\n\n\"DCPA is so dangerous that it needs to be removed from the market immediately,\" said Assistant Administrator for the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention Michal Freedhoff. \"It's EPA's job to protect people from exposure to dangerous chemicals. In this case, pregnant women who may never even know they were exposed could give birth to babies that experience irreversible lifelong health problems. That's why for the first time in almost 40 years, EPA is using its emergency suspension authority to stop the use of a pesticide.\"\n\n\"Farmworkers face burdensome conditions in the fields and often face exposure to harmful pesticides while working to feed our nation. I applaud the emergency action by the EPA which prioritizes farmworker health and safety, especially for pregnant women, by suspending this harmful chemical from our agricultural systems. We must continue to build on this progress and ensure all farmworkers are given the protection, worker's rights, and overtime pay they deserve,\" said Congressman Ra\u00fal Grijalva (AZ-07).\n\n\"Alianza is pleased to see the EPA make this historic decision. As an organization led by farmworker women, we know intimately the harm that pesticides, including dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA or Dacthal), can inflict on our bodies and communities. This emergency decision is a great first step that we hope will be in a series of others that are based on listening to farmworkers, protecting our reproductive health, and safeguarding our families,\" said Mily Trevi\u00f1o Sauceda, Executive Director of Alianza Nacional de Campesinas.\n\nBackground on DCPA and Biden-Harris Administration Efforts to Assess and Address Risks\n\nDCPA is a pesticide registered to control weeds in both agricultural and non-agricultural settings, but is primarily used on crops such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage and onions. DCPA is currently undergoing registration review, a process that requires reevaluating registered pesticides every 15 years to ensure they cause no unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment.\n\nIn deciding whether to issue today's Emergency Order, EPA consulted with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to understand how growers use DCPA and alternatives to this pesticide. In 2013, the agency issued a Data Call-In (DCI) to AMVAC Chemical Corporation, the sole manufacturer of DCPA, requiring it to submit more than 20 studies to support the existing registrations of DCPA. The required data included a comprehensive study of the effects of DCPA on thyroid development and function in adults and in developing young before and after birth, that was due by January 2016. Several of the studies that AMVAC submitted from 2013-2021 were considered insufficient to address the DCI, while the thyroid study and other studies were not submitted at all.\n\nIn April 2022, EPA issued a very rarely used Notice of Intent to Suspend the DCPA technical-grade product (used to manufacture end-use products) based on AMVAC's failure to submit the complete set of required data for almost 10 years, including the thyroid study. While AMVAC submitted the required thyroid study in August 2022, EPA suspended the registration based solely on AMVAC's continued failure to submit other outstanding data on Aug. 22, 2023, following an administrative hearing. In November 2023, the data submission suspension was lifted after AMVAC submitted sufficient data. Most DCPA use on turf was voluntarily canceled by AMVAC in December 2023, but unacceptable risks from other uses remained.\n\nIn May 2023, EPA released its assessment on the risks of occupational and residential exposure to products containing DCPA, following its analysis of the thyroid study submitted by AMVAC. The assessment found health risks associated with DCPA use and application, even when personal protective equipment and engineering controls are used. The most serious risks are to the unborn babies of pregnant individuals. EPA estimates that some pregnant individuals handling DCPA products could be subjected to exposures four to 20 times greater than what EPA has estimated is safe for unborn babies.\n\nAlso of concern are risks to unborn babies of pregnant individuals entering or working in areas where DCPA has already been applied (especially post-application workers involved in tasks such as transplanting, weeding and harvesting). Current product labels specify that entry into treated fields must be restricted for 12 hours after application. However, the evidence indicates that for many crops and tasks, levels of DCPA in a treated field remain at unsafe levels for 25 days or more. Spray drift (the movement of pesticide through the air at the time of application or soon after, to any site other than the area intended) from pesticide application could also put at risk the unborn babies of pregnant individuals living near areas where DCPA is used.\n\nSince the release of EPA's 2023 assessment, AMVAC has proposed several changes to the DCPA registrations, including the cancellation of DCPA products registered for use on turf. Those cancellations practically eliminate exposures to DCPA from recreational activities on and around turf. But according to EPA's analysis, AMVAC's proposed changes to agricultural uses of DCPA do not adequately address the serious health risks for people who work with and around DCPA.\n\nIn April 2024, EPA issued a public warning regarding the significant health risks to unborn babies of pregnant individuals exposed to DCPA and its intent to pursue action to address the serious, and in some instances, permanent, and irreversible health risks associated with the pesticide as quickly as possible. In a letter to AMVAC dated March 27, 2024, EPA restated the risks the agency found and noted that the agency would be pursuing regulatory options as soon as possible which could include cancelling the pesticide or seeking an emergency suspension.\n\nWhen serious risks are identified, EPA can take action under FIFRA to suspend or cancel a pesticide. Taking such action is resource and time intensive, partly due to the procedural requirements of FIFRA. A cancellation proceeding may take at least several months (if uncontested by the registrant) or potentially several years (if contested by the registrant, thus triggering an administrative hearing and any subsequent appeal of a cancellation order). FIFRA also allows EPA to seek a suspension of a pesticide product while cancellation proceedings are ongoing if the Administrator determines it is necessary to prevent an imminent hazard. EPA Administrator Regan has determined that, due to the serious and imminent harm posed by DCPA, an emergency exists such that this order of suspension effective immediately is necessary. EPA intends to issue a notice of intent to cancel the DCPA products within the next 90 days.\n\nThe Emergency Order is effective immediately. EPA determined that the continued sale and use of DCPA products during the time it would take to follow the normal cancellation process poses an imminent hazard to unborn babies. While AMVAC has attempted to address these concerns, EPA has determined there are no practical mitigation measures that can be put in place to allow DCPA's continued use.", "source": {"uri": "epa.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "US EPA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Insecticide,_Fungicide,_and_Rodenticide_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmworker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Farmworker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thyroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suspension (chemistry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pesticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_hormones", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thyroid hormones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra\u00fal_Grijalva", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ra\u00fal Grijalva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Low birth weight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_skill", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motor skill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence quotient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Occupational safety and health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fetus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabbage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabbage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_sprout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brussels sprout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaceae", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poaceae"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Non-Toxic_Living", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Non-Toxic Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-news-releases-twitter.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795302", "eventUri": "eng-9795302", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 20, "textEnd": 26}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-01-", "textStart": 3579, "textEnd": 3591}], "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

Pregnant women in many cases may not have known they were exposed, Freedhoff said.\n\nThe emergency action comes after the sole manufacturer of the pesticide, AMVAC Chemical Corporation, failed to provide sufficient data on DCPA and its health risks, according to the statement. The company did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nThe EPA first identified this pesticide as potentially causing harm to the thyroid in the 1990s, according to the advocacy organization the Environmental Working Group. By then, the agency reported that 80% of DCPA use occurred on turf grass, like golf courses and private lawns.\n\nIn 2023, the EPA released an assessment of the pesticide, concluding it was linked to health risks, especially for pregnant women, even when people exposed to it were using personal protective equipment. The agency said pregnant women may have been exposed to levels of DCPA up to 20 times greater than what the EPA estimates are safe for fetuses.\n\nAlthough the manufacturer AMVAC proposed changes, the EPA said those changes did not \"adequately address\" the serious health risks for people who work with and around DCPA.\n\nMily Trevi\u00f1o Sauceda, executive director of Alianza Nacional de Campesinas, an organization representing women farmworkers, said the group is pleased to see the EPA make this historic decision as a \"great first step\" to protecting farmworkers.\n\n\"EPA knew that DCPA was harming farmworkers and their children, and we're glad that EPA recognized that that harm to this population group required immediate suspension or removal of this toxic pesticide,\" said Sylvia Wu, an attorney with the Center for Food Safety, which has advocated for the EPA to stop the use of DCPA.\n\nAdrianna Rodriguez can be reached at adrodriguez@usatoday.com.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: EPA bans Dacthal, herbicide harmful to fetuses in emergency action", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pesticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fetus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Low birth weight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence quotient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uterus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyl_tetrachloroterephthalate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Working_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmental Working Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabbage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabbage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_sprout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brussels sprout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thyroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawn", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Onion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broccoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broccoli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmworker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Farmworker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suspension (chemistry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Herbicide"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Agrochemicals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Agrochemicals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Pests_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Pests and Diseases", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Environmental_Health", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Environmental Health", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Biologicals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Biologicals", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Environmental_Compliance", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Environmental Compliance", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dPPxf2pE6lVs1t2Sc4.RpQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03ODA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_usatoday_us_articles_590/6ba78273a83ff012fc14aa4bfda9a5cc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795302", "eventUri": "eng-9795302", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

It's commonly applied to grasses, artificial turf, crops including strawberries, cotton and field beans and vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage and onions.\n\nThe agency cited \"serious risks\" to unborn babies of pregnant women who are exposed to the chemical including living in or around areas where Dacthal has been used. Some pregnant people who handle DCPA products could be exposed to levels that are four to 20 times higher than what the EPA considers safe for unborn babies.\n\nAlthough product labels advise restricted entry into fields for 12 hours after application, there is evidence that DCPA levels may remain unsafe for 25 days or more, the agency said.\n\nExposure can alter fetal thyroid hormone levels, a change linked to low birth weight, impaired brain development, decreased IQ and impaired motor skills later in life, according to the EPA.\n\n\"DCPA is so dangerous that it needs to be removed from the market immediately,\" Michal Freedhoff, assistant administrator for the agency's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, said in a news release. \"It's EPA's job to protect people from exposure to dangerous chemicals. In this case, pregnant women who may never even know they were exposed could give birth to babies that experience irreversible lifelong health problems.\"\n\nIssues with Dacthal were flagged in 2013 after the EPA called on AMVAC Chemical Corp. - the sole producer of Dacthal - to submit evidence supporting its continued registration for human use. Much of the research submitted was deemed insufficient, and key studies, including those on thyroid effects, were missing. Despite AMVAC's later compliance and voluntary cancellation of Dacthal on artificial turf, the EPA found the risks \"unacceptable\" and changes the company proposed as \"not adequately addressing the serious health risks for people who work with and around DCPA.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter\n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn September, the EPA suspended the product after AMVAC failed to submit data to support its continued registration.

It's commonly applied to grasses, artificial turf, crops including strawberries, cotton and field beans and vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage and onions.\n\nThe agency cited \"serious risks\" to unborn babies of pregnant women who are exposed to the chemical including living in or around areas where Dacthal has been used. Some pregnant people who handle DCPA products could be exposed to levels that are four to 20 times higher than what the EPA considers safe for unborn babies.\n\nAlthough product labels advise restricted entry into fields for 12 hours after application, there is evidence that DCPA levels may remain unsafe for 25 days or more, the agency said.\n\nExposure can alter fetal thyroid hormone levels, a change linked to low birth weight, impaired brain development, decreased IQ and impaired motor skills later in life, according to the EPA.\n\n\"DCPA is so dangerous that it needs to be removed from the market immediately,\" Michal Freedhoff, assistant administrator for the agency's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, said in a news release. \"It's EPA's job to protect people from exposure to dangerous chemicals. In this case, pregnant women who may never even know they were exposed could give birth to babies that experience irreversible lifelong health problems.\"\n\nIssues with Dacthal were flagged in 2013 after the EPA called on AMVAC Chemical Corp. - the sole producer of Dacthal - to submit evidence supporting its continued registration for human use. Much of the research submitted was deemed insufficient, and key studies, including those on thyroid effects, were missing. Despite AMVAC's later compliance and voluntary cancellation of Dacthal on artificial turf, the EPA found the risks \"unacceptable\" and changes the company proposed as \"not adequately addressing the serious health risks for people who work with and around DCPA.\"\n\nIn September, the EPA suspended the product after AMVAC failed to submit data to support its continued registration. In April, the agency further warned farmworkers, specifically pregnant women, about risks of Dacthal.\n\nTuesday's emergency order is effective immediately, and the EPA intends to issue a notice of intent to cancel DCPA products within the next 90 days, according to the warning.\n\nAMVAC did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\n\nMily Trevi\u00f1o Sauceda, executive director of Alianza Nacional de Campesinas, the National Farmworkers Women's Alliance, said in the EPA's news release that the organization is pleased about the \"historic decision.\"\n\n\"As an organization led by farmworker women, we know intimately the harm that pesticides, including dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA or Dacthal), can inflict on our bodies and communities. This emergency decision is a great first step that we hope will be in a series of others that are based on listening to farmworkers, protecting our reproductive health, and safeguarding our families.\"\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

The pesticide, dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate (known as DCPA or Dacthal), is believed to cause serious birth defects in unborn children. DCPA is used as a weed-killer, particularly around crops such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage and onions, and its residue can linger on crops, according to The Washington Post.\n\nIn a news release, the agency said that it had made \"unprecedented efforts\" to gain information about the safety of the product from its manufacturer, AMVAC Chemical Corporation. According to the EPA, it had been asking for information about the pesticide since 2013, and AMVAC did not provide requested data in some cases and in others provided studies deemed \"insufficient.\" In December 2023, AMVAC voluntarily halted its use on turf, such as athletic fields.\n\n\"DCPA is so dangerous that it needs to be removed from the market immediately,\" said Michal Freedhoff, assistant administrator for the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, the EPA office responsible for the emergency action. The agency last used its emergency suspension powers in 1986, to ban the herbicide Dinoseb, which was believed to cause birth defects and sterility in farm workers.\n\nThe EPA assessed that DCPA creates health risks for anyone working in fields treated with it, and the risk is most acute for unborn children of pregnant women. The chemical is believed to interfere with fetal thyroid hormone levels, which can cause low birth weight, impaired brain development, and other issues, which may be irreversible. The EPA also found that pregnant individuals handling DCPA products may be exposed to levels four to 20 times greater than what the agency estimates is safe for unborn babies.\n\nAs with product recalls, a measure like this requires companies--in this case any farms that may have been using the chemical--to be transparent with their customers and take immediate action to halt its use.

A 2019 study led by scientists at the University of California at Berkeley School of Public Health found that more than half of adolescent women from farmworker communities in the Salinas Valley of California had been exposed to DCPA.\n\nSome farms have voiced opposition to banning the pesticide. It was \"an essential tool for controlling yield-robbing grasses and broadleaf weeds,\" a representative of Griffin Ranches, which grows onions, broccoli and cauliflower in Yuma, Ariz., wrote in a 2022 letter opposing any move toward a ban.\n\nIn many cases, \"the alternative would be hand-weeding, which would entail bringing on additional labor,\" he wrote. Preserving the use of the product \"will maintain the positive economic impact it has had on America's vegetable growers and will ensure the continued supply of affordable and healthy vegetables for American consumers.\"\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency said it would soon issue a notice of intent to cancel DCPA products permanently, a process that could take several months if uncontested by the manufacturer, or years if the move is contested.\n\nIn the interim, the agency invoked its authority under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act to simultaneously suspend the pesticide as an emergency measure, it said, because it had determined that the continued sale and use during the time it would take to follow a normal cancellation process posed an imminent hazard.",

That decision was based on a study conducted by Dacthal's manufacturer in 1993, which showed it caused thyroid tumors in animals, suggesting similar potential threats to people.\n\nIn 2013, the EPA required AMVAC, the sole DCPA manufacturer in the U.S., to submit an additional study showing the chemical's effects on the fetal thyroid among other information.\n\nAMVAC's research, finally submitted to the EPA in 2022, showed even low doses of DCPA exposure can harm the developing fetus.\n\nDuring the nearly 10 years before it finally complied with the EPA's requirement, the company continued producing and selling Dacthal.\n\nAnd AMVAC didn't submit other data requested. So in August 2023, the agency suspended use of the pesticide, a de facto temporary ban.\n\nThe EPA's emergency order immediately halts all uses of the herbicide.\n\nThe new suspension means DCPA is banned even while the EPA begins the cancellation process for the pesticide, which will lead to a permanent ban of DCPA.\n\nIt is the first time in nearly 40 years the EPA has exercised its emergency authority to suspend the use of a pesticide to \"prevent imminent hazard.\"\n\nThis means the EPA believes continued use of the pesticide while the lengthy cancellation process plays out would cause harm to people, and that no mitigation measures would be adequate to protect people.\n\nDCPA has been in use in this country since the late 1950s. These days, it can be found on vegetables like cilantro, kale, mustard greens, broccoli and green onions. That's because, after it's used to kill weeds, the chemical can linger in the soil for long periods of time, contaminating crops later grown in those fields.\n\nEWG research published in 2019 identified DCPA on nearly 60 percent of kale samples tested by the Department of Agriculture. The USDA also found the pesticide on many collard and mustard green samples.\n\nThe EPA identified DCPA's ability to harm the thyroid in the 1990s, based on studies submitted by the pesticide manufacturer. According to a\n\n, a 2004 human health risk assessment identified the need to understand how DCPA harms the thyroid in the developing fetus.\n\nA2022 peer-reviewed study\n\nby EWG scientists identified DCPA as a pesticide of concern, due to its toxicity and capacity to harm the thyroid and its classification as a possible cause of cancer.\n\nOther EWG research found that, even though the EPA had evidence of DCPA's health risks, up to 200,000 pounds of the chemical were sprayed during some years in California - even as the agency delayed action.\n\nA 2019 study\n\nled by scientists at the University of California at Berkeley School of Public Health found that more than half of adolescent girls from farmworker communities in the Salinas Valley had been exposed to DCPA.\n\nSince 2019, EWG has warned about DCPA's risks to human health, calling on the EPA to ban it in 2021 public comments and again in official comments to the agency in July 2023.\n\n\"Countless people have been exposed to DCPA while the EPA abdicated its responsibility,\" said Temkin. \"The agency should have taken action decades ago, when it first identified the human health risks posed by this toxic crop chemical.\"", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common Dreams"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Working_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Environmental Working Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Herbicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pesticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmworker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Farmworker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thyroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fetus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toxicology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carcinogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toxicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suspension (chemistry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica_juncea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brassica juncea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinas_Valley", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salinas Valley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scallion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Berkeley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriander", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coriander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Environmental_Health", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Environmental Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Non-Toxic_Living", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Non-Toxic Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8zMjEwMDM4OS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0OTE0ODI1N30.nWE-dO3LpGCfrP6HKKrgMGYA-9xT8aazabGiQTfcsrM/image.png?width=210", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795302", "eventUri": "eng-9795302", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

This is the first time in almost 40 years the EPA has taken this type of emergency action, following several years of unprecedented efforts by the Biden-Harris Administration to require the submission of long-overdue data, and then assess and address the risk the pesticide poses.\n\nThe EPA has taken this action because unborn babies whose pregnant mothers are exposed to DCPA, sometimes without even knowing the exposure has occurred, could experience changes to fetal thyroid-hormone levels, and these changes are generally linked to small birth weight, impaired brain development, decreased IQ, and impaired motor skills later in life, some of which may be irreversible.\n\n\"DCPA is so dangerous that it needs to be removed from the market immediately,\" said Michal Freedhoff, assistant administrator for the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention. \"It's EPA's job to protect people from exposure to dangerous chemicals. In this case, pregnant women who may never even know they were exposed could give birth to babies that experience irreversible lifelong health problems. That's why for the first time in almost 40 years, EPA is using its emergency suspension authority to stop the use of a pesticide.\"\n\nDCPA is a pesticide registered to control weeds in both agricultural and non-agricultural settings, but is primarily used on crops such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage and onions. DCPA is currently undergoing registration review, a process that requires reevaluating registered pesticides every 15 years to ensure they cause no unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment.\n\nIn deciding whether to issue the Emergency Order, the EPA consulted with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to understand how growers use DCPA and alternatives to the pesticide. In 2013 the agency issued a Data Call-In to AMVAC Chemical Corporation, the sole manufacturer of DCPA, requiring it to submit more than 20 studies to support the existing registrations of DCPA.\n\nThe required data included a comprehensive study of the effects of DCPA on thyroid development and function in adults and in developing young before and after birth, that was due by January 2016. Several of the studies that AMVAC submitted from 2013-2021 were considered insufficient to address the Data Call-In. And the thyroid study and other studies were not submitted at all.\n\nThe EPA issued in April 2022 a rarely used Notice of Intent to Suspend the DCPA technical-grade product in based on AMVAC's failure to submit the complete set of required data for almost 10 years, including the thyroid study. AMVAC then submitted the required thyroid study in August 2022 but the EPA suspended the registration Aug. 22, 2023, based solely on AMVAC's continued failure to submit other outstanding data, following an administrative hearing. In November 2023 the data-submission suspension was lifted after AMVAC submitted sufficient data. Most DCPA use on turf was voluntarily canceled by AMVAC in December 2023, but unacceptable risks from other uses remained.\n\nThe EPA released in May 2023 its assessment on the risks of occupational and residential exposure to products containing DCPA, following its analysis of the thyroid study submitted by AMVAC. The assessment found health risks associated with DCPA use and application, even when personal protective equipment and engineering controls are used. The most serious risks are to the unborn babies of pregnant individuals. The EPA estimates that some pregnant individuals handling DCPA products could be subjected to exposures four to 20 times greater than what the EPA has estimated is safe for unborn babies.\n\nAlso of concern are risks to unborn babies of pregnant individuals entering or working in areas where DCPA has already been applied -especially post-application workers involved in tasks such as transplanting, weeding and harvesting. Current product labels specify that entry into treated fields must be restricted for 12 hours after application. But the evidence indicates that for many crops and tasks, levels of DCPA in a treated field remain at unsafe levels for 25 days or more. Spray drift - the movement of pesticide through the air at the time of application or soon after, to any site other than the area intended - from pesticide application could also put at risk the unborn babies of pregnant individuals living near areas where DCPA is used.\n\nSince the release of EPA's 2023 assessment, AMVAC has proposed several changes to the DCPA registrations, including the cancellation of DCPA products registered for use on turf. Those cancellations practically eliminate exposures to DCPA from recreational activities on and around turf. But according to the EPA's analysis, AMVAC's proposed changes to agricultural uses of DCPA do not adequately address the serious health risks for people who work with and around DCPA.\n\nThe EPA issued in April 2024 a public warning regarding the significant health risks to unborn babies of pregnant individuals exposed to DCPA and its intent to pursue action to address the serious, and in some instances permanent, and irreversible health risks associated with the pesticide as quickly as possible. In a letter to AMVAC dated March 27, 2024, the EPA restated the risks the agency found and noted that the agency would be pursuing regulatory options as soon as possible - which could include canceling the pesticide or seeking an emergency suspension.\n\nWhen serious risks are identified, the EPA can take action under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act to suspend or cancel a pesticide. Taking such action is resource- and time-intensive, partly due to the procedural requirements of the act. A cancelation proceeding may take at least several months - if uncontested by the registrant - or potentially several years - if contested by the registrant thus triggering an administrative hearing and any subsequent appeal of a cancellation order. The act also allows the EPA to seek a suspension of a pesticide product while cancelation proceedings are ongoing if the administrator determines it's necessary to prevent an imminent hazard. EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan has determined that, due to the serious and imminent harm posed by DCPA, an emergency exists such that this order of suspension effective immediately is necessary. The EPA intends to issue a notice of intent to cancel the DCPA products within the next 90 days.\n\nThe Emergency Order is effective immediately. The EPA has determined that the continued sale and use of DCPA products during the time it would take to follow the normal cancelation process poses an imminent hazard to unborn babies. While AMVAC has attempted to address these concerns, the EPA has determined there are no practical mitigation measures that can be put in place to allow DCPA's continued use.\n\nVisit www.regulations.gov/docket/EPA-HQ-OPP-2011-0374 for more information.", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clay Center Dispatch On-Line"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_d_wilson@ccenterdispatch.com", "name": "Ryan D.

The risk to unborn babies was too high for the agency to wait, it said.\n\nThe order to control Dacthal, or dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate, is the first action of its kind the EPA has taken in nearly 40 years, it said in a press release. Studies found pregnant mothers exposed to the chemical can have children with low birth weight, diminished brain development and IQs, and challenged motor skills from changes in fetal thyroid hormone levels, along with impaired thyroid development.\n\nThe USDA approved Dacthal in 1960 for use on a wide range of crops including strawberries, broccoli, onions, Brussels sprouts and cabbage, in addition to use on lawns for controlling weeds like hard-to-remove crabgrass.\n\nIt has been used in Maine for strawberry management, and testing by the state's board of pesticide control found it in groundwater near a strawberry farm 19 years ago.\n\nThe board of pesticide control could not be reached for more information Tuesday.\n\nIn reviewing registration for the chemical, a standard 15-year process, the EPA said required studies from the manufacturer about the product's effects on thyroid health in children and adults were insufficient or not turned in at all.\n\nThe agency's research found fields where the chemical has been applied may be unsafe for pregnant women for 25 days afterward. Pregnant women handling the chemicals, even with protective equipment, could be exposed to levels of Dacthal four to 20 times more than the EPA's safety estimate for unborn babies.\n\nTuesday's order follows an April public health warning about the chemical and an August 2023 suspension of the product registration.", "source": {"uri": "bangordailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangor Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elizabeth_walztoni@bangordailynews.com", "name": "Elizabeth Walztoni", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyl_tetrachloroterephthalate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weed", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Weed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Herbicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strawberry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_hormones", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thyroid hormones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low birth weight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabbage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabbage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_sprout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brussels sprout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thyroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence quotient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pesticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawn", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Onion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broccoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broccoli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundwater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Groundwater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fetus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suspension (chemistry)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Non-Toxic_Living", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Non-Toxic Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Hazardous_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Hazardous Substances", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/08/Vermont-Strawberries.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795302", "eventUri": "eng-9795302", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

That can lead to low birth weight, impaired brain development, lower IQ and motor skill issues, the agency added.\n\n\"DCPA is so dangerous that it needs to be removed from the market immediately,\" Michal Freedhoff, assistant administrator for the EPA's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, said in an agency news release on the emergency order.\n\n\"It's EPA's job to protect people from exposure to dangerous chemicals,\" Freedhoff added. \"In this case, pregnant women who may never even know they were exposed could give birth to babies that experience irreversible lifelong health problems. That's why for the first time in almost 40 years, EPA is using its emergency suspension authority to stop the use of a pesticide.\"\n\nDCPA has been banned in the European Union since 2009, NBC News reported.\n\nEnvironmental groups applauded the move, if not its late timing.\n\n\"The EPA's decision to finally suspend DCPA is welcome news, but it's long overdue,\" Environmental Working Group (EWG) Senior Toxicologist Alexis Temkin, said in a statement. \"For years, EWG and other public health advocates have warned about the serious risks the weedkiller poses to farmworkers, pregnant people and other vulnerable populations.\"\n\n\"Countless people have been exposed to DCPA while the EPA abdicated its responsibility,\" Temkin added. \"The agency should have taken action decades ago, when it first identified the human health risks posed by this toxic crop chemical.\"\n\nFarmworker groups also applauded the ban, which takes effect immediately.\n\nMily Trevi\u00f1o Sauceda, executive director of Alianza Nacional de Campesinas, a national organization of women farmworkers, called the decision \"historic.\"\n\n\"As an organization led by farmworker women, we know intimately the harm that pesticides, including dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate [DCPA or Dacthal], can inflict on our bodies and communities,\" Sauceda said in the EPA news release. \"This emergency decision is a great first step that we hope will be in a series of others that are based on listening to farmworkers, protecting our reproductive health and safeguarding our families.\"\n\nThe DCPA ban followed a decade of back-and-forth between the EPA and the sole manufacturer of DCPA, the AMVAC Chemical Corp. The company did not respond to a request for comment, NBC News reported.\n\nThe EPA said its recent review of DCPA was part of a process in which registered pesticides are re-analyzed every 15 years, to make sure they have no adverse health effects and are not harmful to the environment.\n\nSOURCES: Environmental Protection Agency, news release, Aug. 6, 2024; Environmental Working Group, news release, Aug. 6, 2024; NBC News", "source": {"uri": "healthday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "healthday.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robin_foster@healthday.com", "name": "Robin Foster", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fetus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Herbicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pesticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_hormones", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thyroid hormones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Low birth weight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Working_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmental Working Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabbage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabbage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_sprout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brussels sprout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence quotient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Onion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broccoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broccoli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toxicology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suspension (chemistry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toxicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Non-Toxic_Living", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Non-Toxic Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/healthday-en%2F2024-07%2F9ed98062-aee9-4187-8144-59bd1bc638e4%2FAdobeStock_266919810%20(1).jpeg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795302", "eventUri": "eng-9795302", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 460723962, "relevance": 2}

Still, \"it feels good\" to take on such a beloved character, Emma adds. TikTok's reading community, known as BookTok, has helped catapult titles to viral fame. And one of those is Holly Jackson's 2019 debut A Good Girl's Guide to Murder. The young adult crime story has now been adapted into an upcoming BBC series, starring Emma as Pip and Zain Iqbal as co-detective Ravi Singh. The pair dig into a murder case involving Ravi's brother to try to prove his innocence. Fans have been eagerly awaiting the BBC series dropping. \"I've actually just screamed,\" said one, when they first heard it was announced. The book's author Holly says she is \"just so grateful that TikTok and BookTok exist because if they didn't, I don't know that we would be here making this show\".", "summary": "Actor Emma Myers discusses the hype around the upcoming BBC series - and the power of BookTok.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl55qlz93ezo", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d7c1/live/2e1b8be0-30f6-11ef-a97a-b30e00c8d4a5.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 00:21:22", "author": "Ruchira Sharma And Shola Lee", "authors": ["Ruchira Sharma And Shola Lee"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.485}

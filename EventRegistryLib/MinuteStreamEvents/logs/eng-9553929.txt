Mongonu (Borno North).\n\nThough the report did not recommend a death penalty, the Senate Chief Whip, Ali Ndume, however, moved that the life sentence be replaced with death penalty.\n\nDuring a clause-by-clause consideration of Bill, Barau Jibrin, the Deputy Senate President, who presided over the session, put the amendment on the death penalty to a voice vote and declared that the \"ayes\" had it, but Senator Adams Oshiomhole (Edo North) objected that the \"nays\" rather had it.\n\nHe argued that matters of life and death should not be treated hurriedly, but Barau said it was too late, as he failed to raise a point of division soon enough.\n\nThe bill was subsequently passed.\n\nHowever, throwing more light on what transpired on the the floor of the Senate, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Tahir Monguno said section 11 in the committee report recommended life imprisonment, but the Senate amended it to death sentence.\n\nOn the protest by Senator Oshiomhole, Monguno said in voice vote \"we are bound by the ruling of the presiding officer\" adding that Oshiomhole could have \"timeously applied for division\".\n\nHowever, Monguno said all hope was not lost as Oshiomhole, if he feels very strongly about his opposition to the death penalty, can still come by way of a motion in writing to the Senate to review its decision.\n\nMonguno, a lawyer, who spent 20 years in the House of Representatives before crossing over to the Senate in this 10th Assembly, said what the Senate did on Thursday was passage of a bill which will be transmitted to the president for his assent.\n\nHe said the import of the NDLEA Act amendment that was passed the Senate today, and more particularly with regards to the provision of punishment is that the Senate in its wisdom decided to prescribe the punishment of death sentence for people that engage in the manufacturing, processing of hard drugs.\n\nHe said the Senate, in its wisdom, decided to prescribe the death sentence in view of the havoc being created by substance and drug abuse, if not nipped in the bud, the potential of destroying the future of this country because it is the youth that in majority engage in drug and substance abuse is there.\n\nHe said consumption of hard drugs carry 15 year jail term without the option of fine.\n\nOn governors or president not signing death warrants of condemned prisoners, Monguno said it is because the state governors have discretion as the operating word in the law is \"may\" and not \"shall\".\n\nHe said the caution being exercised is to avoid fatal error in matter of life and death, but advised the governors or the executing authority should use prerogative of mercy or commute the death sentence.", "source": {"uri": "newsdiaryonline.com",

Section 11 in the committee report recommended life imprisonment, but the Senate amended it to death sentence.\n\nOn the protest by Senator Oshiomhole, Monguno said in voice vote \"we are bound by the ruling of the presiding officer\" adding that Oshiomhole could have \"timeously applied for division\".\n\nHowever, Monguno said all hope was not lost as Oshiomhole, if he feels very strongly about his opposition to the death penalty, can still come by way of a motion in writing to the Senate to review its decision.\n\nThe politician who is also a lawyer by training and who spent 20 years in the House of Representatives before crossing over to the Senate in this 10th Assembly, said that what the Senate did on Thursday was passage of a bill which would be transmitted to the President for his assent.\n\nHe said the import of the NDLEA Act amendment that was passed the Senate today, and more particularly with regards to the provision of punishment is that the Senate in its wisdom decided to prescribe the punishment of death sentence for people that engage in the manufacturing, processing of hard drugs.\n\nHe said the Senate, in its wisdom, decided to prescribe the death sentence in view of the havoc being created by substance and drug abuse, if not nipped in the bud, the potential of destroying the future of this country because it is the youth that in majority engage in drug and substance abuse is there.\n\nHe said consumption of hard drugs carry 15 year jail term without the option of fine.\n\nOn governors or president not signing death warrants of condemned prisoners, Monguno said it is because the state governors have discretion as the operating word in the law is \"may\" and not \"shall\".\n\nHe said the caution being exercised is to avoid fatal error in matter of life and death, but advised the governors or the executing authority should use prerogative of mercy or commute the death sentence.", "source": {"uri": "newtelegraphng.com", "dataType": "news",

voice votes.\n\nThe legislation titled the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency Act (Amendment Bill) 2024 had passed a third reading at the Senate on Thursday.\n\nThe Bill sought to review penalties provision, update the list of dangerous drugs, strengthen the operations of the NDLEA, and empower the NDLEA to establish laboratories.\n\nSection 11 of the current act which prescribes that any person who, without lawful authority; Imports, manufactures, produces, processes, plants or grows the drugs popularly known as cocaine, LSD, heroin or any other similar drugs shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to be sentenced to imprisonment for life was amended to reflect a stiffer death penalty.\n\nThe bill was passed after the Senate considered the Report of the Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters presented by Mongonu Tahir, the Senator representing Borno North.\n\nThough the report did not recommend death penalty, Ali Ndume, the Senate Chief Whip, however, moved that the death penalty be replaced with a life sentence.\n\nDuring a clause-by-clause consideration of Bill, Barau Jibrin, the Deputy Senate President who presided over the session, put the amendment on the death penalty to a voice vote and declared that the \"ayes\" had it, but Adams Oshiomhole, Senator Representing Edo North objected that the \"nays\" had it rather.\n\nHe argued that matters of life and death should not be treated hurriedly, but Barau said it was too late, as he failed to raise a point of division soon enough.\n\nThe bill was subsequently passed.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen on the implication of the bill Senator Tahir Munguno, chairman Senate committee on Human Rights and Legal Matters indicated that the import of the ammendment of the NDLEA act as passed by the Senate prescribed the punishment of death sentence for people who engage in the manufacturing, processing of hard drugs.\n\n\"But for the people that engage in the consuption of these hard drugs the sentence prescribed is 15years.\n\n\"I think the Senate in its wisdom decided to prescribe death sentence in view of the havoc being created by substance and drug abuse in this country which if not nipped in the bud have the potential of destroying the future of this country because it is the majority of the youth that are engaged in the drug and substance abuse, sometimes innocently as a

Ripples Nigeria", "body": "The Senate on Thursday approved death sentence as penalty for drug trafficking and other substances in Nigeria.\n\nThis followed the passage of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) Amendment Bill 2024.\n\nThe Red Chamber also prescribed at least 15 years imprisonment without the option of a fine for the consumption of hard drugs and substances.\n\nThe parliament passed the bill after adopting the report of Senate Committees on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters and Drugs and Narcotics on the NDLEA Amendment Act presented by the Chairman, Senator Mohammmed Monguno, at the plenary in Abuja.\n\nMonguno in his presentation said the amendment sought to strengthen the operations of the NDLEA, empower its operations to establish laboratories for forensic review and update the list of dangerous drugs.\n\nHe said the amendment was also designed to review penalties and enhance the powers of the NDLEA to prosecute drug-related offences and issue subsidiary legislation.\n\nThe lawmaker recalled that the Senate on February 28, deliberated on the bill which was transmitted from the House of Representatives for concurrence.\n\nHe said it was important to make a general comment on the bill, especially on the classification of the offences and penalty categorisations of drug-related offences.\n\nMonguno said: \"These guidelines in drug laws are designed to promote fairness, consistency and proportionality in the criminal justice system while considering the broader goals of rehabilitation and public safety.\n\n\"It is also important to note that several variables are used in determining the penalties imposed on a suspect.\n\n\"This includes type and quantity of controlled substance, defendant's criminal history, intent behind drug-related activities, aggravating or mitigating circumstance such as organised crime, violence, use of offensive weapon.\n\nREAD ALSO: Tinubu was involved in drug trafficking -Hundeyin insists in

severity of punishment.\"\n\nBefore the passage of the bill, the Senate Chief Whip, Ali Ndume, moved a motion for amendment to clause 11 of the bill which initially prescribed life imprisonment for drug and substances trafficking in Nigeria.\n\nNdume had called for stiffer sanctions and moved a motion for a death sentence.\n\nThe motion was seconded by the Senator from Ebonyi State, Onyekachi Nwaebonyi , who said drug and substance trafficking was doing greater harm to the nation and hence a stiffer penalty for offenders.\n\nWhen the motion on the death penalty was put to vote, the \"Yes\" had their way as the Deputy Senate President, Barau Jubrin, who presided over the plenary ruled in favour of the \"Yes.\"\n\nHowever, the decision did not go well with the Senator representing Edo North, Adams Oshiomhole, who objected to the ruling.\n\nThe former Edo State governor pointed out that he was responsible to his constituents for every law passed in the Senate.\n\nHe said issues of life and death should not be passed based on \"Yes or No\" responses and advocated for voting by every senator.\n\nThe first and only time Nigeria executed drug traffickers was during the military regime of Muhammadu Buhari in 1984.\n\nThe trio of Bernard Ogedegbe, Batholomew Owoh and Lawal Ojulope were sentenced to death by a special military tribunal set up by the junta and executed a few days later despite appeals for clemency by civil society organisations and concerned international bodies.\n\nOpinions\n\nBalanced, fearless journalism driven by data comes at huge financial

Ali Ndume, recommended that the penalty should be \"toughened\" to the death penalty, which majority of the senators agreed to.\n\nThe penalty for drug importation or dealership is captured in Section 11 of the extant law, which Ndume sought to be increased to death sentence.\n\nNdume said: \"This should be changed to the death sentence. This is the standard worldwide. We have to do this to address this problem of drugs that has seriously affected our youths.\n\n\"It should be toughened beyond life imprisonment. It should be the death sentence, either by hanging or any way.\"\n\nBut, some senators, who protested against the death sentence were overruled by the Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Jibrin Barau, who presided over the plenary at that moment.\n\nSpecifically, former Governor of Edo State, Sen. Adams Oshiomhole, loudly protested against the decision of the Senate.\n\nProtesting against the death sentence, Sen. Oshiomhole said, \"when a matter has to do with life and death, we should be accountable. Let's divide the Senate.\n\n\"This is lawmaking. We are not here to take voice votes.\"\n\nOverruling Oshiomhole, the Deputy President of the Senate said, \"this is about procedure. You were supposed to call for a division, you didn't do so, and I am sorry I can't help you.\"\n\nSen. Sampson Ekong, (Akwa Ibom State), who also tried to protest the ruling, was also overruled.\n\nThe Senate went ahead to pass the bill for third reading.\n\nAddressing newsmen shortly after the plenary, Senator Mohammed Monguno, who lead debate on the Bill, disclosed that the Senate actually approved the death sentence.\n\nHe explained that the protest by Oshiomhole and other lawmakers, even if they had louder voices, did not change the ruling of the presiding officer, adding, \"the ruling of the presiding officer is the position of the Senate.\"\n\nAddressing the controversy trailing the cybersecurity levy, the Chairman, Senate Committee on National Security and Intelligence, Senator Shehu Umar Buba, said that the levy is not punitive as it has numerous exemptions to protect and relieve ordinary citizens, particularly the poor.\n\nAccording to him, the exemptions include salary payments, intra-account transfers, loan disbursements and repayments, and other financial transactions.\n\nHe further said that the levy is provided for in the Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention, etc) (Amendment) Act, 2024.\n\nSenator Buba said the amendments to the Cybercrimes Act were a collaborative effort with the National Assembly's ICT and Cyber Security Committee.\n\nThe committee also underwent a transparent public hearing process, receiving contributions from various stakeholders. Both Houses of the National Assembly unanimously passed it before President Bola Ahmed Tinubu signed it into law.\n\nSenator Umar emphasised that the provisions for the cybersecurity levy have been in place since 2015 but were delayed due to unclear interpretations and applications.\n\nHe said: \"The Cybercrimes Act of 2015 has provisions for imposing a cybersecurity levy since its enactment, but the vagueness of Section 44 led to different interpretations until the 2024 amendments. The levy is 0.5%, equivalent to half a per cent of the value of all electronic transactions by businesses specified in the Second Schedule to the Act.\n\n\"The amendments addressed crucial gaps in the Act and empowered the nation to implement the National Cybersecurity Programme effectively. They also seek to realign and empower the country to combat the inadequate funding and disruptive effects of cyber threats on national security and critical economic infrastructures.\"\n\nSenator Umar underscored the criticality of the cybersecurity levy's implementation, stating that its prudent utilisation will bolster the nation's capacity to evaluate, execute, upgrade, and fortify the security of national critical economic infrastructure, thereby safeguarding the nation's cyberspace.\n\nThe Committee commended the Office of the National Security Adviser and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for initiating the operationalising the cybersecurity levy, highlighting its benefits far outweigh its drawbacks.\n\nHe expressed appreciation to the leaders and representatives of MDAs at the federal and state levels, as well as to all stakeholders, who contributed to this effort's success.\n\nWhile maintaining that the Committee's mandate is to create laws that align with the aspirations of Nigerians, he appealed for public support, assuring that the policy will yield maximum benefits for citizens in the shortest possible time.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ng", "dataType": "news",

National Drug Law Enforcement Agency Act (Amendment Bill) 2024\" which passed the third reading at the Senate yesterday.\n\nThe bill sought to review the penalties, update the list of dangerous drugs, strengthen the operations of the NDLEA and empower the agency to establish laboratories.\n\nSection 11 of the current Act which prescribes that any person who, without lawful authority; imports, manufactures, produces, processes, plants or grows the drugs popularly known as cocaine, LSD, heroin or any other similar drugs, shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to life imprisonment was amended to reflect a stiffer death penalty.\n\nThe bill was passed after the Senate considered the Report of the Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters presented by the chairman, Senator Tahir Mongonu (Borno North).\n\nThough the report did not recommend a death penalty, the Senate chief whip, Ali Ndume, however, moved that the life sentence be replaced with the death penalty.\n\nDuring a clause-by-clause consideration of the bill, Barau Jibrin, the deputy Senate president, who presided over the session, put the amendment on the death penalty to a voice vote and declared that the \"ayes\" had it, but Senator Adams Oshiomhole (Edo North) objected that the \"nays\" rather had it.\n\nHe argued that matters of life and death should not be treated hurriedly, but Barau said it was too late, as he failed to raise his disagreement soon enough.\n\nThe bill was subsequently passed.\n\nHowever, throwing more light on what transpired on the floor of the Senate, Monguno said section 11 in the committee report recommended life imprisonment, but the Senate amended it to death sentence.\n\nOn the protest by Oshiomhole, Monguno said in voice vote \"we are bound by the ruling of the presiding officer\" adding that Oshiomhole could have \"timeously applied for division\".\n\nHowever, Monguno said all hope was not lost as Oshiomhole, if he feels very strongly about his opposition to the death penalty, can still come by way of a motion in writing to the Senate to review its decision.\n\nMonguno, a lawyer, who spent 20 years in the House of Representatives before crossing over to the Senate in this 10th Assembly, said what the Senate did was passage of a bill which will be transmitted to the president for his assent.", "source": {"uri": "leadership.ng",

A fairly typical passage from the textbook \u201cAmerica, Past and Present,\u201d describes hippies as idealistic young activists who \u201cchallenged the prevailing adult values in clothing, hairstyles, sexual conduct, work habits, and music.\u201d Comfortable trousers and strings of beads \u201ctook the place of business suits and wrist-watches . . . long hair, bare feet, and bralessness for women became the new uniform.\u201d At the macro-level, monogamous two-parent families and dull suburban subdivisions \u201cgave way to communes for the \u2018flower children\u2019 of the 1960s.\u201d A major article ran in (of all places) Gentleman\u2019s Quarterly a few years back titled \u201cThe Hippies Were Right After All.\u201d In the piece, author Devin Friedman declares: \u201cThe secret truth is that hippie culture won . . . You don\u2019t believe me? How many yoga studios come up in Google Maps when you open it?\u201d In addition to the impression that hippies constituted a majority or at least a sizable plurality of society, coverage of this kind almost invariably conveys an undertone of sympathy for even the most extreme elements of the counterculture. In the same source, the often-violent Students for a Democratic Society is described as a \u201cradical\u201d organization but also as one that legitimately wanted to \u201crid American society of poverty, violence [!], and racism.\u201d For all their flaws, members are called serious people who pursued a new form of \u201csalvation\u201d via \u201cthe individual rather than the group.\u201d The modern-day romanticization of the hippies represents yet another example of scholars unable to admit the failure and unpopularity of left-leaning revolutions. Not only has the modern world rejected the hippie aesthetic, but history has proven the key elements of their project to be incorrect. For a variety of reasons, including frequent public lewdness by anti-war activists and their treatment of Vietnam combat veterans, the anti-war and hippie movements were extraordinarily unpopular with most non-elite citizens. Such was the actual perception of the Aquarians, during their age. In step with our decades-later reverence for the hippie scene and the peace/sex movements, the mainstream \u201cschoolbook\u201d take on the Vietnam War today seems to be that it was an epic tragedy, unpopular at the time and now known to have been fought for amoral and illogical reasons. In reality, American attitudes toward Vietnam were quite normal if not \u2014 given the length of the war and the prevailing patterns of media coverage of it \u2014 balmier than might have been expected. There were logical reasons underlying both of these dead-common perspectives. Simply put, people disliked hippies because they struck the average taxpayer as slovenly, money-bumming drug addicts. Pieces like Joan Didion\u2019s \u201cSlouching Towards Bethlehem\u201d (1968) painted an amusing but disturbing picture of the hip scene in outposts like San Francisco\u2019s Haight-Ashbury district \u2014 one full of open-air drug markets, doped-up street kids on the nod in public, pimps preying on young flesh, and the occasional lunatic bow-man hunting stray cats for food. One piece in this vein, \u201cThe Death of the Hippies\u201d \u2014 the Atlantic\u2019s 2015 requiem for its older article\u2014opens by discussing the joy and hope that many at first associated with the famous Summer of Love. However after less than a year, any basic civilizational restraints essentially disappeared. \u201cOver time,\u201d says Samberg, \u201cmore and more people started using hard drugs. All the [hippie] stuff about higher consciousness was just sort of dropped.\u201d At around this same time, damaged and often sexually abused teenage kids\u2014especially girls\u2014started showing up in San Francisco and Berkeley in droves. One pack of Berkeley middle-school girls became known as the Minnie Mob because they often hit the avenue in their Mickey Mouse\u2013themed \u201ctween\u201d clothing. And these little kids apparently partied hard. One veteran of the Telegraph Avenue scene, describing the Mob or a similar group taking down two 1.75 liter bottles of Southern Comfort whiskey, said: \u201cThose . . . bottles appeared and disappeared in what couldn\u2019t have been more than two minutes. Those kids were 13, maybe 14. But they just consumed anything.\u201d Simply put, the 1960s \u201cmovement,\u201d now almost universally lauded, was widely hated in its own time, but that didn\u2019t stop it from doing damage. In a sense. . . the hippies did \u201cwin,\u201d but not in a way we should truly applaud. Their pro\u2013free love, anti establishment, anti-war, pro-drug ethos left a trail of destruction in its wake. The negative effect that it had on public attitudes toward the Vietnam War was a real, if minor, factor that contributed directly to the defeat of the domino theory strategy. And that defeat had a devastating eventual effect as the dominoes fell in Southeast Asia. To some degree, the Western hippies gleefully chanting \u201cHo! Ho! Ho Chi Minh!!!\u201d bear responsibility for the killing fields halfway across the world. Six decades later, young radicals continue to chant today for issues such as \u201cPalestine\u201d \u2014 believing that their cause is rooted in love, though as misguided as their predecessors back in Berkeley and the City by the Bay.

{"id": 223786824, "title": "Hamas rocket attack from Gaza sets off air raid sirens in Tel Aviv for the first time in months", "text": "The war also leaves Israel increasingly isolated on the world stage. Last week, three European countries announced they would recognize a Palestinian state, and the chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, along with three Hamas leaders. On Friday, the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to end its military offensive in Rafah. The top UN court also said Israel must give war crimes investigators access to Gaza. Israel is unlikely to comply and has condemned the ICC\u2019s move toward arrest warrants. Israel says it makes every effort to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas because the militants operate in dense, residential areas. Hamas claimed to have captured an Israeli soldier during fighting in northern Gaza and released video late Saturday showing a wounded man being dragged through a tunnel. Israel\u2019s military denied any soldiers had been captured, and Hamas did not provide any other evidence to support its claim. In a separate development, Israel\u2019s military said it had detained a suspect over a widely circulated video in which a man dressed as a soldier threatens mutiny. In the video, the man says tens of thousands of soldiers were ready to disobey the defense minister over his suggestion that Palestinians should govern Gaza after the war and pledged loyalty to Netanyahu alone. It was not clear if the man was on active duty, or when or where the video was made. Yair Netanyahu, the prime minister\u2019s son, shared the video on social media, sparking criticism from political opponents. The prime minister\u2019s office released a brief statement condemning all forms of military subordination.", "summary": "There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.", "url": "https://montrealgazette.com/news/world/hamas-rocket-attack-from-gaza-sets-off-air-raid-sirens-in-tel-aviv-for-the-first-time-in-months", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/montrealgazette/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2154209715.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:50:37", "author": "The Associated Press", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.024}

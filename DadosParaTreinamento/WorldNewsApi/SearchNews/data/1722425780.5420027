In a June 17 episode of the \u201cPodcrushed\u201d podcast, the \u201cYes, And?\u201d singer outlined her passion for true crime stories. Grande, who told podcast hosts Sophie Ansari, Penn Badgley, and Nava Kavelin that she was \u201cinfatuated with serial killers when I was younger,\u201d went on to recount an encounter with a young fan. \u201cIt was in between me being Cat [referring to her role in the Nickelodeon TV show \u201cVictorious\u201d] and pop stuff, so it was like a younger group, and they were with parents, and someone said, \u2018If you could have dinner with anyone living or dead, who would it be?\u2019\u201d the singer recalled. \u201cI mean, Jeffrey Dahmer is pretty fascinating.\u201d Dahmer, who killed at least 17 young men, mostly gay men of color, was examined by a 2022 Netflix documentary, which received its own slate of criticism for its depiction of Dahmer, and for the Dahmer idolization it spurred. \u201cI think I would have loved to have met him . . .

It\u2019s also not something you should say to young people, which she says she did.\u201d Per TMZ, Barbara Hughes, Tony\u2019s sister, called for the \"Wicked\" lead to apologize for the remarks MORE FROM Griffin Eckstein Advertisement: Home About Staff Contact Privacy Terms of Service Archive Go Ad Free Copyright \u00a9 2024 Salon.com, LLC.

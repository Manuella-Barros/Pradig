The 47-year-old has been performing in front of British crowds for 15 years and even earned the title of highest-grossing stand up comedian worldwide back in 2012. Most recently, the star has been taking on more presenting roles with his popular Saturday night show The Wheel a smash hit on the BBC. This show is packed with lots of laughs and plenty of celebrities and caters for all ages. However, some fans may be curious as to what Michael gets up to when he's not entertaining millions so the Mirror have taken a closer look at his life away from the screen. Career boost Michael began his career at the local comedy circuit in his twenties and made a serious career break after appearing on Live at the Apollo. The star appeared on the BBC One show in 2007, 2008 and 2009 and surged in popularity overnight with these comedy sets. Michael landed roles on a number of comedy panel shows that included 8 out of 10 Cats, Mock the Week, Have I Got News for You and Would I Lie to You? Michael then turned to presenting and hosted his very own Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow in 2009. He was also invited to judge on the Britain's Got Talent panel in 2011 alongside Amanda Holden and David Hasselhoff. The star also presented The Michael McIntyre Chat Show, Michael McIntyre's Big Show and most recently The Wheel - both the UK and US versions. 'Rocky' romance Despite featuring in many of Michael's skits, wife Kitty Ward is rarely spotted in public with her comedian husband. Michael has been candid about his relationship and often uses anecdotes to describe their lives while on stage. In his 2010 book, Life and Laughing, Michael said: \"She was the girl I had been looking for. In the romantic comedy that was my life, this would have made a good ending. We would fall happily ever after. Within moments of seeing her and chatting to her I was totally up for that ending. -Unfortunately, she wasn\u2019t.\" It looked like Kitty wasn't interested in Michael at first but with some persuasion, the comedian was able to woo her successfully. Michael once revealed on Desert Island discs that his family weren't so pleased with his love life news, saying: \"Unfortunately my grandma didn\u2019t really like it when I got a girlfriend. \"She was trying to break us up which was funny for a while but then it became quite vicious, an untenable -situation.\" However, true love shone through and the pair went on to marry in 2003. Kitty currently works as an aromatherapist and prefers the private life outwith the spot light. She is no stranger to fame, however, as she is the daughter of late film star Simon Ward and sister of Young Sherlock Holmes actress Sophie Ward. Rarely seen kids and home life The couple have two children together, named Lucas and Oscar. These two have also featured in Michael's skits with his famous line being: \"You never love your children more than when they\u2019re unconscious, but still breathing.\" Michael recently saw his net worth skyrocket to over \u00a375 million following his BBC career revival and Netflix deal. He celebrated by investing in a new house in London ranked at worth \u00a310 million. The eight-bedroom property has a built-in swimming pool in the basement and even a modern cinema room. The star can enjoy a spa after a workout in his gym when he\u2019s not at the other home in Wiltshire. Get the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

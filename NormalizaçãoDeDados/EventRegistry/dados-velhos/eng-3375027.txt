Julian Edelman and Brandin Cooks also played after sitting out last week and Cooks had a 7-yard reception.\n\nHouston quarterback Tom Savage was effective in two drives, going 8 for 9 for 98 yards with a 2-yard touchdown pass to Jaelen Strong that put the Texans up 7-0 in the first quarter.\n\n\"I'm really, really comfortable with this offense,\" Savage said. \"We have a lot of talent out there and a lot of the guys are making some big plays for me and it's been awesome.\"\n\nTexans rookie first-round pick Deshaun Watson, who had 179 yards passing last week, threw for 102 yards and ran for a 2-yard touchdown in about two quarters of work.\n\nJimmy Garoppolo was 15 of 23 for 145 yards with a touchdown and an interception after taking over for Brady.\n\nHouston third-round pick D'Onta Foreman, who won the Doak Walker Award as the nation's best college running back last season, had another solid game, after rushing for 76 yards last week. He had two receptions for 66 yards and ran for 10 yards and a 4-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. His best moment came when he grabbed a short pass from Watson and broke several tackles en route to a 63-yard gain that set up Watson's touchdown in the third quarter.\n\nWATT'S UP\n\nHouston defensive end J.J. Watt played just one series, but it was long enough to provide one of the highlights of the night. Watt, who is returning from back surgery which cost him 13 games last season, leveled Burkhead for a 2-yard loss on New England's opening possession for his first tackle of the season.\n\nSITTING OUT\n\nHouston outside linebacker Jadeveon Clowney and receiver DeAndre Hopkins did not play after both players appeared in the first preseason game. It appears to be a precautionary move since the team hasn't acknowledged injuries to either player. Patriots running back Mike Gillislee sat out for the second straight week with a hamstring injury. New England linebacker Elandon Roberts injured his ribs in the second half and didn't return.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T04:00:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.9450980424880981, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3375027", "time": "04:00:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375027", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "198406", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302611", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "score": 5}, {"id": "302622", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "score": 2}, {"id": "302733", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "score": 3}, {"id": "304976", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "score": 2}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 3}, {"id": "309225", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "score": 5}, {"id": "309397", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "score": 3}, {"id": "309398", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "score": 3}, {"id": "309400", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "score": 1}, {"id": "310749", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "score": 2}, {"id": "312016", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "score": 3}, {"id": "324223", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rush (gridiron football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(gridiron_football)", "score": 2}, {"id": "324224", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "score": 2}, {"id": "325074", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "score": 4}, {"id": "328991", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "J.

His performance came in his return to Houston after leading the Patriots back from a 25-point third-quarter deficit to a 34-28 overtime win against the Atlanta Falcons to earn his fourth Super Bowl MVP trophy here in February.\n\nIt was a far different environment than the previous time the Patriots were at NRG Stadium, but there was a reminder of their big win as remnants of red and blue confetti from the Super Bowl postgame celebration remained in the phone banks near their bench.\n\nRob Gronkowski also made his season debut for the Patriots, playing about 15 snaps, but not catching a pass, in his first preseason appearance since 2012. Julian Edelman and Brandin Cooks also played after sitting out last week and Cooks had a 7-yard reception.\n\nHouston quarterback Tom Savage was effective in two drives, going 8 for 9 for 98 yards with a 2-yard touchdown pass to Jaelen Strong that put the Texans up 7-0 in the first quarter.\n\n\"I'm really, really comfortable with this offense,\" Savage said. \"We have a lot of talent out there and a lot of the guys are making some big plays for me and it's been awesome.\"\n\nTexans rookie first-round pick Deshaun Watson, who had 179 yards passing last week, threw for 102 yards and ran for a 2-yard touchdown in about two quarters of work.\n\nJimmy Garoppolo was 15 of 23 for 145 yards with a touchdown and an interception after taking over for Brady.\n\nROOKIE WATCH\n\nHouston third-round pick D'Onta Foreman, who won the Doak Walker Award as the nation's best college running back last season, had another solid game, after rushing for 76 yards last week. He had two receptions for 66 yards and ran for 10 yards and a 4-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. His best moment came when he grabbed a short pass from Watson and broke several tackles en route to a 63-yard gain that set up Watson's touchdown in the third quarter.\n\nWATT'S UP\n\nHouston defensive end J.J. Watt played just one series, but it was long enough to provide one of the highlights of the night. Watt, who is returning from back surgery which cost him 13 games last season, leveled Burkhead for a 2-yard loss on New England's opening possession for his first tackle of the season.\n\nSITTING OUT\n\nHouston outside linebacker Jadeveon Clowney and receiver DeAndre Hopkins did not play after both players appeared in the first preseason game. It appears to be a precautionary move since the team hasn't acknowledged injuries to either player. Patriots running back Mike Gillislee sat out for the second straight week with a hamstring injury. New England linebacker Elandon Roberts injured his ribs in the second half and didn't return.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

His best moment came when he grabbed a short pass from Watson and broke several tackles en route to a 63-yard gain that set up Watson's touchdown in the third quarter.\n\nWATT'S UP\n\nHouston defensive end J.J. Watt played just one series, but it was long enough to provide one of the highlights of the night. Watt, who is returning from back surgery which cost him 13 games last season, leveled Burkhead for a 2-yard loss on New England's opening possession for his first tackle of the season.\n\nSITTING OUT\n\nHouston outside linebacker Jadeveon Clowney and receiver DeAndre Hopkins did not play after both players appeared in the first preseason game. It appears to be a precautionary move since the team hasn't acknowledged injuries to either player. Patriots running back Mike Gillislee sat out for the second straight week with a hamstring injury. New England linebacker Elandon Roberts injured his ribs in the second half and didn't return.\n\n6\n\nView Gallery Gallery: PHOTOS: Texans host Super Bowl champ Patriots", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:41:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8627451062202454, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3375027", "time": "03:41:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375027", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "198406", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302611", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "score": 5}, {"id": "302622", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "score": 2}, {"id": "302733", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "score": 3}, {"id": "304415", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Red"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red", "score": 3}, {"id": "304754", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "score": 1}, {"id": "304976", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "score": 2}, {"id": "305549", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Blue"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue", "score": 3}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 3}, {"id": "309225", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "score": 5}, {"id": "309397", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "score": 3}, {"id": "309398", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "score": 5}, {"id": "309400", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "score": 1}, {"id": "310219", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "score": 3}, {"id": "310749", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "score": 2}, {"id": "312016", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "score": 3}, {"id": "324223", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rush (gridiron football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(gridiron_football)", "score": 2}, {"id": "324224", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "score": 2}, {"id": "325074", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "score": 4}, {"id": "325513", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Punt (gridiron football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)", "score": 3}, {"id": "328987", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of Houston Texans seasons"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Houston_Texans_seasons", "score": 3}, {"id": "328991", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "J.

Savage retired with 8-of-9 for 98 yards and a touchdown. His rating was 149.1.\n\nBrady was stopped on his first possession by a defense led by end J.J. Watt.\n\nThe Patriots got one first down on their first possession. It came on Brady's pass to running back James White, who tormented the Texans with his catches out of the backfield in the divisional playoff loss last season.\n\nBut Brady failed to generate another first down on that opening series. Watt threw running back Rex Burkhead for a 2-yard loss at New England's 23, and Brady failed to connect on a sideline route with Julian Edelman, who was tightly covered by Johnathan Joseph.\n\nIt was a solid first series by the Texans' defense that finished first last season and appears good enough to challenge for that distinction again.\n\nAfter Savage staked the Texans to a 7-0 lead, Brady took over for his second and last series.\n\nBrady showed he can still pick the Texans' defense apart by throwing to his backs. He did it last season, and he did it again Saturday.\n\nOn New England's second possession, the Patriots got a break on the first play, a pass from Brady to receiver Chris Hogan.\n\nInstant replay at the NFL office in New York - centralized this season - overturned what head been ruled an interception by safety Andre Hal.\n\nHal, who's trying to produce the kind of big plays provided by Quintin Demps last season, made a leaping interception near the sideline over Hogan. Replay overturned the call on the field, saying Hal wasn't able to control the ball when he came down.\n\nGiven new life, Brady took the Patriots to the tying touchdown.\n\nThe defense showed it still can't cover New England running backs on pass routes. Rex Burkhead, who played at Cincinnati, is a new addition to the Patriots' backfield, and he wore out the Texans as a receiver.\n\nBurkhead had back-to-back catches of 16 and 12 yards to get the Patriots to the Texans' 37. He had three carries to get them to the 22.\n\nOn second down, Burkhead was covered by rookie inside linebacker Zach Cunningham.\n\nOne reason the Texans drafted Cunningham in the second round was his ability to run and cover. The idea being that he could be effective in sub-packages covering backs and tight ends.\n\nAfter a slow start in training camp, Cunningham showed a lot of improvement, especially on coverage.\n\nBut on second down at the Texans' 22, Cunningham got schooled by Burkhead.\n\nBurkhead ran a route over the middle. He faked to his right and Cunningham took the bait, but Burkhead cut back to his left and was wide open to catch Brady's pass. He scored easily running down the middle of the field to make it 7-7.\n\nOn Brady's two possessions, that was the only blemish on the Texans' defense.\n\nAfter Brady went to the bench, Jimmy Garoppolo replaced Brady and played against a lot of reserves.\n\nDeshaun Watson took over for Savage against mostly backups.\n\nWatson and Garoppolo ignited field-goal drives. Then, Stephen Gostkowski kicked a 51-yard field goal that gave New England a 13-10 halftime lead.\n\nWhen the coaches watch tape of their defensive starters vs. Brady on Sunday - minus Jadeveon Clowney - they will be pleased with what they see.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T02:55:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8078431487083435, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3375027", "time": "02:55:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375027", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "218051", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "302611", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "score": 5}, {"id": "304976", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "score": 3}, {"id": "305661", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "score": 2}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 4}, {"id": "309397", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "score": 5}, {"id": "309398", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "score": 5}, {"id": "309400", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "score": 2}, {"id": "309405", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Safety (American and Canadian football position)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)", "score": 2}, {"id": "310129", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "End zone"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "score": 3}, {"id": "312016", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "score": 3}, {"id": "312020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end", "score": 2}, {"id": "324224", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "score": 4}, {"id": "325074", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "score": 4}, {"id": "326127", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Down (American and Canadian football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_(American_and_Canadian_football)", "score": 4}, {"id": "328983", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Johnathan Joseph"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnathan_Joseph", "score": 3}, {"id": "328991", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "J.

He had two receptions for 66 yards and ran for 10 yards and a 4-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. His best moment came when he grabbed a short pass from Watson and broke several tackles en route to a 63-yard gain that set up Watson's touchdown in the third quarter.\n\nWATT'S UP\n\nHouston defensive end J.J. Watt played just one series, but it was long enough to provide one of the highlights of the night. Watt, who is returning from back surgery which cost him 13 games last season, leveled Burkhead for a 2-yard loss on New England's opening possession for his first tackle of the season.\n\nSITTING OUT\n\nHouston outside linebacker Jadeveon Clowney and receiver DeAndre Hopkins did not play after both players appeared in the first preseason game. It appears to be a precautionary move since the team hasn't acknowledged injuries to either player. Patriots running back Mike Gillislee sat out for the second straight week with a hamstring injury.

The march ended with a 22-yard catch-and-run touchdown to running back Rex Burkhead. Brady went 6 of 9 for 67 yards, with one touchdown and no interceptions.\n\nBrady's workload should increase in next Friday's road game against the Detroit Lions, as coach Bill Belichick sometimes plays starters into the third quarter of the team's third preseason game so they can build their stamina and experience what it's like to come out of the locker room after halftime and go back on the field.\n\nSome thoughts and notes from the game:\n\nThat guy could start: Burkhead, who spent the first four years of his career as a backup in Cincinnati, looked like a nice fit in the Patriots offense as a dual threat. He showed decisiveness and toughness when running between the tackles and sure hands as a pass-catcher in finishing with 20 yards on seven carries and 50 yards on three receptions. The 5-foot-10, 210-pound Burkhead didn't play in the preseason opener, which was a coach's decision reflecting that he is a big part of the team's plans. With fellow running back Mike Gillislee still sidelined with a reported hamstring injury, Burkhead is making a case to be the Patriots' top running back in what figures to be a committee-type approach.\n\nGronkowski surprise: The biggest surprise of the night was that tight end Rob Gronkowski played in his first preseason game since 2012. In all, he was on the field for 15 of the team's first 17 snaps, but was never targeted with a catchable pass. He came out of the game injury-free.\n\nRoberts a notable injury: It is sometimes said that a successful preseason game is one in which there are no major injuries. The Patriots didn't come out of Saturday night unscathed as second-year linebacker Elandon Roberts was carted to the locker room in the third quarter. He appeared to be in significant pain, hunched over after taking a blow to his ribs on a 63-yard catch-and-run reception by running back D'Onta Foreman.\n\nOne reason to be concerned: The team is thin at defensive end after top draft pick Derek Rivers sustained a season-ending torn ACL on Wednesday. That might have factored into the thinking in the Patriots not having Trey Flowers play on Saturday night. Flowers led them with seven sacks last season, and there is plenty of uncertainty at the position after him. Another defensive end, Geneo Grissom, didn't suit up as he appeared to be testing out an undisclosed injury before the game.\n\nRookie watch: Undrafted linebacker/defensive end Harvey Langi (Brigham Young) started and played deep into the game, as the Patriots continue to evaluate him for a possible spot on the 53-man roster. The 6-foot-2, 252-pound Langi had some struggles in containment on the edge, but his aggressive, physical style has obviously made an impression for him to rise up the depth chart this quickly. He could benefit from the team's current shortage at defensive end and some injuries at linebacker.\n\nWhen it was starters vs. starters, the Patriots looked ...: Not great on defense, as cornerback Malcolm Butler had some struggles playing the ball. Texans quarterback Tom Savage was 8 of 9 for 98 yards, with one touchdown and no interceptions, as he put a firmer grip on his hold of Houston's starting job. Offensively, Brady got it going on the team's second drive, which almost ended after one play on an interception along the sideline. But the pick was overturned on replay.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T04:02:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.658823549747467, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3375027", "time": "04:02:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375027", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "194027", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "198406", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302611", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "score": 5}, {"id": "302622", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "score": 3}, {"id": "304975", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "score": 1}, {"id": "304976", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "score": 3}, {"id": "305794", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "score": 3}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 4}, {"id": "309398", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "score": 5}, {"id": "309400", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "score": 2}, {"id": "310743", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "score": 2}, {"id": "310749", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "score": 3}, {"id": "312020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end", "score": 2}, {"id": "312092", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "score": 3}, {"id": "316239", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "score": 3}, {"id": "323465", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "score": 3}, {"id": "324224", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "score": 5}, {"id": "325074", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "score": 4}, {"id": "336937", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "score": 2}, {"id": "341274", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans", "score": 5}, {"id": "342452", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brigham Young"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_Young", "score": 2}, {"id": "349556", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NRG Stadium"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRG_Stadium", "score": 3}, {"id": "357382", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "score": 3}, {"id": "362083", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of American football"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_American_football", "score": 2}, {"id": "366933", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "score": 4}, {"id": "696221", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mike Gillislee"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Gillislee", "score": 3}, {"id": "718433", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Rex Burkhead"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Burkhead", "score": 3}, {"id": "1274551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Trey Flowers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trey_Flowers", "score": 2}, {"id": "1275238", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Malcolm Butler (American football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Butler_(American_football)", "score": 1}], "image": "http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0819%2Fr246353_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "wgt": 1, "timeCrawl": "04:02:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Tom Brady ends night on a high note in return to Super Bowl site", "originalArticle": null}], "pages": 14}}}

He sat out last week and was 6 of 9 for 67 yards while directing the offense for two possessions against the Texans.\n\nThe Patriots punted on their first drive before Brady connected with Rex Burkhead on a 22-yard touchdown throw that tied it at 7-7 early in the second quarter. His performance came in his return to Houston after leading the Patriots back from a 25-point third-quarter deficit to a 34-28 overtime win against the Atlanta Falcons to earn his fourth Super Bowl MVP trophy here in February.\n\nIt was a far different environment than the previous time the Patriots were at NRG Stadium, but there was a reminder of their big win as remnants of red and blue confetti from the Super Bowl postgame celebration remained in the phone banks near their bench.\n\nRob Gronkowski also made his season debut for the Patriots, playing about 15 snaps, but not catching a pass, in his first preseason appearance since 2012. Julian Edelman and Brandin Cooks also played after sitting out last week and Cooks had a 7-yard reception.\n\nHouston quarterback Tom Savage was effective in two drives, going 8 for 9 for 98 yards with a 2-yard touchdown pass to Jaelen Strong that put the Texans up 7-0 in the first quarter.\n\n\"I'm really, really comfortable with this offense,\" Savage said. \"We have a lot of talent out there and a lot of the guys are making some big plays for me and it's been awesome.\"\n\nTexans rookie first-round pick Deshaun Watson, who had 179 yards passing last week, threw for 102 yards and ran for a 2-yard touchdown in about two quarters of work.\n\nJimmy Garoppolo was 15 of 23 for 145 yards with a touchdown and an interception after taking over for Brady.\n\nROOKIE WATCH\n\nHouston third-round pick D'Onta Foreman, who won the Doak Walker Award as the nation's best college running back last season, had another solid game, after rushing for 76 yards last week. He had two receptions for 66 yards and ran for 10 yards and a 4-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. His best moment came when he grabbed a short pass from Watson and broke several tackles en route to a 63-yard gain that set up Watson's touchdown in the third quarter.\n\nWATT'S UP\n\nHouston defensive end J.J. Watt played just one series, but it was long enough to provide one of the highlights of the night. Watt, who is returning from back surgery which cost him 13 games last season, leveled Burkhead for a 2-yard loss on New England's opening possession for his first tackle of the season.\n\nSITTING OUT\n\nHouston outside linebacker Jadeveon Clowney and receiver DeAndre Hopkins did not play after both players appeared in the first preseason game. It appears to be a precautionary move since the team hasn't acknowledged injuries to either player. Patriots running back Mike Gillislee sat out for the second straight week with a hamstring injury.

He sat out last week and was 6 of 9 for 67 yards while directing the offense for two possessions against the Texans.\n\nThe Patriots punted on their first drive before Brady connected with Rex Burkhead on a 22-yard touchdown throw that tied it at 7-7 early in the second quarter. His performance came in his return to Houston after leading the Patriots back from a 25-point third-quarter deficit to a 34-28 overtime win against the Atlanta Falcons to earn his fourth Super Bowl MVP trophy here in February.\n\nIt was a far different environment than the previous time the Patriots were at NRG Stadium, but there was a reminder of their big win as remnants of red and blue confetti from the Super Bowl postgame celebration remained in the phone banks near their bench.\n\nRob Gronkowski also made his season debut for the Patriots, playing about 15 snaps, but not catching a pass, in his first preseason appearance since 2012. Julian Edelman and Brandin Cooks also played after sitting out last week and Cooks had a 7-yard reception.\n\nHouston quarterback Tom Savage was effective in two drives, going 8 for 9 for 98 yards with a 2-yard touchdown pass to Jaelen Strong that put the Texans up 7-0 in the first quarter.\n\n\"I'm really, really comfortable with this offense,\" Savage said. \"We have a lot of talent out there and a lot of the guys are making some big plays for me and it's been awesome.\"\n\nTexans rookie first-round pick Deshaun Watson, who had 179 yards passing last week, threw for 102 yards and ran for a 2-yard touchdown in about two quarters of work.\n\nJimmy Garoppolo was 15 of 23 for 145 yards with a touchdown and an interception after taking over for Brady.\n\nROOKIE WATCH\n\nHouston third-round pick D'Onta Foreman, who won the Doak Walker Award as the nation's best college running back last season, had another solid game, after rushing for 76 yards last week. He had two receptions for 66 yards and ran for 10 yards and a 4-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. His best moment came when he grabbed a short pass from Watson and broke several tackles en route to a 63-yard gain that set up Watson's touchdown in the third quarter.\n\nWATT'S UP\n\nHouston defensive end J.J. Watt played just one series, but it was long enough to provide one of the highlights of the night. Watt, who is returning from back surgery which cost him 13 games last season, leveled Burkhead for a 2-yard loss on New England's opening possession for his first tackle of the season.\n\nSITTING OUT\n\nHouston outside linebacker Jadeveon Clowney and receiver DeAndre Hopkins did not play after both players appeared in the first preseason game. It appears to be a precautionary move since the team hasn't acknowledged injuries to either player. Patriots running back Mike Gillislee sat out for the second straight week with a hamstring injury. New England linebacker Elandon Roberts injured his ribs in the second half and didn't return.\n\n\u00a9 2017 Associated Press\n\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T04:04:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.9333333373069763, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3375027", "time": "04:04:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375027", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "198406", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302611", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "score": 5}, {"id": "302622", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "score": 2}, {"id": "302691", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "score": 4}, {"id": "302733", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "score": 3}, {"id": "304050", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "score": 2}, {"id": "304415", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Red"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red", "score": 3}, {"id": "304754", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "score": 1}, {"id": "304976", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "score": 2}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 3}, {"id": "309225", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "score": 5}, {"id": "309397", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "score": 3}, {"id": "309398", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "score": 5}, {"id": "309400", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "score": 1}, {"id": "310219", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "score": 3}, {"id": "310749", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "score": 2}, {"id": "312016", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "score": 3}, {"id": "324223", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rush (gridiron football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(gridiron_football)", "score": 2}, {"id": "324224", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "score": 2}, {"id": "325074", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "score": 4}, {"id": "325513", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Punt (gridiron football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)", "score": 3}, {"id": "328987", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of Houston Texans seasons"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Houston_Texans_seasons", "score": 4}, {"id": "328991", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "J.

New England linebacker Elandon Roberts injured his ribs in the second half and didn't return.\n\n\u00a9 2017 Associated Press\n\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T04:04:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.9333333373069763, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3375027", "time": "04:04:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375027", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "198406", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302611", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "score": 5}, {"id": "302622", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "score": 2}, {"id": "302691", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "score": 4}, {"id": "302733", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "score": 3}, {"id": "304050", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "score": 2}, {"id": "304415", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Red"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red", "score": 3}, {"id": "304754", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "score": 1}, {"id": "304976", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "score": 2}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 3}, {"id": "309225", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "score": 5}, {"id": "309397", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "score": 3}, {"id": "309398", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "score": 5}, {"id": "309400", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "score": 1}, {"id": "310219", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "score": 3}, {"id": "310749", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "score": 2}, {"id": "312016", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman", "score": 3}, {"id": "324223", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rush (gridiron football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(gridiron_football)", "score": 2}, {"id": "324224", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "score": 2}, {"id": "325074", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "score": 4}, {"id": "325513", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Punt (gridiron football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)", "score": 3}, {"id": "328987", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of Houston Texans seasons"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Houston_Texans_seasons", "score": 4}, {"id": "328991", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "J.

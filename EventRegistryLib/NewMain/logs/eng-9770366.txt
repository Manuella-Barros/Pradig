The growth in the first six months of this year puts the city on track for a record performance in 2024. Guided by the visionary leadership of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, and driven by DET's efforts in collaboration with stakeholders, the rise in international visitation aligns with the ambitious goal of the Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to further consolidate Dubai's position as a leading global destination for business and leisure.\n\nHis Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence of the UAE, and Chairman of The Executive Council of Dubai, said: \"Guided by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's strategic vision, Dubai's tourism sector continues to demonstrate its robust growth potential and attractive proposition for global travellers. With its sustained growth, Dubai is setting the standard for cities worldwide, in line with the objective of the Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to establish Dubai as one of the world's top urban economies.\" His Highness urged all industry stakeholders to expand partnerships with key markets, explore new opportunities and work to enhance Dubai's value offering by creating rich and memorable experiences.\n\n\"The strong tourism growth achieved by Dubai in the first half of 2024 is testament to the city's ability to foster productive public-private partnerships and build extensive global networks of collaboration. With every year, Dubai continues to consolidate its status as a frontrunner in the global tourism landscape and grow in popularity as an international destination. We remain committed to maintaining this successful trajectory and boosting the tourism sector's contribution to Dubai's GDP. By further developing our infrastructure and providing exceptional services for visitors, we aim to set new benchmarks and records in 2024,\" HH Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed added.\n\nGlobal accolades and industry events\n\nThe rise in international visitation during H1 2024 is the result of citywide strategies established across key tourism pillars, created and implemented in partnership with stakeholders across the public and private sectors. Beyond the growth demonstrated through the performance, these efforts also yielded international recognition. Starting 2024 on a high note, Dubai was named the No.1 global destination for an unprecedented third successive year in the Tripadvisor Travellers' Choice Awards in January, making it the first city to achieve this unique accolade. The first half of the year also saw Dubai named the Middle East's leading destination by the World Travel Awards, while Dubai International Airport and Mina Rashid were named the Middle East's leading airport and leading cruise port for 2024 respectively.\n\nHis Excellency Helal Saeed Almarri, Director General of Dubai Department of Economy and Tourism (DET), said: \"The significant increase in visitation numbers in the first half of 2024 reflects the vision and leadership of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, and aligns with the D33 Agenda's objective to make Dubai the world's best city to visit, live, and work in. This robust performance, reinforced by global recognition, validates the ambition and agility driving Dubai's tourism and wider economy. Our success stems from a diversified market approach, strong public-private partnerships, liberal visa policies, and alternative growth pathways, all catalysts for the continued surge in both leisure and business visitation, along with increasing levels of investment and inflows of global talent. Looking ahead, we are committed to sustaining and building upon this trajectory, leveraging diverse source markets to enhance tourism's contribution to Dubai's GDP.\"\n\nKey source markets\n\nIn collaboration with domestic stakeholders and more than 3,000 global partners in 80 markets, DET's targeted campaigns resulted in Dubai achieving impressive growth in key markets in the first half of 2024. With bespoke strategies and activities highlighting the city's unique offering, dynamic appeal and connectivity, Dubai has maintained its position as a first-choice travel destination for visitors both from key traditional and emerging markets.\n\nFrom January to June 2024, proximity markets in GCC and MENA had a combined 26% share of overall visitors, with 1.27 million (14%) and 1.09 million (12%) arrivals respectively. Western Europe accounted for 20% of visitors to Dubai, with 1.89 million in total. South Asia was another major source market, with 1.62 million visitors (17%), as was CIS and Eastern Europe with 1.37 million (15%). North-East and South-East Asia grew from an 8% share at the beginning of the year to a 10% share (896,000) of total visitors by the end of H1 2024, driven by strong recovery from China. Other regions also saw a rise in visitation to Dubai, including the Americas with 617,000 (7%), Africa with 404,000 (4%) and Australasia with 154,000 (2%).\n\nHotels and hospitality\n\nWorld-class hotels and accommodation continue to be one of the core pillars of Dubai's destination offering. Adding to the city's appeal for global visitors, the first half of the year saw a number of high-profile openings including: The Lana, Dorchester Collection's first Middle East property; SIRO One Za'abeel, Dubai's first fitness hotel; and Hilton Dubai Creek Hotel & Residences. The city's accommodation portfolio will continue to grow with new openings planned throughout the rest of the year, as part of a strategic approach to expanding inventory to meet demand and ensure Dubai offers visitors a wide range of options across different categories and price points.\n\nAccording to DET's latest data, the emirate's hotel sector continued to perform well across all hospitality metrics from January to June, including occupancy, average daily rate (ADR), revenue per available room (RevPAR), and guests' length of stay. Among the highest in the world, Dubai hotels' average occupancy of 78.7% is a slight 1.0 percentage point higher than the 77.7% occupancy achieved for the same period in 2023. Occupied room nights increased by 3%, with 21.35 million at the end of H1 2024, compared to 20.73 million in H1 2023. ADR rose to AED558 during H1, an increase of 4% compared to the same period in 2023, while RevPAR increased by 6% compared to last year, from AED415 to AED439. Meanwhile, total available rooms in Dubai reached 150,879 by the end of June 2024, compared to 148,689 rooms in June 2023, with the number of establishments standing at 823, up from 810 at the same point last year.\n\nHis Excellency Issam Kazim, CEO of the Dubai Corporation for Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DCTCM), said: \"Inspired by the city's visionary leadership and guided by the objectives of the D33 Agenda, Dubai has continued to stay ahead of the curve by further elevating standards with innovative and distinctive world-class infrastructure, experiences and attractions. An exceptional quality of life, safety, and accessibility have been consistently recognised across multiple global indices and we are committed to leveraging partnerships between the public and private sectors to showcase Dubai as a must-visit destination. The unwavering support of our partners and stakeholders will be crucial in driving our strong global and market-specific campaigns this summer, as we look to build on this positive growth throughout the rest of 2024.\"\n\nPartnerships, collaborations and campaigns\n\nIn collaboration with its stakeholders and partners, DET continues to create new growth pathways beyond traditional tourism, through investment, entrepreneurship, and attracting global talent, ensuring the city remains a hub of creativity, innovation, and technological advancement. Global campaigns and partnerships also continue to be a key focus for the city, with ongoing initiatives including 'Where will Dubai take you now?', a music-led promotion by The Greatest Showman director Michael Gracey which takes viewers to every corner of the emirate, and the 'Drop by Dubai' programme, which promotes Dubai as the perfect stopover destination.\n\nAmong the major attractions to open in the first half of the year was Real Madrid World at Dubai Parks and Resorts, the first theme park in the world to be operating under the branding of the famed Spanish football club. The opening aligns with wider collaborative efforts between the club and Dubai, including a multi-year agreement signed between DET and Real Madrid in October 2023.\n\nDubai has also established ongoing partnerships with major names in the music and entertainment fields, including Academy Award-winning composer Hans Zimmer, who has become a vocal supporter of the emirate. Meanwhile, in the realm of gastronomy, Dubai had its own 50-minute episode on season seven of Somebody Feed Phil, a food travel show on Netflix where Phil Rosenthal tours restaurants across major global cities.\n\nA global culinary and cruise hub\n\nDubai's position as a world gastronomy capital was further reinforced after the third edition of the MICHELIN Guide Dubai was unveiled in July. The guide featured 106 restaurants, up from 90 in 2023, including four that were awarded two stars, 15 with one star, three with a green star, 18 Bib Gourmands, and 69 MICHELIN-selected restaurants. On the World's 50 Best Restaurants 2024 list, Tr\u00e8sind Studio was ranked at No.13 and named the best restaurant in the Middle East, while Orfali Bros Bistro was ranked at No.64 on the extended list. Dubai is also placed at No.9 on Time Out's 2024 ranking of 'the world's 20 best cities for food right now'.\n\nThe ongoing expansion of the cruise sector is also seeing significant benefits for Dubai, and in the 2023/2024 winter season from October to April the emirate welcomed more than 132 ship calls between Mina Rashid and Dubai Harbour. In March at ITB in Berlin, Dubai joined forces with other regional maritime and tourism authorities to formalise the strategic Cruise Arabia alliance, to promote the Arabian Gulf as a cruise ship destination globally.\n\nInternational events destination\n\nDubai's status as a global entertainment hub is bolstered by a year-round calendar of business, leisure and sporting events, which continue to attract international tourists. Organised by Dubai Festivals and Retail Establishment (DFRE), some of Dubai's biggest annual events were held during the first half of the year, including Dubai Shopping Festival, Chinese New Year, Ramadan in Dubai, Eid in Dubai, the Great Online Sale, and Dubai Food Festival. The ongoing Dubai Summer Surprises is one of Dubai's major shopping and entertainment events which makes the city as lively and vibrant in the summer season as it is during all other times of the year, further reinforcing Dubai's position as a leading summer destination for families. Upcoming events throughout the rest of 2024 include Dubai Fashion Season Fall/Winter, Dubai Fitness Challenge, and UAE Union Day.\n\nBusiness events also played a critical role - both through the major homegrown trade shows the city hosts annually, as well as the conferences and meetings brought to the city as a result of bidding activity driven by Dubai Business Events, part of DET and the city's official convention bureau. So far this year, Dubai has hosted a number of major industry exhibitions and shows that have attracted thousands of visitors and exhibitors, including Gulfood (150,000 attendees), Arabian Travel Market (46,000 attendees), and the landmark 30th Dubai International Boat Show (more than 1,000 brands and 200 boats).\n\nInclusivity and accessibility\n\nIn pursuing the goals of the D33 Agenda, Dubai is committed to enhancing the quality of life for People of Determination. Major attractions like Burj Khalifa, Dubai Mall and Jumeirah Beach have comprehensive accessibility measures for physical and hidden disabilities like dedicated spaces, ramps, elevators, provision of hearing loops and resizable menus.\n\nIn April, it was announced that Dubai is on record pace towards becoming a Certified Autism Destination\u2122, with efforts across the city, driven by DET, putting it firmly on track to becoming the first Certified Autism Destination\u2122 in the Eastern Hemisphere. Attractions such as Dubai Aquarium, Dubai Ice Rink, The Green Planet, Motiongate, Woo-hoo, and Atlantis Aquaventure have successfully obtained Certified Autism Center\u2122 (CAC) status, awarded by IBCCES, while key hotel groups like Emaar Hospitality and Atlantis have also demonstrated commitment through investing in workforce training to secure their CAC status.\n\nSustainability initiatives\n\nThe UAE's 'Year of Sustainability' was extended into 2024 and Dubai's tourism and hospitality sectors continued to spearhead the city's ecotourism strategy. Released by DET in May, the inaugural 'Dubai Sustainability Report' highlighted the development plans and achievements that support global objectives such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals 2030, and country-wide strategies including the UAE's Net Zero 2050 initiative.\n\nAs part of DET's ongoing Dubai Sustainable Tourism drive, the Dubai Sustainable Tourism Stamp was awarded to 70 hotels in January, with more to be named in the coming months. The stamp recognises hotels with the highest level of adherence to DET's '19 Sustainability Requirements', through a three-tier scheme with Gold, Silver and Bronze categories.\n\nAnother major citywide sustainability initiative is Dubai Can, which is aligned with efforts to transform the emirate into a leading sustainable destination and the best city in the world to visit, work and live in. Since its launch in February 2022 by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai Can, through its 'Refill for Life' campaign, has seen the reduction in the usage of an equivalent of more than 20.4 million 500 ml single-use plastic water bottles and 10.5 million litres of water dispensed via 50 water fountains located throughout the city. Another major milestone for Dubai's sustainability drive in H1 2024 was the launch of Dubai Reef's pilot reef modules in April. Part of Dubai Can, Dubai Reef is the world's largest marine reef development project, with 20,000 modules set to be deployed across 600 square kilometres of Dubai's waters by 2027.\n\nTo read DET's

The growth in the first six months of this year puts the city on track for a record performance in 2024.\n\nGuided by the visionary leadership of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, and driven by DET's efforts in collaboration with stakeholders, the rise in international visitation aligns with the ambitious goal of the Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to further consolidate Dubai's position as a leading global destination for business and leisure.\n\nSheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, and Chairman of The Executive Council of Dubai, said, \"Guided by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum's strategic vision, Dubai's tourism sector continues to demonstrate its robust growth potential and attractive proposition for global travellers. With its sustained growth, Dubai is setting the standard for cities worldwide, in line with the objective of the Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to establish Dubai as one of the world's top urban economies. His Highness urged all industry stakeholders to expand partnerships with key markets, explore new opportunities and work to enhance Dubai's value offering by creating rich and memorable experiences.\"\n\n\"The strong tourism growth achieved by Dubai in the first half of 2024 is testament to the city's ability to foster productive public-private partnerships and build extensive global networks of collaboration.

We remain committed to maintaining this successful trajectory and boosting the tourism sector's contribution to Dubai's GDP. By further developing our infrastructure and providing exceptional services for visitors, we aim to set new benchmarks and records in 2024,\" Sheikh Hamdan added.\n\nGlobal accolades and industry events\n\nThe rise in international visitation during H1 2024 is the result of citywide strategies established across key tourism pillars, created and implemented in partnership with stakeholders across the public and private sectors. Beyond the growth demonstrated through the performance, these efforts also yielded international recognition.\n\nStarting 2024 on a high note, Dubai was named the No.1 global destination for an unprecedented third successive year in the Tripadvisor Travellers' Choice Awards in January, making it the first city to achieve this unique accolade. The first half of the year also saw Dubai named the Middle East's leading destination by the World Travel Awards, while Dubai International Airport and Mina Rashid were named the Middle East's leading airport and leading cruise port for 2024 respectively.\n\nHelal Saeed Almarri, Director-General of DET, said, \"The significant increase in visitation numbers in the first half of 2024 reflects the vision and leadership of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, and aligns with the D33 Agenda's objective to make Dubai the world's best city to visit, live, and work in. This robust performance, reinforced by global recognition, validates the ambition and agility driving Dubai's tourism and wider economy. Our success stems from a diversified market approach, strong public-private partnerships, liberal visa policies, and alternative growth pathways, all catalysts for the continued surge in both leisure and business visitation, along with increasing levels of investment and inflows of global talent. Looking ahead, we are committed to sustaining and building upon this trajectory, leveraging diverse source markets to enhance tourism's contribution to Dubai's GDP.\"\n\nKey source markets\n\nIn collaboration with domestic stakeholders and more than 3,000 global partners in 80 markets, DET's targeted campaigns resulted in Dubai achieving impressive growth in key markets in the first half of 2024. With bespoke strategies and activities highlighting the city's unique offering, dynamic appeal and connectivity, Dubai has maintained its position as a first-choice travel destination for visitors both from key traditional and emerging markets.\n\nFrom January to June 2024, proximity markets in GCC and MENA had a comBined 26 per cent share of overall visitors, with 1.27 million (14 per cent) and 1.09 million (12 per cent) arrivals respectively. Western Europe accounted for 20 per cent of visitors to Dubai, with 1.89 million in total. South Asia was another major source market, with 1.62 million visitors (17 per cent), as was CIS and Eastern Europe with 1.37 million (15 per cent). North-East and South-East Asia grew from an 8 per cent share at the beginning of the year to a 10 per cent share (896,000) of total visitors by the end of H1 2024, driven by strong recovery from China. Other regions also saw a rise in visitation to Dubai, including the Americas with 617,000 (7 per cent), Africa with 404,000 (4 per cent) and Australasia with 154,000 (2 per cent).\n\nHotels and hospitality\n\nWorld-class hotels and accommodation continue to be one of the core pillars of Dubai's destination offering. Adding to the city's appeal for global visitors, the first half of the year saw a number of high-profile openings including: The Lana, Dorchester Collection's first Middle East property; SIRO One Za'abeel, Dubai's first fitness hotel; and Hilton Dubai Creek Hotel & Residences. The city's accommodation portfolio will continue to grow with new openings planned throughout the rest of the year, as part of a strategic approach to expanding inventory to meet demand and ensure Dubai offers visitors a wide range of options across different categories and price points.\n\nAccording to DET's latest data, the emirate's hotel sector continued to perform well across all hospitality metrics from January to June, including occupancy, average daily rate (ADR), revenue per available room (RevPAR), and guests' length of stay. Among the highest in the world, Dubai hotels' average occupancy of 78.7 per cent is a slight 1.0 per centage point higher than the 77.7 per cent occupancy achieved for the same period in 2023.\n\nOccupied room nights increased by 3 per cent, with 21.35 million at the end of H1 2024, compared to 20.73 million in H1 2023. ADR rose to AED558 during H1, an increase of 4 per cent compared to the same period in 2023, while RevPAR increased by 6 per cent compared to last year, from AED415 to AED439. Meanwhile, total available rooms in Dubai reached 150,879 by the end of June 2024, compared to 148,689 rooms in June 2023, with the number of establishments standing at 823, up from 810 at the same point last year.\n\nIssam Kazim, CEO of the Dubai Corporation for Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DCTCM), said: \"Inspired by the city's visionary leadership and guided by the objectives of the D33 Agenda, Dubai has continued to stay ahead of the curve by further elevating standards with innovative and distinctive world-class infrastructure, experiences and attractions.\n\nAn exceptional quality of life, safety, and accessibility have been consistently recognised across multiple global indices and we are committed to leveraging partnerships between the public and private sectors to showcase Dubai as a must-visit destination. The unwavering support of our partners and stakeholders will be crucial in driving our strong global and market-specific campaigns this summer, as we look to build on this positive growth throughout the rest of 2024.\"\n\nPartnerships, collaborations and campaigns\n\nIn collaboration with its stakeholders and partners, DET continues to create new growth pathways beyond traditional tourism, through investment, entrepreneurship, and attracting global talent, ensuring the city remains a hub of creativity, innovation, and technological advancement. Global campaigns and partnerships also continue to be a key focus for the city, with ongoing initiatives including 'Where will Dubai take you now?', a music-led promotion by The Greatest Showman director Michael Gracey which takes viewers to every corner of the emirate, and the 'Drop by Dubai' programme, which promotes Dubai as the perfect stopover destination.\n\nAmong the major attractions to open in the first half of the year was Real Madrid World at Dubai Parks and Resorts, the first theme park in the world to be operating under the branding of the famed Spanish football club. The opening aligns with wider collaborative efforts between the club and Dubai, including a multi-year agreement signed between DET and Real Madrid in October 2023.\n\nDubai has also established ongoing partnerships with major names in the music and entertainment fields, including Academy Award-winning composer Hans Zimmer, who has become a vocal supporter of the emirate. Meanwhile, in the realm of gastronomy, Dubai had its own 50-minute episode on season seven of Somebody Feed Phil, a food travel show on Netflix where Phil Rosenthal tours restaurants across major global cities.\n\nA global culinary and cruise hub\n\nDubai's position as a world gastronomy capital was further reinforced after the third edition of the MICHELIN Guide Dubai was unveiled in July. The guide featured 106 restaurants, up from 90 in 2023, including four that were awarded two stars, 15 with one star, three with a green star, 18 Bib Gourmands, and 69 MICHELIN-selected restaurants. On the World's 50 Best Restaurants 2024 list, Tr\u00e8sind Studio was ranked at No.13 and named the best restaurant in the Middle East, while Orfali Bros Bistro was ranked at No.64 on the extended list. Dubai is also placed at No.9 on Time Out's 2024 ranking of 'the world's 20 best cities for food right now'.\n\nThe ongoing expansion of the cruise sector is also seeing significant benefits for Dubai, and in the 2023/2024 winter season from October to April the emirate welcomed more than 132 ship calls between Mina Rashid and Dubai Harbour. In March at ITB in Berlin, Dubai joined forces with other regional maritime and tourism authorities to formalise the strategic Cruise Arabia alliance, to promote the Arabian Gulf as a cruise ship destination globally.\n\nInternational events destination\n\nDubai's status as a global entertainment hub is bolstered by a year-round calendar of business, leisure and sporting events, which continue to attract international tourists. Organised by Dubai Festivals and Retail Establishment (DFRE), some of Dubai's biggest annual events were held during the first half of the year, including Dubai Shopping Festival, Chinese New Year, Ramadan in Dubai, Eid in Dubai, the Great Online Sale, and Dubai Food Festival.\n\nThe ongoing Dubai Summer Surprises is one of Dubai's major shopping and entertainment events which makes the city as lively and vibrant in the summer season as it is during all other times of the year, further reinforcing Dubai's position as a leading summer destination for families. Upcoming events throughout the rest of 2024 include Dubai Fashion Season Fall/Winter, Dubai Fitness Challenge, and UAE Union Day.\n\nBusiness events also played a critical role - both through the major homegrown trade shows the city hosts annually, as well as the conferences and meetings brought to the city as a result of bidding activity driven by Dubai Business Events, part of DET and the city's official convention bureau. So far this year, Dubai has hosted a number of major industry exhibitions and shows that have attracted thousands of visitors and exhibitors, including Gulfood (150,000 attendees), Arabian Travel Market (46,000 attendees), and the landmark 30th Dubai International Boat Show (more than 1,000 brands and 200 boats).\n\nInclusivity and accessibility\n\nIn pursuing the goals of the D33 Agenda, Dubai is committed to enhancing the quality of life for People of Determination. Major attractions like Burj Khalifa, Dubai Mall and Jumeirah Beach have comprehensive accessibility measures for physical and hidden disabilities like dedicated spaces, ramps, elevators, provision of hearing loops and resizable menus.\n\nIn April, it was announced that Dubai is on record pace towards becoming a Certified Autism Destination, with efforts across the city, driven by DET, putting it firmly on track to becoming the first Certified Autism Destination in the Eastern Hemisphere. Attractions such as Dubai Aquarium, Dubai Ice Rink, The Green Planet, Motiongate, Woo-hoo, and Atlantis Aquaventure have successfully obtained Certified Autism Center (CAC) status, awarded by IBCCES, while key hotel groups like Emaar Hospitality and Atlantis have also demonstrated commitment through investing in workforce training to secure their CAC status.\n\nSustainability initiatives\n\nThe UAE's 'Year of Sustainability' was extended into 2024 and Dubai's tourism and hospitality sectors continued to spearhead the city's ecotourism strategy. Released by DET in May, the inaugural 'Dubai Sustainability Report' highlighted the development plans and achievements that support global objectives such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals 2030, and country-wide strategies including the UAE's Net Zero 2050 initiative.\n\nAs part of DET's ongoing Dubai Sustainable Tourism drive, the Dubai Sustainable Tourism Stamp was awarded to 70 hotels in January, with more to be named in the coming months. The stamp recognises hotels with the highest level of adherence to DET's '19 Sustainability Requirements', through a three-tier scheme with Gold, Silver and Bronze categories.\n\nAnother major citywide sustainability initiative is Dubai Can, which is aligned with efforts to transform the emirate into a leading sustainable destination and the best city in the world to visit, work and live in. Since its launch in February 2022 by H.H. Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai Can, through its 'Refill for Life' campaign, has seen the reduction in the usage of an equivalent of more than 20.4 million 500 ml single-use plastic water bottles and 10.5 million litres of water dispensed via 50 water fountains located throughout the city.\n\nAnother major milestone for Dubai's sustainability drive in H1 2024 was the launch of Dubai Reef's pilot reef modules in April. Part of Dubai Can, Dubai Reef is the world's largest marine reef development project, with 20,000 modules set to be deployed across 600 square kilometres of Dubai's waters by 2027.", "source": {"uri":

With tailored strategies showcasing the city's unique offerings, dynamic appeal, and connectivity, Dubai remained a top travel destination for visitors from both traditional and emerging markets.\n\nFrom January to June 2024, visitors from GCC and MENA regions made up a combined 26% of the total, with 1.27 million (14%) and 1.09 million (12%) arrivals respectively. Western Europe contributed 20% of visitors, totaling 1.89 million. South Asia was another significant market, with 1.62 million visitors (17%), while CIS and Eastern Europe accounted for 1.37 million visitors (15%). North-East and South-East Asia saw growth, with their share increasing from 8% at the start of the year to 10% (896,000) by the end of the first half, largely driven by a strong recovery from China.

This includes fostering investment, encouraging entrepreneurship, and attracting global talent, all aimed at cementing the city's status as a hub of creativity, innovation, and technological advancement. Global campaigns and partnerships remain a central focus, with initiatives like 'Where will Dubai take you now?' -- a music-led promotion by The Greatest Showman director Michael Gracey that showcases various parts of the emirate -- and the 'Drop by Dubai' program, promoting the city as an ideal stopover destination.\n\nA major highlight of the first half of the year was the opening of Real Madrid World at Dubai Parks and Resorts, the world's first theme park under the branding of the iconic Spanish football club. This opening is part of broader collaborative efforts, including a multi-year agreement signed between DET and Real Madrid in October 2023.\n\nDubai has also established partnerships with prominent figures in the music and entertainment industries. Notably, Academy Award-winning composer Hans Zimmer has become a vocal advocate for the emirate. In the culinary scene, Dubai was featured in a 50-minute episode of the seventh season of Somebody Feed Phil, a Netflix food travel show where Phil Rosenthal explores restaurants in major global cities.\n\nDubai's reputation as a world-renowned culinary destination was further solidified with the release of the third edition of the MICHELIN Guide Dubai in July. This edition featured 106 restaurants, up from 90 in 2023, including four with two stars, 15 with one star, three with a green star, 18 Bib Gourmands, and 69 MICHELIN-selected restaurants. On the World's 50 Best Restaurants 2024 list, Tr\u00e8sind Studio ranked No.13 and was named the best restaurant in the Middle East, while Orfali Bros Bistro ranked No.64 on the extended list. Dubai also secured the No.9 spot on Time Out's 2024 list of 'the world's 20 best cities for food right now'.\n\nThe cruise sector in Dubai is also experiencing significant growth. During the 2023/2024 winter season from October to April, the city hosted more than 132 ship calls between Mina Rashid and Dubai Harbour. In March, at ITB in Berlin, Dubai partnered with other regional maritime and tourism authorities to establish the strategic Cruise Arabia alliance, promoting the Arabian Gulf as a premier cruise destination globally.\n\nDubai's status as a global entertainment hub is reinforced by a diverse year-round calendar of business, leisure, and sporting events, attracting international tourists. Organized by the Dubai Festivals and Retail Establishment (DFRE), major annual events during the first half of the year included the Dubai Shopping Festival, Chinese New Year celebrations, Ramadan in Dubai, Eid in Dubai, the Great Online Sale, and the Dubai Food Festival. The ongoing Dubai Summer Surprises continues to make the city lively and vibrant during the summer season, further establishing Dubai as a leading summer destination for families. Upcoming events in 2024 include Dubai Fashion Season Fall/Winter, Dubai Fitness Challenge, and UAE Union Day.\n\nBusiness events also play a crucial role, with major homegrown trade shows and conferences drawing thousands of visitors. Notable events this year included Gulfood, attracting 150,000 attendees, Arabian Travel Market with 46,000 attendees, and the 30th Dubai International Boat Show, featuring over 1,000 brands and 200 boats.\n\nIn line with the goals of the D33 Agenda, Dubai is dedicated to enhancing the quality of life for People of Determination. Major attractions like Burj Khalifa, Dubai Mall, and Jumeirah Beach have implemented comprehensive accessibility measures, including dedicated spaces, ramps, elevators, hearing loops, and resizable menus.\n\nIn April, it was announced that Dubai is making record progress towards becoming a Certified Autism Destination, aiming to be the first in the Eastern Hemisphere. Attractions such as Dubai Aquarium, Dubai Ice Rink, The Green Planet, Motiongate, Woo-hoo, and Atlantis Aquaventure have obtained Certified Autism Center (CAC) status from IBCCES. Key hotel groups like Emaar Hospitality and Atlantis have also committed to securing CAC status through workforce training.\n\nThe UAE's 'Year of Sustainability' continues into 2024, with Dubai's tourism and hospitality sectors leading the city's ecotourism strategy. The inaugural 'Dubai Sustainability Report,' released by DET in May, highlighted development plans and achievements supporting global goals like the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals 2030 and the UAE's Net Zero 2050 initiative.\n\nAs part of the Dubai Sustainable Tourism drive, the Dubai Sustainable Tourism Stamp was awarded to 70 hotels in January, with more to be named soon. This stamp recognizes hotels with the highest adherence to DET's '19 Sustainability Requirements,' through a three-tier scheme of Gold, Silver, and Bronze categories.\n\nAnother major sustainability initiative is Dubai Can, launched by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum in February 2022. The 'Refill for Life' campaign has significantly reduced the use of over 20.4 million 500 ml single-use plastic water bottles and dispensed 10.5 million liters of water via 50 water fountains across the city. A significant milestone in H1 2024 was the launch of Dubai Reef's pilot reef modules in April. Dubai Reef aims to become the world's largest marine reef development project, with 20,000 modules planned across 600 square kilometers of Dubai's waters by 2027.", "source": {"uri":

The combined market value of the companies amounts to around US$ 7 billion.\n\nDuring the first six months of 2024, the chamber trained 243 Emiratis as part of the 'Create Apps in Dubai' initiative, which was launched by H.H. Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, and is led by Dubai Chamber of Digital Economy.\n\nThe chamber also organised a total of 12 international roadshows aimed at promoting Expand North Star. Organised by the Dubai World Trade Centre and hosted by Dubai Chamber of Digital Economy, the event is the world's largest gathering of startups and investors and will take place in October.\n\nIn addition, the chamber further strengthened its presence as an organiser, strategic partner, and active participant in 15 local and international events during the first half of the year.\n\nOmar Sultan Al Olama, Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications, and Chairman of Dubai Chamber of Digital Economy, commented: \"In line with the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai to consolidate the emirate's status as a global capital for digital economy, we are strengthening our efforts to develop an ecosystem that promotes the growth of digital businesses, supports their expansion, and positions Dubai as the global capital of the digital economy. This comes as part of our drive to achieve the objectives of the Dubai Economic Agenda (D33), which seeks to generate an average of AED 100 billion annually for the emirate's economy through digital transformation projects.\"\n\nHe added: \"Dubai Chamber of Digital Economy remains committed to further enhancing Dubai's attractiveness for companies and entrepreneurs operating within all technology-related disciplines. Our impactful programmes and initiatives are designed to develop the infrastructure, regulatory environment, and services available to the digital sector in Dubai.\"\n\n'Create Apps in Dubai' was launched to strengthen digital capabilities in the UAE and has set a target to train 1,000 Emiratis in cooperation with the private sector. The initiative aims to triple the number of app developers in Dubai by 2025 and support 100 new national projects for the development of cutting-edge mobile applications.\n\nSpearheaded by Dubai Chamber of Digital Economy, 'Create Apps in Dubai' seeks to capitalise on emerging growth opportunities in the sector by creating a strong digital infrastructure, establishing a legislative framework that supports application development, and providing government incentives to accelerate the sector's growth, in line with the chamber's strategic objectives.\n\nThe chamber signed four memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with partners during H1 2024 aimed at enhancing Dubai's digital business ecosystem and nurturing the growth of digital enterprises and technology companies. These included an MoU with Enterprise Ireland, an Irish government agency dedicated to trade and innovation that is the largest venture capital institution in Europe by number of deals. The agreement seeks to create a strategic partnership that promotes business opportunities, expansion, and mutual cooperation between companies within the digital sector from Dubai and Ireland.\n\nThe

The growth in the first six months of this year puts the city on track for a record performance in 2024.\n\nGuided by the visionary leadership of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, and driven by DET's efforts in collaboration with stakeholders, the rise in international visitation aligns with the ambitious goal of the Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to further consolidate Dubai's position as a leading global destination for business and leisure.\n\nH.H. Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, and Chairman of The Executive Council of Dubai, said, \"Guided by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's strategic vision, Dubai's tourism sector continues to demonstrate its robust growth potential and attractive proposition for global travellers. With its sustained growth, Dubai is setting the standard for cities worldwide, in line with the objective of the Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to establish Dubai as one of the world's top urban economies. His Highness urged all industry stakeholders to expand partnerships with key markets, explore new opportunities and work to enhance Dubai's value offering by creating rich and memorable experiences.\"\n\n\"The strong tourism growth achieved by Dubai in the first half of 2024 is testament to the city's ability to foster productive public-private partnerships and build extensive global networks of collaboration. With every year, Dubai continues to consolidate its status as a frontrunner in the global tourism landscape and grow in popularity as an international destination. We remain committed to maintaining this successful trajectory and boosting the tourism sector's contribution to Dubai's GDP. By further developing our infrastructure and providing exceptional services for visitors, we aim to set new benchmarks and records in 2024,\" Sheikh Hamdan added.\n\nGlobal accolades and industry events\n\nThe rise in international visitation during H1 2024 is the result of citywide strategies established across key tourism pillars, created and implemented in partnership with stakeholders across the public and private sectors. Beyond the growth demonstrated through the performance, these efforts also yielded international recognition.\n\nStarting 2024 on a high note, Dubai was named the No.1 global destination for an unprecedented third successive year in the Tripadvisor Travellers' Choice Awards in January, making it the first city to achieve this unique accolade. The first half of the year also saw Dubai named the Middle East's leading destination by the World Travel Awards, while Dubai International Airport and Mina Rashid were named the Middle East's leading airport and leading cruise port for 2024 respectively.\n\nHelal Saeed Almarri, Director-General of DET, said, \"The significant increase in visitation numbers in the first half of 2024 reflects the vision and leadership of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, and aligns with the D33 Agenda's objective to make Dubai the world's best city to visit, live, and work in. This robust performance, reinforced by global recognition, validates the ambition and agility driving Dubai's tourism and wider economy. Our success stems from a diversified market approach, strong public-private partnerships, liberal visa policies, and alternative growth pathways, all catalysts for the continued surge in both leisure and business visitation, along with increasing levels of investment and inflows of global talent. Looking ahead, we are committed to sustaining and building upon this trajectory, leveraging diverse source markets to enhance tourism's contribution to Dubai's GDP.\"\n\nKey source markets\n\nIn collaboration with domestic stakeholders and more than 3,000 global partners in 80 markets, DET's targeted campaigns resulted in Dubai achieving impressive growth in key markets in the first half of 2024. With bespoke strategies and activities highlighting the city's unique offering, dynamic appeal and connectivity, Dubai has maintained its position as a first-choice travel destination for visitors both from key traditional and emerging markets.\n\nFrom January to June 2024, proximity markets in GCC and MENA had a combined 26 percent share of overall visitors, with 1.27 million (14 percent) and 1.09 million (12 percent) arrivals respectively. Western Europe accounted for 20 percent of visitors to Dubai, with 1.89 million in total. South Asia was another major source market, with 1.62 million visitors (17 percent), as was CIS and Eastern Europe with 1.37 million (15 percent). North-East and South-East Asia grew from an 8 percent share at the beginning of the year to a 10 percent share (896,000) of total visitors by the end of H1 2024, driven by strong recovery from China. Other regions also saw a rise in visitation to Dubai, including the Americas with 617,000 (7 percent), Africa with 404,000 (4 percent) and Australasia with 154,000 (2 percent).\n\nHotels and hospitality\n\nWorld-class hotels and accommodation continue to be one of the core pillars of Dubai's destination offering. Adding to the city's appeal for global visitors, the first half of the year saw a number of high-profile openings including: The Lana, Dorchester Collection's first Middle East property; SIRO One Za'abeel, Dubai's first fitness hotel; and Hilton Dubai Creek Hotel & Residences. The city's accommodation portfolio will continue to grow with new openings planned throughout the rest of the year, as part of a strategic approach to expanding inventory to meet demand and ensure Dubai offers visitors a wide range of options across different categories and price points.\n\nAccording to DET's latest data, the emirate's hotel sector continued to perform well across all hospitality metrics from January to June, including occupancy, average daily rate (ADR), revenue per available room (RevPAR), and guests' length of stay. Among the highest in the world, Dubai hotels' average occupancy of 78.7 percent is a slight 1.0 percentage point higher than the 77.7 percent occupancy achieved for the same period in 2023.\n\nOccupied room nights increased by 3 percent, with 21.35 million at the end of H1 2024, compared to 20.73 million in H1 2023. ADR rose to AED558 during H1, an increase of 4 percent compared to the same period in 2023, while RevPAR increased by 6 percent compared to last year, from AED415 to AED439. Meanwhile, total available rooms in Dubai reached 150,879 by the end of June 2024, compared to 148,689 rooms in June 2023, with the number of establishments standing at 823, up from 810 at the same point last year.\n\nIssam Kazim, CEO of the Dubai Corporation for Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DCTCM), said: \"Inspired by the city's visionary leadership and guided by the objectives of the D33 Agenda, Dubai has continued to stay ahead of the curve by further elevating standards with innovative and distinctive world-class infrastructure, experiences and attractions.\n\nAn exceptional quality of life, safety, and accessibility have been consistently recognised across multiple global indices and we are committed to leveraging partnerships between the public and private sectors to showcase Dubai as a must-visit destination. The unwavering support of our partners and stakeholders will be crucial in driving our strong global and market-specific campaigns this summer, as we look to build on this positive growth throughout the rest of 2024.\"\n\nPartnerships, collaborations and campaigns\n\nIn collaboration with its stakeholders and partners, DET continues to create new growth pathways beyond traditional tourism, through investment, entrepreneurship, and attracting global talent, ensuring the city remains a hub of creativity, innovation, and technological advancement. Global campaigns and partnerships also continue to be a key focus for the city, with ongoing initiatives including 'Where will Dubai take you now?', a music-led promotion by The Greatest Showman director Michael Gracey which takes viewers to every corner of the emirate, and the 'Drop by Dubai' programme, which promotes Dubai as the perfect stopover destination.\n\nAmong the major attractions to open in the first half of the year was Real Madrid World at Dubai Parks and Resorts, the first theme park in the world to be operating under the branding of the famed Spanish football club. The opening aligns with wider collaborative efforts between the club and Dubai, including a multi-year agreement signed between DET and Real Madrid in October 2023.\n\nDubai has also established ongoing partnerships with major names in the music and entertainment fields, including Academy Award-winning composer Hans Zimmer, who has become a vocal supporter of the emirate. Meanwhile, in the realm of gastronomy, Dubai had its own 50-minute episode on season seven of Somebody Feed Phil, a food travel show on Netflix where Phil Rosenthal tours restaurants across major global cities.\n\nA global culinary and cruise hub\n\nDubai's position as a world gastronomy capital was further reinforced after the third edition of the MICHELIN Guide Dubai was unveiled in July. The guide featured 106 restaurants, up from 90 in 2023, including four that were awarded two stars, 15 with one star, three with a green star, 18 Bib Gourmands, and 69 MICHELIN-selected restaurants. On the World's 50 Best Restaurants 2024 list, Trsind Studio was ranked at No.13 and named the best restaurant in the Middle East, while Orfali Bros Bistro was ranked at No.64 on the extended list. Dubai is also placed at No.9 on Time Out's 2024 ranking of 'the world's 20 best cities for food right now'.\n\nThe ongoing expansion of the cruise sector is also seeing significant benefits for Dubai, and in the 2023/2024 winter season from October to April the emirate welcomed more than 132 ship calls between Mina Rashid and Dubai Harbour. In March at ITB in Berlin, Dubai joined forces with other regional maritime and tourism authorities to formalise the strategic Cruise Arabia alliance, to promote the Arabian Gulf as a cruise ship destination globally.\n\nInternational events destination\n\nDubai's status as a global entertainment hub is bolstered by a year-round calendar of business, leisure and sporting events, which continue to attract international tourists. Organised by Dubai Festivals and Retail Establishment (DFRE), some of Dubai's biggest annual events were held during the first half of the year, including Dubai Shopping Festival, Chinese New Year, Ramadan in Dubai, Eid in Dubai, the Great Online Sale, and Dubai Food Festival.\n\nThe ongoing Dubai Summer Surprises is one of Dubai's major shopping and entertainment events which makes the city as lively and vibrant in the summer season as it is during all other times of the year, further reinforcing Dubai's position as a leading summer destination for families. Upcoming events throughout the rest of 2024 include Dubai Fashion Season Fall/Winter, Dubai Fitness Challenge, and UAE Union Day.\n\nBusiness events also played a critical role - both through the major homegrown trade shows the city hosts annually, as well as the conferences and meetings brought to the city as a result of bidding activity driven by Dubai Business Events, part of DET and the city's official convention bureau. So far this year, Dubai has hosted a number of major industry exhibitions and shows that have attracted thousands of visitors and exhibitors, including Gulfood (150,000 attendees), Arabian Travel Market (46,000 attendees), and the landmark 30th Dubai International Boat Show (more than 1,000 brands and 200 boats).\n\nInclusivity and accessibility\n\nIn pursuing the goals of the D33 Agenda, Dubai is committed to enhancing the quality of life for People of Determination. Major attractions like Burj Khalifa, Dubai Mall and Jumeirah Beach have comprehensive accessibility measures for physical and hidden disabilities like dedicated spaces, ramps, elevators, provision of hearing loops and resizable menus.\n\nIn April, it was announced that Dubai is on record pace towards becoming a Certified Autism Destination, with efforts across the city, driven by DET, putting it firmly on track to becoming the first Certified Autism Destination in the Eastern Hemisphere. Attractions such as Dubai Aquarium, Dubai Ice Rink, The Green Planet, Motiongate, Woo-hoo, and Atlantis Aquaventure have successfully obtained Certified Autism Center (CAC) status, awarded by IBCCES, while key hotel groups like Emaar Hospitality and Atlantis have also demonstrated commitment through investing in workforce training to secure their CAC status.\n\nSustainability initiatives\n\nThe UAE's 'Year of Sustainability' was extended into 2024 and Dubai's tourism and hospitality sectors continued to spearhead the city's ecotourism strategy. Released by DET in May, the inaugural 'Dubai Sustainability Report' highlighted the development plans and achievements that support global objectives such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals 2030, and country-wide strategies including the UAE's Net Zero 2050 initiative.\n\nAs part of DET's ongoing Dubai Sustainable Tourism drive, the Dubai Sustainable Tourism Stamp was awarded to 70 hotels in January, with more to be named in the coming months. The stamp recognises hotels with the highest level of adherence to DET's '19 Sustainability Requirements', through a three-tier scheme with Gold, Silver and Bronze categories.\n\nAnother major citywide sustainability initiative is Dubai Can, which is aligned with efforts to transform the emirate into a leading sustainable destination and the best city in the world to visit, work and live in. Since its launch in February 2022 by H.H. Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai Can, through its 'Refill for Life' campaign, has seen the reduction in the usage of an equivalent of more than 20.4 million 500 ml single-use plastic water bottles and 10.5 million litres of water dispensed via 50 water fountains located throughout the city.\n\nAnother major milestone for Dubai's sustainability drive in H1 2024 was the launch of Dubai Reef's pilot reef modules in April. Part of Dubai Can, Dubai Reef is the world's largest marine reef development project, with 20,000 modules set to be deployed across 600 square kilometres of Dubai's waters by 2027.", "source": {"uri":

This marks a 9% increase over the 8.55 million tourist arrivals in the first half of 2023, according to data published by the Dubai Department of Economy and Tourism (DET). The city, which hosted 17.15 million international overnight visitors in 2023, is on track for another record-breaking year.\n\nThe growth in tourism is guided by the visionary leadership of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, and driven by DET's collaborative efforts with stakeholders. This rise in international visitors aligns with the ambitious goals of the Dubai Economic Agenda D33, which aims to further solidify Dubai's status as a premier global destination for both business and leisure.\n\nHis Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, and Chairman of The Executive Council of Dubai, highlighted that Dubai's tourism sector continues to demonstrate robust growth potential. He emphasized the importance of expanding partnerships with key markets, exploring new opportunities, and enhancing Dubai's value offering by creating rich and memorable experiences for travelers.\n\nThe robust tourism growth in the first half of 2024 underscores Dubai's ability to foster productive public-private partnerships and build extensive global networks of collaboration. With each passing year, Dubai continues to strengthen its status as a frontrunner in the global tourism landscape. The city's sustained efforts are set to boost the tourism sector's contribution to Dubai's GDP by further developing infrastructure and providing exceptional services for visitors.\n\nThe surge in international visitors to Dubai offers several global benefits for travelers and the wider travel industry:\n\nDubai's world-class hotels and accommodation remain core pillars of its destination offering. The first half of 2024 saw several high-profile hotel openings, including The Lana, Dorchester Collection's first Middle East property; SIRO One Za'abeel, Dubai's first fitness hotel; and Hilton Dubai Creek Hotel & Residences. According to DET's latest data, the hotel sector performed well across all hospitality metrics, including occupancy, average daily rate (ADR), and revenue per available room (RevPAR).\n\nCollaboration with domestic stakeholders and over 3,000 global partners in 80 markets has enabled Dubai to achieve impressive growth in key markets. From January to June 2024, the GCC and MENA regions accounted for a combined 26% of overall visitors, with significant contributions from Western Europe, South Asia, and CIS and Eastern Europe. North-East and South-East Asia saw a strong recovery, driven by increased visitation from China.\n\nDubai's record-breaking visitor numbers in the first half of 2024 highlight the city's ongoing appeal as a leading global travel destination. The strategic vision and collaborative efforts underpinning this growth not only boost Dubai's tourism sector but also contribute significantly to the city's economy.

The growth in the first six months of this year puts the city on track for a record performance in 2024. Guided by the visionary leadership of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, and driven by DET's efforts in collaboration with stakeholders, the rise in international visitation aligns with the ambitious goal of the Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to further consolidate Dubai's position as a leading global destination for business and leisure.\n\nHis Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence of the UAE, and Chairman of The Executive Council of Dubai, said: \"The strong tourism growth achieved by Dubai in the first half of 2024 is testament to the city's ability to foster productive public-private partnerships and build extensive global networks of collaboration. With every year, Dubai continues to consolidate its status as a frontrunner in the global tourism landscape and grow in popularity as an international destination. We remain committed to maintaining this successful trajectory and boosting the tourism sector's contribution to Dubai's GDP. By further developing our infrastructure and providing exceptional services for visitors, we aim to set new benchmarks and records in 2024.\"\n\nRead more: Sharjah Airport reports 8.3 million passengers in H1 2024, achieving 12.4 percent growth\n\nDubai's Department of Economy and Tourism (DET) collaborated extensively in the first half of 2024 to drive growth in key markets. Working with over 3,000 global partners across 80 markets, as well as domestic stakeholders, DET implemented targeted campaigns that resulted in impressive visitor numbers.\n\nThrough bespoke strategies and activities showcasing Dubai's unique offerings, dynamic appeal, and exceptional connectivity, the city has solidified its reputation as a top-tier travel destination for both traditional and emerging markets.\n\nIn the January to June 2024 period, the GCC and MENA regions accounted for a substantial 26 percent share of overall visitors, with 1.27 million (14 percent) and 1.09 million (12 percent) arrivals respectively. Western Europe contributed a significant 20 percent of visitors, totaling 1.89 million.\n\nSouth Asia emerged as another major source market, generating 1.62 million visitors (17 percent), while the CIS and Eastern Europe region also drove 1.37 million (15 percent) arrivals.\n\nNotably, North-East and South-East Asia saw their share of visitors grow from 8 percent at the start of the year to 10 percent (896,000) by the end of H1 2024, buoyed by a strong rebound from China. Other regions, including the Americas (617,000 / 7 percent), Africa (404,000 / 4 percent), and Australasia (154,000 / 2 percent), also experienced an uptick in visitation to Dubai.\n\nRead more: UAE tourism sector contributed $59.89 billion to GDP in 2023, generated 809,000 job opportunities\n\nDubai's accommodation offering continues to be a core strength of the city's destination appeal for global visitors. In the first half of 2024, several high-profile hotel openings have added to Dubai's diverse hospitality portfolio, including The Lana - the first Middle East property from Dorchester Collection, SIRO One Za'abeel (Dubai's first fitness-focused hotel), and Hilton Dubai Creek Hotel & Residences.\n\nDubai's hotel sector has maintained strong performance across key metrics in the first six months of 2024. According to the latest data from the Department of Economy and Tourism (DET), the emirate's average hotel occupancy reached 78.7 percent, a slight 1.0 percentage point increase compared to the same period in 2023. Occupied room nights grew by 3 percent, reaching 21.35 million by the end of H1 2024, up from 20.73 million in H1 2023. Average daily rate (ADR) rose 4 percent year-on-year to AED558, while revenue per available room (RevPAR) increased by 6 percent to AED439.\n\nDubai's overall hotel inventory continued to expand, with the total available rooms reaching 150,879 by the end of June 2024, up from 148,689 rooms in June 2023. The number of hotel establishments in the city also increased from 810 to 823 during this period. This strategic growth in accommodation options aims to meet the rising demand and ensure Dubai offers visitors a wide range of choices across different categories and price points.\n\nDubai's Department of Economy and Tourism (DET) continues to collaborate with stakeholders and partners to create new pathways for growth beyond traditional tourism. This includes a focus on investment, entrepreneurship, and attracting global talent, ensuring the city remains a hub of creativity, innovation, and technological advancement.\n\nGlobal marketing campaigns and strategic partnerships are a key priority for Dubai. Ongoing initiatives include the music-led 'Where will Dubai take you now?' promotion, directed by Michael Gracey of The Greatest Showman fame, which showcases the diverse experiences across the emirate. Another notable program is 'Drop by Dubai', which promotes the city as an ideal stopover destination.\n\nAmong the major new attractions to open in the first half of 2024 was Real Madrid World at Dubai Parks and Resorts - the first theme park in the world to operate under the branding of the renowned Spanish football club. This aligns with wider collaborative efforts between Real Madrid and Dubai, including a multi-year agreement signed between DET and the club in October 2023.\n\nDubai has also established partnerships with prominent figures in the music and entertainment industries, such as Academy Award-winning composer Hans Zimmer, who has become a vocal supporter of the emirate. Additionally, the city's culinary offerings have gained global recognition, with Dubai featured in a 50-minute episode of the Netflix food travel show Somebody Feed Phil, hosted by Phil Rosenthal.\n\nThese strategic initiatives, partnerships, and new attraction openings demonstrate Dubai's commitment to diversifying its tourism offerings, fostering innovation, and positioning the city as a global hub of creativity and technological advancement.\n\nDubai's status as a global entertainment hub is bolstered by a year-round calendar of business, leisure and sporting events, which continue to attract international tourists. Organised by Dubai Festivals and Retail Establishment (DFRE), some of Dubai's biggest annual events were held during the first half of the year, including Dubai Shopping Festival, Chinese New Year, Ramadan in Dubai, Eid in Dubai, the Great Online Sale, and Dubai Food Festival. The ongoing Dubai Summer Surprises is one of Dubai's major shopping and entertainment events which makes the city as lively and vibrant in the summer season as it is during all other times of the year, further reinforcing Dubai's position as a leading summer destination for families. Upcoming events throughout the rest of 2024 include Dubai Fashion Season Fall/Winter, Dubai Fitness Challenge, and UAE Union Day.\n\nBusiness events also played a critical role - both through the major homegrown trade shows the city hosts annually, as well as the conferences and meetings brought to the city as a result of bidding activity driven by Dubai Business Events, part of DET and the city's official convention bureau. So far this year, Dubai has hosted a number of major industry exhibitions and shows that have attracted thousands of visitors and exhibitors, including Gulfood (150,000 attendees), Arabian Travel Market (46,000 attendees), and the landmark 30th Dubai International Boat Show (more than 1,000 brands and 200 boats).\n\nIn 2024, the UAE's 'Year of Sustainability' was extended, and Dubai's tourism and hospitality sectors continued to lead the city's ecotourism strategy. In May, the inaugural 'Dubai Sustainability Report' released by the Dubai Department of Economy and Tourism (DET) highlighted the development plans and achievements that support global objectives such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals 2030, and country-wide strategies including the UAE's Net Zero 2050 initiative.\n\nAs part of DET's ongoing Dubai Sustainable Tourism drive, the Dubai Sustainable Tourism Stamp was awarded to 70 hotels in January 2024, with more to be named in the coming months. The stamp recognizes hotels that adhere to DET's '19 Sustainability Requirements' at the Gold, Silver, and Bronze levels.\n\nAnother major citywide sustainability initiative is Dubai Can, which aligns with efforts to transform the emirate into a leading sustainable destination and the best city in the world to visit, work, and live. Since its launch in February 2022 by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai Can's 'Refill for Life' campaign has seen the reduction in the usage of more than 20.4 million 500 ml single-use plastic water bottles and the dispensing of 10.5 million litres of water through 50 water fountains located throughout the city.\n\nIn the first half of 2024, a significant milestone for Dubai's sustainability drive was the launch of the pilot reef modules for the Dubai Reef project in April. Part of the Dubai Can initiative, Dubai Reef is the world's largest marine reef development project, with plans to deploy 20,000 modules across 600 square kilometres of Dubai's waters by 2027.",

The vision was approved by The Executive Council earlier to consolidate the emirate's position as a leading example of future economies backed by emerging technologies.\n\nThis also aligns with the objectives of the Dubai Economic Agenda D33, which aims to raise the productivity of Dubai's economy by 50% through digital innovation.\n\nDigital Dubai has conducted a scientific and realistic analysis of the current situation. This analysis concluded that there are broad opportunities for coordination between the concerned parties to attract and establish possible data centres for artificial intelligence and to make Dubai an attractive city for this type of investment.\n\nThe study conducted by Digital Dubai showed that adopting the strategic vision for AI-backed data centres will create an added value of more than AED14.3 billion by the year 2028 and contribute to creating more job opportunities in the digital economy related to data centres.\n\nIt is expected that adopting this strategic vision will enhance Dubai's readiness for next-generation technologies (Web 3.0) including the Metaverse, Smart Cities, and the Internet of Things. It will also contribute to strengthening partnerships with other sectors in areas such as sustainable artificial intelligence.\n\nDigital Dubai is working alongside the Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority, Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, Dubai Municipality, the General Secretariat of the Executive Council, and the Dubai Department of Economy and Tourism to take coordinated measures aiming to enhance Dubai's readiness for the economy of the future and enhance its leading position in this field.\n\nThe strategic vision for the AI-backed data centre economy represents an advanced stage in digital leadership, the digital economy, and the making of a bright future for the emirate.\n\nAdopting this vision would unleash new dynamics that would pave the way for reaching a state of comprehensive integration and coordination between various entities working in this field.

The vision was approved by The Executive Council earlier, with the aim of consolidating the emirate's position as a leading example of future economies backed by emerging technologies.

This initiative leverages Dubai's established position as a hub for talented minds in various digital fields to ensure its success.\" H.E added.\n\nHis Excellency Younus Al Nasser, Chief Executive of the Dubai Data and Statistics Establishment, commented: \"With the ongoing global transformations, new economic patterns and business models are emerging, presenting future opportunities for dynamic economies like Dubai's. The data center economy exemplifies these transformations. In Dubai, we have accumulated extensive experience in future planning through a prolonged journey of digital transformation, leading to the current stage where data has become a crucial component of various economic activities and a global competitive standard.

These initiatives include developing high-performance computing, ensuring the use of advanced data centers, increasing reliance on renewable energy, facilitating relevant government procedures, improving access to renewable energy, improving the process of saving energy, and enhancing the government's coordination role in terms of planning, land, energy, and others. These initiatives also include supporting the strategic situation of artificial intelligence readiness in the Emirate of Dubai.\n\nDigital Dubai has conducted a scientific and realistic analysis of the current situation. This analysis concluded that there are broad opportunities for coordination between the concerned parties to attract and establish possible data centers for artificial intelligence and to make Dubai an attractive city for this type of investment, as building the digital economy on a large scale requires the adoption of cloud computing in a comprehensive manner while increasing the city's absorption capacities.\n\nThe study conducted by Digital Dubai showed that adopting the strategic vision for AI-backed data centers will lead to the creation of an added value of more than 14.3 billion dirhams by the year 2028 and contribute to creating more job opportunities in the areas of the digital economy related to data centers.\n\nIt is expected that adopting this strategic vision will enhance Dubai's readiness for next-generation technologies (Web 3.0) including the Metaverse, Smart Cities, and the Internet of Things.

The growth in the first six months of this year puts the city on track for a record performance in 2024, said Emirates News Agency, WAM, said.\n\nGlobal Accolades and Industry Events\n\nThe rise in international visitation during H1 2024 is the result of citywide strategies established across key tourism pillars, created and implemented in partnership with stakeholders across the public and private sectors.\n\nBeyond the growth demonstrated through the performance, these efforts also yielded international recognition.\n\nStarting 2024 on a high note, Dubai was named the No.1 global destination for an unprecedented third successive year in the Tripadvisor Travellers' Choice Awards in January, making it the first city to achieve this unique accolade.\n\nThe first half of the year also saw Dubai named the Middle East's leading destination by the World Travel Awards, while Dubai International Airport and Mina Rashid were named the Middle East's leading airport and leading cruise port for 2024 respectively.\n\nHelal Saeed Almarri, Director-General of DET, said: \"Our success stems from a diversified market approach, strong public-private partnerships, liberal visa policies, and alternative growth pathways, all catalysts for the continued surge in both leisure and business visitation, along with increasing levels of investment and inflows of global talent.\n\n\"Looking ahead, we are committed to sustaining and building upon this trajectory, leveraging diverse source markets to enhance tourism's contribution to Dubai's GDP.\"\n\nKey Source Markets\n\nIn collaboration with domestic stakeholders and more than 3,000 global partners in 80 markets, DET's targeted campaigns resulted in Dubai achieving impressive growth in key markets in the first half of 2024.\n\nFrom January to June 2024, proximity markets in GCC and MENA had a combined 26% share of overall visitors, with 1.27 million (14%) and 1.09 million (12%) arrivals respectively. Western Europe accounted for 20% of visitors to Dubai, with 1.89 million in total.\n\nSouth Asia was another major source market, with 1.62 million visitors (17%), as was CIS and Eastern Europe with 1.37 million (15%). North-East and South-East Asia grew from an 8% share at the beginning of the year to a 10% share (896,000) of total visitors by the end of H1 2024, driven by strong recovery from China.\n\nOther regions also saw a rise in visitation to Dubai, including the Americas with 617,000 (7%), Africa with 404,000 (4%) and Australasia with 154,000 (2%).\n\nHotels and Hospitality\n\nWorld-class hotels and accommodation continue to be one of the core pillars of Dubai's destination offering. Adding to the city's appeal for global visitors, the first half of the year saw a number of high-profile openings including:\n\nThe Lana, Dorchester Collection's first Middle East property; SIRO One Za'abeel, Dubai's first fitness hotel; and Hilton Dubai Creek Hotel & Residences.\n\nAccording to DET's latest data, the emirate's hotel sector continued to perform well across all hospitality metrics from January to June, including occupancy, average daily rate (ADR), revenue per available room (RevPAR), and guests' length of stay.\n\nAmong the highest in the world, Dubai hotels' average occupancy of 78.7% is a slight 1.0 percentage point higher than the 77.7% occupancy achieved for the same period in 2023.\n\nOccupied room nights increased by 3%, with 21.35 million at the end of H1 2024, compared to 20.73 million in H1 2023. ADR rose to AED558 during H1, an increase of 4% compared to the same period in 2023, while RevPAR increased by 6% compared to last year, from AED415 to AED439.\n\nMeanwhile, total available rooms in Dubai reached 150,879 by the end of June 2024, compared to 148,689 rooms in June 2023, with the number of establishments standing at 823, up from 810 at the same point last year.\n\nIssam Kazim, CEO of the Dubai Corporation for Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DCTCM), said: \"An exceptional quality of life, safety, and accessibility have been consistently recognised across multiple global indices and we are committed to leveraging partnerships between the public and private sectors to showcase Dubai as a must-visit destination.\"\n\nPartnerships, Collaborations and Campaigns\n\nIn collaboration with its stakeholders and partners, DET continues to create new growth pathways beyond traditional tourism, through investment, entrepreneurship, and attracting global talent, ensuring the city remains a hub of creativity, innovation, and technological advancement.\n\nGlobal campaigns and partnerships also continue to be a key focus for the city, with ongoing initiatives including 'Where will Dubai take you now?', a music-led promotion by The Greatest Showman director Michael Gracey which takes viewers to every corner of the emirate, and the 'Drop by Dubai' programme, which promotes Dubai as the perfect stopover destination.\n\nAmong the major attractions to open in the first half of the year was Real Madrid World at Dubai Parks and Resorts, the first theme park in the world to be operating under the branding of the famed Spanish football club.\n\nThe opening aligns with wider collaborative efforts between the club and Dubai, including a multi-year agreement signed between DET and Real Madrid in October 2023.\n\nDubai has also established ongoing partnerships with major names in the music and entertainment fields, including Academy Award-winning composer Hans Zimmer, who has become a vocal supporter of the emirate.\n\nMeanwhile, in the realm of gastronomy, Dubai had its own 50-minute episode on season seven of Somebody Feed Phil, a food travel show on Netflix where Phil Rosenthal tours restaurants across major global cities.\n\nA Global Culinary and Cruise Hub\n\nDubai's position as a world gastronomy capital was further reinforced after the third edition of the Michelin Guide Dubai was unveiled in July. The guide featured 106 restaurants, up from 90 in 2023, including four that were awarded two stars, 15 with one star, three with a green star, 18 Bib Gourmands, and 69 Michelin-selected restaurants.\n\nOn the World's 50 Best Restaurants 2024 list, Tr\u00e8sind Studio was ranked at No.13 and named the best restaurant in the Middle East, while Orfali Bros Bistro was ranked at No.64 on the extended list. Dubai is also placed at No.9 on Time Out's 2024 ranking of 'the world's 20 best cities for food right now'.\n\nThe ongoing expansion of the cruise sector is also seeing significant benefits for Dubai, and in the 2023/2024 winter season from October to April the emirate welcomed more than 132 ship calls between Mina Rashid and Dubai Harbour.\n\nIn March at ITB in Berlin, Dubai joined forces with other regional maritime and tourism authorities to formalise the strategic Cruise Arabia alliance, to promote the Arabian Gulf as a cruise ship destination globally.\n\nInternational Events Destination\n\nDubai's status as a global entertainment hub is bolstered by a year-round calendar of business, leisure and sporting events, which continue to attract international tourists.\n\nOrganised by Dubai Festivals and Retail Establishment (DFRE), some of Dubai's biggest annual events were held during the first half of the year, including Dubai Shopping Festival, Chinese New Year, Ramadan in Dubai, Eid in Dubai, the Great Online Sale, and Dubai Food Festival.\n\nThe ongoing Dubai Summer Surprises is one of Dubai's major shopping and entertainment events which makes the city as lively and vibrant in the summer season as it is during all other times of the year, further reinforcing Dubai's position as a leading summer destination for families.\n\nUpcoming events throughout the rest of 2024 include Dubai Fashion Season Fall/Winter, Dubai Fitness Challenge, and UAE Union Day.\n\nBusiness events also played a critical role - both through the major homegrown trade shows the city hosts annually, as well as the conferences and meetings brought to the city as a result of bidding activity driven by Dubai Business Events, part of DET and the city's official convention bureau.\n\nSo far this year, Dubai has hosted a number of major industry exhibitions and shows that have attracted thousands of visitors and exhibitors, including Gulfood (150,000 attendees), Arabian Travel Market (46,000 attendees), and the landmark 30th Dubai International Boat Show (more than 1,000 brands and 200 boats).\n\nInclusivity and Accessibility\n\nIn pursuing the goals of the D33 Agenda, Dubai is committed to enhancing the quality of life for People of Determination. Major attractions like Burj Khalifa, Dubai Mall and Jumeirah Beach have comprehensive accessibility measures for physical and hidden disabilities like dedicated spaces, ramps, elevators, provision of hearing loops and resizable menus.\n\nIn April, it was announced that Dubai is on record pace towards becoming a Certified Autism Destination, with efforts across the city, driven by DET, putting it firmly on track to becoming the first Certified Autism Destination in the Eastern Hemisphere.\n\nAttractions such as Dubai Aquarium, Dubai Ice Rink, The Green Planet, Motiongate, Woo-hoo, and Atlantis Aquaventure have successfully obtained Certified Autism Center (CAC) status, awarded by IBCCES, while key hotel groups like Emaar Hospitality and Atlantis have also demonstrated commitment through investing in workforce training to secure their CAC status.\n\nSustainability Initiatives\n\nThe UAE's 'Year of Sustainability' was extended into 2024 and Dubai's tourism and hospitality sectors continued to spearhead the city's ecotourism strategy.\n\nReleased by DET in May, the inaugural 'Dubai Sustainability Report' highlighted the development plans and achievements that support global objectives such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals 2030, and country-wide strategies including the UAE's Net Zero 2050 initiative.\n\nAs part of DET's ongoing Dubai Sustainable Tourism drive, the Dubai Sustainable Tourism Stamp was awarded to 70 hotels in January, with more to be named in the coming months. The stamp recognises hotels with the highest level of adherence to DET's '19 Sustainability Requirements', through a three-tier scheme with Gold, Silver and Bronze categories.\n\nAnother major citywide sustainability initiative is Dubai Can, which is aligned with efforts to transform the emirate into a leading sustainable destination and the best city in the world to visit, work and live in.\n\nAnother major milestone for Dubai's sustainability drive in H1 2024 was the launch of Dubai Reef's pilot reef modules in April.\n\nPart of Dubai Can, Dubai Reef is the world's largest marine reef development project, with 20,000 modules set to be deployed across 600 square kilometres of Dubai's waters by 2027.", "source": {"uri": "tradearabia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Trade

With its sustained growth, Dubai is setting the standard for cities worldwide, in line with the objective of the Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to establish Dubai as one of the world's top urban economies.\"\n\nSheikh Hamdan urged all industry stakeholders to expand partnerships with key markets, explore new opportunities, and work to enhance Dubai's value offering by creating rich and memorable experiences.\n\n\"The strong tourism growth achieved by Dubai in the first half of 2024 is a testament to the city's ability to foster productive public-private partnerships and build extensive global networks of collaboration. With every year, Dubai continues to consolidate its status as a frontrunner in the global tourism landscape and grow in popularity as an international destination. We remain committed to maintaining this successful trajectory and boosting the tourism sector's contribution to Dubai's GDP. By further developing our infrastructure and providing exceptional services for visitors, we aim to set new benchmarks and records in 2024,\" Sheikh Hamdan added.\n\nGlobal accolades and industry events\n\nThe rise in international visitation during H1 2024 is the result of citywide strategies established across key tourism pillars, created and implemented in partnership with stakeholders across the public and private sectors. Beyond the growth demonstrated through the performance, these efforts also yielded international recognition. Starting 2024 on a high note, Dubai was named the No.1 global destination for an unprecedented third successive year in the Tripadvisor Travellers' Choice Awards in January, making it the first city to achieve this unique accolade. The first half of the year also saw Dubai named the Middle East's leading destination by the World Travel Awards, while Dubai International Airport and Mina Rashid were named the Middle East's leading airport and leading cruise port for 2024, respectively.\n\nHelal Saeed Almarri, Director General of Dubai Department of Economy and Tourism (DET), said: \"The significant increase in visitation numbers in the first half of 2024 reflects the vision and leadership of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, and aligns with the D33 Agenda's objective to make Dubai the world's best city to visit, live, and work in. This robust performance, reinforced by global recognition, validates the ambition and agility driving Dubai's tourism and wider economy. Our success stems from a diversified market approach, strong public-private partnerships, liberal visa policies, and alternative growth pathways, all catalysts for the continued surge in both leisure and business visitation, along with increasing levels of investment and inflows of global talent. Looking ahead, we are committed to sustaining and building upon this trajectory, leveraging diverse source markets to enhance tourism's contribution to Dubai's GDP.\"\n\nKey source markets\n\nIn collaboration with domestic stakeholders and more than 3,000 global partners in 80 markets, DET's targeted campaigns resulted in Dubai achieving impressive growth in key markets in the first half of 2024. With bespoke strategies and activities highlighting the city's unique offering, dynamic appeal, and connectivity, Dubai has maintained its position as a first-choice travel destination for visitors both from key traditional and emerging markets.\n\nFrom January to June 2024, proximity markets in GCC and MENA had a combined 26 per cent share of overall visitors, with 1.27 million (14 per cent ) and 1.09 million (12 per cent) arrivals respectively. Western Europe accounted for 20 per cent of visitors to Dubai, with 1.89 million in total. South Asia was another major source market, with 1.62 million visitors (17 per cent), as was CIS and Eastern Europe with 1.37 million (15per cent). North-East and South-East Asia grew from an 8 per cent share at the beginning of the year to a 10 C share (896,000) of total visitors by the end of H1 2024, driven by strong recovery from China. Other regions also saw a rise in visitation to Dubai, including the Americas with 617,000 (7 per cent), Africa with 404,000 (4 per cent), and Australasia with 154,000 (2 per cent).\n\nHotels and hospitality\n\nWorld-class hotels and accommodation continue to be one of the core pillars of Dubai's destination offering. Adding to the city's appeal for global visitors, the first half of the year saw a number of high-profile openings, including: The Lana, Dorchester Collection's first Middle East property; SIRO One Za'abeel, Dubai's first fitness hotel; and Hilton Dubai Creek Hotel & Residences. The city's accommodation portfolio will continue to grow with new openings planned throughout the rest of the year, as part of a strategic approach to expanding inventory to meet demand and ensure Dubai offers visitors a wide range of options across different categories and price points.\n\nAccording to DET's latest data, the emirate's hotel sector continued to perform well across all hospitality metrics from January to June, including occupancy, average daily rate (ADR), revenue per available room (RevPAR), and guests' length of stay. Among the highest in the world, Dubai hotels' average occupancy of 78.7 per cent is a slight 1.0 percentage point higher than the 77.7 per cent occupancy achieved for the same period in 2023. Occupied room nights increased by 3 per cent , with 21.35 million at the end of H1 2024, compared to 20.73 million in H1 2023. ADR rose to Dh558 during H1, an increase of 4 per cent compared to the same period in 2023, while RevPAR increased by 6% compared to last year, from Dh415 to Dh439. Meanwhile, total available rooms in Dubai reached 150,879 by the end of June 2024, compared to 148,689 rooms in June 2023, with the number of establishments standing at 823, up from 810 at the same point last year.\n\nIssam Kazim, CEO of the Dubai Corporation for Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DCTCM), said: \"Inspired by the city's visionary leadership and guided by the objectives of the D33 Agenda, Dubai has continued to stay ahead of the curve by further elevating standards with innovative and distinctive world-class infrastructure, experiences, and attractions. An exceptional quality of life, safety, and accessibility have been consistently recognised across multiple global indices and we are committed to leveraging partnerships between the public and private sectors to showcase Dubai as a must-visit destination. The unwavering support of our partners and stakeholders will be crucial in driving our strong global and market-specific campaigns this summer, as we look to build on this positive growth throughout the rest of 2024.\"\n\nPartnerships, collaborations, and campaigns\n\nIn collaboration with its stakeholders and partners, DET continues to create new growth pathways beyond traditional tourism, through investment, entrepreneurship, and attracting global talent, ensuring the city remains a hub of creativity, innovation, and technological advancement. Global campaigns and partnerships also continue to be a key focus for the city, with ongoing initiatives including 'Where will Dubai take you now?', a music-led promotion by The Greatest Showman director Michael Gracey which takes viewers to every corner of the emirate, and the 'Drop by Dubai' programme, which promotes Dubai as the perfect stopover destination.\n\nAmong the major attractions to open in the first half of the year was Real Madrid World at Dubai Parks and Resorts, the first theme park in the world to be operating under the branding of the famed Spanish football club. The opening aligns with wider collaborative efforts between the club and Dubai, including a multi-year agreement signed between DET and Real Madrid in October 2023.\n\nDubai has also established ongoing partnerships with major names in the music and entertainment fields, including Academy Award-winning composer Hans Zimmer, who has become a vocal supporter of the emirate. Meanwhile, in the realm of gastronomy, Dubai had its own 50-minute episode on season seven of Somebody Feed Phil, a food travel show on Netflix where Phil Rosenthal tours restaurants across major global cities.\n\nA global culinary and cruise hub\n\nDubai's position as a world gastronomy capital was further reinforced after the third edition of the MICHELIN Guide Dubai was unveiled in July. The guide featured 106 restaurants, up from 90 in 2023, including four that were awarded two stars, 15 with one star, three with a green star, 18 Bib Gourmands, and 69 MICHELIN-selected restaurants. On the World's 50 Best Restaurants 2024 list, Tr\u00e8sind Studio was ranked at No.13 and named the best restaurant in the Middle East, while Orfali Bros Bistro was ranked at No.64 on the extended list. Dubai is also placed at No.9 on Time Out's 2024 ranking of 'the world's 20 best cities for food right now'.\n\nThe ongoing expansion of the cruise sector is also seeing significant benefits for Dubai, and in the 2023/2024 winter season from October to April, the emirate welcomed more than 132 ship calls between Mina Rashid and Dubai Harbour. In March at ITB in Berlin, Dubai joined forces with other regional maritime and tourism authorities to formalise the strategic Cruise Arabia alliance, to promote the Arabian Gulf as a cruise ship destination globally.\n\nInternational events destination\n\nDubai's status as a global entertainment hub is bolstered by a year-round calendar of business, leisure, and sporting events, which continue to attract international tourists. Organised by Dubai Festivals and Retail Establishment (DFRE), some of Dubai's biggest annual events were held during the first half of the year, including Dubai Shopping Festival, Chinese New Year, Ramadan in Dubai, Eid in Dubai, the Great Online Sale, and Dubai Food Festival. The ongoing Dubai Summer Surprises is one of Dubai's major shopping and entertainment events which makes the city as lively and vibrant in the summer season as it is during all other times of the year, further reinforcing Dubai's position as a leading summer destination for families. Upcoming events throughout the rest of 2024 include Dubai Fashion Season Fall/Winter, Dubai Fitness Challenge, and UAE Union Day.\n\nBusiness events also played a critical role - both through the major homegrown trade shows the city hosts annually, as well as the conferences and meetings brought to the city as a result of bidding activity driven by Dubai Business Events, part of DET and the city's official convention bureau. So far this year, Dubai has hosted a number of major industry exhibitions and shows that have attracted thousands of visitors and exhibitors, including Gulfood (150,000 attendees), Arabian Travel Market (46,000 attendees), and the landmark 30th Dubai International Boat Show (more than 1,000 brands and 200 boats).\n\nInclusivity and accessibility\n\nIn pursuing the goals of the D33 Agenda, Dubai is committed to enhancing the quality of life for People of Determination. Major attractions like Burj Khalifa, Dubai Mall and Jumeirah Beach have comprehensive accessibility measures for physical and hidden disabilities like dedicated spaces, ramps, elevators, provision of hearing loops, and resizable menus.\n\nIn April, it was announced that Dubai is on record pace towards becoming a Certified Autism Destination\u2122, with efforts across the city, driven by DET, putting it firmly on track to becoming the first Certified Autism Destination\u2122 in the Eastern Hemisphere. Attractions such as Dubai Aquarium, Dubai Ice Rink, The Green Planet, Motiongate, Woo-hoo, and Atlantis Aquaventure have successfully obtained Certified Autism Center\u2122 (CAC) status, awarded by IBCCES, while key hotel groups like Emaar Hospitality and Atlantis have also demonstrated commitment through investing in workforce training to secure their CAC status.\n\nSustainability initiatives\n\nThe UAE's 'Year of Sustainability' was extended into 2024, and Dubai's tourism and hospitality sectors continued to spearhead the city's ecotourism strategy. Released by DET in May, the inaugural 'Dubai Sustainability Report' highlighted the development plans and achievements that support global objectives such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals 2030, and country-wide strategies including the UAE's Net Zero 2050 initiative.\n\nAs part of DET's ongoing Dubai Sustainable Tourism drive, the Dubai Sustainable Tourism Stamp was awarded to 70 hotels in January, with more to be named in the coming months. The stamp recognises hotels with the highest level of adherence to DET's '19 Sustainability Requirements', through a three-tier scheme with Gold, Silver, and Bronze categories.\n\nAnother major citywide sustainability initiative is Dubai Can, which is aligned with efforts to transform the emirate into a leading sustainable destination and the best city in the world to visit, work and live in. Since its launch in February 2022 by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai Can, through its 'Refill for Life' campaign, has seen the reduction in the usage of an equivalent of more than 20.4 million 500 ml single-use plastic water bottles and 10.5 million litres of water dispensed via 50 water fountains located throughout the city. Another major milestone for Dubai's sustainability drive in H1 2024 was the launch of Dubai Reef's pilot reef modules in April. Part of Dubai Can, Dubai Reef is the world's largest marine reef development project, with 20,000 modules set to be deployed across 600 square kilometres of Dubai's waters by 2027.", "source": {"uri":

The combined market value of the companies amounts to around US$ 7 billion.\n\nDuring the first six months of 2024, the chamber trained 243 Emiratis as part of the 'Create Apps in Dubai' initiative, which was launched by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, and is led by Dubai Chamber of Digital Economy.\n\nThe chamber also organised a total of 12 international roadshows aimed at promoting Expand North Star. Organised by the Dubai World Trade Centre and hosted by Dubai Chamber of Digital Economy, the event is the world's largest gathering of startups and investors and will take place in October.\n\nIn addition, the chamber further strengthened its presence as an organiser, strategic partner, and active participant in 15 local and international events during the first half of the year.\n\nHis Excellency Omar Sultan Al Olama, Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications, and Chairman of Dubai Chamber of Digital Economy, commented: \"In line with the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai to consolidate the emirate's status as a global capital for digital economy, we are strengthening our efforts to develop an ecosystem that promotes the growth of digital businesses, supports their expansion, and positions Dubai as the global capital of the digital economy. This comes as part of our drive to achieve the objectives of the Dubai Economic Agenda (D33), which seeks to generate an average of AED 100 billion annually for the emirate's economy through digital transformation projects.\"\n\nHis Excellency added: \"Dubai Chamber of Digital Economy remains committed to further enhancing Dubai's attractiveness for companies and entrepreneurs operating within all technology-related disciplines. Our impactful programmes and initiatives are designed to develop the infrastructure, regulatory environment, and services available to the digital sector in Dubai.\"\n\n'Create Apps in Dubai' Initiative\n\n'Create Apps in Dubai' was launched to strengthen digital capabilities in the UAE and has set a target to train 1,000 Emiratis in cooperation with the private sector.

Our aim is to enhance Dubai's value offering by creating rich and memorable experiences.\"\n\nHe added that the progress was guided by the leadership of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, and supported by DET's initiatives, boosting Dubai's tourism sector which is aligned with the ambitious objectives of the Dubai Economic Agenda D33.\n\nThis agenda aims to solidify Dubai's status as a premier global destination for both business and leisure.\n\nKey factors\n\nThe rise in international visitors is attributed to strategic efforts across key tourism pillars.\n\nIn collaboration with domestic stakeholders and more than 3,000 global partners in 80 markets, DET's targeted campaigns resulted in Dubai achieving impressive growth in key markets in the first half of 2024, added the report.\n\nWith strategies and activities highlighting the city's unique offering, dynamic appeal and connectivity, Dubai has maintained its position as a first-choice travel destination for visitors both from key traditional and emerging markets.\n\nThese efforts, developed in partnership with stakeholders across the public and private sectors, have not only boosted performance but also earned global recognition.\n\nHelal Saeed Almarri, Director-General of DET, highlighted the significance of diversified market approaches, strong public-private partnerships, liberal visa policies, and alternative growth pathways as catalysts for the increase in both leisure and business visitors.\n\n\"Our success stems from a diversified market approach, strong public-private partnerships, liberal visa policies, and alternative growth pathways, all catalysts for the continued surge in both leisure and business visitation, along with increasing levels of investment and inflows of global talent. Looking ahead, we are committed to sustaining and building upon this trajectory, leveraging diverse source markets to enhance tourism's contribution to Dubai's GDP.\"\n\nPerformance by Key Markets\n\nFrom January to June 2024, proximity markets in the GCC and MENA regions contributed 26% of overall visitors, with 1.27 million (14 per cent) from GCC and 1.09 million (12 per cent) from MENA.\n\nWestern Europe accounted for 20 per cent of visitors with 1.89 million arrivals, followed by South Asia with 1.62 million (17 per cent), and CIS and Eastern Europe with 1.37 million (15 per cent).\n\nNorth-East and South-East Asia grew to a 10 per cent share with 896,000 visitors, driven by a strong recovery from China.\n\nHospitality sector\n\nDubai's hotel sector continues to perform well, with an average occupancy rate of 78.7 per cent, up from 77.7 per cent in the same period in 2023. Occupied room nights increased by 3 per cent to 21.35 million, and the average daily rate (ADR) rose by 4 per cent.\n\nRevenue per available room (RevPAR) increased by 6 per cent and the city's hotel inventory reached 150,879 rooms across 823 establishments.\n\nThe first half of 2024 saw several high-profile hotel openings, including The Lana by Dorchester Collection, SIRO One Za'abeel, and Hilton Dubai Creek Hotel & Residences. These additions are part of Dubai's strategic approach to expanding accommodation options to meet demand.\n\nIssam Kazim, CEO of the Dubai Corporation for Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DCTCM), emphasised Dubai's commitment to maintaining its growth trajectory.\n\nHe highlighted the city's exceptional quality of life, safety, and accessibility, consistently recognised across global indices.\n\nSustainability Initiatives\n\nDubai's tourism sector is also focusing on sustainability, with initiatives like the Dubai Sustainable Tourism Stamp and the Dubai Can project.\n\nThe city is

The initiative seeks to triple the number of app developers in Dubai by 2025 and support 100 new national projects for developing cutting-edge mobile applications.\n\nLed by the DCDE, the Create Apps in Dubai aims to capitalise on emerging growth opportunities by creating a strong digital infrastructure, establishing a legislative framework that supports application development, and providing government incentives to accelerate the sector's growth, aligning with the chamber's strategic objectives.\n\nThe chamber signed four memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with partners in H1-24 to enhance Dubai's digital business ecosystem and nurture the growth of digital enterprises and technology companies.\n\nThese included an MoU with Enterprise Ireland, an Irish government agency dedicated to trade and innovation and the largest venture capital institution in Europe by the number of deals.\n\nThis agreement aims to create a strategic partnership that promotes business opportunities, expansion, and mutual cooperation between companies within the digital sector from Dubai and Ireland.\n\nIt is worth noting that DCDE attracted nine multinational companies (MNCs) with a market value of more than AED 304 billion ($82.84 billion) in 2023.", "source": {"uri": "english.mubasher.info", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.mubasher.info"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

This surge underscores Dubai South's expanding role as a pivotal force in Dubai's real estate sector, bolstered by its distinctive features.\n\nReal estate investments constitute 70 per cent of the overall investments at Dubai South, and we take pride in launching strategic and well-studied projects that cater to the needs and preferences of investors and end users.\n\nAfter the announcement of Al Maktoum International Airport's passenger terminals in April, the airport is undoubtedly poised to become a key factor in Dubai's economic development.\n\nIts completion is anticipated to significantly increase the employment opportunities in the Dubai South area and act as a catalyst for new properties, offices, retail, hospitals and other social infrastructure. It is worth noting that the Dubai 2024 Urban Master Plan, which is the government's vision for a comprehensive plan for sustainable urban development of Dubai, identifies the Dubai South area as one of the key growth vectors for the city.\n\nHow is Dubai South aligned with the government's vision of attracting a million residents to the Dubai South area?\n\nDubai South Properties, a subsidiary of Dubai South, presents a diverse array of residential offerings, including villas, townhouses, mansions, and apartments. There is significant demand for properties in Dubai South, evidenced by the quick sell-out of every new phase released to the market.\n\nThe company addresses the preferences of its clientele, catering to their individual needs with precision. Dubai South provides good investment opportunities for different offerings, especially since most units across our developments are much more spacious than what is available in the market.\n\nAt Dubai South, we understand the immense responsibility we have towards the government's goal of attracting one million residents to the area once the airport is complete. We are pleased to see the huge demand for properties within Dubai South, recently witnessing a 20-30 per cent increase in prices.\n\nThe start of construction of the new passenger terminals at Al Maktoum International Airport is expected to further boost demand for properties at Dubai South, especially the real estate projects which are launched by Dubai South Properties, which are likely to experience increased attention due to their proximity to the Al Maktoum International Airport. These include South Bay, The Pulse Beachfront, and South Living, an exclusive luxury apartment project in The Residential District.\n\nHow many units are being delivered shortly at the Residential District?\n\nIn 2025, Dubai South Properties is on track to complete and deliver approximately 2,500 units. In addition, other active developers are expected to add around 5,500 units to the market.\n\nWhat sets Dubai South's Residential District apart?\n\nDubai South's Residential District is currently home to an estimated 25,000 residents, benefiting from its diverse offerings, contemporary amenities, and vibrant lifestyle. With an annual growth rate of about 20 per cent, the community continues to attract an increasing number of residents each year.\n\nThe Residential District at Dubai South incorporates state-of-the-art amenities for the comfort and convenience of its tenants.\n\nThese include a GEMS Founders School that commenced student enrollments for the academic year 2024-2025, subject to KHDA approvals; public parks; sports courts; retail shops; a 50,000 square-foot hypermarket, a mosque; a petrol station; and a public bus route connecting the district to the Expo Metro station.\n\nGive us some of the key milestones of Dubai South.\n\nOver the years, we have successfully positioned Dubai South as an ideal investment destination, attracting a multitude of prominent companies. Our mission, however, does not stop there.

In the first half of 2024, Dubai secured 175 event bids, marking a 24% increase from the previous year. These events are projected to attract over 92,000 delegates, fueling growth in the business events industry for years to come.\n\nThe successful bids will see Dubai hosting numerous prestigious international conferences, congresses, and incentive meetings through 2028. This diverse range of events highlights the crucial role business events play in achieving the Dubai Economic Agenda D33, which aims to double the city's economic size by 2033 and solidify its standing as one of the top global destinations for living, working, and visiting.\n\nDubai Business Events (DBE), the official convention bureau under the Dubai Department of Economy and Tourism, collaborated with key stakeholders and industry experts, including the Al Safeer Congress Ambassadors, to secure major business events for the city. Alongside successful bids, Dubai has also gained international acclaim as a premier business events destination. The International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA) recognized Dubai as the leading city in the Middle East for hosting association meetings in 2023. Additionally, Cvent ranked Dubai as the top meeting destination in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nAhmed Al Khaja, CEO of Dubai Festivals and Retail Establishment, said: \"In line with the vision and leadership of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, business events continue to play a critical role in driving tourism and economic prosperity. High-impact conferences, congresses and meetings not only boost economic progress, but also make vital contributions to Dubai's burgeoning status as a knowledge hub, and centre of expertise across key sectors. This is aligned with the ambitions of the Dubai Economic Agenda D33, which envisions Dubai as a leading destination for business and leisure, and the best city to visit, live and work in.\n\n\"Associations, businesses and organisations around the world are increasingly recognising the power of hosting their meetings in Dubai, as demonstrated by the number of major international conferences secured by the city in the first half of 2024. Our vibrant calendar of upcoming events will bring together industry leaders, visionaries and delegates from all over the world, taking advantage of and feeding into our knowledge economy and propelling collective growth, and we look forward to welcoming them to Dubai.\"\n\nDubai's appeal as a prime destination for corporate and incentive events is growing, thanks to its diverse offerings that cater to all budgets, an extensive selection of international hotels, top-notch infrastructure, and excellent accessibility. In the first half of the year, Dubai secured significant events such as Modicare Advisors Incentive 2024, Vkusno i Tochka Convention 2024, World Agri-Tech Innovation Summit 2024, and OPPO Guangdong Mobile Communication Incentive 2025.\n\nDubai's reputation as a global hub for associations, coupled with its evolving knowledge economy and focus on innovation, has attracted key decision-makers for major events. Notable conferences and congresses secured include The International Cotton Association Conference 2025, IFHNOS Summit 2025, WC A World Annual Conference 2025, and Rhinology World Congress 2028.\n\nDubai Business Events (DBE) continues to attract prestigious global events through year-round engagement and close collaboration with hotels, event venues, Professional Congress Organizers (PCOs), Destination Management Companies (DMCs), and other service providers. In the first half of 2024, DBE successfully completed several sales missions in target markets and participated in major trade shows, including IMEX Frankfurt. It plans to attend upcoming events such as IMEX America (8-10 October, Las Vegas) and IBTM World (19-21 November, Barcelona). DBE also collaborates closely with industry stakeholders to host meeting planners in Dubai for study missions, showcasing the city's business events and tourism infrastructure and its rapidly growing knowledge economy.", "source": {"uri": "travelandtourworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Travel And Tour World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Knowledge economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_bin_Rashid_Al_Maktoum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Order of the British Empire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_city", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Global city"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_held_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privately held company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cotton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guangdong"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guangdong"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Business/Resources", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Resources/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Resources/Conferences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DBE-at-IMEX-Frankfurt-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770366", "eventUri": "eng-9770366", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-08", "dateEnd": "-10-10", "textStart": 4129, "textEnd": 4141}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-19", "dateEnd": "-11-21", "textStart": 4170, "textEnd": 4184}], "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

However, beyond the glittering facade of tourism and real estate, Dubai has been making significant strides in the technology sector. The city has been positioning itself as a global tech hub, attracting top talent from around the world and fostering an environment conducive to innovation and growth.\n\nA strategic move towards diversification\n\nDubai's strategic vision, encapsulated in the Dubai Plan 2021 and the UAE Centennial 2071, emphasizes diversification away from oil-dependent revenues towards a knowledge-based economy. As part of this vision, the city has invested heavily in technology and innovation. Initiatives like Smart Dubai, Dubai Internet City, and the Dubai Future Foundation are pivotal in creating a robust tech ecosystem.\n\nKey sectors driving tech employment\n\nArtificial intelligence and Machine Learning: Dubai has embraced AI as a cornerstone of its future development. The establishment of the UAE Artificial Intelligence Strategy 2031 aims to position the country as a leader in AI by integrating it into various sectors, including healthcare, education, and transportation. Companies in Dubai are actively seeking AI specialists, data scientists, and machine learning engineers to drive these initiatives. Fintech: The financial services sector in Dubai is undergoing a significant transformation with the rise of fintech. Blockchain, cryptocurrency, and digital payments are at the forefront of this evolution. The Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) provides a fertile ground for fintech startups and established companies, creating numerous job opportunities for software developers, blockchain experts, and cybersecurity professionals. E-commerce: E-commerce has seen exponential growth in Dubai, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Major players like Amazon and Noon have established significant operations in the city, while numerous startups are emerging. This sector demands a wide range of tech talent, from web developers and UX/UI designers to digital marketers and logistics tech specialists. Smart city initiatives: Smart Dubai aims to transform Dubai into the happiest and smartest city on Earth. This initiative involves the deployment of IoT (Internet of Things), big data analytics, and smart infrastructure. Professionals with expertise in IoT, cloud computing, and data analytics are highly sought after to drive these projects.\n\nThe talent landscape\n\nDubai's tech job market is highly competitive and attracts a global pool of talent. The city's tax-free income, high quality of life, and cosmopolitan environment make it an attractive destination for tech professionals. However, the demand for skilled workers often outstrips supply, leading to fierce competition for top positions.\n\nThe government and private sector are addressing this gap through various means. Educational institutions are expanding their tech-related programs, and initiatives like the Dubai Future Accelerators are fostering local talent and entrepreneurship. Additionally, partnerships with international universities and companies help bring in expertise and knowledge from around the world.\n\nChallenges and considerations\n\nDespite its many advantages, the tech job market in Dubai faces several challenges:\n\nTalent shortage: While Dubai is attracting tech talent globally, there remains a significant shortage of highly skilled professionals, particularly in emerging technologies like AI and blockchain. This gap can slow down the implementation of ambitious projects. Cost of living: The high cost of living in Dubai can be a deterrent for some potential employees, particularly those from regions with lower living expenses. Competitive salaries and benefits are essential to attract and retain talent. Work permits and visa regulations: Navigating the visa and work permit process can be complex and time-consuming. Recent reforms, such as the introduction of the long-term visa and the Golden Visa for exceptional talents, aim to simplify this process and make it more appealing for tech professionals to move to Dubai. Cultural adaptation: While Dubai is known for its cosmopolitan nature, cultural adaptation can be a challenge for expatriates. Understanding and respecting local customs and business practices is crucial for success.\n\nFuture prospects\n\nThe future of tech jobs in Dubai looks promising. The city's commitment to innovation and technology, coupled with its strategic location and business-friendly environment, positions it well for continued growth. The Expo 2020 Dubai has further accelerated developments in the tech sector, showcasing the city's capabilities to a global audience and fostering international collaborations.\n\nMoreover, the Dubai Silicon Oasis Authority and other free zones continue to provide excellent infrastructure and support for tech companies, from startups to global giants. These zones offer benefits like 100% foreign ownership, tax exemptions, and easy access to markets in the Middle East, Africa, and beyond.\n\nDubai's tech job market is a dynamic and rapidly evolving landscape, offering numerous opportunities for professionals in various sectors. The city's vision for a diversified, knowledge-based economy drives its investment in technology and innovation. It's possible to find tech jobs in dubai on Avopy. While challenges exist, the proactive measures taken by the government and private sector ensure that Dubai remains an attractive destination for tech talent. As the city continues to grow and adapt, its role as a global tech hub is set to become even more prominent, making it an exciting place for tech professionals to build their careers.\n\nRelated

Since accommodation costs are likely to constitute a significant chunk of your total travel budget, it's wise to schedule your trip to the city outside of the busiest months from November to February.\n\nFor those on a budget, it's also best to avoid visiting during major trade events and conferences such as GITEX Global and Gulfood, when the large number of international business visitors rapidly increases nightly hotel rates. These days, Dubai is a year-round destination, and with these insider tips, you'll have the trip of a lifetime in Dubai-for $100 a day.\n\nMost first-time travelers to Dubai prefer to visit from November to March, when the average temperatures hover between 21\u00b0C to 27\u00b0C (or about 70\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 F), and the city experiences pleasant, sunny afternoons and breezy evenings. However, the large number of tourist arrivals directly impacts both rates and availability at hotels, pushing up accommodation costs, even at budget and mid-range hotels.\n\nFor more affordable hotel rates, plan to visit during the shoulder season from September to October when average temperatures are in the 31\u00b0C to 34\u00b0C range or April to May with average temperatures in the 28\u00b0C to 31\u00b0C range. While you can expect some warm afternoons, especially in early September, it's still possible to stroll around the heritage buildings and museums in the Al Fahidi Historical Neighborhood or an abra ride across the Dubai Creek to the souks of Deira in the mornings or evenings.\n\nYou'll get the best deals on hotel rooms during the summer months from June to August, when many Dubai residents travel to escape the heat. There's no lack of things to do to pass the time when it's too hot to be outside, from snowboarding at the indoor ski resort Ski Dubai and shopping at Dubai Mall to catching an art exhibition at Alserkal Avenue or heading up to the observation deck at the Burj Khalifa.\n\nAnother advantage of visiting in shoulder season or in summer, when you'll have to deal with fewer crowds, is that it's easier to get tickets to attractions such as the Museum of the Future, which might otherwise be sold out months in advance.\n\nComprising the metro, buses, tram, boats, ferries, and water taxis, Dubai's excellent public transportation offers a convenient way to visit the city's many sights of interest, from the souks of Deira and the canalside cafes of Dubai Marina to the beach clubs of Palm Jumeirah. Making use of it won't just help you save significantly on your travel costs; it will also help you skip the notorious rush hour traffic jams that you'll inevitably find yourself in while nervously watching the taxi meter rise.\n\nWhile traveling on public transportation, it helps to know that Dubai is divided into seven zones. With a Silver Nol card, the most commonly used public transportation card that costs Dhs25 ($7) and comes pre-loaded with Dhs19 ($5) of credit, you'll pay Dhs3 for traveling within a single zone, Dhs5 for traveling across two adjacent zones and Dhs7.5 for traveling across two or more zones. This is true whether you use the metro, bus, or a combination of the two to get from point A to B, as long as the transfer between the two modes is within 30 minutes.\n\nThat means you could travel from Bur Dubai to Dubai Marina by metro for only Dhs5 ($1.40), whereas you'd pay anywhere from Dhs70 to 90 ($19 to 25) if you took a taxi for the same distance.\n\nWith palatial facades, private yacht marinas, and outdoor decks with white sand from the Maldives, you wouldn't be wrong to think that Dubai's most luxurious hotels, where celebrities from around the world come to holiday, are an ode to extravagance. But they're not your only option for accommodation in the city.\n\nIf you're on a budget of $100 a day, steer clear of areas such as Palm Jumeirah and consider budget hotels and hotel apartments in the city's older neighborhoods such as Bur Dubai, Mankhool, Deira, and the Trade Centre area. If you'd rather stay closer to most of the city's attractions, Al Barsha and Dubai Marina also offer many options.\n\nAround the city, 3-star hotel apartments can be quite spacious, some with kitchenettes so you can prepare simple meals or breakfast to save on the costs of eating out. Expect clean rooms, modern comforts such as TVs and free Wi-Fi, and access to the hotel's gym and rooftop pool. With several branches around Dubai, hotel chains such as Citymax, Ibis, Novotel, and Rove offer excellent value-for-money rooms and seasonal deals with prices as low as USD 50 in summer.\n\nHome to nearly 200 nationalities, Dubai's multicultural and vibrant dining scene means there's no lack of options if you're eating out on a budget. You'll find satisfying Levantine fare-possibly the city's favorite for casual dining-and value-for-money prices at cafeterias and Levantine restaurants such as Operation Falafel, Allo Beirut, Al Mallah, Picnic Home, and Aroos Damascus. A shawarma, falafel, or chicken sandwich costs anywhere from Dhs7 to Dhs22 ($2 to $6), a plate of hummus costs Dhs14 to Dhs22 ($4 to $6), and a plate of kebabs costs Dhs 34 to Dhs68 ($9 to $18).\n\nIn Bur Dubai, Karama, Al Satwa, Deira, Al Barsha, and Dubai Marina, you'll find casual restaurants from around the Indian subcontinent serving everything from Nepali momos and Afghani kebab to Indian dosa, where an all-you-can-eat meal can set you back by just Dhs29 ($8) and a plate of slow-cooked lamb and rice costs Dhs45 ($12). Biryani and mandi restaurants are also fantastic options to enjoy delicious food at affordable prices. Every shopping mall in Dubai offers a food court where you'll find reasonably priced restaurants serving a variety of cuisines.\n\nIf you plan on splurging on a meal or two at one of Dubai's fancy Michelin-rated restaurants, it's worth asking about their Business Lunch. Usually offered as a two or three-course set menu (with options for vegetarians) through the week (except weekends), it's a smart way to enjoy signature dishes at nearly half of what you'd spend there for dinner.\n\nAlmost every bar in Dubai, whether an upscale establishment in a five-star hotel or a casual pub in a residential neighborhood, offers a daily happy hour that's worth checking out. During this two-hour duration, selected alcoholic drinks and bar bites are available at significantly discounted prices. In addition to happy hours, most bars have Ladies' Nights, during which female guests are served complimentary drinks and enjoy deals and discounts on food.\n\nTo truly experience the best of Dubai, look beyond touristy attractions and sights and do as the locals do. Spend a morning or afternoon at Kite Beach, a free-to-visit public beach where you'll be in the company of locals swimming, kitesurfing, practicing yoga, or simply sunbathing on the sand, close to cafes and food trucks from where you can grab a bite.\n\nWhen the weather is nice, take a Careem bike (Dhs20 or $5.50 for a day pass) and enjoy a ride along the Dubai Water Canal to appreciate this modern engineering marvel and venture all the way to Jumeirah Beach.", "source": {"uri": "fodors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fodors Travel Guide"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

These zones create a business-friendly environment, attracting thousands of entrepreneurs globally.\n\nAre you looking to start a business in Dubai but unsure where to begin? You're in the right place. This article will guide you through everything you need to know before starting a business in Dubai.\n\nThe first thing you need to know before starting a business in Dubai is to understand business types. Dubai offers three types of businesses, the details are as follows:\n\nMainland businesses in Dubai operate within the non-free zone areas of the UAE. It provides the flexibility to trade both within the local market and internationally. Licensed by the Dubai Department of Economic Development (DED), these businesses must comply with UAE commercial laws and regulations. Establishing a mainland business offers several advantages, including the ability to bid for government contracts and a broader scope of business activities.\n\nDubai offers various mainland business structures to meet diverse business needs. Here are the main types:\n\nAn LLC is the most common structure which is favored for its flexible company structure and the ease of business operations. However, you require a local sponsor with 51% ownership, while foreign ownership is 49%. It offers flexibility for trading within the UAE and internationally.\n\nThe sole proprietorship business is owned by one individual. In this setup, one individual has full control and unlimited liability. Moreover, this structure suits small businesses and professionals like consultants and freelancers.\n\nIdeal for professionals such as doctors and engineers, a Civil Company can be 100% foreign-owned but needs a local service agent for administrative tasks and government liaison.\n\nA Branch Office in mainland Dubai is an extension of a foreign company, requiring a DED license and a local service agent. It can conduct business similar to its parent company.\n\nPromoting a foreign company's products and services, a Representative Office conducts market research but cannot engage in commercial activities. It requires DED registration and a local service agent.\n\nSuitable for large businesses offering public shares, a PJSC needs at least 51% UAE national ownership and a minimum of ten shareholders, regulated by the SCA.\n\nThis structure requires at least three shareholders and keeps shares private, with 51% held by UAE nationals. It is ideal for large businesses wanting control over ownership and operations.\n\nDubai's free zones are special economic zones designed to attract foreign investment. These free zones offer a range of incentives and benefits. Dubai's free zones offer an optimal environment for launching businesses centered on international trade, services, and manufacturing. Establishing a free zone company in Dubai presents a compelling opportunity for entrepreneurs and companies because of the distinct advantages provided.\n\nDubai offers various free zone business structures to cater to different business needs. Here are the primary types:\n\nA Free Zone Establishment (FZE) is a limited liability entity formed by a single shareholder. It's ideal for solo entrepreneurs seeking the benefits of Dubai's free zone advantages.\n\nA Free Zone Company (FZC) allows multiple shareholders, typically up to five. This structure is suitable for SMEs with multiple owners, offering limited liability and full foreign ownership.\n\nA Branch Office in a free zone is an extension of an existing foreign or UAE-based company. This arrangement enables the parent company to establish a presence in a Dubai free zone. It allows the company to conduct similar business activities while benefiting from free zone incentives.\n\nA Representative Office is set up by a foreign company to promote products, conduct market research, and build business connections in Dubai. It is not permitted to engage in commercial activities or directly generate revenue.\n\nAn Offshore Company is a legal business entity established under the regulations of specific free zones like Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZA) or Ras Al Khaimah International Corporate Centre (RAK ICC). These companies are designed for businesses not conducting operations within the UAE but seeking Dubai's strategic location, favorable tax regime, and excellent infrastructure for international operations.\n\nIdeal for businesses seeking Dubai's strategic location and infrastructure, offering full foreign ownership, tax benefits, and confidentiality.\n\nProvides a flexible and cost-effective solution with full foreign ownership, privacy, and tax exemptions.\n\nSuitable for commodities trading and related activities, offering benefits like full foreign ownership, tax advantages, and comprehensive banking\n\nYou need to acquire business licence before starting a business in Dubai.

While this may be true in the short term, it overlooks longer term trends and the needs of an ever-growing population of expat families.\n\nThis situation also drives up prices for existing stock, making it increasingly difficult for middle income families to find affordable housing that meets their requirements. The lack of larger units could also impact the rental market. Families who can't find suitable properties to buy may turn to renting, further tightening the market and driving up rents.\n\nSo, what's the solution?\n\nDubai developers must recognise and respond to this growing demand for spacious family homes by reassessing their current development plans and prioritising the construction of larger units.\n\nPolicymakers also have a role to play in incentivising the development of such properties through zoning laws, tax breaks, and other measures that encourage builders to cater to this segment of the market.\n\nTo be fair, some developers have started to catch up with demand with recent launches such as The Heights Country Club & Wellness by Emaar (coming soon), Riverside by Damac, The Watercrest by Ellington, The Acres by Meraas, Haven and Athelon by Aldar, and Tilal al Ghaf by Majid Al Futtaim - all of which boast larger family-friendly homes. More are needed.\n\nFor investors keeping an eye on the Dubai market, this undersupply of larger units presents an opportunity, as a lower supply generally increases the chance for good capital appreciation and strong rental yields.\n\nInvestor oppurtunity\n\nThe current landscape is ripe with opportunity overall due to the rolling out of the ambitious Dubai Economic Agenda D33, which aims to almost double the economy over the next decade and establish the city among the top three global hubs for business and investment.\n\nIt has some eye-watering targets: increasing foreign trade to Dh25.6 trillion, foreign direct investment to Dh60 billion annually, government expenditures to Dh700 billion, private sector investments to Dh1 trillion, and enhancing domestic demand for goods and services to Dh3 trillion.\n\nThere are also efforts to push Dubai southwards in line with the gigantic new passenger terminal at Al Maktoum International Airport which will replace all operations at Dubai International (DXB) and hold the world's largest capacity annually. It is predicted that around one million people will be living in Dubai South by 2040.\n\nIndeed, Emaar has been putting its stamp in the south Dubai area with the announcement of four master communities in the pipeline. Savvy investors are already jumping at the chance with Riverside, Oasis, Haven, Athelon and Watercrest selling out within days.\n\nIn terms of apartments, as the Dubai population grows, and more families move here many could be priced out of townhouses and villas which will create demand for more two to three bedroom apartments which are in short supply. So, there's a great opportunity for investors here too.\n\nWe are having conversations right now with astute investors making considered choices to identify the areas, payment plans and quality products, as well as the most lucrative choices based on what the data is indicating with these pockets of potential undersupply.\n\nAs ever with great investing, timing is everything.\n\nPaul Sharland\n\nThe writer is the Associate Director & Sales Manager - Off Plan & Investments, haus & haus Real Estate\n\nKnow more about the Author", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GULF NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_and_Human_Development_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Knowledge and Human Development Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Townhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Private school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emirate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apartment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damac_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damac FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meraas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meraas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majid_Al_Futtaim", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Majid Al Futtaim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopis_cineraria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosopis cineraria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emaar_Properties", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emaar Properties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expatriate", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Expatriate"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Affordable housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverside,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riverside, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riverside, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai_South", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dubai South"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_terminal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airport terminal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Maktoum_International_Airport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Maktoum International Airport"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://imagevars.gulfnews.com/2024/01/04/Stock-Dubai-Property_18cd34bc3d2_medium.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770366", "eventUri": "eng-9770366", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

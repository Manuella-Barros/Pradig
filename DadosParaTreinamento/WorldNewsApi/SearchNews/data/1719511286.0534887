Earlier this month, she graduated with honors from the College of Eastern Idaho, earning an associate of science degree in general studies. Having spent the past four years dedicating much of her free time to studies \u2014 working up to 18 hours a day on schoolwork, according to her father Dain White \u2014 Ava will take yet another class this summer. Then, in the fall, she will attend Idaho State University, majoring in nuclear engineering. \u201cI always knew that I was interested in science,\u201d Ava said when asked what drew her to that major. \u201cI wanted to do a lot in my life, and it seemed like science is really the way to do that.\u201d Ava was born in northern Idaho \u2014 Moscow. Her family moved to Idaho Falls when she was 10. That was when INL, and a potential career in science, came into focus. Graduating high school having already earned an associates degree is a feather in the cap toward her aspirations of holding a position at INL. And she credits ITCA for achieving that. She was born with a trio of medical conditions \u2014 Hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome and Raynaud\u2019s Syndrome \u2014 which made ITCA\u2019s online classes much easier for her. Among other symptoms, Ava explained to EastIdahoNews.com, she deals with regular dizziness and nausea, and her body at times struggles with cold weather. So, being able to attend class without having to walk in the snow is massively convenient as she doesn\u2019t have to \u201cbattle (her) disabilities everyday\u201d to go to school. Plus, Ava began attending ITCA \u2014 which has long held online classes and perfected operations of remote education \u2014 in 2020, when other schools were having to figure out how to do so. Asked what her plans have in store for her after obtaining a bachelor\u2019s degree in nuclear engineering, Ava said she anticipates continuing her higher education journey. As for where, she said she does not expect to leave Idaho but would for the right circumstance. \u201cI really like Idaho. If I can find a better school to go to, sure, I\u2019ll go where ever the wind takes me. But I\u2019m definitely not itching to get out of Idaho,\u201d she said. When she has free time, Ava enjoys the outdoors (symptoms permitting) along with playing and listening to music. \u201cI spend a lot of time on weekends working on schoolwork, but I really like to go camping and hiking. I\u2019m crazy about music, too. I love to play music, and I always make time to go to concerts,\u201d she said. Ava has played the marimba \u2014 which is similar to a xylophone \u2014 since she was five and more recently took up the accordion, kalimba and piano. Asked what kind of music she enjoys, Ava said she is a hug fan of punk music.", "summary": "IDAHO FALLS \u2014 Ava White graduated salutatorian from the Idaho Technical Career Academy (ITCA) last week.

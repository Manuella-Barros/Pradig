{"id": 232012568, "title": "Is it wise to have all your accounts under one roof?", "text": "Dear Liz: I\u2019m setting up accounts post-divorce while learning personal finance on the fly. Is it \u201csafe\u201d or advisable to have all of my larger accounts \u2014 IRAs, 401(k), cash management \u2014 with the same institution, or should I spread them around? I have smaller checking and savings accounts with a good credit union. Answer: Using a single investment firm is certainly convenient, and most people will be just fine having all their accounts in one place. The Securities Investor Protection Corp. covers accounts up to $500,000, including up to $250,000 in cash. This insurance protects you if the brokerage fails and your cash or securities go missing. Customers with multiple accounts often get more coverage. For example, IRAs and Roth IRAs would each get up to $500,000 in coverage, as do individual and joint brokerage accounts. A person with all four types of accounts would have $2 million in coverage. Accounts for corporations, trusts, estate executors and guardians of minors also get separate coverage. For more details, see SIPC\u2019s brochure, \u201cHow SIPC Protects You.\u201d Your 401(k) has its own protections. Assets in 401(k)s are placed into trust accounts, separate from the investment firms that administer the plans and the employers that sponsor them. The money can\u2019t be touched by creditors of either one. Dear Liz: My brokerage recently sent an updated fee list. They now are charging $100 to close an account. That seems an incredibly high fee should I choose to move my investments somewhere else. The fine print says the fee will not apply to anyone who holds at least $5 million in qualifying assets. Well, that certainly isn\u2019t me. So they\u2019re hitting those who have the least with a ridiculously high fee when it comes time to end the account. Is this typical across the investment industry? Answer: Unfortunately, yes, but the usual fee is closer to $75. Many brokerages have lowered their fees in recent years, with many eliminating commissions. But the account closure fee has stuck around, probably because most people don\u2019t think about the costs of shutting down an account after they\u2019ve opened one. Dear Liz: I\u2019ve received multiple conflicting answers from Social Security and hope you can clarify. My husband waited to collect until he was 70 and unfortunately passed away soon afterward. I am 66 and was instructed to apply for survivor benefits because I would be eligible to collect his enhanced benefit at age 66 plus two months. I received an \u201capproval of application\u201d letter in January 2024 and was expecting payment on March 20, but nothing! I went on the SSA.gov website and saw my status was \u201cineligible due to being employed or still working.\u201d I\u2019m an independent human resources consultant. I finally got through to Social Security on the phone and was told I wouldn\u2019t be able to collect his benefits (which would be higher than mine due to his age and earnings) until I was at full retirement age, 66 plus six months. Is this true? Answer: Yes. You just got squeezed between two different types of full retirement age. Many people don\u2019t realize they have two full retirement ages, one for retirement benefits and a slightly younger one for survivor benefits. At 66 and two months, you qualified for your full survivor benefit, meaning that the amount wasn\u2019t reduced because of an early start. However, the earnings test applies because you haven\u2019t yet reached your full retirement age for retirement benefits. The earnings test reduces your benefit by $1 for every $2 you earn over a certain limit, which in 2024 is $22,320. The good news is that the earnings test will end when you reach 66 years and six months, and you\u2019ll start receiving your survivor benefit regardless of how much you get paid.

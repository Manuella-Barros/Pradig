(AP) \u2014 When the track announcer asked Grant Holloway what he thought of his latest win at U.S. track trials, America\u2019s best hurdler made it clear there are bigger things to come. \u201cIf you\u2019re not training to win an Olympic gold medal,\u201d Holloway said, \u201cthen what the heck are you doing?\u201d That mantra has stayed planted in the 26-year-old\u2019s brain over the past three years, ever since an upset loss at the Tokyo Games left him with everything in this sport, except its biggest prize. On Friday, the three-time world champion earned a trip back to the Olympics, winning the trials with the fourth-fastest time in history, 12.86 seconds, despite clipping the eighth of 10 hurdles in a not-so-subtle reminder of how fickle this event can be. Others with unfinished business looming at the Olympics include Sha\u2019Carri Richardson and Noah Lyles, each of whom blazed through their 200-meter semifinals to set up races Saturday to qualify for their second event. Richardson faces a matchup against Gabby Thomas in what could be one of the best races of the trials. Holloway\u2019s 110 hurdles was up there, too, though he\u2019s well aware that making the games and bringing home Olympic gold are two different things. In Tokyo three years ago, he cleared all 10 hurdles but faded late and lost by 0.05 to Jamaica\u2019s Hansle Parchment, who runs in his country\u2019s national championship this weekend. Holloway called it one of the worst races he\u2019d ever run and one of Parchment\u2019s best. Friday\u2019s race marked Holloway\u2019s third sub-13 run of the season \u2014 the second-fastest of his career. Freddie Crittenden was 0.07 seconds behind and Daniel Roberts finished third in 12.96, making this the first race in history with three sub-13 times. Could an American sweep in the short hurdles \u2014 a la what Brianna Rollins, Nia Ali and Kristi Castlin pulled off for the U.S. in the women\u2019s race in 2016 \u2014 be in the offing this summer? \u201cWe\u2019ve already put it out there,\u201d Holloway said. \u201cI think me, Daniel and Freddie have probably already thought about it once we came through that finish line.\u201d Sha\u2019Carri vs. Gabby Thomas Sha\u2019Carri Richardson ran her personal-best time. Gabby Thomas ran the season\u2019s best time. Up next, a showdown in the final between two of the best this year at 200 meters. Thomas, the Olympic bronze medalist in 2021, glanced up to the scoreboard and looked surprised when she saw the \u201c21.78\u201d by her name after her semifinal. The mark bettered the best of 2024 by 0.05. Richardson was every bit as pleased with her 21.92, which matched a personal best. \u201cIt just shows I\u2019ve been working, not just me but my team, preparing for this moment,\u201d Richardson said. Thomas ran a smooth curve and accelerated down the homestretch to hit a time even she wasn\u2019t expecting. She said she\u2019d love to put another low number up in the final Saturday. \u201cI absolutely would,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I make the team, I want to come out with another world lead, another \u2018pb\u2019 and just show everyone I\u2019m ready to compete.\u201d Also in the final will be NCAA champion McKenzie Long, whose 21.83 was the best of 2024 before Friday. Lyles vs. clock Lyles ran a wind-aided 19.60 to win his semifinal, and was thinking about more than the Olympic spot he\u2019ll be racing for Saturday. \u201cAfter the 100s, I was thinking I could come out here and attack the American record again, maybe the world record. We\u2019ll see,\u201d said Lyles, who won the 100 last weekend. Two summers ago on this track, Lyles ran 19.31 to beat by .01 Michael Johnson\u2019s hallowed American record, set at the Atlanta Games in 1996. The world record belongs to Usain Bolt at 19.19. Rai Benjamin Olympic silver medalist Rai Benjamin stayed on pace for a return to the games, finishing his semifinal in the 400 hurdles in 47.97, the only sub-48 time of the meet so far. Benjamin ran 46.17 at the Tokyo Games to finish second in the fastest 400 hurdle race ever. His mark would have been a world record were it not for Norway\u2019s Karsten Warholm, who ran 45.94. They appear headed for a rematch in Paris. Benjamin said he sees no need to post a time in Sunday\u2019s final as a way of sending a message. \u201cIt\u2019s just about making this team,\u201d Benjamin said. \u201cOnce I do that, everything else will take care of itself.\u201d Kara Winger returns Javelin thrower Kara Winger bought herself a few more throws to turn her comeback into her fifth trip to the Olympics. Next up, she needs to eke out another meter. The 38-year-old threw 63.01 meters (206 feet, 8 inches) to win qualifying and advance to Sunday\u2019s finals. But it will take more than a mere top-three finish for her to make it to Paris. She will also need to throw 64 meters, which is the Olympic qualifying standard. \u201cEvery single throw matters, every single throw can be 64 meters,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I know I have it in me. But (63.01 is) the farthest I\u2019ve ever thrown at trials.\u201d Elsewhere \u2014Eric Holt, who made a splash by getting a sponsor this week at trials, initially earned the last qualifying spot for 800 final but was later disqualified for a lane infraction. \u2014Two-time triple jump gold medalist Christian Taylor, making one last run at the Olympics, advanced through qualifying and will jump for a spot in Sunday\u2019s final. \u2014Also returning to the track this weekend is 41-year-old hurdler Lolo Jones, who finished last in her heat but advanced because no one was eliminated in a small prelim field. ___ AP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL29seW1waWNzLTIwMjQtdHJhY2stc2hhY2FycmktaG9sbG93YXktbHlsZXMtYWZmMTQ1NjM0YzRlNzFjZjk5OTA2ZDNkMjI2Yjk1YmPSAQA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Olympics and unfinished business await for hurdler Holloway while Sha'Carri and Lyles keep blazing</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-track-shacarri-holloway-lyles-aff145634c4e71cf99906d3d226b95bc", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/a59b401/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7944x4469+0+414/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F7f%2F2b%2Fbf4278fe820171cc330b2a9287f6%2Fca0b2e915baa4083ba7859fd4e39c53e", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:28:25", "author": "Eddie Pells", "authors": ["Eddie Pells"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.132}

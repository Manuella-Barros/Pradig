Mr. Sullivan said Sunday that Mr. Biden viewed the approval as a \u201ccommon sense\u201d decision, despite concerns of retaliation. \u201cWhat was happening up around Kharkiv, which was new just in the last couple of months, was a Russian offensive where they were moving from one side of the border directly to the other side of the border, and it simply didn\u2019t make sense not to allow the Ukrainians to fire across that border, to hit Russian guns and emplacements that were firing at the Ukrainians,\u201d Mr. Sullivan told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace The Nation.\u201d \u201cSo the president authorized that.\u201d The momentum of Russia\u2019s operation in Kharkiv has stalled, according to Mr. Sullivan, but the area remains under threat. Tension between Russia and the U.S. has escalated since Mr. Biden gave Ukraine the go-ahead. Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Wednesday that Russia could provide weapons to Western adversaries in response to NATO allies allowing Ukraine to use their weaponry to attack Russian territory. Four Russian warships are set to arrive in Havana, Cuba, this week, according to the Associated Press. Cuban officials said Thursday that the warships, which include a nuclear-powered submarine, will not carry nuclear weapons and do \u201cnot represent a threat to the region.\u201d The warships\u2019 maneuvers do not appear to have caught Washington by surprise either. Before the Cuban officials\u2019 announcement, U.S. officials said they were tracking Russian warships expected to arrive in the Caribbean for a military exercise. Growing nuclear threats from Russia, China and others are prompting the U.S. to consider amassing more nuclear weapons, according to Pranay Vaddi, top arms control official at the White House National Security Council. \u201cAbsent a change in the trajectory of adversary arsenals, we may reach a point in the coming years where an increase from current deployed numbers is required and we need to be fully prepared to execute if the president makes that decision,\u201d Mr. Vaddi told the Arms Contol Association on Friday. Mr. Vaddi added, \u201cIf that day does come, it will result from a determination that more nuclear weapons are required to deter our adversaries and protect the American people and our allies and partners.\u201d The U.S. is standing steadfast in its assistance of Ukraine on the battlefield. \u201cThe United States will continue to support Ukraine in holding the line and pushing back against the aggressing Russian forces,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said on CBS. \u2022 This article is based in part on wire service reports.", "summary": "President Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to fire U.S.-provided weapons into Russia was not complicated, according to National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jun/9/approving-ukraines-firing-us-weapons-russia-was-co/", "image": "https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/04/24/Russia_Ukraine_War_Missiles_22241.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:54:36", "author": "Ryan Lovelace", "authors": ["Ryan Lovelace"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.082}

THE POWER LIES WITH THE PEOPLE ALWAYS!!!!!\"\n\nALSO READ: Kenya police fire tear gas at small rallies in capital\n\nThe largely peaceful rallies have widened into a broader campaign against Ruto and his government, with some demonstrations degenerating into violence that has left dozens dead.\n\nLast week, the Kenyan leader announced sharp cuts to government spending in response to growing anger over his cabinet's travel and renovation budgets while ordinary citizens struggle to cope with a cost of living crisis.\n\nThe government will also have to increase its borrowing to pay for some services even as it grapples with massive foreign debt amounting to 70 percent of GDP.\n\nThe crisis led US-based Moody's to downgrade Kenya's debt rating further into junk territory, warning of a negative outlook, which will make borrowing even more expensive for the cash-strapped government.\n\nThe ratings agency said it was cutting the ratings for Kenyan government debt to Caa1 -- considered to have \"very high credit risk\" -- with the move reflecting Ruto's \"significantly diminished capacity\" to raise taxes and reduce debt.\n\nThe businessman-turned-politician, who won elections in 2022 on the promise to lift the fortunes of the common man, was caught off guard by the depth of public anger over the proposed tax hikes, which followed an earlier round of increases last year.\n\nALSO READ: Kenya revolt is a stark warning\n\nRuto also said Thursday that he will \"immediately engage in extensive consultations across different sectors and political formations, with the aim of setting up a broad-based government\".\n\nThis government would, he said, help him to develop \"radical programmes\" to deal with the country's huge debt burden, increase job opportunities, eliminate government waste and \"slay the dragon of corruption\".\n\nIn addition to scrapping the annual finance bill which included the tax hikes, Ruto has also sought to engage with some of the protesters, hosting an event on X with young Kenyans last week.\n\nBut this has failed to appease some demonstrators, who have continued to call for him to step down, using the hashtag #RutoMustGo and staging smaller rallies across Kenyan cities.\n\nPublic debt amounts to some 10 trillion shillings ($78 billion), around 70 percent of Kenya's GDP.\n\nThe government's decision to borrow more will result in the fiscal deficit rising from 3.3 percent to 4.6 percent, according to Ruto.", "source": {"uri": "citizen.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Citizen"}, "authors": [{"uri":

THE POWER LIES WITH THE PEOPLE ALWAYS!!!!!\"\n\nThe largely peaceful rallies have widened into a broader campaign against Ruto and his government, with some demonstrations degenerating into violence that has left dozens dead.\n\nLast week, the Kenyan leader announced sharp cuts to government spending in response to growing anger over his cabinet's travel and renovation budgets while ordinary citizens struggle to cope with a cost of living crisis.\n\nThe government will also have to increase its borrowing to pay for some services even as it grapples with massive foreign debt amounting to 70 percent of GDP.\n\nThe crisis led US-based Moody's to downgrade Kenya's debt rating further into junk territory, warning of a negative outlook, which will make borrowing even more expensive for the cash-strapped government.\n\nThe ratings agency said it was cutting the ratings for Kenyan government debt to Caa1 -- considered to have \"very high credit risk\" -- with the move reflecting Ruto's \"significantly diminished capacity\" to raise taxes and reduce debt.\n\n'Radical programmes'\n\nThe businessman-turned-politician, who won elections in 2022 on the promise to lift the fortunes of the common man, was caught off guard by the depth of public anger over the proposed tax hikes, which followed an earlier round of increases last year.\n\nRuto also said Thursday that he will \"immediately engage in extensive consultations across different sectors and political formations, with the aim of setting up a broad-based government\".\n\nThis government would, he said, help him to develop \"radical programmes\" to deal with the country's huge debt burden, increase job opportunities, eliminate government waste and \"slay the dragon of corruption\".\n\nIn addition to scrapping the annual finance bill which included the tax hikes, Ruto has also sought to engage with some of the protesters, hosting an event on X with young Kenyans last week.\n\nBut this has failed to appease some demonstrators, who have continued to call for him to step down, using the hashtag #RutoMustGo and staging smaller rallies across Kenyan cities.\n\nPublic debt amounts to some 10 trillion shillings ($78 billion), around 70 percent of Kenya's GDP.\n\nThe government's decision to borrow more will result in the fiscal deficit rising from 3.3 percent to 4.6 percent, according to Ruto.", "source":

It will go down to county governments, it will go down to the members of the national assembly and it will go down to churches,\" Mokua said.\n\nThe secretary-general of Kenya's ruling United Democratic Alliance, Cleophas Malala, said the party will start a program of government outreach and engagement.\n\nHe said political leaders must not come to the people only when they want their votes.\n\nSome experts blame the recent protests on a lack of space for Kenyans to air their grievances, and the government's failure to engage with the public on laws being considered.\n\nThe constitution requires citizens' input before a law is passed, something that successive Kenyan administrations have made little effort to obtain.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ruto", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William Ruto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State-owned enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voice of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Democratic_Alliance_(Kenya)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Democratic Alliance (Kenya)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleophas_Malala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleophas Malala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generation Z"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Scientology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Scientology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://gdb.voanews.com/794994FC-B690-4254-B716-B3505FF5EC3E.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724724", "eventUri": "eng-9724724", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

almost entire cabinet after deadly protests", "body": "Led largely by young, Gen-Z Kenyans, the protests plunged President William Ruto\u2019s administration into crisis, forcing him to abandon the tax hikes\n\nKenyan President William Ruto announced on Thursday the dismissal of almost his entire cabinet and consultations to form a \u201cbroad-based government\u201d following widespread anti-government protests.\n\nThe East African nation was left reeling after peaceful rallies last month over steep tax increases flared into deadly violence with police firing at crowds who stormed parliament, leaving it partly ablaze.\n\nLed largely by young, Gen-Z Kenyans, the protests plunged Ruto\u2019s administration into the most serious crisis of his presidency, forcing him to abandon the tax hikes and scramble to contain the damage.\n\nIn the latest move to defuse tensions, Ruto said his decision would extend to all ministers including the attorney general but excluded Prime Cabinet Secretary and Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi and Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua.\n\nRuto said he decided on the dismissals \u201cupon reflection, listening keenly to what the people of Kenya have said and after a holistic appraisal of the performance of my cabinet and its achievements and challenges\u201d.\n\nThe largely peaceful rallies have widened into a broader campaign against Ruto and his government, with some demonstrations degenerating into violence that has left dozens dead.\n\nLast week, the Kenyan leader announced sharp cuts to government spending in response to growing anger over his cabinet\u2019s travel and renovation budgets while ordinary citizens struggle to cope with a cost of living crisis.\n\nThe government will also have to increase its borrowing to pay for some services even as it grapples with massive foreign debt amounting to 70 per cent of GDP.\n\nThe crisis led US-based Moody\u2019s to downgrade Kenya\u2019s debt rating further into junk territory, warning of a negative outlook, which will make borrowing even more expensive for the cash-strapped government.\n\nThe ratings agency said it was cutting the ratings for Kenyan government debt to Caa1 \u2013 considered to have \u201cvery high credit risk\u201d \u2013 with the move reflecting Ruto\u2019s \u201csignificantly diminished capacity\u201d to raise taxes and reduce debt.\n\nThe businessman-turned-politician, who won elections in 2022 on the promise to lift the fortunes of the common man, was caught off guard by the depth of public anger over the proposed tax hikes, which followed an earlier round of increases last year.\n\nRuto also said Thursday he will \u201cimmediately engage in extensive consultations across different sectors and political formations, with the aim of setting up a broad-based government\u201d.\n\nThis government would, he said, help him to develop \u201cradical programmes\u201d to deal with the country\u2019s huge debt burden, increase job opportunities, eliminate government waste and \u201cslay the dragon of corruption\u201d.\n\nIn addition to scrapping the annual finance bill which included the tax hikes, Ruto has also sought to engage with some of the protesters, hosting an event on X with young Kenyans last week.\n\nBut this has failed to appease some demonstrators, who have continued to call for him to step down, using the hashtag #RutoMustGo and staging smaller rallies across Kenyan cities.\n\nPublic debt amounts to some 10 trillion shillings (US$78 billion), around 70 per cent of Kenya\u2019s GDP.\n\nThe government\u2019s decision to borrow more will result in the fiscal deficit rising from 3.3 per cent to 4.6 per cent, according to Ruto.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

THE POWER LIES WITH THE PEOPLE ALWAYS!!!!!\"\n\nThe largely peaceful rallies have widened into a broader campaign against Ruto and his government, with some demonstrations degenerating into violence that has left dozens dead.\n\nLast week, the Kenyan leader announced sharp cuts to government spending in response to growing anger over his cabinet's travel and renovation budgets while ordinary citizens struggle to cope with a cost of living crisis.\n\nThe government will also have to increase its borrowing to pay for some services even as it grapples with massive foreign debt amounting to 70 percent of GDP.\n\nThe protests were largely led by young Kenyans\n\nThe crisis led US-based Moody's to downgrade Kenya's debt rating further into junk territory, warning of a negative outlook, which will make borrowing even more expensive for the cash-strapped government.\n\nThe ratings agency said it was cutting the ratings for Kenyan government debt to Caa1 -- considered to have \"very high credit risk\" -- with the move reflecting Ruto's \"significantly diminished capacity\" to raise taxes and reduce debt.\n\n- 'Radical programmes' -\n\nThe businessman-turned-politician, who won elections in 2022 on the promise to lift the fortunes of the common man, was caught off guard by the depth of public anger over the proposed tax hikes, which followed an earlier round of increases last year.\n\nRuto also said Thursday that he will \"immediately engage in extensive consultations across different sectors and political formations, with the aim of setting up a broad-based government\".\n\nRuto said he decided on the dismissals 'upon reflection'\n\nThis government would, he said, help him to develop \"radical programmes\" to deal with the country's huge debt burden, increase job opportunities, eliminate government waste and \"slay the dragon of corruption\".\n\nIn addition to scrapping the annual finance bill which included the tax hikes, Ruto has also sought to engage with some of the protesters, hosting an event on X with young Kenyans last week.\n\nBut this has failed to appease some demonstrators, who have continued to call for him to step down, using the hashtag #RutoMustGo and staging smaller rallies across Kenyan cities.\n\nPublic debt amounts to some 10 trillion shillings ($78 billion), around 70 percent of Kenya's GDP.\n\nThe government's decision to borrow more will result in the fiscal deficit rising from 3.3 percent to 4.6 percent, according to Ruto.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

THE POWER LIES WITH THE PEOPLE ALWAYS!!!!!\"\n\nThe largely peaceful rallies have widened into a broader campaign against Ruto and his government, with some demonstrations degenerating into violence that has left dozens dead.\n\nLast week, the Kenyan leader announced sharp cuts to government spending in response to growing anger over his cabinet's travel and renovation budgets while ordinary citizens struggle to cope with a cost of living crisis.\n\nThe government will also have to increase its borrowing to pay for some services even as it grapples with massive foreign debt amounting to 70 percent of GDP.\n\nThe crisis led US-based Moody's to downgrade Kenya's debt rating further into junk territory, warning of a negative outlook, which will make borrowing even more expensive for the cash-strapped government.\n\nMore from this section French leftists pitch candidates for PM after inconclusive vote Prominent Democrats Issue Memo Proposes Biden's Mid-July Exit from Presidential Race, Calls for 'Blitz Primary' Nation's first pharmacy on wheels hits CT streets\n\nThe ratings agency said it was cutting the ratings for Kenyan government debt to Caa1 -- considered to have \"very high credit risk\" -- with the move reflecting Ruto's \"significantly diminished capacity\" to raise taxes and reduce debt.\n\n- 'Radical programmes' -\n\nThe businessman-turned-politician, who won elections in 2022 on the promise to lift the fortunes of the common man, was caught off guard by the depth of public anger over the proposed tax hikes, which followed an earlier round of increases last year.\n\nRuto also said Thursday that he will \"immediately engage in extensive consultations across different sectors and political formations, with the aim of setting up a broad-based government\".\n\nThis government would, he said, help him to develop \"radical programmes\" to deal with the country's huge debt burden, increase job opportunities, eliminate government waste and \"slay the dragon of corruption\".\n\nIn addition to scrapping the annual finance bill which included the tax hikes, Ruto has also sought to engage with some of the protesters, hosting an event on X with young Kenyans last week.\n\nBut this has failed to appease some demonstrators, who have continued to call for him to step down, using the hashtag #RutoMustGo and staging smaller rallies across Kenyan cities.\n\nPublic debt amounts to some 10 trillion shillings ($78 billion), around 70 percent of Kenya's GDP.\n\nThe government's decision to borrow more will result in the fiscal deficit rising from 3.3 percent to 4.6 percent, according to Ruto.\n\nbur-amu/rbu/ach", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The move follows nationwide protests over against new taxes he was compelled to scrap.\n\nThe youth-led protests against the Finance Bill in June turned violent, leaving at least 39 people dead in clashes with the police. Some organisers had vowed to stage protests twice weekly until Ruto himself stepped down.\n\n\"I will immediately engage in extensive consultations across different sectors and political formations and other Kenyans, both in public and private, with the aim of setting up a broad-based government,\" Ruto said in a televised address in which he said additional measures would be announced soon.\n\nThe Kenyan leader said he had also dismissed the Attorney General, but the Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi, who is also the Cabinet Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Diaspora Affairs, would remain in office. The dissolution of his cabinet does not affect Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, who cannot legally be sacked.\n\nRuto announced on June 27 that he would pull the willy unpopular Fnance Bill that proposed taxes on everything from bread, sugar and vegetable oil to motor vehicles and mobile money transactions .\n\nThe bill aimed to raise KES346bn ($2.68bn) in additional revenue, equivalent to about 3% of GDP, to help pay down the East African country's spiralling debt, a necessity for accessing more International Monetary Fund (IMF) financing.\n\nIn June, the IMF reported that Kenya experienced \"a significant shortfall in tax revenue collection and deterioration in the primary fiscal balance in FY2023/24 relative to program targets is expected to keep domestic borrowing needs elevated\".\n\nEast Africa's most-developed nation owes about $80bn in domestic and foreign debt that together stand at 68% of GDP, while the World Bank and IMF's recommended maximum is 55%. Most of Kenya's debt is owed to international bondholders. Its biggest bilateral creditor is China, to which it owes $5.7bn.\n\nWithout going into detail, Ruto said in the televised address on Thursday he would set up new government that would assist him in accelerating the necessary, urgent and irreversible implementation of a raft of measures.\n\nThese include tackling the debt burden, raising domestic revenue, expanding job opportunities, trimming back government agencies with overlapping duties and combatting corruption.\n\nDoing so, Ruto said, would consequently make the government leaner, but also more effective and efficient.\n\n\"During this process, the operations of government will continue uninterrupted under the guidance of Principal Secretaries and other relevant officials,\" he said. Ruto has not indicated when he expects to name a new government.\n\nThis is the second Cabinet shake-up since Ruto took office in September 2022 after winning a contested election by a narrow margin, with the first coming in October 2023.", "source": {"uri": "intellinews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Intellinews                        "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ruto", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William Ruto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Cabinet_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Cabinet Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigathi_Gachagua", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rigathi Gachagua"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Kenya)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Kenya)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musalia_Mudavadi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Musalia Mudavadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_President_of_Kenya", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deputy President of Kenya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diaspora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sugar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vegetable oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "http://www.intellinews.com/img/main_logo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724724", "eventUri": "eng-9724724", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 54, "textEnd": 61}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 1127, "textEnd": 1134}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Some demonstrators briefly stormed parliament, before Ruto abandoned the new taxes.\n\n\"I will immediately engage in extensive consultations across different sectors and political formations and other Kenyans, both in public and private, with the aim of setting up a broad-based government,\" Ruto said in a televised address to the nation, adding that he would announce additional measures later.\n\nHe also dismissed the attorney general but said the office of the deputy president was not affected.\n\nThe sweeping cabinet changes were what Kenyans have been asking for, veteran anti-corruption activist John Githongo told Reuters.\n\n\"Let us see what happens now if the new ministers deal with big issues around corruption and just the arrogance and excess of his administration and the fact that a lot of Kenyans died during the demonstrations,\" he said. \"Hopefully this should temporarily calm things.\"\n\nRuto has been caught between the demands of lenders such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cut deficits and a hard-pressed population reeling from rising cost of living.\n\nLast week he proposed spending cuts and additional borrowing in roughly equal measure to fill the nearly $2.7 billion budget hole caused by the withdrawal of the tax hikes.\n\nAnalysts have said the tax rollback means Kenya is likely to miss IMF targets although the government does not have debts that are due.\n\nThe budget deficit is now projected at 4.6% of gross domestic product in the fiscal year that started on July 1.\n\nOjango Omondi, a community activist from the Social Justice Centres Working Group in Nairobi, said dismissing so many cabinet ministers was a \"move towards justice\", but activists would want to see who Ruto appoints in their place.\n\n\"It's one thing to dismiss, the second is to ensure that the people that will be chosen in the cabinet are accountable to the constitution and the rule of law,\" Omondi said.

Mudavadi will also continue to double up as the country's foreign affairs cabinet secretary.\n\nRuto attributed the mass dismissals to the protests and resulting withdrawal of his government's controversial finance bill, which he said had brought the country to \"an inflection point\".\n\nThe firing of the cabinet has been one of the protesters' key demands.

The plan received the backing of the opposition on Tuesday, but has generally been rejected by protesters who say they only want their demands met.\n\nThey have planned a major nationwide protest on Tuesday, July 16 -- a day after the dialogue forum is due to begin. Demonstrators have also demanded Ruto's resignation.\n\nThe protests, in which dozens of people were killed in clashes with security agents, was first sparked by opposition to tax hikes in the finance bill.\n\nThe demonstrations have continued despite the president's decision to scrap the bill last month.

The protests turned violent, leading to the death of at least 39 people. Ruto promised a broad-based government and additional measures to address the crisis.\n\nKenyan President William Ruto on Thursday fired his entire cabinet apart from the foreign minister, responding to the pressure from nationwide protests that have posed the biggest crisis of his two-year presidency. The youth-led protests against proposed tax hikes started peacefully but escalated into violence, resulting in at least 39 deaths in clashes with police last month. Some protesters briefly stormed parliament, prompting Ruto to retract the new taxes.\n\n\"I will immediately engage in extensive consultations across different sectors and political formations and other Kenyans, both in public and private, with the aim of setting up a broad-based government,\" Ruto said in a televised address to the nation, adding that he would announce additional measures later. He also dismissed the attorney general, noting that the office of the deputy president remains unaffected.\n\nThe sweeping cabinet overhaul was a response to public demands, according to veteran anti-corruption activist John Githongo. \"Let us see what happens now if the new ministers tackle significant issues like corruption, government excesses, and the deaths during the demonstrations,\" Githongo told Reuters, expressing hope for temporary calm.\n\nRuto has been navigating between the expectations of international lenders such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for deficit reduction and a population burdened by rising living costs. Last week, he proposed measures involving spending cuts and additional borrowing to address a $2.7 billion budget deficit caused by the rollback of tax hikes.\n\nAnalysts suggested that the tax rollback could lead Kenya to miss IMF targets, despite the government not facing imminent debts. The budget deficit is projected to be 4.6% of GDP for the fiscal year starting July 1.\n\nOjango Omondi, a community activist, described the cabinet dismissals as a \"move towards justice\" but emphasized the importance of appointing accountable new ministers. \"It's one thing to dismiss, the second is to ensure that the new cabinet members adhere to the constitution and rule of law,\" Omondi said.

This unprecedented move comes amid rising political tensions and public demand for government accountability.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Nairobi, President Ruto justified the sweeping dismissals as a necessary step to restore public trust and improve government efficiency. \"Today marks a new chapter for our nation,\" Ruto declared. \"We must build a government that is transparent, accountable, and responsive to the needs of the Kenyan people.\"\n\nThe president's decision has sent shockwaves through the political landscape, with analysts speculating on the potential implications for the country's governance and future policies. This bold move is expected to pave the way for a significant reshuffling within the government, as Ruto seeks to consolidate his administration and introduce new faces into key positions.\n\nThe announcement has elicited mixed reactions from various political factions. Supporters of President Ruto have hailed the decision as a courageous and necessary action to address issues of corruption and inefficiency within the government. However, critics argue that the move could lead to political instability and disrupt ongoing governmental projects and policies.\n\nPolitical analyst Peter Kihara commented on the potential impact of the dismissals, stating, \"This is an extraordinary step by President Ruto. While it signals his commitment to reform, it also raises questions about the continuity of governance and the potential for political backlash from those who have been removed from their positions.\"\n\nWith the entire cabinet and the attorney general dismissed, President Ruto faces the daunting task of appointing new leaders who can effectively steer the country through its current challenges. The president has emphasized the importance of selecting individuals who are not only competent but also committed to upholding the principles of integrity and public service.\n\nObservers will be closely watching the upcoming appointments and the subsequent performance of the new cabinet. The success of these changes will be critical in determining whether President Ruto's administration can achieve its goals of reform and enhanced governance.\n\nAs Kenya navigates this period of political transformation, the international community will also be paying attention to the developments. The stability and effectiveness of the Kenyan government are crucial not only for the country's progress but also for the broader East African region.\n\nRuto's dismissal of all cabinet secretaries and the attorney general marks a significant turning point in Kenyan politics.

corner", "body": "Dr Ruto's withdrawal of the Finance Bill 2024, which contained tax proposals to raise an additional Sh350 billion, did little to quell the protests by the Gen Zs who have also complained about governance ills and demanded accountability in how government is run.\n\nPresident William Ruto has borrowed from the 2005 script by President Mwai Kibaki who fired his entire cabinet after a humiliating defeat at a national referendum in his bid to shore up dwindling public confidence in his administration.\n\nBut unlike President Kibaki who lost the vote that scuttled a government-sponsored constitution draft, President Ruto has been forced to act by protests by youths initially sparked by unpopular taxes and extravagance by the elite in the face of economic hardships by the majority.\n\nDr Ruto's withdrawal of the Finance Bill 2024, which contained tax proposals to raise an additional Sh350 billion, did little to quell the protests by the Gen Zs who have also complained about governance ills and demanded accountability in how government is run.\n\nIn the past, the government had disregarded public opposition to tax increases, even after public hearings, and exploited a ruling coalition majority to shove the unpopular policies down the throats of weary Kenyans, a script it had replayed with the recent Bill after failing to read public mood.\n\nThe bloody crackdown by police - at least 39 people have been killed and hundreds injured, infiltration of the protests by goons in an orgy of violence and looting, occasioning economic losses running into billions, meant the crisis could no longer be ignored.\n\nPresident Ruto first signalled the looming cabinet changes a week ago, committing to \"shortly\" reorganise his government during an address from State House last Friday as unrelenting protestors piled up pressure on his administration.\n\nA subsequent engagement with the youths on X Spaces proved insufficient to appease the government critics who have warned of more protests, defying State-sponsored terror, including abductions, torture and killings unleashed to try to suppress the demonstrations.\n\nIt was the president's third address since the protests started a month ago, the first on the day demonstrators stormed Parliament, attracting a backlash after the president was accused of failing to show empathy to the families of those killed.\n\nThe second address during which the president sought to assuage bitter Kenyans saw him announce the withdrawal of the controversial tax proposals but his statement on June 27 was marred by a sensational claim by Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua.\n\nMr Gachagua, who unusually convened a press briefing after the president's address, claimed the National Intelligence Service boss Noordin Haji had not given a proper brief about the scale of public disillusionment.\n\nThis stunning address by the deputy president publicly exposed the deep rifts within the government although the conflict had been raging for some time with Mr Gachagua accusing some of the president's allies of attempting to demean his office.\n\nFurther infuriating demonstrators was the government's action, on the day President Ruto was backing down on the Finance Bill, to call out the military to the streets, a reaction that questioned the State's sincerity to negotiate a truce and which only hardened government critics.\n\nAlready rocked by internal strife, the protests only further exposed the Kenya Kwanza government's soft underbelly just two years after storming to power on a populist campaign that promised to uplift the downtrodden and ensure equal access to opportunity irrespective of class.\n\nThe initial response to the public revolt that was building up online was a contemptuous dismissal by the president's allies and advisors, including David Ndii who dared the Gen Zs saying their campaign could not move beyond social media.\n\nIt is a line that government functionaries constantly hammered until the crisis snowballed into a huge protest that brought the capital city to a standstill and the world took notice of the revolution that was aided by online mobilisation.\n\nAt one point, even the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which has been accused of prescribing harsh policies like more taxes that are hurting Kenyans was forced to declare it was not to blame for the Kenyan government's actions that had triggered the rebellion.\n\nWhile the president has made missteps in his response to the crisis, his action today to fire the entire cabinet, apart from his deputy- the DP's tenure is ring-fenced by the constitution- and Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi- perhaps for political and diplomatic considerations given his Foreign Affairs portfolio- offers him the opportunity to buy time.\n\nBut eyes will be on the new Cabinet appointments and whether they will be a break from the past in terms of the credentials of the appointees and their ability to offer hope that they will run a government that is sensitive to the plight of Kenyans already battered by the runaway cost of living.\n\nThe president will also be under scrutiny to ensure a lean government- it is expected he will cascade the crackdown to principal secretaries- that reflects his belt-tightening campaign in the face of the nation's financial challenges largely attributed to soaring debt and wastage.\n\nThis will require a delicate balancing act to deliver considering the talk of a government of national unity, which is interpreted as coopting more opposition members.\n\nThe country's past experience with this has been a bloated government, which will be unacceptable to the public and will further inflame the inferno.", "source": {"uri":

The decision, announced on Thursday, comes amidst weeks of anti-government protests sparked by a controversial tax bill and a deepening economic crisis.\n\nThe President, in a televised address from State House Nairobi, stated that the decision was made \"upon reflection, and a holistic appraisal\" of his cabinet. He acknowledged that the recent protests had brought the country to an \"inflexion point\" necessitating decisive action.\n\n\"Even with the progress we've made, I'm acutely aware that the people of Kenya have very high expectations of me, and they believe that this administration can undertake the most extensive transformation in our nation's history,\" Ruto said, outlining his commitment to forming a \"broad-based\" new government through extensive consultations.\n\nThe move comes after weeks of escalating tensions, with protests turning violent and claiming the lives of at least 40 people in clashes with police. Demonstrators, angered by the proposed tax hikes, even stormed Parliament, forcing legislators to flee.\n\nThe National Council of Churches of Kenya, representing some of the country's largest churches and religious organisations, had joined the chorus of voices calling for a cabinet shake-up, citing concerns about bad governance and allegations of corruption within the administration.\n\n\"The president has himself said that his Cabinet is incompetent,\" said Reverend Chris Kinyanjui, the Council of Churches' general secretary. \"Kenyans are saying he has an incompetent Cabinet, and in addition, many members of his Cabinet are also corrupt.\"\n\nRuto, facing mounting pressure, withdrew the proposed tax increases, but many Kenyans remain deeply dissatisfied with the government's handling of the economic crisis. They hold the cabinet accountable for the country's burgeoning debt and the rising cost of living.\n\nThe President's decision to dismiss almost his entire cabinet has been met with a mixture of hope and skepticism.\n\n\"Let us see what happens now if the new ministers deal with big issues around corruption and just the arrogance and excess of his administration and the fact that a lot of Kenyans died during the demonstrations,\" said veteran anti-corruption activist John Githongo. \"Hopefully, this should temporarily calm things.\"\n\nOjango Omondi, a community activist from the Social Justice Centres Working Group in Nairobi, echoed the sentiment, saying, \"It's one thing to dismiss, the second is to ensure that the people that will be chosen in the cabinet are accountable to the constitution and the rule of law.\"\n\nWhile the cabinet purge may provide a temporary respite from the protests, it remains to be seen whether it will address the deeper economic and political issues at the heart of the unrest.\n\nRuto's government has been grappling with a difficult balancing act, trying to appease international lenders like the IMF, who are demanding deficit cuts, while also addressing the concerns of a population struggling with rising costs of living.\n\nThe President's recent proposal to reduce government expenditures, including merging key ministries and state corporations, banning the purchase of government vehicles for 12 months, and suspending nonessential travel by state and public officers, has been met with mixed reactions.\n\nAnalysts suggest that the tax rollback, while a concession to protesters, may lead to Kenya missing IMF targets, despite the country's manageable debt levels. The budget deficit is now projected at 4.6% of GDP in the fiscal year that began on July 1st.\n\nThe coming weeks will be crucial for Ruto as he navigates this turbulent period.

Moody's downgraded Kenya's debt rating further into junk territory to Caa1 with a negative outlook, citing Ruto's administration's challenges in fiscal management and debt reduction.\n\nKey figures involved in the protests and government responses include Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, Prime Cabinet Secretary and Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi, and former Defense Minister Aden Duale, who thanked Ruto and the people of Kenya for the opportunity to serve in a social media post following his dismissal", "source": {"uri": "thenews-chronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019\u20132020_Hong_Kong_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2019\u20132020 Hong Kong protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Kenya", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Kenya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ruto", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Ruto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austerity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austerity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moody's_Investors_Service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moody's Investors Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nairobi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nairobi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nairobi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Cabinet_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Cabinet Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigathi_Gachagua", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rigathi Gachagua"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aden_Duale", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aden Duale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musalia_Mudavadi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Musalia Mudavadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_President_of_Kenya", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deputy President of Kenya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenyan_shilling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenyan shilling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/thenews-chronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/kenana-e1720712451784.jpg?fit=659%2C430&ssl=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724724", "eventUri": "eng-9724724", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 53, "textEnd": 60}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-25", "textStart": 530, "textEnd": 537}], "sentiment": -0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 458408645, "relevance": 2}

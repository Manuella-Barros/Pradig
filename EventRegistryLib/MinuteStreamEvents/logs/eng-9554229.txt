Thibs, I love you, baby! But I want to beat you, to a pulp. You want me, I don't want you. It's like a one-sided relationship. You are in love with me and I love you, but I'm not in love with you.\"\n\nTibideau has responded in classic Thibs fashion, pretending like he doesn't know who Butler is before turning his threat back onto him.\n\n\"Who? I don't know him. But I will beat him to a pulp.\"\n\nButler's larger quote was him saying that the Knicks and Celtics would both be home if he was healthy, laughing at the idea of Josh Hart stopping him.\n\n\"If I was playing, Boston would be at home, New York damn sure would be at home,\" said Butler. \"Josh Hart? C'mon, man.\"\n\nButler and Thibodeau are clearly joking as the pair share a great relationship given their former experiences. Thibodeau was Butler's first coach in the NBA on the Chicago Bulls before also coaching Butler at his next stop on the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nWhile their relationship ended in 2018 after 10 games with the Wolves as Butler was traded and Thibs was later fired, it's easy to see how Thibs' personality has shaped the player we know Butler to be. It isn't easy to withstand the aggressive style of coaching the Knicks head coach deploys but Butler thrived under it and blossomed into an NBA star.\n\nJimmy Butler And Tom Thibodeau Have A Love-Hate Relationship\n\nFew player-coach relationships in the NBA are as linked as Thibodeau and Butler. One of the biggest talk points of the 2023 playoff matchup between the Heat and the Knicks was the fact that Butler was going up against Thibodeau once again. Butler even described their relationship as a love-hate one after they spent the summer of 2016 together winning a Gold medal at the Rio Olympics.\n\n\"It's a moment, man. As much stuff (as we went through), as much of a love-hate relationship as we had and still have, it's big. He was always telling me I could be a special player after my rookie season (when) he thought I was terrible, of course. But I've got love for Thibs, a lot of love for Thibs.\"\n\nThibodeau would be the one to bring Butler to the Timberwolves in 2016 as the forward led the franchise to their first playoff appearance since Kevin Garnett was on the franchise, with Thibs as coach and President. But Butler objected to the heavy workload Thibodeau gave him, as the coach is notorious for taxing his preferred players.\n\nButler would force Thibodeau to trade him to the Philadelphia 76ers in 2018 in a messy saga which led to Jimmy's infamous practice beatdown on Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins.\n\nDespite the waves, the relationship between Butler and Thibodeau has remained cordial.

One year removed from their NBA Finals appearance, the Heat failed to make it out of the first round of the playoffs, in large part because of Butler's sprained right MCL. Injuries derailed the Heat all season, and they ultimately resulted in their lack of playoff intensity. This summer, Miami is set to make some key decisions that will impact its future. No decision is more important than the one that will be made regarding Butler's future.\n\nAlthough he is still under contract, Butler is going to be eligible for a contract extension with the Heat. Over his five seasons in Miami, Butler has established himself as the face of the franchise. However, his availability has been the downfall of this organization lately, as he has missed at least 18 games each of the last five years. This is why there are rumors beginning to form regarding possible trade scenarios the Heat could consider involving the 34-year-old.\n\nWhile there is no way to tell what the Heat are going to do, Butler has remained focused on being the best leader he can be. The entire city of Miami has embraced Butler as their fearless leader, which is why he is ready to bounce back in a huge way entering the 2024-25 season.\n\n\"I feel at home, man. I really care about the city, I really care about the people in this city. Miami has embraced me,\" Butler told Rohan Nadkarni of GQ Sports. \"They've wanted me to bring them something they haven't done since LeBron, D-Wade and C-Bosh. And I want to do that. So as soon as I get this knee back right, I'm right back on they ass and everybody know it.\"\n\nButler is serious about his passion for the city of Miami. When he came to the team ahead of the 2019-20 season, many were questioning whether or not Butler was a leader and a player a franchise could embrace. He has quickly shot all of these naysayers down and has once again reaffirmed to everyone that the Heat are perennial contenders. As far as his future goes, Butler's comments appear to suggest that he hasn't given one thought to leaving Miami.\n\nRumors are rumors. Perhaps there is a little bit of truth to some of them, but Butler has sent a clear message that where he is right now is home. A championship is all Butler wants, hence why he mentioned LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Boh. The Heat are one of the best franchises in the history of the NBA, which is why Butler wants to establish his legacy with this franchise by claiming his own title.\n\nLeaving the Heat and going to another team doesn't appear to be something on Butler's mind -- at least entering this offseason.\n\nJimmy Butler to leave Heat for Brazil?\n\nButler has made it clear that the Heat are his team and that he is focused on getting healthy so he can be the best version of himself. At 34 years old and eligible for a contract extension, it will be interesting to see what Miami decides to do over the summer. They could let their star know that they want him to stay long-term until the end of his career with a new contract. At least, the Heat could keep Butler until the end of his NBA career.\n\nIt is extremely rare for NBA players to retire and end their basketball career in a different country, but it seems like this is a possibility for Butler. While speaking with Nadkarni, Butler discussed the possibility of joining Flamengo in Brazil's premier basketball league, the Novo Basquete Brasil (NBB).\n\n\"I mean, yeah. In the NBA? For sure,\" Butler confirmed, regarding a Heat jersey being his last NBA uniform. \"But then after that, I really do want to play for Flamengo. I tell everybody, I'm half-Brazilian.\"\n\nButler, who is close with Brazilian soccer player Neymar, has spent a lot of time through the years in Brazil. It is possible that his connections to the country could potentially lead to him playing at least one season in the NBB at some point in his career.\n\nOf course, all of this depends on his future with the Heat. After Heat president Pat Riley's recent press conference, it is hard to tell what Butler's immediate future is looking like.\n\nPat Riley's questionable comments\n\nRiley did not hold back when discussing the state of the Heat in his end-of-season press conference on Monday. Despite reaffirming that the team won't be trading Butler, the long-time executive pointed out that he was not fond of Butler's comments about defeating the Boston Celtics in their first-round series if he was healthy.\n\n\"They are, this year, the best team in the league,\" Riley said of the Celtics. \"For him to say that, you know, I thought, is that Jimmy trolling? Or is that Jimmy serious? If you're not on the court, playing against Boston, or on the court playing against the New York Knicks, you should keep your mouth shut and the criticism of those teams.\"\n\nThis was one of those comments that you don't really know how to respond to. Was Riley being serious with his delivery here, or was he just messing with his star player? Butler and Riley share two similar personalities where they always seem to poke fun at certain things, but at the end of the day, the meaning behind everything they say is always true and factual. It really does seem like Riley was sending a clear message to Butler here, which can be a dangerous approach for teams with their star players.\n\nButler is not a softie. He probably saw Riley's message and laughed. How these comments and the current thought process of the Heat's front office impact potential contract negotiations with Butler is the key topic of discussion here. The important note is that after Riley called out Butler, he went on to talk about the star's value to the Heat as a whole.\n\n\"Who moves the needle the most on our team is Jimmy,\" Riley continued. \"Jimmy moves the needle the most. He's an incredible player. What I said at the beginning about change is he's got to give it some thought himself for this team to be what he wants it to be and what I want it to be, and [owner] Micky [Arison] and everybody else. This five-year window, we've been pretty successful. We haven't won the chip, and I think that bothers everybody.\"\n\nThe goal in Miami is to win a championship. The Heat know they have a good shot to do so when everyone, including Butler, is healthy. That is why they aren't going to give up on him just yet. Butler wants to stay in Miami, and it appears as if Riley isn't giving any thought to him not being on the roster at the start of the 2024-25 season. As of right now, all indications point towards the Heat staying the course after a rough 2023-24 campaign.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brett_siegel@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Brett Siegel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Bulldogs_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler Bulldogs men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_collateral_ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medial collateral ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CR_Flamengo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CR Flamengo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novo_Basquete_Brasil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Novo Basquete Brasil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dwyane Wade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neymar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neymar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Heating_and_Cooling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Heating and Cooling", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy_and_Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy and Environment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/7382810141.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554229", "eventUri": "eng-9554229", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

He's made two All-Star teams, three All-NBA teams, an All-Defensive team and led them to two Finals runs.\n\nThe NBA is a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately league, though. After a first-round exit in which Butler was not healthy enough to play, Pat Riley seems like he might be ready to move on from the Playoff Jimmy era. The Heat's team president raised some eyebrows when he expressed hesitation about extending his star at the end of the season.\n\n\"We don't have to do that for a year. We have not discussed that internally right now, but we have to look at making that kind of commitment,\" Riley told reporters.\n\nRiley said that Butler would not be traded for now, but he didn't sound all that happy with his franchise player's performance. He criticized Butler for trolling the Celtics during the Heat's swift first-round loss, expressing that \"if you're not on the court playing, you should keep your mouth shut.\"\n\nThat matches up with the \"increasingly loud whispers that [Butler's] future might not be in Miami,\" according to The Athletic's John Hollinger. The six-time All-Star is 34 years old and on the verge of getting paid again. That would complicate the Heat's cap situation even further -- they're already projected to be well into the tax and likely over the first apron for a team that barely made the playoffs this season.\n\nIf Riley is starting to sour on Butler, then this summer would be the time to trade him for maximum value. Here's where he could end up.\n\nMORE: Pat Riley discusses Jimmy Butler's future at end-of-season press conference\n\nButler is under contract through the 2024-25 season with a $52.4 million player option for 2025-26.\n\nButler is seeking a three-year, $161.7 million deal this offseason, per the Miami Herald. Such an extension would guarantee his contract through 2027 when he will be 37.\n\nRiley made it clear that availability is Miami's top concern as it relates to a long-term commitment, and that comes as little surprise. Butler has missed at least 18 regular season games in each of the last four seasons, and that trend typically doesn't improve when a player enters his mid-to-late 30s.\n\nThe Knicks have been stockpiling assets for a star. They have up to eight first-round picks that they could move in a deal this summer, along with a ton of matching salary.\n\nTom Thibodeau and Butler obviously have a strong connection, dating from their days both in Chicago and Minnesota. Thibs has already traded for Butler once. Nothing would make him happier than another reunion.\n\nNew York is so reliant on Jalen Brunson to produce everything for its offense. Butler would give the Knicks a second option that could get to his spots on the floor, along with an absolutely deadly closer at the end of games. Playoff Jimmy is one year removed from finishing runner-up in the Clutch Player of the Year award, and he's shown his value over the years in the postseason where he regularly morphs into an MVP candidate.\n\nHere's what a Knicks deal would potentially look like:\n\nThe Knicks don't have cap space to work with, so they'd have to get up to Butler's $48.7 million salary. Julius Randle and Bojan Bogdanovic are easy ways to match. Their 2024 first-round pick is slotted at No. 25. Throw in an additional two firsts, and this seems like the type of big deal needed to get Butler.\n\nFor the Heat, this trade gets them out of luxury tax hell and gives them a younger player who can create some badly-needed offense for them. They were ranked 21st on that end of the floor this season.\n\nRandle commands double teams regularly. He'd be fantastic when surrounded by Miami's shooters. He is a significantly worse player than Butler, but the main draw would be a chance to take a small step back, add picks to bring in another player down the road and get salary relief to usher in the next era of Heat basketball.\n\nThe Pistons are part of this deal for bookkeeping purposes. As a team with a ton of cap space, they can take in a player without having to send one back. This would be a nice piece of business for them, essentially reversing the trade that they made a few months ago and getting Bogdanovic back for a fraction of the price that they traded him away for.\n\nDetroit is trying to add veterans to improve next year, so this would line up with its incentives.\n\nThe 76ers made a massive mistake in choosing Tobias Harris over Butler back in 2019. It's one that Jimmy still remembers. This could be their chance to rectify that mistake.\n\nMORE: Why the Sixers chose Tobias Harris over Jimmy Butler\n\nPhiladelphia has positioned itself for a unique offseason. It has a ton of optionality, with the ability to clear over $60 million in cap space . That, combined with up to five first-rounders that they can move after the draft, makes the 76ers an attractive trade partner.\n\nHere's what a deal could look like:\n\nFor the Heat, this trade would make them a lot worse present day, but they would be much better positioned for the future. They get a young big man prospect in Paul Reed who could be a killer defender in the Heat's system. In addition, they would get way under the tax and be able to completely reshape their roster. They'd also add the No. 16 pick in this year's draft, along with two not-too-distant future picks.\n\nPhilly's reasons for doing this are obvious. The 76ers have needed a closer at the end of games, and Butler is as good as it gets. He and Joel Embiid already have a good relationship, which would keep their MVP happy. And Tyrese Maxey would fit in great alongside both of those stars.\n\nA better free agent isn't available in this class, so this would be the best possible outcome for the Sixers.\n\nThe Lakers would be salivating at the opportunity of adding Butler next to long-time playoff rival LeBron James. They need more shot creation. Butler can still do that at an extremely high level.\n\nLos Angeles doesn't have as much to offer as the Knicks or Sixers, so it could only get into the Butler sweepstakes if those other teams decided that they didn't want to throw in all of their draft equity.\n\nHere's what the Lakers could give up:\n\nLike the Knicks, the Lakers don't have cap space. They'd have to rope in a team with money to spend like the Pistons to get the Heat the salary savings that they're seeking.\n\nThe Lakers would have to send out money to match Butler's big salary. D'Angelo Russell would have to opt into the next year of his deal for this to work, which might not be too far-fetched given how poorly he played in the 2024 NBA Playoffs. Rui Hachimura and Gabe Vincent would be the other outgoing pieces.\n\nLos Angeles has up to three first-rounders that it can move after the draft, in 2024, 2029 and 2031. It would need to include all of them to be competitive.\n\nThe Heat would get the return of Vincent, who played very well for them in the past. Hachimura is a good young player who could give them some shotmaking. And the draft compensation here isn't bad -- three first-rounders and two seconds from the Pistons. This gets them out of the tax, a starter from their Finals team and another young starter-quality player.\n\nThe Pistons would get a veteran guard who could show Cade Cunningham and Jaden Ivey the ropes while adding some much-needed shooting to their roster in Russell. It would be tough to get a player like him to sign in free agency, so trading for one is a good option for them.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"},

After several terrific seasons together, the Heat will have to decide whether or not to retain superstar Jimmy Butler.\n\nButler, 34, is set to have a cap hit of a whopping $48.7 million next season before a player option presents itself in the 2025-26 season. He is two years away from free agency, a prospect that some Heat fans might not look forward to.\n\nNBA writer Rohan Nadkarni joined The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz on Thursday to discuss the happenings in the NBA. Among them were Butler and his looming expiring contract, and comments the star made about owner Pat Riley recently. Nadkarni thinks it's a no-brainer that the Heat should make the move to lock their superstar up for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"I think it would be crazy for the Heat not to extend Jimmy Butler,\" Nadkarni said. \"I think people have already very quickly forgotten where this franchise was in the 3-4 years before he got there.\" Nadkarni continued on, and then added, \"No superstar in the NBA has done more with less than Jimmy Butler has in the last five years.\"", "source": {"uri": "thecomeback.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Comeback"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_novak@thecomeback.com", "name": "Chris Novak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Bulldogs_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler Bulldogs men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Center_(Philadelphia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dan_Le_Batard_Show_with_Stugotz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Riley"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://cdn1.thecomeback.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/USATSI_23051313-scaled-e1715287071455.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554229", "eventUri": "eng-9554229", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-04-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Come on man'", "body": "The New York Knicks have received a heap of praise for downing the Philadelphia 76ers 4-2 in their 2024 Eastern Conference first-round series, but not from one former NBA All-Star.\n\nMiami Heat forward Jimmy Butler fired shots at the Knicks in an Instagram video that soon went viral. As ClutchPoints shared on X, he declared that if he were healthy, the Knicks would be home right now, along with the Boston Celtics (h/t Zach Braziller of the New York Post):\n\n\"If I was playing, Boston would be at home. New York would damn sure be f****** at home,\" Butler boasted.\n\nWhen he was asked about Hart and Thibodeau, he continued: \"F*** that mean to me? Josh Hart? Come on man. Nah, I love Thibs. Thibs! I love you, baby. I want to beat you, to a pulp!\"\n\nButler was able to lead the Heat to wins over the Knicks in the 2023 Eastern Conference Semifinals and the Celtics in that year's Eastern Conference Finals en route to their second NBA Finals berth since 2020. Hence why he's continued to bask in his bragging rights.\n\nThis year though, the Heat finished as the No. 8 seed in the East. Therefore, he wouldn't have even had the opportunity to eliminate the Knicks, who finished as the No. 2 seed, until at least the Conference Finals, neither could he have knocked them out of playoff contention with four games having separated both teams in the standings.\n\nThe Heat wound up losing to the Celtics in a gentlemen's sweep in their first-round matchup without Butler available. He clearly feels as though the outcome would have been different had he been in uniform this year.\n\nAs for the Heat and Knicks, they did have their share of back-and-forths stemming back to their playoff series from a year ago.

The Miami Heat's first-round exit prompted potential roster changes to improve the team. The team needs to evaluate Butler's contract and make decisions on trades and drafts for the upcoming season.\n\nThe Miami Heat could consider themselves unfortunate to have not been able to make a deep playoff run that would have been similar to their trip to the NBA Finals last year.\n\nTheir star player, Jimmy Butler, minced no words about his unavailability preventing him and the Heat from succeeding in the playoffs. He believes the outcome would have been different had he not been injured.\n\nButler Believes Opponents Were Lucky To Not Have Faced Him Butler missed the Heat's first-round series due to injury\n\nComing off his fifth season with the Heat, Butler has reached an incredible peak in his career with the team. The connection he shares with the organization only boosted their will to compete and win as one collective unit.\n\nDuring a recent interview with GQ Sports, Butler regrets not being able to help out his team in the playoffs over the past few weeks due to a sprained MCL in his right knee as he watched them bow out in five games to the Celtics in the first round from the bench.\n\n\"I feel like everybody got a pass this playoffs, man. We're not going out like that,\" - Jimmy Butler\n\nIt may have been possible for Miami to have done better in the playoffs with Butler instead of falling in five games to Boston without him.\n\nComing off an improbable run to the NBA Finals in 2023, where Butler averaged 26.9 points, 6.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists, and 1.8 steals while torching opponents in the playoffs, he saw his numbers decline slightly this year.\n\nHe put up 20.8 points, 5.3 rebounds, five assists, and 1.3 steals on 49.9 percent shooting from the field and a career-high 41.4 percent shooting from beyond the arc in 60 games. Despite his improvement in three-point shooting, his scoring and overall shooting went down as he is getting close to turning 35 this September.\n\nEven though he stayed relatively healthy, the Heat were not able to improve their standing in the East from the year prior. It also didn't help that he got injured against the 76ers in the Play-In Tournament.\n\nHe stayed in that game to finish with 19 points in nearly 40 minutes, but his effectiveness was nowhere near the level he was at during his playoff run in 2023. Needing a lot of time to recover, the Heat could not stand their ground without him in the postseason.\n\nWhat Now For Butler And Miami? First-round exit could see changes in the roster\n\nMiami finished the year with a 46-36 record for the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference, marking the second straight year they reached the playoffs via the Play-in Tournament.\n\nAfter making deep playoff runs in consecutive seasons in 2022 and 2023, as well as three in the last five seasons, a first-round exit could be a solid refresher for the Heat. Knowing they still have plenty of work to do with improving the roster by making potential trades for certain stars and drafting young talents who will fit well in their system.\n\nFor all that to happen, it must start with what Miami decides to do with Butler during contract negotiations, especially after all he's done since joining the franchise in 2019. Only after that can they set the foundation of what their team will be heading into the 2024-25 season.\n\nRelated Cavaliers Have a '10% Chance' To Make Celtics Series 'Competitive' The odds to reach the Eastern Conference finals are heavily stacked in their opposition's favor.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_collateral_ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medial collateral ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Heating_and_Cooling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Heating and Cooling", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mixcollage-15-apr-2024-02-24-pm-2654.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554229", "eventUri": "eng-9554229", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

ESPN's Nick Friedell captured this sentiment in a May 2023 profile, noting their mutual admiration that's only grown stronger over the years.\n\nEven in jest, Butler couldn't help but throw a light-hearted jab at his former coach, saying, \"F--k Thibs,\" then immediately adding, \"F--k your article. And I like Thibs,\" showing his playful side in what could otherwise be seen as a tense relationship.\n\nWhile the duo may never team up again, given Butler's age and the Knicks' current trajectory under Thibodeau's leadership, fans might still hold out hope for an electrifying playoff showdown between the coach and his outspoken former star.

It took five games for the former to return the favor for the latter's dashing their championship hopes in the previous campaign, eliminating the Heat on the TD Garden parquet, just as Miami did to them in 2023.\n\nOn the heels of a 4-1 series loss Jimmy Butler did not participate in due to an MCL sprain, prominent South Florida sports media member Dan Le Batard, formerly of ESPN and the Miami Herald, declared on the Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz, \"The Celtics just ended the Heat as we know them,\" deeming the defending Eastern Conference champions' championship window with Butler as their best player shut.\n\nThen came a spicy end-of-season press conference from the Heat's team president, Pat Riley, taking umbrage with the six-time All-Star trolling the Celtics during an in-game interview despite being inactive and his lack of availability. Butler appeared in 60 games this year.\n\nThe five-time All-NBA selection, who turns 35 in September, is reportedly seeking an extension worth $113 million this summer, per Anthony Chiang of the Miami Herald. He has one year left on his contract, plus a $52.4 million player option for the 2025-26 campaign.\n\nIf the relationship between Butler and the Heat has fractured to a significant enough extent for the two to part ways this offseason, David Aldridge of The Athletic suggests the Philadelphia 76ers reunite with the star forward, noting the Sixers ability to create north of $50 million in cap space and their need for an Alpha.\n\nWhile Miami may find patching up its partnership with Butler is preferential to the offers the Heat receive for him, a future first-round pick aimed at aligning with when Philadelphia's window with Embiid closes could prove more beneficial to their future.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nShooting Struggles Not Preventing Jayson Tatum from Positive Impact: 'They'll

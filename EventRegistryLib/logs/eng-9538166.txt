If the woman proceeded with the abortion, even in a state where the procedure remains legal, Davis would seek a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding the abortion and \"pursue wrongful-death claims against anyone involved in the killing of his unborn child,\" the lawyer wrote in a letter, according to records.\n\nNow, Davis has disclosed his former partner's abortion to a state district court in Texas, asking for the power to investigate what his lawyer characterizes as potentially illegal activity in a state where almost all abortions are banned.\n\nThe previously unreported petition was submitted under an unusual legal mechanism often used in Texas to investigate suspected illegal actions before a lawsuit is filed. The petition claims Davis could sue either under the state's wrongful-death statute or the novel Texas law known as Senate Bill 8 that allows private citizens to file suit against anyone who \"aids or abets\" an illegal abortion.\n\nThe decision to target an abortion that occurred outside of Texas represents a potential new strategy by antiabortion activists to achieve a goal many in the movement have been working toward since Roe v. Wade was overturned: stopping women from traveling out of state to end their pregnancies. Crossing state lines for abortion care remains legal nationwide. ... The case also illustrates the role that men who disapprove of their partners' decisions could play in surfacing future cases that may violate abortion bans -- either by filing their own civil lawsuits or by reporting the abortions to law enforcement.\n\n{snip}\n\nRead more: https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2024/05/03/texas-abortion-investigations/", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

She began dating Davis in November 2023 and found out that she was pregnant in January, according to the petition.\n\nThe case, which was reported on by The Washington Post on Friday, is being cited by abortion rights supporters who fear that anti-abortion advocates will use -- or at least threaten to use -- strict abortion laws to target abortions obtained even in states where the procedure is legal. Texas' law, passed in 2021, targets doctors and those involved in facilitating abortions, not the women who undergo the procedure themselves, but opponents say that legal uncertainty about restrictions in a post-Roe America has the intended consequence of intimidating women.\n\nDavis is seeking the deposition to obtain information about those involved in the abortion, including the identity of the doctor who performed the procedure in Colorado, and he considers filing a lawsuit against all of them, according to the court filings.\n\nDavis is being represented by Jonathan Mitchell, a well-known lawyer and abortion rights opponent who also represented former President Donald Trump in his Colorado ballot case.\n\nMitchell helped craft SB 8, also known as the Texas Heartbeat Act, which uses a novel civil enforcement mechanism to prohibit abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, a point usually around six weeks into a pregnancy. Davis cited the law in his petition for the deposition.\n\nCNN has reached out to Davis for comment.\n\nMitchell said in a statement, \"Fathers of aborted fetuses can sue for wrongful death in states with abortion bans, even if the abortion occurs out-of-state. They can sue anyone who paid for the abortion, anyone who aided or abetted the travel, and anyone involved in the manufacture or distribution of abortion drugs.\"\n\nThe case is seen by some abortion rights advocates as an example of the new legal landscape facing women who wish to obtain an abortion, even by legal means.\n\n\"We don't think there is a basis (for a lawsuit),\" Marc Hearron, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the woman, told CNN. \"It is perfectly legal to leave Texas or any state and go get an abortion in a state where it is legal. And it is perfectly legal to help someone or be involved in someone going out of state and obtaining an abortion where it is allowed by law.\"\n\nNancy Northup, president & CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the Supreme Court's 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization to overturn Roe v. Wade \"opened the door to this kind of frightening and unacceptable\u202ffearmongering and harassment by one citizen against another.\"\n\nMitchell has spearheaded other legal efforts in the wake of Texas' abortion law. Last June, he represented a man who filed a wrongful death lawsuit against three friends of his ex-wife who allegedly assisted her in terminating her pregnancy with abortion medication, in an early legal test of the reach of wrongful death statutes in the wake of Roe's reversal. That case has not yet been resolved.\n\nIt's unclear whether Davis' petition could lead to a lawsuit against the woman, said Drexel University Law Professor David Cohen.\n\n\"I definitely don't think there is a basis for this,\" he said. \"But we have no confidence to know exactly what the Texas courts will say anymore, at any level.\"\n\nOther Republican-led states have sought to pressure women against seeking abortions in other states, particularly minors. Idaho's legislature last year passed a bill -- later blocked by a judge over constitutionality concerns -- that would prohibit adults from helping minors cross state lines to get an abortion without parental permission. Meanwhile, Tennessee's legislature is advancing a law that would similarly criminalize so-called \"abortion trafficking\" for minors in the state.\n\n\"This is all part of a scare campaign to make people afraid that if they go out of state and get an abortion, that they or their loved ones might be sued,\" Hearron said. \"We really want to emphasize that people should not be intimidated.\"\n\nTemple University Beasley School of Law Dean Rachel Rebouch\u00e9 called Davis' legal maneuver \"bizarre and concerning\" but said it was not \"surprising.\"\n\n\"I think that we'll see much more of this in the years to come, so long as Dobbs is in the books. And, frankly, this is exactly the type of example we should point to when we talk about when the Supreme Court should overturn Dobbs,\" Rebouch\u00e9 told CNN.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

She began dating Davis in November 2023 and found out that she was pregnant in January, according to the petition.\n\nThe case, which was reported on by The Washington Post on Friday, is being cited by abortion rights supporters who fear that anti-abortion advocates will use -- or at least threaten to use -- strict abortion laws to target abortions obtained even in states where the procedure is legal. Texas' law, passed in 2021, targets doctors and those involved in facilitating abortions, not the women who undergo the procedure themselves, but opponents say that legal uncertainty about restrictions in a post-Roe America has the intended consequence of intimidating women.\n\nDavis is seeking the deposition to obtain information about those involved in the abortion, including the identity of the doctor who performed the procedure in Colorado, and he considers filing a lawsuit against all of them, according to the court filings.\n\nDavis is being represented by Jonathan Mitchell, a well-known lawyer and abortion rights opponent who also represented former President Donald Trump in his Colorado ballot case.\n\nMitchell helped craft SB 8, also known as the Texas Heartbeat Act, which uses a novel civil enforcement mechanism to prohibit abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, a point usually around six weeks into a pregnancy. Davis cited the law in his petition for the deposition.\n\nCNN has reached out to Davis for comment.\n\nMitchell said in a statement, \"Fathers of aborted fetuses can sue for wrongful death in states with abortion bans, even if the abortion occurs out-of-state. They can sue anyone who paid for the abortion, anyone who aided or abetted the travel, and anyone involved in the manufacture or distribution of abortion drugs.\"\n\nCritics decry legal maneuvers\n\nThe case is seen by some abortion rights advocates as an example of the new legal landscape facing women who wish to obtain an abortion, even by legal means.\n\n\"We don't think there is a basis (for a lawsuit),\" Marc Hearron, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the woman, told CNN. \"It is perfectly legal to leave Texas or any state and go get an abortion in a state where it is legal. And it is perfectly legal to help someone or be involved in someone going out of state and obtaining an abortion where it is allowed by law.\"\n\nNancy Northup, president & CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the Supreme Court's 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization to overturn Roe v. Wade \"opened the door to this kind of frightening and unacceptable\u202ffearmongering and harassment by one citizen against another.\"\n\nMitchell has spearheaded other legal efforts in the wake of Texas' abortion law. Last June, he represented a man who filed a wrongful death lawsuit against three friends of his ex-wife who allegedly assisted her in terminating her pregnancy with abortion medication, in an early legal test of the reach of wrongful death statutes in the wake of Roe's reversal. That case has not yet been resolved.\n\nIt's unclear whether Davis' petition could lead to a lawsuit against the woman, said Drexel University Law Professor David Cohen.\n\n\"I definitely don't think there is a basis for this,\" he said. \"But we have no confidence to know exactly what the Texas courts will say anymore, at any level.\"\n\nOther Republican-led states have sought to pressure women against seeking abortions in other states, particularly minors. Idaho's legislature last year passed a bill -- later blocked by a judge over constitutionality concerns -- that would prohibit adults from helping minors cross state lines to get an abortion without parental permission. Meanwhile, Tennessee's legislature is advancing a law that would similarly criminalize so-called \"abortion trafficking\" for minors in the state.\n\n\"This is all part of a scare campaign to make people afraid that if they go out of state and get an abortion, that they or their loved ones might be sued,\" Hearron said. \"We really want to emphasize that people should not be intimidated.\"\n\nTemple University Beasley School of Law Dean Rachel Rebouch\u00e9 called Davis' legal maneuver \"bizarre and concerning\" but said it was not \"surprising.\"\n\n\"I think that we'll see much more of this in the years to come, so long as Dobbs is in the books. And, frankly, this is exactly the type of example we should point to when we talk about when the Supreme Court should overturn Dobbs,\" Rebouch\u00e9 told CNN.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tierney_sneed@cnn.com", "name": "Tierney Sneed", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_death_claim", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrongful death claim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor of Science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbeat_bill", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heartbeat bill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gestation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazos_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazos County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brazos County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Heartbeat_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas Heartbeat Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Reproductive_Rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center for Reproductive Rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Wade ruling. (Scripps News)\n\nArizona is at the epicenter of an abortion dilemma that has seen states roll out a patchwork of laws in the two years since Roe was overturned.\n\nOn May 2, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill to repeal an 1864 Civil War-era abortion ban that was resurrected by the state Supreme Court in April.\n\n\"In those 160 years, the Arizona legislature never took the step of repealing this statute,\" Jennifer Piatt, an Arizona State University research scholar and the co-director of the Center for Public Health Law and Policy at the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law said.\n\nIn June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade after hearing the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case. The decision gave states the power to ban abortions or implement more restrictions.\n\n\"This is an issue that really emerged across a number of different states in the chaos in the aftermath of the Dobbs decision,\" Piatt said.\n\nRoe ensured access to abortion across the country for nearly 50 years. The Supreme Court's reversal of that decision ignited protests and sent states scrambling to issue abortion guidance, as some states navigated abortion laws that were in the books for more than a century.\n\nIn Arizona, the state is currently abiding by a 15-week abortion ban signed by former Gov. Doug Ducey in 2022, but the pre-statehood 1864 abortion law could take effect as early as June 27. The repeal approved by lawmakers would take effect 90 days after the legislative session concludes, in June or July.\n\nIn a statement, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said her office was exploring every option available to prevent the 1864 law from taking effect.\n\nAdvocates who oppose protecting abortion told Scripps News they were disappointed the 1864 ban would be repealed.\n\nAbortion\n\nProposal to legalize abortion on Missouri ballot submitted with more than twice the signatures needed AP via Scripps News 7:55 PM, May 03, 2024\n\nIn 2022, after Roe was overturned, West Virginia officials claimed the state's 1849 abortion ban would take effect but challenges impacted its ability to become the law. The state currently bans abortions and has limited exceptions.\n\nIn Wisconsin, a 174-year-old abortion law banned abortion at any point in pregnancy with no exceptions for rape, incest or the health of the pregnant individual. That law only made an exception for cases in which a medical provider determined it was necessary to preserve the life of the mother. This year, the state approved a bill to ban abortions after 14 weeks.\n\nThe patchwork of laws makes it difficult for people to navigate what is and isn't legal in their state.\n\n\"It just makes it difficult to make basic choices about, you know, your health and well-being,\" Heather Gerrish, an Arizona resident, said.\n\nGerrish has a 13-month-old baby. While she says her child was very much wanted, she admits that being pregnant was still scary.\n\n\"In this day and age your health and safety isn't guaranteed when you're pregnant,\" Gerrish said.\n\nAt least 14 states have banned abortion. On May 1, Florida began enforcing a 6-week abortion ban like the Georgia and North Carolina abortion bans. Some democratic states have laws or executive orders to protect access to abortion.\n\nAbortion\n\nFlorida joins other Southeastern states with strict abortion limits Stephanie Liebergen 1:56 PM, May 01, 2024\n\nThe varying laws across the country, at times, lack clarity, advocates say. Piatt adds that the laws force medical providers to think twice before agreeing to perform an abortion because the decision could potentially cost them their medical license or land them in prison.\n\n\"I am of the opinion that some of the murkiness in these abortion laws is a feature, and not a bug, for anti-abortion politicians,\" Piatt said.\n\nPerpetual challenges abortion laws face can also increase confusion.\n\n\"New constitutional amendments can be drafted and I think it's a kind of unclear, very much shifting and changing legal landscape,\" Piatt said.\n\nArizona is one of seven swing states in the 2024 presidential election. President Joe Biden narrowly won Arizona in 2020 by 10,457 votes, the closest win in the state's history.\n\nPresident Biden has criticized former President Donald Trump for taking credit for overturning Roe v. Wade. The president is campaigning on reviving the landmark Roe ruling and has made abortion protection central to his reelection campaign.\n\nAccording to Trump, it should be up to states to decide abortion laws. In an interview with Time Magazine Trump said he would let red states monitor women's pregnancies and prosecute those who violate abortion bans.\n\nWhile the abortion issue heats up in Arizona, efforts are underway for a ballot initiative to enshrine the right to an abortion in the state constitution.

Which side has momentum? - National | Globalnews.ca", "body": "As abortion and women's health care shapes up to be a key issue in this year's U.S. elections, the momentum appears to be persistently on the side of those fighting to restore access -- while the opposing side struggles to settle on a consistent message to voters.\n\nBallot measures on whether to guarantee abortion access are likely to be decided in several states in November including Arizona -- where lawmakers voted this week to repeal a Civil War-era ban on nearly all abortions that was allowed to come into force -- and Florida, where a ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy took effect Wednesday.\n\nAt the same time, Donald Trump has found himself under fire from all sides of the debate for his current position that the issue should be left to the states, which marks the latest reversal for the Republican presidential candidate.\n\nIn the nearly two years since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the constitutional right to an abortion, stories have mounted of the serious health issues people have faced due to some states' bans and limits on the procedure. Polls and fundraising reports suggest those real-life impacts have underscored the stakes for many voters, who have continually voted for measures to protect and guarantee abortion access.\n\nOrganizers say they expect that trend to continue into November and beyond.\n\n\"Since Roe v Wade was overturned, every time a voter has had an opportunity to protect abortion access at the ballot, they do it,\" said Sara Tabatabaie, executive director of VoteProChoice, a political action group that works to elect pro-abortion candidates across the U.S.\n\n\"Our work no longer has the hurdle of needing to convince folks ... that this is a winning issue. It's clear now that abortion is popular.\"\n\nThe Public Religion Research Institute found 64 per cent of Americans say abortion should be legal in most or all cases in a new poll released Thursday. Majorities of nearly all religious groups and all but five states surveyed support abortion access, the poll suggests. That majority support has stayed consistent for the past decade, the PRRI has found.\n\nEven limited access to abortion retains broad support. Gallup found last year that nearly 69 per cent of people surveyed want abortion to stay legal for women in the first trimester of pregnancy, which lasts 12 weeks and is when the vast majority of abortions are performed.\n\nIn states where abortion access has been limited or outright banned, the share of people surveyed by CNN in a poll released Wednesday who say their state's laws are too restrictive has risen since last year, to roughly half.\n\nAt the same time, studies suggest the number of abortions performed in the U.S. has remained roughly the same since those laws were enacted, while the pro-choice Guttmacher Institute says abortions have actually increased between 2020 and 2023, citing expanded protections in other states and a rise in travel to those areas.\n\n\"If the point of Dobbs (v. Jackson Women's Health Organization) was to reduce the number of abortions in the U.S., it has failed spectacularly,\" said Jessica Waters, a professor at American University who studies reproductive rights law and policy.\n\nCurrently, 21 states have passed restrictions on abortion, including 14 states that are enforcing bans at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions.\n\nExamples of the impact of those laws have exploded. Some of the most harrowing have emerged from Texas, where performing an abortion is punishable by up to life in prison and civilians are allowed to sue anyone who assists someone in getting one.\n\nA Texas mother facing a life-threatening pregnancy had to travel out of state for an abortion after spending days seeking court permission under the law's medical exemption clause -- a request that was ultimately rejected hours after she left. A man in Texas has launched legal action to investigate his ex-partner's out-of-state abortion, and another man is suing three women who allegedly helped his ex-wife obtain abortion pills.\n\nAnother Texas woman, Amanda Zurawski, stars in a powerful ad for U.S. President Joe Biden's re-election campaign where she shares her story of being denied an abortion she needed after a miscarriage. As she and her husband, Josh, tearfully look at a baby blanket and books they bought while she was pregnant, the ad says Zurawski almost died twice after contracting sepsis and now may never be able to get pregnant again. She's suing the state.\n\n\"Donald Trump did this,\" the ad concludes.\n\nThe line refers to Trump's nomination of three Supreme Court justices who were part of the conservative majority that overturned Roe v. Wade, an accomplishment Trump has bragged about ever since.\n\nYet Trump has also angered anti-abortion groups who support him for declaring he would not support efforts to ban or limit abortion nationally, instead saying he prefers the patchwork approach of letting states decide.\n\nIn an interview with Time Magazine published Tuesday, Trump previewed what would effectively be a hands-off approach to the issue if he returns to the White House. He said he wouldn't intervene if states move to monitor women's pregnancies or prosecute them for defying abortion bans, even if their health is at risk.\n\n\"It's irrelevant whether I'm comfortable or not,\" he told the magazine, \"because the states are going to make those decisions.\"\n\nTrump did, however, tell reporters last month the Arizona Supreme Court went too far by ruling that a law passed in 1864 banning all abortions except when the mother's life is at risk can be enforced, superseding an existing 15-week limit. The 1864 law was quickly repealed, but a 90-day grace period for new legislation means the stricter ban will stay in place until the summer.\n\nTrump's \"states will decide\" stance is just the latest policy reversal he's made on abortion. He said he was \"very pro-choice\" in 1999, only to shift to saying he was \"pro-life\" a decade later.\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign for president, he suggested there should be \"some form of punishment\" for women who seek an abortion, and during his presidency supported an effort in Congress to pass a national 20-week limit. According to the New York Times, Trump had voiced support for a 15-week limit at the national level, which he now denies.\n\n\"I keep being asked, 'But what do you think of President Trump's new moderate stance on abortion?'\" Waters said. \"And I think the real answer is we need to judge him on his record.\"\n\nWithout a national constitutional right to an abortion, voters are now moving to enact their own at the state level, or reject efforts to remove those rights.\n\nIn 2022, ballot measures that would deny abortion rights in the state constitution or state that life begins at conception were defeated in Kansas, Kentucky and Montana. Last year, Ohio voters approved a measure guaranteeing abortion as a constitutional right.\n\nThis year, a measure that will provide a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability will appear on the ballot in Florida. A similar measure is expected to be approved in Arizona, and signature-gathering campaigns are underway for pro-abortion measures in other states including Missouri, Nevada and South Dakota.\n\nEarly polling suggests a majority of voters support the measures in Arizona and Florida, although the Florida measure could struggle to reach the 60 per cent threshold needed to get passed.\n\nThe campaigns in support of the measures are also outpacing opponents in fundraising. While the group sponsoring the Florida initiative has raised millions, Florida Voters Against Extremism has brought in just US$75,640.\n\nArizona for Abortion Access has raised US$12.3 million, according to campaign finance records, including over US$700,000 in individual contributions. The opposing campaign, dubbed It Goes Too Far, has amassed US$518,000 in individual contributions to date, plus just US$5,000 from other sources.\n\nThe name and stated mission of It Goes Too Far speaks to the difficulty anti-abortion groups and politicians are having in the face of majority support for reproductive freedom.\n\nIn an interview with Global News, the group's spokesperson Cindy Dahlgren described it as a coalition of advocates who have \"varying views on abortion and where that limit should be,\" including some pro-choice Democrats.\n\nAll of them, she said, agree the ballot measure is too vague when it comes to the issue of post-viability abortions -- a rare procedure that's typically performed to save the mother's life -- and what counts as a \"health care professional\" who could determine such an abortion is necessary.\n\nThe group also says the measure would remove requirements for parents of minors seeking an abortion to be notified, and for women and girls to be notified of the potential risks -- a requirement often sought by anti-abortion advocates through places like crisis pregnancy centres.\n\n\"Voters are not being told the truth,\" Dahlgren said.\n\nYet Dahlgren would not say what limits or regulations on abortion she or the group would support, saying their sole mission is to ensure the constitutional amendment is defeated.\n\nDahlgren also serves as a spokesperson for the Center for Arizona Policy, a \"traditional family\" and religious freedom advocacy group that repeatedly urged lawmakers to block attempts to veto the 1864 abortion ban.\n\nWaters says Republicans who are against abortion are also having a difficult time now expressing their views, with some even walking back their support for strict bans.\n\n\"It is not a winning issue for them,\" she said.\n\nTabatabaie, from VoteProChoice, says that's helped political organizers like herself galvanize around the issue. Although she acknowledges the fight to expand abortion access won't end after November, she said she's seeing support continue to grow.\n\n\"Anyone who is working on this issue is hoping to work themselves out of a job,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_right", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional right"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Religion_Research_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public Religion Research Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

She began dating Davis in November 2023 and found out that she was pregnant in January, according to the petition.\n\nRead more: https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/05/us/texas-abortion-collin-davis-colorado/index.html", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_death_claim", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrongful death claim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Collin County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Collin County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazos_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazos County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brazos County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deposition (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbeat_bill", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heartbeat bill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor of Science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gestation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Licensing_and_Regulations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Licensing and Regulations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Tukong_Moosul", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Tukong Moosul", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538166", "eventUri": "eng-9538166", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-20", "textStart": 363, "textEnd": 374}], "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Given what we know about this Collin Davis character, this is the smartest possible decision she could have made, as having his child would have meant being chained to him for life in some capacity -- and he sure seems like a goddamned nightmare.\n\nIn February, when Davis found out that she was considering this, he immediately retained Jonathan Mitchell, who is the architect of the Texas law and also the absolute spitting image of Robert, the haunted Edwardian-era doll who destroys the lives of Florida tourists who disrespect him.\n\nMitchell then sent her a \"legal threat\" meant to keep her from having the abortion. It did not work (thank goodness).\n\nNow that his ex has had the abortion, Collin and Mitchell are still hoping to ruin her life by filing a petition to investigate her and anyone he believes aided and abetted her in getting the abortion.\n\nVia Washington Post:\n\nIn the Davis case, Mitchell is attempting to depose the woman who had the abortion, along with several other people he writes may be \"complicit\" in the abortion. If deposed, they would be asked about others involved in the abortion, including any abortion funds or any other entities that provided financial support, according to court records. They would also have to provide all documentation relevant to the abortion.\n\n\"Mr. Davis expects to be able to better evaluate the prospects for legal success after deposing [the people listed], and discovering the identity of their co-conspirators and accomplices,\" Mitchell wrote in the complaint, which he filed on March 22.\n\nHe is able to do this because of Texas's Rule 202, which allows for an investigation prior to filing a lawsuit.\n\nDavis, who we don't know isn't related somehow to Texas oil tycoon Cullen Davis who allegedly killed his stepdaughter and attempted to have his soon-to-be-ex-wife and the judge in their divorce proceedings killed, is clearly just trying to continue to exercise control over his ex and everyone she knows -- because that is what men like him do. That is, in fact, exactly why it was a good idea for her to have an abortion.\n\nHe's not the first man to try and pull this either. In March of last year, a man named Marcus Silva was also represented by Jonathan Mitchell. Silva was very open -- at least to his ex -- about the fact that he was using the threat of the lawsuit to force her to continue having sex with him and cleaning his house.\n\nMARCUS SILVA: You're not considering what can happen to you if I continue to do this sh*t for the next 40 years.\n\nBRITTNI SILVA: Marcus, I'm not gonna be f*cking blackmailed into having sex with you.\n\nMARCUS SILVA: Then you're just gonna have your f*cking life destroyed in every f*cking way that you can imagine to where you want to blow your f*cking brains out.\n\nWhat a peach!\n\nSo far, we haven't heard from Collin Davis's ex, but I think we can all be pretty sure that when we do, she'll likely have a very similar story to tell. Any man who would sue his ex's friends and family over helping her get an abortion is at least psychologically abusive.\n\nDonate Just Once!\n\nI've always found the \"Let's do Lysistrata!\" thing extremely cringe, as we no longer really live in a society in which women are regularly sexually involved with men who hold diametrically opposite views to them and also have any particular power to change anything. Like, it is unclear what a woman going on a sex strike from their equally antiwar or pro-abortion rights partner, who has no more political power than she does, would actually accomplish. It also presumes that all women share the same opinions on things and that sex is a favor they do for men.

Great! But has he considered starting at home with his wife's boss?\n\nMen should care about abortion rights. Duh. So, I'm all for Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff -- Vice President Kamala Harris' husband -- hosting an Atlanta-based event with Men4Choice on Tuesday to call on more men to stand up for abortion rights. But what I will say is that Emhoff is starting with the wrong men. Has he considered calling on President Joe Biden, the most powerful man in the world, to try standing up for abortion rights, first?\n\nPer NBC, Emhoff's event is timed to the fifth anniversary of Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) signing the state's six-week ban into law and is in partnership with health care providers and local activists. The audience is \"expected to be made up primarily of men and will include some students from Morehouse College.\" It will be the first of several events hosted by Emhoff and Men4Choice, with more to come in states including Florida, Arizona, and North Carolina -- all of which are competitive (or somewhat competitive) purple states that have recently enacted abortion bans. In January, Emhoff observed the anniversary of Roe v. Wade -- which was overturned in June 2022 -- by telling Esquire, \"I look at this issue as a father, as a son, as a husband, and I'm still enraged about this.\"\n\n\"If you're a man, and you're looking at having a family or you have a family, these issues completely impact how you're going to live your life. I'm at an age right now where I've got a group of guy friends who all have daughters and some of those daughters are still of college age, and you're thinking about what if your daughter wants to go to college in one of these states like Texas with a ban?\" Emhoff said. All true! But I can certainly name one man Emhoff probably has in his contacts who might have a little more power over all of this than a male college student.\n\nAs the Biden-Harris campaign increasingly centers abortion rights and its overly vague pledge to \"Restore Roe,\" neither the president nor vice president seems particularly capable of specifying plans to protect and expand abortion in a nation where over a dozen states have totally lost access to care -- nor do they seem particularly interested in even saying the word abortion.\n\nIn fact, almost every time Biden speaks on abortion, he seems incapable of doing so without simultaneously insulting abortion patients, or just falling back on pithy but hollow liberal slogans. In February, Biden declared to a room full of rich donors, \"I'm a practicing Catholic. I don't want abortion on demand, but I thought Roe v. Wade was right.\" It closely reflected a similar statement from Biden last summer: \"I'm a practicing Catholic. I'm not big on abortion. But guess what? Roe v. Wade got it right.\" Perhaps the most insane thing about these two nearly identical statements is that they're just... wrong? A majority of Catholic Americans support abortion rights, so the insinuation that Biden can justify his disdain for a standard medical procedure by citing his Catholic faith is bullshit. Then, there's the fact that Roe did not, in fact, \"get it right\" -- that Supreme Court decision still left far too many people vulnerable to massive barriers and even the threat of criminalization.\n\nI'm all for more American men mobilizing for abortion rights -- they should be donating to or volunteering with abortion funds, supporting organizations that protect pregnant people targeted with criminalization, talking to other men about abortion rights, voting for local and state-level candidates who will protect and expand abortion access in their communities. But what is Biden going to do to help people living in states that have banned abortion? What is his plan to stop escalating attacks on abortion pills? Stop prosecutors from trying to jail people for pregnancy loss? What is his plan for any of these issues beyond \"I am not Donald Trump\"?\n\nA fundamental principle of organizing is that change starts at home, in our own communities, between us and the people we're closest with. So, it's great that Emhoff is trying to get more men to care about abortion but has he considered starting at home -- the White House -- with his wife's boss?\n\nWe clearly don't need to tell Biden's campaign that abortion is important -- they know and that's why they're running on it. But it's one thing to run on Roe, on niceties and slogans, and another to actually get proactive and wield everything in the executive branch's arsenal to get people the abortion care they need.", "source": {"uri": "jezebel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jezebel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kylie_cheung@jezebel.com", "name": "Kylie Cheung", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

(AP) -- For decades, only three people knew Gloria Johnson had had an abortion.\n\nBut a year of watching women and doctors agonize under Tennessee's strict abortion ban kicked up a fire in the longtime Democrat. She watched in dismay as her Republican colleagues in the General Assembly dismissed concerns that the law was harming women. Many GOP lawmakers argued that only on rare occasions was an abortion needed to save a life.\n\nSo without telling her legislative staff or family in advance, the then-60-year-old state representative stood before a Republican-controlled House panel in March 2023 and testified about the abortion she had at age 21. She made the decision to have an abortion, she said, as a newly married college student after being diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm. That would likely have killed her if she did nothing, but might have harmed the baby if Johnson got the treatment she needed to save her own life.\n\n\"The reality is that we're in a situation where people act like stories like mine are one in a million when actually they happen every day,\" Johnson said in a recent interview, nearly a year after her dramatic testimony.\n\nJohnson, now running as a Democrat for the U.S. Senate against Republican incumbent Marsha Blackburn, has joined the growing ranks of progressive candidates choosing to tell their own abortion stories. They are doing so more frequently in states that have banned abortion in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nDemocrats think that even in many strongly Republican states voters support their view that such personal choices should be left to women to make for themselves and that showing voters how hard their own decisions were will help make that case.\n\nRecent elections suggest the fight for abortion rights may have real currency. Statewide ballot measures supporting reproductive rights have won big since the high court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, including in GOP strongholds such as Kansas and Kentucky.\n\nReproductive rights supporters celebrated last month after Marilyn Lands won a special election in Alabama, claiming a legislative seat long held by Republicans. Alabama currently bans abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with almost no exception.\n\nLands made abortion rights central to her campaign, releasing a video in which she disclosed having an abortion after testing determined that her baby had a genetic disorder and could not survive.\n\nLands made a comparison to Alyssa Gonzales, a woman denied the same care just months after Dobbs despite having almost the same diagnosis as Lands. Gonzales traveled 10 hours out of state to Washington, D.C., to get the help she needed.\n\n\"Our media consultant did say, 'Marilyn, you don't have to do this, the issue is compelling enough on its own,'\" Lands said. \"I think they wanted to be sure that I really was comfortable with it, and I was. ... It was absolutely the right thing to do.\"\n\nFor the most part, though, election victories have been slower to come for prochoice candidates than when they are framed in a ballot measure. Measures legalizing recreational marijuana and Medicaid expansion also have won in conservative states but have not translated into many wins for candidates supporting them.\n\nThat leaves political experts watching races such as Johnson's Tennessee Senate bid to see if telling more personal stories will make a difference.\n\n\"If these candidates continue to be successful, it'll just once again show us that people are unhappy with state abortion policies but also that abortion is a big enough deal to them that they may vote for someone they may not otherwise,\" said Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis.\n\nHeather Williams, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to state legislatures, said Lands' victory was a \"political earthquake in Alabama.\"\n\n\"In red states, when candidates share these stories, it helps voters see there's someone championing the things they care about, who shares their experiences,\" she said.\n\nWhile the majority of candidates and lawmakers who have shared abortion stories have been Democrats, Republican Sam Brown has chosen to revisit his wife's abortion as he vies for a U.S. Senate seat in Nevada. Earlier this year, Brown's wife talked candidly about the abortion she had before the two met. Brown said he would oppose a federal abortion ban while supporting Nevada's current law protecting the right to an abortion up to 24 weeks -- roughly the standard nationally under Roe v. Wade.\n\nEven before the right to abortion was struck down, there were hints that politicians' personal stories could make a difference.\n\nIn Georgia, Democrat Shea Roberts first ran for the state House in 2018 but lost to Republican Deborah Silcox. In 2020, Roberts shared her abortion story while running once again and won.\n\nRoberts started talking about her decision to terminate her nonviable pregnancy -- first before small groups of voters and then at news conferences. She said she owed her win to that decision.\n\n\"I regretted not being braver the first time around,\" she said.\n\nAt the federal level, Democratic Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri, Pramila Jayapal of Washington state and Barbara Lee of California have shared their abortion stories openly since speaking about them at a House committee hearing in 2021 on abortion rights.\n\nAnd as the future of Roe v. Wade hung in the balance after the Supreme Court's draft ruling leaked, Democratic Reps.\n\nMarie Newman of Illinois and Gwen Moore of Wisconsin also spoke openly about their abortions.\n\nIn Arizona, state Sen. Eva Burch told fellow lawmakers from the Senate floor last month that she was going to get an abortion because her pregnancy was no longer viable. In a nearly 10-minute speech, the 43-year-old first-term lawmaker, who previously worked as a nurse practitioner at a women's health clinic, described a \"rough journey\" with fertility and an earlier miscarriage.\n\nBurch criticized Arizona's restrictions as out of touch, saying state law requires an ultrasound that her doctor did not order. She also said she was given bad information about alternative treatments.\n\n\"I think a lot of people wish they could tell their story, but either they don't have the platform or they don't want to and they shouldn't have to,\" Burch said later. \"If that's something that I can do for people, I'm going to do it in whatever capacity I possibly can.\"\n\nIn Wisconsin, Dr. Kristin Lyerly, an obstetrician and gynecologist who performs abortions, entered the race last week for an open congressional seat in a Republican district. Minnesota state Sen. Kelly Morrison, a practicing OB-GYN, is running for Congress and promoting her support for abortion rights.\n\nBack in Tennessee, which severely limits exemptions to its abortion ban, Gloria Johnson isn't the only candidate sharing her story.\n\nAt 19 weeks pregnant, Allie Phillips learned she had a nonviable pregnancy, but she did not meet the requirements to receive an abortion in the state despite the many complications she was having. Her account of traveling outside Tennessee with her husband to get the services she needed has circulated widely on social media.\n\nPhillips has since joined a group of women challenging the legality of Tennessee's abortion law. She announced her candidacy for the state House against a Republican who she says played down her story when she met with him last year.\n\nJohnson says reproductive rights are a priority for Democrats and Republicans. She knows Tennessee voters have not elected a Democrat to statewide office in nearly 20 years but thinks being open will help her connect with anyone who cares about how women are treated.\n\n\"I'm absolutely setting myself apart. I'm letting you know that I'm a woman who cares about women's reproductive choice,\" she said. \"To me it's about equality and rights.\"", "source": {"uri": "sfltimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South Florida Times: Miami , Broward, Palm Beach, Breaking News & Weather at SFLTimes.com - Home"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@sfltimes.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

In Arizona, meanwhile, lawmakers voted to repeal a total ban on abortion dating back to 1864, decades before Arizona became a state. Also this week, the Kansas Legislature increased funding for anti-abortion centers, while advocates in South Dakota submitted the required number of signatures for a ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.\n\nThe status of abortion in states across the country has changed constantly, with lawmakers passing measures and courts ruling on challenges to them. Currently, 14 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions. Most Democratic-led states, meanwhile, have taken steps to preserve or expand access.\n\n\"Some of it's exactly what we knew would happen,\" said David Cohen, a professor at the Thomas R. Kline School of Law at Drexel University who studies abortion policy, \"and others have been big surprises that have put, frankly, the anti-abortion movement on their heels.\"\n\nAlthough more than 20 states have begun enforcing abortion bans of varying degrees since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, studies have found that the number of monthly abortions nationally is about the same -- or higher -- than it was before the ruling. Asked to weigh in on the emotional debate, voters have supported the position favored by abortion rights advocates on all seven statewide ballot measures since then.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case was released officially on June 24, 2022, upending nearly 50 years of abortion being legal nationwide. But the world caught a glimpse of it about six weeks earlier, on May 2, after a news outlet published a leaked draft.\n\n\"With the Dobbs decision, the will of the people is now able to be adhered to,\" said Stephen Billy, vice president of state affairs for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. He said abortion rights supporters have amplified uncertainty in laws -- especially over whether abortion is allowed in medical emergencies: \"They've tried to sow political division just to advance their policy agenda,\" he said.\n\nAt the time Politico published the leaked draft, Amanda Zurawski was undergoing fertility treatment and was about two weeks away from learning she was finally pregnant.\n\nThe Austin, Texas, woman had always supported abortion rights, and was mad that the right to abortion was on the verge of disappearing. But she didn't expect a direct impact in her life.\n\nThat changed months later when she was denied an abortion despite a premature rupture of membranes, which can lead to dangerous internal bleeding. Days later, she was diagnosed with sepsis, a life-threatening reaction to infection. Her daughter, Willow, was ultimately aborted, but Zurawski nearly died in the process because of the delay.\n\nShe emerged from the experience an activist.\n\n\"I thought I would be a new mom with a newborn,\" she said in an interview. \"Instead, I was in Tallahassee, Florida, meeting the vice president.\"\n\nZurawski has been a plaintiff in a court challenge seeking to clarify Texas abortion law and has spoken about her experience before Congress and across the country. She recently left her tech job to spend the next several months supporting abortion rights and President Joe Biden's reelection campaign.\n\n\"I'm definitely somebody who wants to fight for justice,\" she said. \"This is not the path that I would have guessed.\"\n\nZurawski's widely publicized experience is a reflection of the central role abortion has assumed on the political stage during this highly charged election year.\n\nIn Arizona, one of a handful of battleground states that will decide the next president, the state Supreme Court issued a ruling last month saying that a near-total abortion ban passed in 1864 could be enforced now that Roe v. Wade had been overturned. That decision ultimately led to the repeal proposal that passed the state House last week and the Senate on Wednesday after vitriolic debate. Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, is expected to sign the repeal.\n\nFlorida, Maryland and New York will have measures on the ballot in November to protect abortion access.\n\n\"Women are going to be put into an impossible situation of not having access to health care, whether it is in an emergency situation or just family planning,\" said Nikki Fried, chair of the Florida Democratic Party. \"Floridians are going to have the opportunity to take control back.\"\n\nSusan B. Anthony's Billy said his group was focused on defeating the ballot questions in Florida and other states where passing them would roll back bans in place now.\n\nArizona is one of at least eight states with a push for a similar measure. A few states also have pushes for measures to enshrine bans in the state constitution.\n\nThe issue is also weighing heavily in the presidential election.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been blasting his likely opponent, former President Donald Trump, for appointing the Supreme Court justices who swayed the Roe v. Wade decision. Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Florida on Wednesday to decry the six-week ban passed in the nation's third most-populous state.\n\nTrump, who said in April that he believes abortion laws should be decided by states, went further this week, telling Time magazine that states should also be able to prosecute women who seek abortions. Proposals to do that have not picked up steam in any state legislatures so far.", "source": {"uri": "accesswdun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Access WDUN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Lake won applause for a casual threat of violence against trans women, saying that, if she had ever seen \"a man\" walk into a locker room while her daughter was changing, he wouldn't have \"walked out.\" Later she spoke about the gun she bought her daughter for her 21st birthday: \"I said, if anybody attacks you, unload that thing, baby. Unload it.\" The crowd laughed appreciatively.\n\nOnly one question, from Danise Rees, president of the campus chapter of Students for Life, was at all challenging. As Rees noted, Lake had taken conflicting positions on Arizona's 1864 abortion ban. Two years ago, Lake called it a \"great law.\" But last month, after a court ruling upholding the statute generated widespread outrage, she came out against it, and even lobbied Republicans to repeal it. Then she waffled again, bemoaning the state attorney general's decision not to enforce the law.\n\nRees wanted clarity about where Lake stood. \"We've seen both your opposition and your support for this law in the past,\" she said. \"Can you please define your values and tell us how you will remedy the doubts that pro-lifers have in you right now?\"\n\nLake didn't have a concise answer. She echoed Donald Trump on the need for exceptions in cases of rape and incest, which the Arizona ban doesn't have. She suggested that if Republicans let the law stand, it would fuel liberal efforts to pass a ballot initiative enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution. She spoke about her own love of motherhood and the merits of family policy in Hungary, a nod to the MAGA movement's infatuation with Hungarian strongman Viktor Orban.\n\nBut the core of her argument was electability. \"There's so much on the line this election,\" she said. \"We're either going to save our country, or the Democrats -- I call them Communists -- are going to drive us right to the ground.\" Given the existential stakes, Lake insisted, Republicans can't let themselves get \"caught up\" with wedge issues like this one.\n\nIt was a curious argument coming from Lake, who later offered a soliloquy against compromising the conservative movement's principles. But it was a sign of how difficult it has been for the Republican Party to balance its base's demand for abortion bans with the public revulsion when those policies are enacted.\n\nEight years ago, many Christian conservatives put aside their qualms about Trump in the hope that he would lay the groundwork for outlawing abortion. It was a bargain that paid off, at least in the medium term. But today, in purplish parts of the country like Arizona, that political equation is being turned on its head, as some on the right argue that they must put aside qualms about abortion so Republicans can win elections.\n\nJust this week, Arizona repealed its sweeping 1864 ban, a law that Trump said went too far and would be \"straightened out.\" It was the first state with a Republican legislature to back off its most draconian abortion restrictions since the fall of Roe. In Nevada, Sam Brown, a longtime abortion opponent running for Senate, has come out against a national abortion ban, and in February he gave a TV interview with his wife in which she spoke about the abortion she had before they met. Eric Hovde, a Republican Senate candidate in Wisconsin, once declared himself \"totally opposed to abortion,\" but now says women should have a \"right to make a choice\" early in pregnancy.\n\nThe Republican Party, of course, is still very much the party of abortion bans. This week, Florida, the third-most populous state, began prohibiting the procedure at six weeks. In an interview with Time magazine, Trump said he wouldn't try to stop states from prosecuting women who have had abortions, and refused to say whether he would veto a national abortion ban. If he wins in November, conservatives have plans to use the Comstock Act, a federal law from the same era as the Arizona ban, to restrict abortion nationwide. Idaho is already in the Supreme Court fighting the federal government's attempts to make emergency rooms treat women with failing pregnancies before they're on the verge of death. And in Louisiana, where almost all abortion is illegal, lawmakers are moving to criminalize the mere possession of abortion pills.\n\nStill, in swing states, Republican Party leaders are trying to distance themselves from the anti-abortion movement, treating it much the way skittish Democrats once treated the movement for abortion rights. Back in the 1990s, Democrats relied on pro-choice votes, but haunted by old taunts about representing \"acid, amnesty and abortion,\" they held activists at a remove, and their leaders often expressed either disapproval or ambivalence about terminating pregnancies. Bill Clinton vetoed anti-abortion legislation and put pro-choice judges on the Supreme Court, but he also said the procedure should be \"safe, legal and rare.\" As late as 2005, Hillary Clinton called abortion a \"sad, even tragic choice.\"\n\nNow, however, the Democratic Party is united in championing abortion rights, with the vice president recently making history by visiting an abortion clinic, and it's Republicans who are flailing as they contend with a pro-choice backlash. It remains to be seen whether anti-abortion forces can acclimate to their new status as the embarrassing stepchildren of a coalition that once coddled them.\n\nAt the Arizona Capitol last week, when abortion opponents packed the House chamber to protest its vote to scrap the state ban, few blamed Trump or Lake, and some didn't even realize the ex-president had opposed the law. After Lake's event, however, Rees said she was disappointed in Republicans.\n\n\"I don't think that it's fair to expect pro-lifers to show up for you the second time around when you completely take a hands-off approach on pro-life issues,\" she said. Still, she recognized that people like her don't have another choice. \"I think there's going to be probably other reasons why pro-lifers go out to vote,\" she said, \"but I think it's going to be a very reluctant vote.\"", "source": {"uri": "heraldnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Herald net"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_woman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trans woman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Orb\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Orb\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_constitution_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State constitution (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_right", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian right"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

(Scripps News)\n\nThe Biden/Harris campaign has made access to abortion a core message of their 2024 reelection campaign.\n\nFollowing former President Trump's Time Magazine interview in which he refused to commit to vetoing a national abortion ban, noting it's unlikely that a piece of legislation would reach his desk if he's elected, the president and vice president are lifting up those comments on and off the campaign trail.\n\nThe Biden/Harris campaign launched a seven-figure ad buy last week across sports programming and networks targeting a younger audience.\n\nTrump's interview, the retort by the Biden/Harris campaign and Florida's implementation of their six-week abortion ban coalesced in the same week that marked two years since the Dobbs decision was leaked, forecasting that the Roe v. Wade decision would be overturned.\n\nAbortion\n\nVP Harris talks with Scripps News about protecting abortion access Scripps News Staff 11:53 AM, Feb 01, 2024\n\nIt was a moment that the administration -- specifically the vice president -- had been warning about. She has since become the administration's and campaign's foremost voice on the topic of abortion.\n\n\"I do believe in a moment in time where so many of our hard-won freedoms are under attack and this is a moment for us to stand and fight,\" the vice president said in April 2023 at the launch of the Biden/Harris reelection campaign.\n\n\"It really is something that matters to her at her core,\" Rachel Palermo, Harris' former deputy communications director told Scripps News.\n\n\"It was a natural fit for the vice president to want to lead on protecting reproductive rights. And the question was never if she was going to do it. It really was how, because this is something that is so near and dear to her,\" Palermo added. \"And she really views this as an issue of protecting fundamental freedoms, and that's how she thinks about it.\"\n\nAs a prosecutor, Palermo notes, Harris had focused on crimes against women and children, which is why she \"really takes issue with abortion bans with no exceptions for rape.\"\n\nAbortion\n\nIn visit to Arizona, VP Harris rebukes Trump on abortion Haley Bull 2:17 PM, Apr 12, 2024\n\nDuring Harris' fourth speech on abortion in a month, she showed how personal the issue is for her, telling people in Jacksonville a story about a friend being molested.\n\n\"When I was in high school, I learned that my best friend was being molested by her stepfather.\u202f And I said to her, 'Well, you've got to come and live with us.' I called my mother, and my mother said, \"'Of course, she does.'\u202f And so, she did,\" the vice president shared. \"So, the idea that someone who survives a crime of violence to their body, a violation of their body would not have the authority to make a decision about what happens to their body next, that's immoral.\u202f That's immoral.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Harris picked up this platform during her political career. As a senator, she went viral for an exchange with Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh, in which she asked him what laws govern a man's body.\n\nIt was also a top focus of her unsuccessful 2020 presidential campaign, in which she called out the lack of discussion on the issue during the presidential debates.\n\n\"This is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word with all of these discussions about health care on women's access to reproductive health care, which is under full-on attack today at the White House,\" she said at the CNN debate in the fall of 2020.\n\nIn the White House, even before Roe was overturned, she was highlighting what she saw as a concern over the future of the legal protection for abortion.\n\nThe same day the Justice Department sued Texas for its six-week abortion ban, which deputized citizens to report abortion seekers in September 2021, Harris hosted abortion providers and patients.\n\nEarlier this year, she took her advocacy for abortion protections a step further, making a historic visit to a clinic that performs abortions in Minnesota.\n\nPresident Biden has said he's running to \"make Roe v. Wade the law of the land\" and has gone further on the issue than his Democratic predecessors; from making the medication mifepristone more available through the mail, to defending the use of the medicated abortion drug before the Supreme Court, as well as advocating for access to abortion around emergency medical care.\n\nBut the president, a lifelong Catholic, is not the voice leading the issue. That responsibility has gone to the vice president, who is leaning into her decades-long experience on the topic to speak directly to voters.", "source": {"uri": "abc15.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "abc15 Arizona"}, "authors": [{"uri": "serena_marshall@abc15.com", "name": "Serena Marshall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripps_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scripps News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palermo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palermo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palermo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Wade ended nearly 50 years of the constitutional right to abortion in the United States.\n\nFlorida health officials in 2023 reported more than 84,000 abortions statewide, including nearly 7,800 from out-of-state residents.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Times recently reported that about 2 in 5 abortions in Florida over the past six years occurred in the first six weeks of pregnancy, meaning that roughly 60% of the procedures performed over that time frame would be illegal under the new restrictions.\n\nThe new laws in Florida and other states are sending some Americans across the border into Mexico to access an abortion, where the procedure was legalized in recent years.\n\nClinics in Mexico do not require proof of residency, so solid numbers about who they are treating are hard to come by. But providers in Mexico report they have been seeing more Americans.\n\nIn 2022, Luisa Garc\u00eda, director of Profem, an abortion clinic in the border city of Tijuana, told NPR that the percentage of patients coming from the United States had jumped from 25% to 50% in just the two months following the Dobbs decision.\n\nIn recent years, the U.S. and Mexico have each struggled over access to abortion care, with the two countries moving in opposite directions.\n\nThe year before the U.S. Supreme Court reversed Roe, the Mexican Supreme Court ruled the criminalization of abortion by the northern state of Coahuila unconstitutional. This decision set a precedent that led to decriminalization at the federal level in 2023.\n\nChange has since been slow. Only 13 of Mexico's 31 states have modified their penal codes to reflect the court's resolution, with Jalisco being the latest state to do so, in April 2024.\n\nUnlike in the U.S., federal laws in Mexico do not automatically overrule local ones. But Mexican women living in states where abortions are illegal can still have one in a federally run hospital or clinic.\n\nFollowing the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in 2022, Mexican organizations offering abortions have expanded locations to increase choices for Mexican and U.S. residents seeking care.\n\nFundaci\u00f3n MSI opened its newest clinic in Canc\u00fan late last year. Canc\u00fan's status as a popular tourist destination means that multiple U.S. airports offer direct flights for about $400 round trip.\n\nTo assist those traveling to Mexico, Mexican and American abortion rights groups created the Red Transfronteriza, a transnational network that supports those crossing the border in search of care but whose primary mission has become the shipping of misoprostol and mifepristone, the pills generally used to induce abortions, into the United States.\n\nOne group that is part of the network on the Mexican side of the border is Guanajuato-based Las Libres, or The Free Ones. In September 2023, its founder estimated that her organization had sent abortion pills to approximately 20,000 women in the U.S. since the Dobbs decision.\n\nAs elections loom closer in the United States, abortion will likely take center stage once again -- including in Florida, where a referendum to reverse the six-week ban will be on the November ballot.", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbeat_bill", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heartbeat bill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

(Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)\n\nEditor's note: This story is the third in a series about a group of people from Wisconsin trying to come up with policies to address abortion and its root causes that could be applied nationwide. Their larger goal is to find common ground on one of the most divisive issues in America.\n\nMADISON, Wis. -- The Starts With Us civic experiment on abortion began with a hypothesis that was reflected in the session's first working title: Abortion Access & Limits.\n\nAnd the experiment's results, following heated discussions among 14 Wisconsin residents with divergent abortion beliefs, are reflected in the session's final title: Abortion & Family Well-Being, whose just-released five proposed consensus solutions are designed to address the economic, health, and education disparities that can lead people to choose abortion. The group ultimately could not come to any consensus about abortion itself.\n\nBut they came very close.\n\nShortly before Starts With Us went live with its public feedback period on Wednesday, participant Dr. Kristin Lyerly experienced what facilitator Mariah Levison had throughout this session described as heartburn.\n\nThe OB-GYN and abortion provider told States Newsroom she couldn't sign off on the final language of what would have been a sixth proposal titled, \"Keep abortion available when a woman is experiencing a life-threatening medical risk.\" She said she took issue with some of the non-medical terms like \"unborn child,\" but her bigger concern was that the proposal used Wisconsin's definition of a life-threatening medical risk, which she said is poorly defined and does not explicitly include mental health emergencies.\n\n\"As a physician ... I do this in practice, and everybody else is just talking about the theory of it,\" said Lyerly, who has since stepped away from the Starts With Us project because her recently launched congressional campaign conflicts with its nonprofit status. \"When I'm taking care of my patients, I'm focused on, what does my patient need medically right now? Not, hey, can you Google what current Wisconsin law says about when a mother's life is in danger?\"\n\nSeveral of the participants on either side of the abortion access divide said the Starts With Us civic experiment motivated them to keep engaging in discussions about abortion with people they disagree with. (Sofia Resnick/States Newsroom)\n\nStarts With Us communications manager Tori Larned told States Newsroom that despite high-level consensus on this issue, several participants -- both who support and oppose abortion access -- disagreed with this proposal's final language, so they've scrapped it for now with the potential to revisit in the near future.\n\n\"For some, the language is still too permissive and for others it's too restrictive,\" Larned said in an email. \"Citizen Solutions is about bringing more nuance to what is often a binary, overly simplistic conversation.\"\n\nLyerly said she is excited about the proposals the group did achieve consensus on and the connections she made with people who disagree with her. But she remains firm in her view that a medical procedure shouldn't be narrowly regulated.\n\n\"I think we made some important headway, and I think that the fact that we were not able to address the pressing issue of abortion itself really emphasizes how complicated this problem is, and how it belongs in the realm of medical practice, not politics,\" Lyerly said. \"It's really hard to find that middle ground because there isn't necessarily middle ground that applies universally. It's a personal issue for you that affects your personal self and your personal family.\"\n\nSeveral of the participants on either side of the abortion access divide told States Newsroom that this civic experiment motivated them to keep engaging in discussions about abortion with people they disagree with. A couple said they were disappointed with the ultimate results. And some expressed improved understanding in the other's point of view, but no major shifts in thinking.\n\n\"Initially, I just felt that, how could you want to kill a baby inside your womb? How could you ever come to that conclusion?\" said participant Jeff Davis, 76, who has worked with crisis pregnancy centers for women who are contemplating abortion. \"From just some of the experiences of people who were there who viewed things differently than I do, I could see why a person could come to those conclusions. And so even though I didn't change my view, it's like, okay, now how can these concerns be addressed so that a person would want to choose life?\"\n\nDavis also told States Newsroom that he was among those abortion opponents who initially agreed that pregnancy termination should be allowed to preserve the life of the woman but could not agree to include mental distress as part of that definition. The semi-retired bovine veterinarian said his reasoning revolves around the qualitative nature of mental distress.\n\n\"It seems to me that those who are pro-abortion want to set the bar very low,\" Davis said. \"As a result, almost every woman could claim mental distress as a reason for being able to have an abortion.\"\n\nParticipant Ali Muldrow, the executive director of the abortion fund WMF Wisconsin, said she ultimately thinks theirs is a progressive set of policy proposals in what it doesn't include: abortion-ban exceptions for rape and incest.\n\n\"The fact that we actually didn't agree on an exception for rape and incest I think is a win,\" Muldrow said. \"We're not oversimplifying hugely traumatic experiences as if they can be easily identified, proven, and used to access health care. We didn't take the bait of compassion with a condition of extreme brutality. That's something you're seeing around the country right now and it's really dangerous.\"\n\nShe said that for her the group's dynamics reflect what she sees in the U.S., that there is a majority broadly on the side of abortion access despite their diverse personal views, and a minority (in this case five white Christians) advocating for limits because of deeply held religious beliefs.\n\n\"When you pair people who represent 80% of the population with people who represent kind of a specific religious perspective and pretend that those sides are equal, while also failing to kind of acknowledge that one of those groups of people has had historically more power than the other group of people, it creates a pretty complex dynamic,\" Muldrow said.\n\nAbortion opponents also expressed disappointment at what they saw as an imbalance of abortion perspectives. Kateri Klingele said that ahead of the final session held in April she acted as spokesperson for the five abortion opponents, and said they would refuse to consider an abortion exception related to fetal health diagnoses. Lyerly noted that three of the nine abortion-access supporters were absent for the final in-person debate. Heather Martell and Ramona Williams were absent because of personal issues, and Monique Minkens started feeling sick and had to leave.\n\nThis group of 14 Wisconsinites live all across the state, including Milwaukee, Rock, Chippewa, Door, Brown, Grant, and Dane counties. But now residents from the entire state - and the nation - can vote and comment on the group's proposals for state lawmakers to potentially consider. The proposals were evaluated by 14 health, legal, and policy experts with divergent views on abortion access, three of whom (a \"Catholic marriage and family expert,\" \"pro-life OB/GYN,\" and \"professor of educational policy studies\") chose to remain anonymous.\n\nIn brief, they would:\n\n\"We envision a world where Wisconsinites have greater support for planning and sustaining their families,\" the participants write in their joint vision statement. \"Unintended pregnancies and poor fetal and maternal health outcomes are experienced disproportionately by women of color and lower-income women. ... Better community and social supports -- including for children and families, as well as during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period -- help those who become pregnant feel like they have options for continuing their pregnancy.\"\n\nA June 2023 poll conducted by Marquette University in Milwaukee found that 32% of those polled believe abortion should be legal in all cases, 34% in most, 25% illegal in most, and 6% illegal in all. The participants in the Starts with Us civic experiment came from diverse backgrounds and points of view on abortion access. (Sofia Resnick/States Newsroom)\n\nStarts With Us head of programs Ashley Phillips said that after the public feedback period concludes on May 31, the participants will find out which proposals got the most support and then evaluate potential next steps, including bringing them to state lawmakers. She noted that for their first session, on gun rights and safety launched last year in Tennessee, more than 30,000 Tennesseans weighed in on eight proposals and five majority-supported proposals were ultimately brought to the state legislature.\n\nPhillips said Starts With Us absorbed a lot of participants' feedback (including hiring a mental-health counselor to help guide the final session in April) as they continue to iterate their Citizen Solutions sessions throughout the country. She said the results of this particular experiment, on abortion in Wisconsin, make her optimistic.\n\n\"If you look at the five [proposals], they're much more about root causes of abortion,\" Phillips said. \"That's the conversation that this group is trying to have. How can we expand the conversation on abortion, so it's not just about weeks, and it's not just about exceptions and carve-outs and bans and not bans and morality or not?\"\n\nMany of the participants said this experience was hard, but for most it was worthwhile.\n\n\"I think it's important to hear where people are,\" Muldrow said. \"As important as the areas where we agree, I think the areas where we disagree are deeply important. If you want there to be this kind of happy Kumbaya ending to a conversation about abortion with people with very different beliefs, it's a little disappointing that one of the more pronounced elements of that conversation is where people disagree, but people were able to disagree and stay in that space together. I think there's a lot to learn from that.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_Newsroom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "States Newsroom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baylor_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baylor University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics_and_gynaecology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Obstetrics and gynaecology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Veterinarian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_pregnancy_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crisis pregnancy center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualitative research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uterus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Davis_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Davis County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jeff Davis County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sofia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sofia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bulgaria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Phillips_(soccer,_born_1986)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ashley Phillips (soccer, born 1986)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojibwe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ojibwe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

In Arizona, a key battleground state and home to the sixth-largest Latinx population in the country, a Civil War-era total abortion ban will go into effect for at least several months until a repeal approved by state lawmakers takes effect.\n\nThe changing landscape of abortion restrictions in Florida and Arizona underscores the outsize impact of abortion bans on Latinas, the largest group of women of color impacted by current and likely bans on the procedure, according to multiple analyses. In both states, the sizable Latinx population could play a decisive role in the passage of proposed amendments to enshrine the right to abortion in their state constitutions.\n\n\"In many of these places, including Florida and Arizona, inequities for Latinas in terms of health care access were already really great,\" said Lupe Rodr\u00edguez, the executive director of the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice. \"Latinos have some of the highest rates of not being insured, and therefore, of not getting preventative health care of many kinds, including preventative reproductive health care. We know that these laws are very, very potentially harmful to the community.\"\n\nAn analysis by Rodriguez's group and the National Partnership for Women & Families, published in October, found that close to 6.7 million Latinas -- or 43 percent of all Latinas of reproductive age -- live in one of the 26 states with restrictions on abortions before fetal viability. Latinas in Florida, Arizona and Texas, where abortion is completely banned, account for one-third of all Latinas of reproductive age in the country.\n\nLatinos have one of the highest uninsured rates in the country, second only to Indigenous Americans, at 20 percent, according to a federal government analysis. The closure of clinics that offer abortions could disproportionately affect health care access among Latinas since the clinics are often \"the only entry point that many of them had to care,\" Rodriguez said. Her group is in the early stages of a study about the impact of abortion bans and the subsequent clinic shutterings on this population.\n\nThe Latina population in the United States trends younger, expanding the impact of bans on reproductive health care decisions. A study from UCLA published in late 2022 found that the share of Latinas who are of childbearing age tends to be significantly higher than that of White women in states that restrict abortion. In Florida, 49 percent of Latinas are between the ages of 18 and 44, compared with 31 percent of White women. In Arizona, the share is 60 percent and 34 percent, respectively.\n\nIt's important to point out that while Latinas make up a larger group of women impacted, the share of Black women living in states with these restrictions is the highest among all women, at 60 percent, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nJust over 1 in 10 Latinos are undocumented immigrants, but the impact on these Latinas will be compounded. In Florida, state laws meant to restrict how undocumented immigrants travel will make it harder for these patients to access an abortion, said Isa Ysaosales, who worked with a network of abortion funds in South Florida before joining a progressive group focused on drumming up support for the state's abortion rights ballot initiative. A new state law signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis makes it a felony for anyone to drive into the state with an undocumented immigrant, adding criminal penalties for family members or volunteers on top of existing fear about deportations.\n\nYsaosales said Wednesday was a \"sad day\" for abortion access in Florida as a six-week ban went into effect. The bright spot for abortion rights advocates is that voters in November will get a chance to weigh in on a measure that would protect abortion rights up to the point of fetal viability.\n\n\"We know that our tias and our primas and our abuelas have had abortions. We know that a world without abortion has never existed and will never exist. The Latina population knows they are putting our health at risk,\" said Ysaosales, who is an immigrant from Chile. \"I have faith that we're going to limit government interference in the state of Florida.\"\n\nIn Arizona, the abortion access landscape remains muddled. State lawmakers on Wednesday approved a repeal of an abortion ban that predates statehood and was revived by a state court last month. The ban is expected to go into effect in June while its repeal won't take effect for several more months -- 90 days from the end of the legislative session, which could end well into the summer. The timeline creates a gap during which the ban can take effect.\n\nThe ban is part of a Civil Rights-era law that makes it a crime to perform an abortion or assist someone in obtaining one -- and has no exceptions for rape or incest. Its revival supplanted a ban on most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nThe effort to repeal the ban in the Arizona state Senate was led in part by a Latina lawmaker elected to the chamber in 2022, illustrating the way in which many Latinas are leading efforts to expand reproductive rights.\n\nState Sen. Anna Hernandez, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, said her West Phoenix district has the highest share of Latinx residents in the state. It is also heavily working-class, augmenting the impact of any abortion restriction \"because these are people that already have barriers to access the care that is legal now, and they're not gonna have the resources to get up and travel out of state to seek care,\" she said.\n\nHernandez was part of a group of political leaders and reproductive rights advocates who traveled to the Dominican Republic in December to better understand the effect of a total abortion ban with no exceptions. Her experience there boosted her drive on reproductive rights in the legislature.\n\nLatinas in the Arizona Legislature are not a united front against abortion restrictions. House Majority Whip Teresa Martinez is one of the Republicans who led efforts to block the repeal. According to the Arizona Mirror, she introduced legislation meant to draw voters away from the abortion rights referendum by crowding the ballot with other abortion related measures with titles that suggest they would protect abortion rights.\n\n\"In my opinion, removing healthy babies from healthy mothers is not health care nor reproductive care. Pregnancy is not an illness,\" Martinez said on the House floor last month.\n\nIn the end, Martinez and most of her fellow Republican legislators could not keep the Civil War-era ban alive. Support for the repeal came from Hernandez and 15 other Latina legislators, a group whose representation reached historic highs after last year's elections.", "source": {"uri": "tucsonsentinel.com",

Wade in June 2022.\n\nThe path to this moment has been marked by disagreements among abortion rights advocates, as well as lengthy court battles with Republican officials trying to block them from starting to gather signatures. More legal challenges loom, as Republican state lawmakers look to weaken the state's long-standing tradition of giving the voters the power to directly amend their state constitution, and anti-abortion groups spin up new efforts to defeat the measure.\n\nMissouri's abortion ban, which threatens doctors with felony charges, has no exceptions for rape or incest. The proposed Right to Reproductive Freedom Amendment would enshrine a constitutional right to abortion to the point of fetal viability, which is determined by physicians but is usually around 22 to 25 weeks of pregnancy, and requires the state to use the \"least restrictive means\" in regulating abortion. The amendment would also guarantee a right to other reproductive health care, including pre and post-natal care, contraception and miscarriage management.\n\n\"Missourians are excited for the opportunity to end our state's cruel abortion ban and put health care decisions back in the hands of patients and doctors,\" Tori Schafer, deputy director of policy and campaigns at the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, which is backing the measure, said in a statement.\n\nThat effort has garnered vigorous resistance from anti-abortion groups and top officials in Missouri's Republican-controlled state government.\n\nAbortion opponents in Missouri argue the proposed amendment would go too far in allowing abortions later in pregnancy and could overturn the dozens of abortion restrictions passed by the state legislature. Anti-abortion groups including Missouri Right to Life and Missouri Stands With Women, a political action committee incorporated in January, led \"decline to sign\" campaigns discouraging voters from signing petitions to get the abortion measure on the ballot.\n\nSome of the fiercest opposition has come from Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, whose office waged a months-long legal fight with abortion rights advocates over the amendment's summary language, delaying the start of signature gathering. Ashcroft, a candidate for governor, also suggested he'd refuse to do his job if voters passed the amendment.\n\nAshcroft ultimately lost in the state Supreme Court, but the coalition submitted more than double the signatures required in anticipation of his office possibly challenging their validity.\n\nThere's also a chance state lawmakers could pass a bill that would ask voters in the November election or a special election to pass a constitutional amendment that would make it harder for citizen-led initiatives to get on the ballot and pass. An analysis from the news outlet The Missouri Independent found that under the proposal, as few as 1 in 5 voters in the state could reject a ballot measure. Its sponsor, Republican state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, has backed other anti-abortion bills.\n\nOhio voters resoundingly rejected a similar measure that Republican officials put on the ballot as they attempted to thwart the passage of an abortion rights constitutional amendment in 2023.\n\nKelly Hall, executive director of The Fairness Project, said Missouri is \"a poster child for what can be achieved through direct democracy\" with proper investment. The Fairness Project supports progressive ballot measure campaigns around the country, including current efforts to put abortion on the ballot in Missouri, Arizona, Florida and Montana in 2024.\n\nOver the past decade, organizers in Missouri have led successful ballot measure campaigns to expand Medicaid, raise the state's minimum wage, and legalize medical and recreational marijuana -- all policies with little to no chance in the Republican-dominated state legislature.\n\nHall said Missouri organizers' wealth of experience allowed them to raise significant funds and kickstart signature gathering despite months of delays. Missourians for Constitutional Freedom raised nearly $5 million in the first quarter of 2024, filings show. Over 1,800 volunteers collected signatures in all of Missouri's 114 counties and knocked on over 40,000 doors, the coalition said Friday.\n\n\"As grateful as I am for the initiative petition, it's a really unfortunate way to make law because it just means that we don't have a representative legislature,\" said Bridgette Dunlap, a St. Louis-based attorney and writer. Dunlap, who has a background in abortion rights litigation, assisted with an amicus brief the League of Women Voters of Missouri filed in the lawsuit over the initiative's summary language.\n\n\"The only way things with bipartisan support get through in Missouri is through this arduous, expensive process,\" she said.\n\nRepublicans are heavily favored to win the presidential, U.S. Senate and governor's races in Missouri, which backed former President Donald Trump by 15 points in 2020. The abortion amendment could be among the most competitive contests on the November ballot.\n\nA survey conducted by St. Louis University and YouGov in February found a plurality of Missourians, 44 percent, supported returning abortion rights to the standard under Roe v. Wade while 37 percent were opposed. The measure's potential success lies with the 19 percent who said they were undecided.\n\nRepublicans backing the proposal to change the state's citizen-led initiative process argue it would limit out-of-state influence in ballot measures and give rural voters a greater voice, making the outcomes of ballot measures more representative. But abortion rights advocates see it as a clear gambit to block citizens from directly voting on abortion.\n\n\"I just hope that they look at Ohio and see that that would be a huge waste of time and money,\" said Dunlap. \"And it just trains people to go out to vote.\"\n\nIn the meantime, elected officials like Coleman and anti-abortion groups are deploying other tactics, some of which are relatively novel, to oppose the amendment.\n\nIn the summer of 2023, Attorney General Andrew Bailey, Coleman and another state lawmaker unsuccessfully disputed State Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick's assessment that the measure would have little to no cost to the state, arguing that legalizing abortion would cost the state billions of dollars in lost tax revenue from citizens who would have otherwise been born. Research has consistently found a strong correlation between abortion bans and negative economic outcomes at the state level.\n\nAnother effort picked up their line of argument, aiming to block organizers from getting the signatures they needed to get the measure on the ballot. Missouri Right to Life's \"decline to sign\" flyers, which also argued that legalized abortion would cost the state tax revenue, encouraged people to call a hotline and report where volunteers are gathering signatures for the abortion amendment.\n\nJess Piper, a progressive advocate and writer who serves as the executive director of Blue Missouri, reported that Coleman, the Republican state senator who is also a candidate for secretary of state, has personally attempted to discourage people from signing petitions.\n\nIn a post on her Substack blog, The View from Rural Missouri, Piper shared photographs and witness accounts from an April 20 signature-gathering event at a public library in Coleman's district that Coleman attended to dissuade voters present from signing petitions. Coleman's campaign did not return a request for comment about the event.\n\nMissouri Stands With Women, an organization led by men with close ties to the anti-abortion movement, has raised over $84,000 and spent nearly $67,000 since January, in part to back the decline-to-sign effort, campaign finance filings show.\n\nThe leading image on the group's website, depicting a group of smiling women in white T-shirts, is a stock photo also seen on a modeling agency website and in an Amazon listing for friendship bracelets. Samuel Lee, the group's president, is a longtime anti-abortion activist and lobbyist in the state who proclaimed that the fight over abortion was \"not over\" after the Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health.\n\nThe organization has close ties to Republican officials who have tried to block the ballot measure. The organization's treasurer, attorney Edward Greim, donated $2,825, the maximum allowed, to Ashcroft's campaign in June. Shortly after, Ashcroft hired the law firm where Greim practices as a partner to represent his office in a lawsuit. In January, Ashcroft told state lawmakers he intended to pay the firm, Graves Garrett Greim, $1.2 million in taxpayer funds for legal services in the case. Greim also represented Missouri Senate Majority Leader Cindy O'Laughlin, who filed an amicus brief defending Ashcroft's proposed ballot summary language for the abortion measure.\n\nThe organization has released a \"decline to sign\" flyer and several videos featuring Republican elected officials urging Missourians not to sign petitions. They've also reportedly sent text messages to voters claiming, without evidence, that a voter signing an initiative petition is vulnerable to having their identity stolen, an argument Coleman has also echoed.\n\nOn Tuesday, Piper tweeted out a screenshot of a text message she said some Missouri residents received that urged them to \"decline to sign\" to \"protect yourself from fraud & theft.\"\n\n\"Out of town strangers are trying to collect your sensitive personal data for extremist groups,\" claimed the text message, which did not mention abortion or the ballot initiative.\n\nA disclosure seen at the bottom of a graphic included in the message says it was paid for by Missouri Stands With Women. A representative for the group did not respond to a request for comment about the text message.\n\nVoters signing initiative petitions provide information like their name and address necessary to verify their eligibility to vote, but not sensitive information like their Social Security number. Registered voters' names, addresses, dates of birth, and contact information are publicly available information. Campaigns and PACs regularly use them in their voter outreach and targeting efforts.\n\n\"Anti-abortion extremists continue to lie and spread disinformation because they know Missourians are fired up and ready to turn out to support our campaign,\" Schafer said.\n\nDunlap, the Missouri lawyer and writer, has been volunteering to collect signatures for the ballot measure in St. Louis and Columbia. She said that while decline-to-sign efforts could have an impact of generally \"stigmatizing\" the abortion ballot measure, she saw no evidence of them actually being effective.\n\nTo Hall, the success of the signature-gathering effort in Missouri highlights the importance of long-term investment in direct democracy where it exists.\n\n\"We can't only think about these middle-of-the-country states when there happens to be a shiny object like abortion on the ballot,\" Hall said. \"It really pays off to do cycle-over-cycle, year-round work to make sure that this infrastructure exists -- and it's being put to exceptional use by the abortion measure coalition right now in Missouri.\"", "source": {"uri": "truthout.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Truthout"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ashcroft", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Ashcroft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_amendment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional amendment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_right", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional right"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

(Scripps News)\n\nAbortion is expected to be a major factor in the 2024 presidential election. It's a deeply personal issue, and every person who seeks help has their own story.\n\n\"You have someone who's flying here all the way from Texas to literally walk into a clinic and pick up some pills and go home,\" said Megan Jeyifo, executive director of the Chicago Abortion Fund.\n\n\"And then there's just also a lot of trauma. There's a lot of, you know, people might have more complex medical needs and need to be transferred to hospital-based care,\" she continued.\n\nThe one thing that is consistent is the sheer volume of people seeking an abortion. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe, which provided the constitutional right to abortion, in 2022, the Chicago Abortion Fund has increased its staff from two to 19.\n\n\"There's great resources for people that are managing miscarriages or abortions, as well as people that are actively fighting prosecution around pregnancy outcomes,\" said Qudsiyyah Sharyif, deputy director of the Chicago Abortion Fund.\n\nIn addition to helping provide abortion care, the group also offers meals, flights, gas money and emotional support.\n\nMany of their clients come from as far away as Texas, others from right next door in Indiana, where a near-total abortion ban went into effect in August 2023.\n\n\"About once a week I probably talked to somebody who says, 'Well, I think abortion is wrong. I think abortion is not something that people should do, but I need one and here's why,\" said Jess Marchbank of All Options of Indiana, a pregnancy resource center.\n\nMarchbank is all too familiar with the myriad reasons people seek help.\n\n\"We talked to a lot of people who are experiencing intimate partner violence or on the verge of homelessness, unstable housing situations, or often it's just, I get a lot of messages along the lines of I already have four kids and I've been taking all the precautions. I can barely support the children that I already have,\" she explained.\n\nMarchbank calls her group a one-stop-shop for anything expectant mothers may need: from diapers and wipes, to spiritual counseling and even financial help with abortion access.\n\nShe also spends her time explaining the nuances of Indiana's law to people who oftentimes feel scared or frustrated.\n\n\"Sometimes, I almost get the sense that they've been sort of put through the wringer so much that at the next sort of barrier or challenge, they'll give up,\" she continued.", "source": {"uri": "wptv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WPTV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amber_strong@wptv.com", "name": "Amber Strong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Abortion_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Abortion Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

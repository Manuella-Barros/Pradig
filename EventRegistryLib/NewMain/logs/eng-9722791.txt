The report said while bankruptcy is a possibility, MOD Pizza could still choose a different path. The company is \"exploring all options\" to improve its financial situation, according to a company spokesperson.\n\n\"We have a brand that our guests love, a dedicated team and a solid turnaround plan that's making progress. We're working hard to improve our finances and are considering all possible options. Since this is an ongoing process, it wouldn't be appropriate to speculate on the outcome,\" they said.\n\nThis news is surprising despite the wave of bankruptcy filings, potential filings or large-scale closures of various restaurant chains and franchisees. MOD Pizza had been a standout success story, growing rapidly and becoming the leader in the fast-casual pizza sector known for its \"made-on-demand, customizable, individual-sized personal pizzas.\" (Related: Restaurant industry collapsing across the US, with several popular chains permanently CLOSING DOWN numerous locations.)\n\nMOD Pizza secured a funding of $160 million in 2019 when it operated 433 locations and aimed to expand to 1,000 locations within five years. The chain even filed for an initial public offering in 2021, though it never came to fruition. However, the pandemic and subsequent inflation likely hindered the company's growth.\n\nDespite challenges, MOD Pizza remains a success story within the fast-casual pizza sector. According to Technomic's Ignite data, MOD Pizza ended fiscal 2023 with $732 million in domestic sales, a 10.7 percent increase from the previous year, outperforming competitors, like Blaze Pizza and Pieology.\n\nWe are building the infrastructure of human freedom and empowering people to be informed, healthy and aware.

This change indicated that there might be deeper issues within MOD Pizza.\n\nAccording to Restaurant Business magazine, MOD Pizza closed 26 restaurant locations in the first quarter of this year - which the chain confirmed on April 9. These closures included 25 company owned locations across 10 states and the District of Columbia, as well as one franchise location in Atlanta. The move reduced MOD Pizza's total number of locations from 553 down to 527.\n\nMOD Pizza spokesman Rick Van Warner noted that the closures affected five locations in California - where the pizza chain operates 53 restaurants. However, he clarified that the Golden State's new $20 hourly minimum wage wasn't the reason for the shutdowns. Rather, the closures were due to \"underperformance\" and the decision was based on business evaluations.\n\nThe distribution of closures included three restaurants each in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Texas and the District of Columbia; two in Wisconsin and Washington state; and one each in Florida, Oklahoma, Virginia and Oregon. Workers from the closed locations were given opportunities to transfer to other units or offered severance pay if they couldn't or didn't want to transfer.\n\nFounded in 2008 by Svenson and his wife, MOD Pizza is known is known for its people-first mission. The chain provides opportunities for workers often overlooked by other employers, including those previously incarcerated or with developmental disabilities.\n\nCalifornia passes new law establishing fast-food minimum wage of $20/hour, McDonald's to spend $250,000 more per restaurant per year.\n\nCasual dining restaurant chain Hooters CLOSES several locations as \"restaurant apocalypse\"

But with the deal, MOD officials hope to restructure debt and shore up the 512-unit chain's capital base.\n\nElite has been a collector of financially troubled restaurant brand over the years. Led by Michael Nakhleh, the former Sizzler and Fatburger franchise operator has acquired brands like Slater's 50/50, pizza concepts Project Pie and Patxi's Pizza, family-dining chain Marie Callender's, as well as the Mediterranean concepts Daphne's and Noon Mediterranean, and cupcake chain Gigi's Cupcakes. It's not clear whether those brands remain in Elite's portfolio.\n\nNakhleh in a statement said, \"MOD has an outstanding culture and passionate, loyal guests and employees. We recognize the inherent value this represents and look forward to helping MOD write the next chapter in its history.\"\n\nLast week, reports indicated MOD was considering a Chapter 11 filing as the company worked to improve its capital structure. In a statement at the time, company officials said they were exploring all options, and that a \"solid turnaround plan was underway that is making progress.\"\n\nThat plan has included \"rightsizing the portfolio,\" as well as refreshing the brand and elevating the guest experience, the company said Wednesday, though no details were offered. Year to date, 44 underperforming restaurants have shuttered, all company owned, and it's not clear whether more will close.\n\nFor years, MOD -- known officially as MOD Super Fast Pizza Holdings LLC -- was seen as the leader in the fast-casual pizza niche, growing to more than 500 units. Of the 512 currently, 89 are franchised.\n\nIt was founded by Scott and Ally Svenson in 2008, and was one of the first fast-casual pizza concepts to emerge in what soon became a crowded pack of contenders offering a walk-the-line, build-your-own personal, artisanal pizza, with as many as 40 toppings available for one price.\n\nIt quickly became a favorite of investors, and the chain raised a total of $345 million over the years, with investors that included Nigel Travis, the former chair and CEO of Dunkin' Brands Group Inc., and Spencer Rascoff, CEO of the real estate website Zillow, as well as investment firms PWP Growth Equity, Fidelity Management & Research. Most recently, in 2019, MOD announced it had raised $160 million in equity financing from private-equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice.\n\nAt the time, the company pledged to double its unit count to about 1,000 restaurants. That funding supported rapid expansion in a drive to earn national brand awareness, with the goal of going public. In 2021, the chain filed confidential plans for an initial public offering.\n\nBut the IPO never came to fruition and there were signs earlier this year that MOD was in serious trouble -- perhaps in part because that rapid expansion resulted in poor real estate choices.\n\nScott Svenson in January stepped down as CEO, moving to an executive chairman role, and the company brought in former Cooper's Hawk executive Beth Scott to take the helm. She took quick action.\n\nIn the first quarter, the company closed 26 restaurants, scattered across the country, in a culling of underperforming units. And the closures continued into the second quarter, for a total of 44.\n\nThe chain had ended 2023 with about 553 units, an increase of 4.1% over the prior year, according to Restaurant Business sister brand Technomic. MOD also generated an estimated $699 million in domestic sales, up 5.7%, and the average unit volume was $1.3 million, which increased from the AUV in 2022 of $1.2 million. But, because MOD is a private company, officials declined to verify those estimates.\n\nMOD is not the only fast-casual pizza chain to face challenges.\n\nThe pandemic was not kind to fast-casual pizza, which was fundamentally designed to be a better alternative to legacy delivery brands like Domino's and Pizza Hut. MOD's style of pizza was best served hot out of the 800-degree ovens, and it made for a quick lunch for office workers.\n\nBut post-pandemic consumers gravitated to delivery and digital ordering (and chicken concepts), and many workers never returned to offices, changing the equation for fast-casual pizza's lunch-focused real estate selections.\n\nTo address these challenges, competitor Blaze Pizza -- which last year saw its unit count shrink 2.3% to 295, recently unveiled a brand overhaul that includes a new menu. Last year &Pizza brought in a new CEO with the hope of bringing the brand's edginess back. Pieology also closed restaurants in 2023, with its unit count down 8.4% to 109, according to Technomic.\n\nMOD has long been known for its mission-driven employee culture. The Svensons were believers in the idea of second chances, and the chain made a point of welcoming workers from all walks of life, including those with challenging backgrounds, like previous incarceration, homelessness or those with developmental disabilities.\n\nIt's not clear whether that mission will change under new ownership.\n\n\"MOD is a beloved brand with a strong following,\" said CEO Beth Scott, in a statement about the sale. \"We're excited to work with Elite Restaurant Group to strengthen MOD's future.\"\n\nMembers help make our journalism possible.

Another Major Restaurant Chain Close to Declaring Bankruptcy", "body": "Your favorite pizza place is in financial trouble. I hate hearing this.\n\nRestaurant Business is reporting that a popular pizza chain is struggling and trying to figure out its future, but could be headed for a bankruptcy filing.\n\nFor years it was considered the fastest-growing chain restaurant in the United States and now, like many other restaurants it's trying to stay afloat.\n\nIt's MOD Pizza.\n\nIt still has 18 locations in Pennsylvania, including Newtown, Warrington, and Willow Grove.\n\nThere were several New Jersey locations, including Princeton and Cherry Hill but, they have closed down.\n\nA MOD Pizza spokesperson said in a statement addressing the rumors that the company is experiencing trouble, \"We have a brand guests love, a passionate team, and a solid turnaround plan underway that is making progress. We're working diligently to improve our capital structure and are exploring all options to do so. Since this is an ongoing process, it would be inappropriate to speculate on the outcome.\"\n\nThis isn't the only restaurant chain that's been hit with hard times recently.\n\nThe once wildly popular seafood chain, Red Lobster, declared bankruptcy back in May (2024). I never thought I'd see that happen. The company has been forced to shut down many locations across the country including the always bustling Lawrenceville, NJ location on Route 1.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and post-pandemic inflation has wrecked havoc on the restaurant industry.\n\nHopefully, MOD Pizza will survive. I love the concept.\n\nYou know what MOD stands for, don't you? It's an abbreviation for Made On Demand. The pizza is made how you like it in a personal size, so everyone is happy.

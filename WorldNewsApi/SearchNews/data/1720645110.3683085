Duke of Westminster's new wife Olivia Henson beams in official photos from the society wedding of the year that starred Prince William as an usher By Maria Chiorando For Mailonline Published: 17:21 BST, 8 June 2024 | Updated: 17:21 BST, 8 June 2024 e-mail View comments The highly-anticipated 'society wedding of the year' took place yesterday, with Hugh Grosvenor and Olivia Henson tying the knot. As with any wedding, many spectators were most interested in seeing what the bride, 31, would be wearing. And Olivia - who holds the title of Duchess of Westminster following the nuptials to Hugh, the 7th Duke of Westminster - did not disappoint with her choice. The bride looked ethereal in a bespoke gown by London-based designer Emma Victoria Payne. She paired it with a bespoke veil from the same designer, and the Faberge Myrtle Leaf Tiara, made for Grosvenor brides to wear on their wedding day. Emma Victoria Payne, who has been described as the 'go to' designer for the society set, revealed in a post on Instagram that she was 'thrilled to be commissioned to make this special bespoke bridal gown for Olivia'. Olivia Henson (pictured, right) donned a bespoke gown and veil created by designer Emma Victoria Payne for her wedding to Hugh Grosvenor (pictured, left) yesterday She told Tatler: 'From the initial appointments to the final fitting, it has been an absolute pleasure and we have loved every moment of collaborating with her. Olivia had a clear vision for certain elements of her dress and we worked closely together to bring the design to life.' The gown, which boasted a slimline silhouette, three-quarter length sleeves, and a bateau neckline, was crafted from ivory silk crepe satin and ivory silk organza. Additional details, like the lace trim on the neckline and cuffs, added a personal touch to the simple and elegant design. Gathering at the waistline created some volume at the bottom of the bias-cut skirt, and the keyhole back - meant the dress, while conservative, was not stuffy. Finally, the gown featured a detachable two metre silk crepe satin train with a panelled construction. Describing the dress in a post on Instagram, the designer said it was: 'A sleek silhouette with a bias cut skirt, pleated waistband, gathered sleeves, wide embroidered silk organza cuffs with a scalloped edge repeat motif and button detailing. 'The back of the bridal gown features a dropped waist, keyhole back and scalloped edging embroidery embellishments fastening with rouleau loops. It features a detachable 2m silk crepe satin train with a panelled construction.' Olivia's long veil incorporated floral motifs and edgings from her great-great-grandmother\u2019s veil (which dates back to around 1880). Wedding dress designer Emma Victoria Payne was on hand on the big day, where she was seen holding the veil amid blustery winds Completing the veil design, were personalised initials and the wedding date, embroidered in the centre back. The designer described the piece as a 'bespoke waterfall veil featuring intricate bespoke and personalised embroidery'. As she made her way into the cathedral, the bride's veil blew in the wind, prompting gasps from the crowd. Luckily, the designer was on hand to help hold the train and veil in place, against the blustery winds. While she may be one of Emma Victoria Payne's most recognisable customers, the new Duchess is not her only high profile commission. Among the brides who have sported her designs are India Clevely, the owner of London Velvet, who wed Charlie Agar in 2022. In 2021, Lady Jemima Herbert married Hugo Davies at the family pile, Wilton House in Wiltshire, wearing a gown she designed and Emma Victoria Payne brought to life. She also designed the wedding dress worn by Sophie Carter, who is reportedly a close friend of the Princess of Wales, and a godmother to Princess Charlotte. In addition to creating bridal gowns and bridesmaid frocks, Emma also designed a collection of dresses for the annual British debutante ball, Queen Charlotte's Ball - one of the highlights of the social calendar. According to her website, the designer had 'a clear passion for design from an early age'. At just eight, Emma, who hails from Chorleywood in Hertfordshire, was given her first sewing machine, and 'adored making things'. The bride's bespoke lace veil, and two metre-long detachable train, prompted gasps from the assembled crowds as they blew in the wind (pictured L-R: Olivia Henson; Emma Victoria Payne) After completing an art foundation course, she studied at the famous Central St Martins College of Art and Design, completing a degree in Fashion Print. Following this, she went to design for John Galliano in Paris and Levi Strauss in Brussels. Emma, who was honoured with the prestigious Elle Style Award for Levi Denim Designer of the Year in 2006, revealed that it was while working in Paris that she realised she wanted to design bridal gowns. This was after she 'fell in love with the elegance of vintage silhouettes and bias cut styles', and wanted to 'create gowns that captured a feminine romantic feel'. Emma opened her boutique on Beauchamp Place in Knightsbridge in 2010, doubling the size of the premises in 2011. In 2017, the store moved to Chelsea, to a new address on Park Walk.

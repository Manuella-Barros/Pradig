{"id": 243217228, "title": "Xander Bogaerts sees himself in Red Sox rookie Ceddanne Rafaela", "text": "In the hours leading up to Xander Bogaerts\u2019 first game at Fenway Park as a visitor, several former Red Sox teammates found him to catch up. But one player, in particular, was eager to greet him. Because even though they didn\u2019t overlap in Boston, they share a unique connection few other Major Leaguers can claim. For several minutes, Bogaerts and Ceddanne Rafaela stood by the Red Sox dugout, speaking Papiamento. \u201cWhen we talk, it\u2019s always Papiamento,\u201d Rafaela told the Herald. Papiamento is the official language of Aruba, Bogaerts\u2019 home, and Rafaela\u2019s native Cura\u00e7ao. Along with Bonaire, they make up the Dutch Caribbean\u2019s beautiful ABC Islands, also known as the Leeward Antilles. Bogaerts won\u2019t play at all this weekend. He fractured his shoulder on May 20 and only began swinging a bat again this week. Like many Red Sox teammates, Rafaela was just happy to see him. \u201cI was asking him how it\u2019s going with his injury, how he\u2019s feeling, talking about life. It\u2019s nice to have him around,\u201d the rookie said with a smile. As a kid growing up in Cura\u00e7ao with dreams of playing Major League Baseball, Rafaela looked up to Bogaerts, who played ball against his cousin and brother. It made signing with Boston in the summer of 2017 all the more meaningful. \u201cI\u2019ve always looked up to the player he is, the human he is,\u201d Rafaela said. \u201cI think he\u2019s one person always. Doesn\u2019t matter how he\u2019s doing on the field, I think you always see him being nice to the people, he\u2019s being one of the best teammates, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard. So I think those type of things are the things I really appreciate about him.\u201d Despite never officially being teammates, Bogaerts and Rafaela keep in touch. \u201cI hit him up the other day,\u201d Bogaerts said, joking that he may have \u201cjinxed\u201d the rookie. \u201cHe was hot, and then I hit him up and said continue and I mean, I think he went on a little cold stretch,\u201d the infielder explained. \u201cBut he got it, man. And I mean, it\u2019s elite at short and center. That\u2019s not something that a lot of guys can say that they can do.\u201d Bogaerts sees a lot of himself in the rookie. \u201cObviously, we know him to be a free-swinger, but when he hits it, he can get a good swing on it,\u201d the two-time World Series champion assessed. \u201cI\u2019d probably say the same thing about me! When I was young, it was tough; I mean, I hit .240 my first (full) year in the big leagues. It wasn\u2019t easy. And all I needed was a little time, the team showing some trust in me, giving me some more at-bats, some more playing time, and I\u2019m happy with the player that I am today because of that, and I\u2019m thankful for that. \u201cSo I think, with him, it\u2019s the same thing. Just patience. And the more he learns the strike zone, the more he plays, the more better he\u2019ll get, that\u2019s for sure. He works hard, and he has a lot of talent, that\u2019s for sure. He has a good mindset.\u201d In baseball history, only 23 players have made it from ABC to MLB. When he debuted with the Red Sox on August 20, 2013, Bogaerts was No. 18. Ten years and eight days later, Rafaela became the 23rd. \u201cI always wanted to play with someone from the islands, and now I have Profar,\u201d Bogaerts said of Padres teammate Jurickson Profar, who hails from Cura\u00e7ao. \u201cProfar is someone I played against since we were nine. \u2026 Me and him have something different, something more special I would say.\u201d Rafaela shares the Red Sox clubhouse with fellow Cura\u00e7aoan Kenley Jansen. But in an alternate universe \u2013 one in which the club renegotiated Bogaerts\u2019 contract and he remained a Red Sock for life, just as he always wanted \u2013 it could\u2019ve been Bogaerts and Rafaela. It\u2019s something both really wanted. \u201cYes, always, it was always in my mind, coming up in the organization,\u201d Rafaela said. \u201cI was hoping to play with him but we didn\u2019t have the chance.\u201d \u201cRafaela is someone I took care of whenever he was in the minors. I followed him a lot in the minors,\u201d Bogaerts concurred. \u201cHe was one I was looking forward to playing with, but it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d When he debuted late last summer, Rafaela played several positions, often subbing into contest in later innings. Then he got to make his first career start, stepping into Bogaerts\u2019 shoes. \u201cIn my mind it was crazy, because my first start was at short, and that\u2019s where he was for years,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cThat first game was special for me, playing shortstop.\u201d Stuck on the sidelines for his first series back in Boston, Bogaerts was looking forward to seeing the rookie patrol his old diamond live. \u201cI\u2019m definitely excited to see him play tonight, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s at short or center,\u201d he said. Hearing that Rafaela was starting at shortstop on Friday night, Bogaerts smiled. \u201cThat\u2019ll be nice.\u201d", "summary": "Former Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts once hoped to play with his fellow countryman Ceddanne Rafaela in Boston.

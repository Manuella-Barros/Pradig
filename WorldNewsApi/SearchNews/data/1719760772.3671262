Which is the best value?", "text": "Fast-food inflation has been waging war on the pockets of consumers who enjoy hot and ready meals from a variety of chains. The cost of this fare, which many would say gained popularity for being low-cost, last-ditch food or late-night grub is now considered a \u201cluxury.\u201d Fast food costs have effectively outpaced the average rate of inflation in other U.S. industries, and numerous consumers have taken to the internet to rant about menu prices at some of their favorite establishments. McDonald\u2019s is one such restaurant that has received some heat from guests, and it\u2019s been reported that lower-income customers have stopped considering the chain. The chain\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski said that providing value for this segment of restaurant guests is a top concern. This could be why Mickey D\u2019s announced it\u2019d be offering a $5 combo meal. McDonald\u2019s limited-time $5 combo According to CNBC, the box contains fries, a drink, four-piece nuggets, and a McChicken or a McDouble, all for the price of five bucks. The promotion starts on June 25 and lasts a month. Tasting Table reported that Burger King is offering a similar deal to its customers with the Your Way Meal, which also retails for $5 and gives shoppers the choice between a Whopper Jr., Chicken Jr., or Bacon Cheeseburger, along with nuggets, fries, and a drink as well. Former McDonald\u2019s Corporate chef Mike Haracz said that Burger King\u2019s combo meal is a clear example that the latter chain is gunning for fast-food burger value dominance, as statements made from business reps clearly stated the promotion was going to last at least several months, as opposed to the four weeks of Mickey D\u2019s run, per Reuters. Haracz, in his trademark fashion, records his TikTok from the interior of his car. In his latest bit of Mickey D\u2019s commentary, he discusses how BK is gunning for the golden arches with its latest budget offering, the $5 combo meal bag, akin to Wendy\u2019s popular 4 for $4. Burger King\u2019s $5 value meal \u201cBurger King is coming after McDonald\u2019s,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a former McDonald\u2019s corporate chef and Burger King has announced that it is bringing its own five dollar value meal to its menu. Something very interesting that they\u2019ve publicly stated is not only are they gonna bring it back before McDonald\u2019s, they said that they are gonna keep it on the menu much longer than McDonald\u2019s does.\u201d He adds, \u201cMcDonald\u2019s said it\u2019s bringing its $5 value meal however it would be only for a month and only at select locations. I have a feeling the same thing is gonna happen at Burger King where it might not be at all locations. But this is very common in QSR [quick-service restaurant] World. Whether its Chicken Wars, whether it\u2019s the snack wrap alternative, whatever the other kind of deal or values, McDonald\u2019s seldomly is the one doing it first.\u201d Commenters weigh in One person wrote that there have been other fast food chains that have ensured guests have relatively low-cost combo meals at their fingertips. \u201cWendy\u2019s has been doing it already for YEARS,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThey\u2019ve made a few more expensive at $7 or $6 recently but still have 3 meals $5 or less\u201d Another said, \u201cWendy\u2019s is putting them to task too by coming out with theirs.\u201d Several folks swore by Burger King, stating that BK\u2019s menu items are far superior to Ronald McDonald\u2019s. \u201cBurger King will always be better than McTrash,\u201d one person said. Another replied, \u201cBK is already a better value than McD. And the flame flavor is better.\u201d \u201cThe rodeo burger is great. There bbq sauce is better. Not corn syrup swill,\u201d someone else remarked. Others weren\u2019t enthused with the idea of eating anything from Burger King. \u201cI had Burger King yesterday for the first time in a very long time, it was terrible. won\u2019t be going back anytime soon,\u201d one user said. Others directed customers to the McDonald\u2019s app, which has deals year-round that many users raved about. \u201cOur area has the 2 for 3.50 mcdouble/chicken, 1.39 any size fountain and free medium fries with 2.00 purchase on the app. so all of that for 4.89 plus tax,\u201d one said. @chefmikeharacz Former #McDonalds corporate chef talks about #Burger Kings $5 value meal. #mcdonaldshacks #McDonaldsTikTok #mcdonaldssecrets #mcdonaldsccsing #mcdonaldschallenge #FYP #mcdonaldsdrivethru #tiktokfood #foodfestontiktok #foodtiktok #fastfood #fastfoodlife #fastfoodstories #food #foodie #foodtok #burgertok \u266c original sound \u2013 Chef Mike Haracz In an email to the Daily Dot, Haracz said he believes the move to be a smart one for Burger King. \u201cThey would like to take market share away from McD while also providing customer\u2019s the better value they are looking for,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are also smart discussing keeping it on the menu longer, actively listening to consumers needs.\u201d And when asked if he intended on pitting the two combo meals in a review face off with each other, Haracz wrote, \u201cI haven\u2019t really done a major review of food items from different QSR\u2019s but I\u2019m sure I could make some comments about it.\u201d The Daily Dot has also reached out to McDonald\u2019s, and Burger King via email for further comment.

But he has never won the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year Award so far in his career. Bam Adebayo is currently a member of Team USA preparing for the Olympics and it was in Las Vegas where he let his frustrations be known regarding his DPOY snubs as per Vincent Goodwill of Yahoo Sports.\n\n\"That's one thing that irks me, it's not my fault I'm versatile,\" Adebayo said. \"I've been top five in DPOY voting the last five years, there's been guys y'all (media) been giving it to over me.\n\n\"A point guard (Marcus Smart) got it over me, a center (Rudy Gobert) got it over me, a power forward (Jaren Jackson Jr.) has gotten it over me.

Some of it is, they don't really care about us and that's fine. I think they should pay attention to consistency because being top five DPOY, I think I have the longest streak of All-Defensive teams so the goalposts move for me.\"\n\nSince the 2019-20 season, Bam Adebayo has been named to the All-Defensive First Team but has not won a DPOY Award. This past season, Adebayo finished third in the Defensive Player of the Year voting behind Rudy Gobert and Victor Wembanyama. Adebayo may have point in that he takes on a larger role on his team than some of these other players have on their respective teams.\n\nAs per Goodwill, Bam Adebayo was in line for a significant contract extension from the Heat, larger than the one he signed, had he won the DPOY award any of the past three seasons. Adebayo recently came to terms on a contract extension with the Heat for three years and $166 million.\n\nBam Adebayo continues to anchor Heat defense\n\nWhile Bam Adebayo may not have a Defensive Player of the Year Award to his name, he's still the glue that holds the Heat's defense together. Simply put, where Adebayo goes, the Heat go. There's a case to be made that he's the Heat's most important player.\n\nAdebayo has significant defensive responsibilities in addition to having to be arguably the key cog in the Heat's offense, a playmaker and a strong rebounder. Of the players who received first place votes for DPOY; Rudy Gobert, Victor Wembanyama, Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday, only Davis has arguably the same level of importance on the court for his team as Adebayo.\n\nThis past season, Adebayo appeared in 71 games at exactly 34 minutes per game. He was named to his third career All-Star selection. He averaged 19.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, 3.9 assists and 1.1 steals with splits of 52.1 percent shooting from the field, 35.7 percent shooting from the three-point line and 75.5 percent shooting from the free-throw line.\n\nThe Heat finished in the play-in for the second straight season.

Adebayo has made the NBA All-Defensive teams in each of the last five seasons, including his first nod to the first team this past season.\n\nHowever, despite being consistently one of the best in the league on that side of the court, Adebayo has always come up short in the Defensive Player of the Year voting. Bam has finished in the Top 5 of the DPOY balloting in each of the last five seasons, including third during the 2023-24 season.\n\nDuring an interview with Yahoo Sports' Vincent Goodwill, the KU product vented his frustration about not winning the award.\n\n\"I've been top-five in DPOY voting the last five years,\" said Bam.\"There's been guys y'all (media) been giving it to over me.\"\n\nBam finished third in last season's DPOY voting\n\nAdebayo was the Heat's 14th overall pick in the 2017 NBA Draft out of the University of Kentucky. The 6'9'' big man began his career coming off the Heat bench. However, after two promising seasons, he was promoted to starter in Year 3, and that's when he emerged as a force on both sides of the floor.\n\nWith Bam as a defensive anchor, Miami has landed in the Top 10 in Defensive rating in each of the last four seasons, including twice in the Top 5. Last season, the Heat were the fifth-best defensive team in the NBA. Adebayo was named among the finalists for the DPOY award, but he finished a far third behind Rudy Gobert and Victor Wembanyama.\n\n\"A point guard (Marcus Smart) got it over me, a center (Rudy Gobert) got it over me, a power forward (Jaren Jackson Jr.) has gotten it over me. The goalposts move for me, in certain degrees. It's me and a lot of undrafted dudes, and we still have a top-five defense. These other guys have All-NBA dudes around them,\" Bam added.\n\nRelated: Kobe Bryant's former bodyguard compared working for him and other NBA stars: \"Kobe was a sit outside-the-gate person\"\n\nAdebayo also lashed out at the All-Star fan-voting\n\nDuring the 2022-23 season, Bam also castigated the voting process for the NBA's All-Star starters. Adebayo had something to say when it was announced that Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, and Kyrie Irving were the 2023 Eastern Conference starters.\n\n\"I'll leave fan voting to fan voting,\" said the Heat star. \"There are guys that shouldn't even be on that list. But it's fan voting. That's what it is, and you got to live with that. I mean, right now I'm in a position where it's based off the coaches in the East. Now that, I'm going to be [upset] about if they tell me somebody else has played better than me this year.\"\n\nThere's no question that Bam has done more on defense than those who beat him for the award in the past five years. With the lineups he played with, he had to do a lot of covering for a lot of players just so the Heat could be a top NBA defense these past five years. Unfortunately for him, it's media votes that determine the DPOY winner, just as it's the fans that choose the All-Star starters.\n\nRelated: Bam Adebayo reveals the two players who he believes are on the same level as him defensively", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shane_garry_acedera@postandcourier.com", "name": "Shane Garry Acedera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wembanyama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victor Wembanyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Smart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Smart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Kentucky", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Kentucky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaren_Jackson_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaren Jackson Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022\u201323_Oklahoma_City_Thunder_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022\u201323 Oklahoma City Thunder season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/c9/0c9512c0-3f27-51d8-9354-89a23686535f/668ff8132b255.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724728", "eventUri": "eng-9724728", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Adebayo is still seething over being repeatedly ignored for award consideration despite anchoring a defense with fewer defensive pieces around him.\n\n\"A point guard (Marcus Smart) got it over me, a center (Rudy Gobert) got it over me, a power forward (Jaren Jackson Jr.) has gotten it over me. The goalposts move for me, to certain degrees. It's me and a lot of undrafted dudes, and we still have a top-five defense. These other guys have All-NBA dudes (around them).\"\n\nAdebayo just wants the goalposts to not be moving all the time.\n\n\"Some of it is, they don't really care about us and that's fine. I think they should pay attention to consistency because being top five DPOY, I think I have the longest streak of All-Defensive teams, so the goalposts move for me.\"\n\nThe calling card behind the Heat's success in the Jimmy Butler era has been defense, as they have been a consistently poor offense that wins games and series on the strength of their defense. That defense is anchored by Bam, who averaged 19.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, 1.1 steals, and 0.9 blocks last season.\n\nPersonally speaking, I had Adebayo as my choice for DPOY in both 2022 and 2023 when he lost out to Marcus Smart and Jaren Jackson Jr. In 2022, the Heat had the best record in the East primarily due to the incredible defensive performances by Adebayo but the Celtics' late-season defensive surge prompted people to favor Smart.\n\nThe Heat were much worse record-wise the next season, but they were still a top-five defense in the NBA. Nonetheless, Adebayo was overlooked for Jaren Jackson Jr., who had a monster season when it came to putting up defensive stats (1.0 steals and 3.0 blocks per game).\n\nErik Spoelstra Went Off On NBA GMs For Not Recognizing Bam Adebayo's Defensive Ability\n\nAhead of the 2023-24 NBA season, the annual NBA GM poll saw no mention of Adebayo when it came to the best defenders in the league. This incensed Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra, who went off over Bam's defense being ignored.\n\n\"That one is just unbelievable to me. I think Bam is the best defensive player in the league and I just can't understand why he's not recognized for how impactful he is on that end of the court. So, he's just going to have to prove it again and just do it this year until everybody notices. I think that's a good award to go for.\"\n\nAdebayo's defensive reputation clearly improved this year as he made his first appearance on the All-Defense First Team. He has made All-Defense every year since 2020, the longest active streak of All-Defense appearances.\n\nWith the emergence of Victor Wembanyama, Adebayo may legitimately never get another shot at winning the award given how close Wembanyama came to winning it as a rookie with over 60 losses on the season.

Mandatory Credit: Sam Navarro-USA TODAY Sports / Sam Navarro-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies have two of the last three Defensive Player of the Year award winners on their roster, but Miami Heat star Bam Adebayo believes he should have at least one of them. Speaking with Vince Goodwill of Yahoo Sports, Adebayo blasted the NBA media for moving the goalposts.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153A point guard (Marcus Smart) got it over me, a center (Rudy Gobert) got it over me, a power forward (Jaren Jackson Jr.) has gotten it over me,\u00e2\u20ac Adebayo told Yahoo Sports. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The goalposts move for me, in certain degrees.

I think they should pay attention to consistency because being top five DPOY, I think I have the longest streak of All-Defensive teams, so the goalposts move for me.\"\n\nIt is certainly fair for Adebayo to feel this way, as he carries one of the biggest defensive responsibilities in all of basketball. That said, there are a lot of really talented defenders in the NBA, making it hard to select one Defensive Player of the Year each season. For Adebayo, he does not yet have a Defensive Player of the Year award, but does have five All-Defensive selections.\n\nMemphis Grizzlies Projected to Acquire Intriguing Ja Morant Backup\n\nCleveland Cavaliers Star Named 'Ambitious' Trade Target for Memphis Grizzlies", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaseya_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kaseya Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2023 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Smart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Smart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Grizzlies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memphis Grizzlies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaren_Jackson_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaren Jackson Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ja_Morant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ja Morant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4800,h_2700,x_0,y_56/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_grizzlies/01j2fn60tyv0e2k1rr2s.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724728", "eventUri": "eng-9724728", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

So you're kind of leaning on one another to get used to it.\n\n\"Going into it, it's not about yourself.\"\n\nAdebayo and Team USA are now off for a series of pre-Olympic exhibitions, starting Monday in Abu Dhabi against Australia.\n\nAdebayo's Team USA experience is being shared with Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, who is assisting Kerr. The week also included a scrimmage against a USA Select Team that featured second-year Heat guard Jaime Jaquez Jr., who remained in Las Vegas to join the Heat's summer-league team.\n\nFor Adebayo the Las Vegas stay was a whirlwind, starting on Saturday with the signing of a three-year, $166 million extension that now has him under contract to the Heat for the next five seasons.\n\nAmong those in Las Vegas with Adebayo when he signed his extension was his mother, Marylin Blount.\n\n\"It's a very surreal moment,\"Adebayo said of having his mother alongside at the signing, \"because you go back to the situations of where we come from, you go back to situations of life where my mom was at one point, where I was at one point, and to have this generational wealth . . . at this point, it's not about me, it's about hopefully when I have little Bams.\"\n\nSpoelstra also was alongside at the signing.\n\n\"It's hard to do, in today's day and age of pro sports, to be able to have continuity,\" Spoelstra said. \"And we believe in continuity and finding the right people and finding a way to keep them. And he's earned it.\n\n\"He's a caretaker now for this culture. He carries the baton, now and into the future. And it's just really special to see that. I've treasured the time and I'm really appreciative that we have Bam.\"\n\nNext up is coach and center in dual search for gold.\n\n\"Coming from where I come from, this isn't an opportunity you take for granted,\" Adebayo said of the extension. \"You understand where you want to be. You understand what type of culture this is. And the head coach I have, you want to be a part of what he's doing for as long as you can.\"\n\nJaquez was added to the Heat's summer roster on Wednesday, with the expectation of playing in the first two games of the Heat's schedule in Las Vegas, expected to practice with the summer roster for the first time Friday.\n\nHeat assistant Dan, who is guiding the team's summer roster, embraced the opportunity.\n\n\"Jaime obviously winning (first-team) All-Rookie team, having a great first season, he's one of those guys where it doesn't matter if he's had a practice, if he's had four practices, he meshes extremely well,\" Bisaccio said. \"He's a great teammate first, above everything. He's a competitor. He's a tough, hard-nosed player, so we're extremely excited to get him implemented.\"\n\nBisaccio said the opportunity is there for summer growth, even in the wake of Jaquez's breakout season from the No. 18 selection out of UCLA in the 2023 NBA draft.\n\n\"With summer league, especially with our guys that are playing for the second year, we're looking to see if they can improve on a few things. We have certain goals we're looking for Jaime to do, and we're excited for him to take the challenge.\"\n\nJaquez after his rookie season cited individual defense and 3-point shooting as targeted offseason growth areas. Bisaccio said among the summer focus points with Jaquez will be improved reads on offense.", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SunSentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ira_winderman@sun-sentinel.com", "name": "Ira Winderman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Spoelstra", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Erik Spoelstra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canada-US-Basketball-Olympics-1.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724728", "eventUri": "eng-9724728", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

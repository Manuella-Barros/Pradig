The Best in the World then talked about the audience during his return to the company, claiming he could not hear anything. He further stated that the crowd's cheers made him feel like he was having a stroke:\n\n\"Selfishly, I have to say that Chicago is always the loudest place, but that goes back to me being a little kid and being fortunate enough to see hockey games in the old Chicago Stadium before they blew that up and turned it into a parking lot. Allstate Arena, when I came back at Survivor Series, I couldn't hear Living Color. I couldn't hear anything. It was white noise. I thought I was having a stroke. Turns out, I wasn't.

He fractured my elbow. Broken bones in it. You know what I did the next day? I wrestled in a four-way match, and I would have won if it wasn't for CM Punk. I've been taping up every week.

Since then, The Second City Saint has become a key figure in WWE, embedding himself into its current narrative and adding to the excitement surrounding the company's direction.\n\nIn an interview on Countdown to WWE Backlash France, CM Punk talked about the enthusiasm of the Chicago crowd, humorously admitting that he \"selfishly\" regards Chicago as the best audience.\n\nRecalling his return to WWE in November 2023, CM Punk described the crowd's roar as so intense that it felt like he was experiencing a stroke, hearing only white noise.\n\n\"Selfishly, I have to say Chicago is always the loudest place. It probably goes back to when I was a kid, seeing hockey games at the old Chicago Stadium before they demolished it and built a parking lot. At the Allstate Arena, when I came back at Survivor Series, I couldn't hear Living Color. I couldn't hear anything. It was just white noise. I thought I was having a stroke. It turned out I wasn't -- it was just a really, really loud crowd happy to see me.\"\n\nCM Punk even revealed who reached out to him for his WWE return. Regardless, Punk is still waiting to make his in-ring return as he recovers from his triceps injury, so we'll have to see when Punk will return to in-ring action.\n\nAre you enjoying CM Punk's run in WWE so far?

This resulted in suspensions for all parties involved in 2022. Punk's time in AEW brought attention to his backstage behavior. WWE producer Shane Helms shared his experience working with CM Punk in WWE.\n\nIn an interview with Behind the Turnbuckle, Helms mentioned that he hasn't heard anything negative about Punk's behavior in WWE. He stated, \"In terms of Phil backstage, he's been a pleasure since he's been back. I didn't have problems with him to begin with, so I'm not surprised he's been a pleasure with me, but I haven't heard anything bad, either.\"\n\nFurthermore, he expressed surprise at CM Punk's WWE return, citing past disagreements and controversies during Punk's absence as reasons he didn't expect the comeback. He also reflected on personal growth and how people's views can change over time.\n\nUpdate on CM Punk's situation in WWE headquarters\n\nWhile WWE was enjoying the premium live event Backlash in France, CM Punk, one of their biggest stars, was stuck in WWE headquarters in the US.

I got lost. There are too many places to hide out. Anyway, to answer all of your questions, I am still here.\"\n\nCM Punk appears to be having fun with the fans following this situation.

He worked out in the gym, contemplated living there, and amused himself with exploring the building while evading detection. Punk's playful personality shone through as he embraced the absurd situation, leaving fans wondering how long he'll keep the fun going.\n\nWWE superstar CM Punk found himself in an unexpected situation following the Backlash pre-show at WWE Headquarters. Taking to Instagram in a series of stories he posted, Punk explained how he got locked in a bathroom after changing out of his suit from the Backlash pre-show with Jackie Redmond and Big E. Punk was inadvertently left behind as everyone else left for the night. Now, what started as a simple mishap turned into an amusing saga as Punk remained unnoticed and decided to turn it into an epic saga.\n\nWith no one around to rescue him, Punk said he missed his flight home and found himself with time to kill. Noting he was curious to see how long it would take for anyone to notice there was someone still in the building, he had no idea who worked on weekends. So, in a series of Instagram stories, he humorously chronicled his adventures as he roamed the halls of WWE HQ, likening himself to the Phantom of the Opera.\n\nPunk's escapades included sneaking around the WWE gym and getting in a workout, contemplating becoming a permanent resident of the headquarters, and even stumbling upon a door labeled \"Executive Wellness,\" which he amusingly remarked sounded \"really fancy.\" Despite his predicament (not sure if this is real or staged), Punk maintained his sense of humor throughout the ordeal, talking about his \"bed head\" and \"same clothes\" as he continued to evade detection. He checked out some of the posters on the walls, hit the Andre the Giant statue in the groin, and got into other mischief.\n\nRelated Video: CM Punk Trends, AEW Scrambles After Tony Khan Airs All In Footage CM Punk trends after AEW chooses to air Punk and Jack Perry footage.\n\nThis Is CM Punk Being A Total Goofball\n\nThe situation provided fans with a glimpse into Punk's playful personality, as he embraced the absurdity of the situation and made the most of his unexpected extended stay at WWE Headquarters. He suggested he might stay there for Raw on Monday so it will be interesting to see if WWE airs some of this footage on the show.\n\nAs Punk's antics continued to entertain fans on social media, the question remains: how long will he run with these videos and would anyone at WWE HQ notice the former superstar's presence before he decided to make himself known?", "source": {"uri": "thesportster.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheSportster"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jim_parsons@thesportster.com", "name": "Jim Parsons", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WWE Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CM_Punk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CM Punk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heavyweight_Championship_(WWE,_2002\u20132013)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Heavyweight Championship (WWE, 2002\u20132013)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Danielson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Danielson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEW_World_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AEW World Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_Jacob_Friedman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maxwell Jacob Friedman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlash_(2009)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Backlash (2009)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECW_World_Heavyweight_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ECW World Heavyweight Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROH_World_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ROH World Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROH_World_Tag_Team_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ROH World Tag Team Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Tag_Team_Championship_(WWE)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Tag Team Championship (WWE)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Cena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Intercontinental_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WWE Intercontinental Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_Towers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Titan Towers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_E_(wrestler)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big E (wrestler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle_Boy_(wrestler)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jungle Boy (wrestler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Elite_Wrestling", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All Elite Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9_the_Giant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9 the Giant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Niche", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Niche", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Punk", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Punk", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Guts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Guts", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cm-punk-lost-wwe-hq.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539953", "eventUri": "eng-9539953", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1999-03-13", "textStart": 249, "textEnd": 259}], "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

He has wrestled both men dozens of times and teamed up with them. Speaking on his Extreme Life podcast, Hardy talked about why Punk vs. McIntyre can main event a premium live event with no titles involved as the personal grudge makes it a big deal.\n\n\"The entertainment that has been built between these two competitors is what is gonna make this match. It's not having great matches on the road to this blow-off match, it is the entertainment factor between these two guys. Drew has been super entertaining, Punk has been super entertaining, and now there's a legit beef, there's something personal between these two - a rivalry.

It was just a really, really loud crowd that was happy to see me.\"\n\nCM Punk is currently out of action with a tricep tear but that hasn't stopped him from being a menace in the life of Drew McIntyre.", "source": {"uri": "fightful.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fightful.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CM_Punk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CM Punk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Survivor Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allstate_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allstate Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_WarGames_(2021)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NXT WarGames (2021)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Backlash", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WWE Backlash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White noise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_McIntyre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drew McIntyre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Stadium"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games/Thumb_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games/Thumb Wrestling", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://imageservice-prod.jv-internal.com/2/stream?domain=fightful-frontend-prod.jv-internal.com&path=/134964_maxresdefault_1714842251.jpg&op=crop&w=1200&h=800", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539953", "eventUri": "eng-9539953", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

CM Punk was part of the Backlash pre-show, but after the pre-show was over, Punk posted several stories to Instagram that revealed he was stuck inside WWE Headquarters. Punk said that after going to change out of his suit from the pre-show in the bathroom, he ended up locked inside, and once he got out everybody was gone. That left him to explore the building while posting to social media, and the results were delightful (via Fightful).\n\nOn Instagram Punk said, \"Okay this is what's legitimately happening. I got done doing the pre-show, and I got locked inside a bathroom while I was changing out of my suit. Nice suit by the way. DanielGeorge.com. He's in Chicago. And by the time I got out of the bathroom, everybody's gone.\"\n\n\"So I'm literally in, I don't know what you call this anymore. Titan Towers? Titan Towers II? Headquarters? But I'm here, and I figured since I was here I might try to pull some Phantom of the Opera s*** and see how long it takes somebody to notice that I am in fact here. I don't know what the employee work schedule is, I don't know who works at what time, and there are a lot of doors you need a keycard for, and I don't have a keycard,\" Punk said.\n\n\"Sorry I got cut off. I didn't know there was a time limit on these things, but anyway, I'm in the gym now. Figured since I got stuck here and might miss my flight, I'm gonna work out. And then I'm going to wander around and see what sort of trouble I can cause. Hopefully, no one who works here is watching this online or on social media, that would be a big mistake on my part,\" Punk said.\n\nThen Punk ended up in another section of the building with photos on the wall, and then made his way into the green room with his stuff. He then found a wall with Roxanne Perez's image on the wall alongside Trick Williams, displaying that they were the NXT Champions. He closed out this unexpected tour by finding the Andre the Giant statue and giving it a tap.\n\nThe fact that Punk got locked in the building is hilarious on its own, but the fact that he took fans along for the ride during his unexpected tour was the icing on the cake. As for Backlash, you can find the full results below.\n\nUndisputed WWE Championship: Cody Rhodes (C) def. AJ Styles World Heavyweight Championship: Damian Priest (C) def.

Soon, McIntyre said, he'll show up in Chicago and handle things the grown way.\n\n\"And right now it's 'Oh, you look like a big dumb idiot chasing CM Punk,' and I was saying 'Mate, get in my face,\" Drew McIntyre said. \"You screwed me at the World Title at WrestleMania, just face me like a man, you're playing games where I'm chasing you around.' No, like who's the coward here? Who's the, again, PG, 'p word' here? He is.\n\n\"So if I look like an idiot chasing him around, fair enough,\" McIntyre said. \"But he's not willing to fight me like a man. I'm not going to end up showing up to his doorstep. He embarrassed me at WrestleMania, it was 5 minutes and 46 seconds, by the way, I had the title for before he cheated me out of it. Now I'm getting ready to show up to Chicago like I don't know where he lives, and start smacking him around.

He referenced his own fractured elbow that he suffered at WrestleMania 40. McIntyre stated said he's been working the entire time, all while Punk at sat home and took paychecks, according to him.\n\n\"You know what happened at Mania when [CM Punk] attacked me from behind and swept my legs out? He fractured my elbow. Broken bones in it,\" said McIntyre. \"You know what I did the next day? I wrestled in a four-way match, and I would have won if it wasn't for CM Punk.\n\n\"I've been taping up every week. I did a European tour where I wrestled Jey Uso every single night.

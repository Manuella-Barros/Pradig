Season 86 women's volleyball Final Four on Sunday night, May 5, at the Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay City.\n\nIn front of a mammoth crowd of 19,505, the Espa\u00f1a-based squad took all its chances and made the strongest case of possibly earning the coveted collegiate title.\n\nThe Golden Tigresses will be making their first finals appearance in five years as they await the winner between top seed National University and Far Eastern University as they both resume their quest for gold in a do-or-die semifinal clash on Wednesday, May 8.\n\nExactly five years ago on May 5, 2019, UST defeated La Salle in their Final Four showdown to secure its final seat.\n\nAll that was possible again five years later as outside hitter Poyos scattered a game-high 28 points on 25 kills, one block and two service aces to help UST finish on top of La Salle time and again this season.\n\nJonna Perdido contributed 18 markers highlighted by 16 attacks as she continued her particularly exceptional showing against the Lady Spikers.\n\nIn as many encounters, La Salle just couldn't solve the UST puzzle as it continued to be left with a bitter taste to its mouth all season long.\n\nWith the game back to square one as the sets were locked at 2-2, the Lady Spikers crumbled under pressure and trailed by as many as 5-11 in the fifth and final set.\n\nFrom then on, everything just simply fell into place for the UST side as it cruised to the victory.\n\nReigning Most Valuable Player Angel Canino, who was back for her second game with La Salle after five absences due to a right arm injury, finished with 16 points in the losing cause.\n\nSans Canino and with her in the rotation, Shevana Laput paced La Salle for the last time this season with a team-high 20 points highlighted by 18 sharp attacks,

Now, the opportunity to win another championship since 2010 has presented itself for the Tigresses.\n\nWhile the Lady Spikers were a little bit shaky, the UST offense was well-oiled in the first set as Poyos and Perdido alternated in attacking the La Salle floor along with Jurado.\n\nPerdido's block on the much taller Thea Gagate and Jurado's cut shot put them in a favorable position, 11-6, and amazingly took control from there.\n\nEm Banagua was momentarily pulled out with UST still leading by five after straining her left knee anew, an injury that sidelined the middle blocker for most of the second round.\n\nREAD: Behind UST's unbeaten start in UAAP volleyball: The 'fantastic' coaching staff\n\nThe Tigresses briefly allowed a 4-0 run by their rivals, but a Perdido crosscourt strike found a lonely space between two defenders before Poyos cleaned it up with an off-the-block smash in front of Julyana Tolentino.\n\nPulled off the bench, Jyne Soreno energized the Lady Spikers, pouring most of her hits in a 10-0 blistering rally that propelled them to equalize after two sets.\n\nWith majority of her points coming from blocks, Soreno conspired with Gagate in shutting down UST's firepower, making the left pin impenetrable where Poyos and Perdido were situated at the net.\n\nShevana Laput then widened the gap with a flush and ended the set with a crosscourt bomb, made easier by the errors of Bianca Plaza and Renee Penafiel.\n\nIt was a fierce, emotional roller-coaster in the third set, but the Tigresses managed to come out unscathed with Cassie Carballo presiding over simple plays that worked in favor of Poyos and Jurado.\n\nAngel Canino tied the count at 19 with an off-speed spike but erred in the ensuing sequence, allowing a perfectly timed rally that the Tigresses exploited.\n\nJurado cashed in on a combination pattern and followed it up with a piercing crosscourt blow, after which Poyos again took over with successive off-the-block attacks punctuated by an ace.\n\nLaput maximized her 6-foot-2 length to the hilt, towering above the blockers in a dazzling La Salle breakaway in the fourth set.\n\nLaput found the back row twice with timely hits from the middle and added an off-speed attack that created the distance the Lady Spikers needed.\n\nCanino and Soreno sustained the efforts of Laput by knocking down sharp down-the-line spikes as they kept the Tigresses out of reach.\n\nPoyos then committed two quick attack errors and Gagate saw another open space at set point, pushing the encounter to the limit.\n\nFlipping the script\n\nBut the Tigresses couldn't be denied, extinguishing whatever fire the Lady Spikers had in them in the final set with Poyos showcasing her super rookie tag in a collective effort with Jurado, Banagua and Carballo.\n\nPoyos unleashed a down-the-line hit that kicked off a 6-0 run capped by a Banagua power tip.\n\nAmie Provido stopped La Salle's bleeding with a quick swipe, but Poyos and Banagua were joined by Perdido in closing out the defending champions.\n\nCarballo had 26 aces so far in the tournament, but her last one was the most important at match point.\n\n\"When I entered the court, I was reminded that it was also on May 5 that we won in the Final Four and entered the Finals five years ago. This time, we intend to change the result,'' said Reyes.\n\nLaput led the Lady Spikers with 20 points while Gagate had 16 on top of six blocks and Canino added 12 attacks out for 14 points but these heroics weren't enough for them remain on course for a repeat act in the finals.", "source": {"uri": "sports.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "june_navarro@sports.inquirer.net", "name": "June Navarro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_La_Salle_Lady_Spikers_volleyball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "De La Salle Lady Spikers volleyball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_La_Salle_Green_Archers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "De La Salle Green Archers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UST_Growling_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UST Growling Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Athletic_Association_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University Athletic Association of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Santo_Tomas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Santo Tomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volleyball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_four", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Final four"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_format", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoff format"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FEU_Tamaraws", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FEU Tamaraws"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ateneo_Blue_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ateneo Blue Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_put", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shot put"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Canino", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angel Canino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.C._Penafiel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "F.C.

This year's team features the league's best setter and server, Cassie Carballo, and two lefty hitters who bedeviled the Lady Spikers into surrendering their title -- Jonna Perdido and Reg Jurado.\n\n\"I have a feeling that we can bring the crown back to Espa\u00f1a if we remain hardworking in all our trainings and games,\" Perdido said, referring to the boulevard fronting their school's historic campus. Perdido finished with 18 points as she again tormented La Salle with her attacking.\n\nAnd like that 2010 squad, the current Tigresses have enough talent in their young roster, led by the inimitable Poyos, who finished with 28 points on Sunday. \"I'm happy because this is my first season and I'm grateful that we carried ourselves ... to the Finals,\" said Poyos, whose total was built around 25 kills, two aces and a block.\n\nThe Tigresses, despite having one of the smallest attack corps in the league, burst out of the gates blazing, winning their first eight games and holding on to first place until getting stunned by Far Eastern University (FEU) late in the second round.\n\nBut UST kept its poise and negated its lack of height with excellent court coverage and a variety of attacks. A loss to National University (NU) had the team on the edge, but the Tigresses bounced back strong with a four-set win over La Salle to close out the elimination round with the No. 2 seed and twice-to-beat protection.\n\nThe Tigresses did not have to fish out that card.\n\nUST has one of the youngest rosters in the league, with Detdet Pepito, the team's captain and chief libero, having the most UAAP experience as a junior.\n\nMost of the names on the roster are freshmen and sophomores.\n\n\"We proved ourselves to doubters, right in our very first game,\"Pepito said.\n\nNone of the Tigresses were around the last time UST made the Finals in 2019, where the school lost to a tall Ateneo squad in a series that went the distance.\n\nThat time, UST also ousted La Salle in the Final Four.\n\n\"People say history repeated itself,\" UST coach KungFu Reyes said. \"This time, we hope to change the result. We just have to work hard. And then maybe, we can get lucky in the Finals.\"\n\nUST had to wait for its Finals opponent after FEU dragged NU to a deciding duel in their half of the semifinal duel. The top seed Lady Bulldogs and No. 4 Lady Tamaraws face off on Wednesday for the last championship berth.\n\nThe Tigresses will use the waiting period to get even better.\n\n\"We're here anyway, might as well give it our all,\" Reyes said. \"We will pour everything that we have left.

That motivates us,\" said La Salle's CJ Austria, who won the tournament's Most Valuable Player award.\n\nJust a few months ago, La Salle captured the men's 5-on-5 basketball championship, while UST also did the same in the women's side.\n\nDown by as many as 7 points early, La Salle stormed back against the upset-seeking UE Red Warriors, 17-16, to retain the men's 3\u00d73 title.\n\nAustria dropped 5 points in the finale, while Rookie of the Year Jonnel Policarpio posted 8 markers to help the Archers survive the thriller.\n\n\"I feel like this tells about our system in La Salle and the training we constantly do,\" Austria added.\n\nEarl Abadam also provided La Salle some spark with 3 points, but none bigger than his final jumper that proved to be the dagger.\n\n\"It's really a big jump from winning in the 5-on-5 to the 3-on-3 championship, but this tournament showed the confidence in ourselves and the trust that we have for each other,\" said Abadam.\n\n\"Every league, we try go as hard as we can. There are no breaks, no rest so [we try] to win as much as we can,\" he added.\n\nOn the distaff side, the UST Growling Tigresses defended their 3\u00d73 crown, escaping with a 21-18 decision over the NU Lady Bulldogs, whom they also defeated last December for the women's 5-on-5 crown.\n\nJust like in the full-court stage, UST leaned on Kent Pastrana, who notched 11 points to be named the MVP of the women's tournament.\n\nPastrana went perfect in her championship-clinching free throws as the Tigresses reached 21 first to bag back-to-back halfcourt titles.\n\n\"All of us, the entire team from the 5-on-5, want another championship this season. It's something we promised, and I'm glad we delivered,\" said Pastrana.\n\nGraduating Tantoy Ferrer, meanwhile, added 8 points, to end her UAAP career with championships in both basketball disciplines.\n\n\"This is such a perfect ending for me in UST,\" Ferrer said in Filipino. \"We all trusted the system and each other.

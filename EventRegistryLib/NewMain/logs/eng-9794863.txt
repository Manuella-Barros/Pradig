American sprinter Brittany Brown was third.\n\nThomas finished in 21.83 seconds to add a gold to the bronze she took home in the event from Tokyo three years ago. The 27-year-old Harvard graduate, who has a Masters in public health, took the lead for good at the curve and was never challenged in the final stretch. She grabbed her head with both hands after winning.\n\nCole Hocker, meanwhile, pulled the upset of the track meet with a stunning victory in the 1,500 meters.\n\nHocker outraced favorites Jakob Ingebrigtsen and Josh Kerr to the finish line in an Olympic record 3 minutes 27.65 seconds. He pulled from fifth to first over the final 300 meters to beat his personal best by more than 3 seconds.\n\nHe beat Kerr by .14 seconds, while Ingebrigtsen, who set the pace through the first 1200 meters, ended up in fourth behind American Yared Nuguse.\n\nAnnette Nneka Echikunwoke won a silver in the women's hammer throw.\n\nA look at other events from Day 11 of the Paris Olympics:\n\nKhelif advances to gold medal match\n\nBoxer Imane Khelif of Algeria advanced to the gold-medal bout in the women's welterweight division with a semifinal victory.\n\nKhelif defeated Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand 5:0 in the semifinals at Roland Garros, where the crowd roared and chanted her name throughout her three-round fight. Khelif has won three consecutive bouts in Paris, and she will win either a gold or a silver medal when she completes the tournament on Friday.\n\nShe has faced scrutiny during these Games over misconceptions about her gender.\n\nKhelif had already clinched Algeria's first medal in women's boxing before she stepped into the ring to rousing roars at Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nWith one more victory, Khelif would win Algeria's second boxing gold medal, joining Hocine Soltani (1996).\n\nUS women's soccer team to play for gold\n\nThe United States women's soccer team advanced to the gold-medal game and will make its sixth appearance in the Olympic final following a 1-0 win over Germany.\n\nSophia Smith broke a scoreless game in extra time by outmaneuvering defender Felicitas Rauch and German goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger. It was Smith's third goal of the tournament.\n\nThe Americans are undefeated in France under new coach Emma Hayes and are vying for their fifth Olympic gold medal. They will play Brazil for the gold.\n\nThey U.S. Women's National Team missed out on the finals at the last two Olympic tournaments. They were eliminated in the quarterfinals in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro and relegated to the bronze-medal match at the Tokyo Games three years ago.\n\nUS women's volleyball team advances\n\nThe reigning Olympic champion U.S. women's volleyball team posted a straight-set victory against Poland to advance to the semifinals in Paris.\n\nThe Americans next play powerhouse Brazil on Thursday.\n\nThe Americans made a lineup change after the team's five-set defeat to China on July 29 to open group stage play, moving veterans Jordan Larson and Kelsey Robinson Cook to reserve roles and bringing in Avery Skinner and Kathryn Plummer. The Americans bounced back to beat Serbia two days later.\n\nTeen wins skateboarding gold\n\nA 14-year-old won the women's park skateboarding and knew she had a podium locked up as soon as she nailed her final run.\n\nArisa Trew of Australia scored a 93.18 on her final but still had an excruciating wait to see which step on the podium she'd stand on. Only when a 92.63 popped up for Japan's Cocona Hiraki to end the competition did Trew knew she was taking home gold.\n\nAt 14 years and 88 days old, Trew became the youngest Australian to win a medal. The previous youngest was Sandra Morgan, who was 14 years and 184 days old when she won gold in the women's 4x100 freestyle relay in 1956.\n\nWrestler goes out on top\n\nMijain Lopez concluded his career at the top, retiring after winning the 130-kilogram final for his fifth consecutive gold medal in Greco-Roman wrestling.\n\nThe 41-year-old Cuban defeated Yasmani Acosta Fernandez of Chile 6-0. It made him the first Olympian to win gold in an event in five straight Games.\n\nFollowing the match, he placed his shoes in the center of the mat, symbolizing his retirement.\n\nAt the last Olympics, Lopez became the first male wrestler to win four gold medals when he dominated in Tokyo, blowing through the field unscored upon in four matches.\n\nPerfect 10 in diving\n\nQuan Hongchan of China won her second gold medal in diving competition at these Games and did it by scoring a perfect 10 on the first of her five dives.\n\nThe dive was a forward 3 1/2 somersaults and hardly made a ripple as she set off wild cheers from Chinese fans as the seven judges all registered scores of 10.\n\nThe 17-year-old, a three-time world champion, said she has scored 10 three times before -- including twice while winning gold in Tokyo.\n\nThe two Chinese women teamed up earlier to win the 10-meter synchronized.\n\nBrazil upset in beach volleyball\n\nTop-ranked David Ahman and Jonatan Hellvig of Sweden jump-set their way into the beach volleyball semifinals by beating Evandro and Arthur of Brazil at the Eiffel Tower Stadium.\n\nBrazil's loss means the sport's spiritual home will not win a men's medal for the second straight Olympics. The Brazilian men took gold in Rio de Janeiro and Athens and three other medals in between.\n\nSeine River water concerns cancel marathon swim test\n\nA test run meant to allow athletes to familiarize themselves with the marathon swimming course in the Seine River was canceled over concerns about water quality in the Paris waterway.\n\nWorld Aquatics made the decision to cancel the exercise at an early morning meeting. Fluctuating bacteria levels in the long-polluted waterway have been a constant concern throughout the Games with the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming events both planned in the river.\n\nAnother marathon swimming test event is scheduled for Wednesday, and organizers will decide early that morning whether it will go forward. The women's marathon swim competition is set for Thursday, while the men are scheduled to race Friday.\n\nThe triathlon mixed relay event was held in the river this week. World Triathlon released data showing that when the triathletes swam, the levels of fecal bacteria E. coli and enterococci were within acceptable levels for the length of the triathlon relay course.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

American sprinter Brittany Brown was third.\n\nThomas finished in 21.83 seconds to add a gold to the bronze she took home in the event from Tokyo three years ago. The 27-year-old Harvard graduate, who has a Masters in public health, took the lead for good at the curve and was never challenged in the final stretch. She grabbed her head with both hands after winning.\n\nCole Hocker, meanwhile, pulled the upset of the track meet with a stunning victory in the 1,500 meters.\n\nHocker outraced favorites Jakob Ingebrigtsen and Josh Kerr to the finish line in an Olympic record 3 minutes 27.65 seconds. He pulled from fifth to first over the final 300 meters to beat his personal best by more than 3 seconds.\n\nHe beat Kerr by .14 seconds, while Ingebrigtsen, who set the pace through the first 1200 meters, ended up in fourth behind American Yared Nuguse.\n\nAnnette Nneka Echikunwoke won a silver in the women's hammer throw.\n\nKhelif advances to gold medal match\n\nBoxer Imane Khelif of Algeria advanced to the gold-medal bout in the women's welterweight division with a semifinal victory.\n\nKhelif defeated Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand 5-0 in the semifinals at Roland Garros, where the crowd roared and chanted her name throughout her three-round fight. Khelif has won three consecutive bouts in Paris, and she will win either a gold or a silver medal when she completes the tournament on Friday.\n\nShe has faced scrutiny during these Games over misconceptions about her gender.\n\nKhelif had already clinched Algeria's first medal in women's boxing before she stepped into the ring to rousing roars at Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nWith one more victory, Khelif would win Algeria's second boxing gold medal, joining Hocine Soltani (1996).\n\nUS women's football team to play for gold\n\nThe United States women's football team advanced to the gold-medal game and will make their sixth appearance in the Olympic final following a 1-0 win over Germany.\n\nSophia Smith broke a scoreless game in extra time by outmaneuvering defender Felicitas Rauch and German goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger. It was Smith's third goal of the tournament.\n\nThe Americans are undefeated in France under new coach Emma Hayes and are vying for their fifth Olympic gold medal. They will play Brazil for the gold.\n\nThe US Women's National Team missed out on the finals at the last two Olympic tournaments. They were eliminated in the quarter-finals in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro and relegated to the bronze-medal match at the Tokyo Games three years ago.\n\nUS women's volleyball team advances\n\nThe reigning Olympic champion US women's volleyball team posted a straight-set victory against Poland to advance to the semifinals in Paris.\n\nThe Americans next play powerhouse Brazil on Thursday.\n\nThe Americans made a lineup change after the team's five-set defeat to China on July 29 to open group stage play, moving veterans Jordan Larson and Kelsey Robinson Cook to reserve roles and bringing in Avery Skinner and Kathryn Plummer. The Americans bounced back to beat Serbia two days later.\n\nTeen wins skateboarding gold\n\nA 14-year-old won the women's park skateboarding and knew she had a podium locked up as soon as she nailed her final run.\n\nArisa Trew of Australia scored a 93.18 on her final but still had an excruciating wait to see which step on the podium she'd stand on. Only when a 92.63 popped up for Japan's Cocona Hiraki to end the competition did Trew knew she was taking home gold.\n\nAt 14 years and 88 days old, Trew became the youngest Australian to win a medal. The previous youngest was Sandra Morgan, who was 14 years and 184 days old when she won gold in the women's 4x100 freestyle relay in 1956.\n\nWrestler goes out on top\n\nMijain Lopez concluded his career at the top, retiring after winning the 130-kilogram final for his fifth consecutive gold medal in Greco-Roman wrestling.\n\nThe 41-year-old Cuban defeated Yasmani Acosta Fernandez of Chile 6-0. It made him the first Olympian to win gold in an event in five straight Games.\n\nFollowing the match, he placed his shoes in the center of the mat, symbolizing his retirement.\n\nAt the last Olympics, Lopez became the first male wrestler to win four gold medals when he dominated in Tokyo, blowing through the field unscored upon in four matches.\n\nPerfect 10 in diving\n\nQuan Hongchan of China won her second gold medal in diving competition at these Games and did it by scoring a perfect 10 on the first of her five dives.\n\nThe dive was a forward 3 1/2 somersaults and hardly made a ripple as she set off wild cheers from Chinese fans as the seven judges all registered scores of 10.\n\nThe 17-year-old, a three-time world champion, said she has scored 10 three times before -- including twice while winning gold in Tokyo.\n\nThe two Chinese women teamed up earlier to win the 10-meter synchronized.\n\nBrazil upset in beach volleyball\n\nTop-ranked David Ahman and Jonatan Hellvig of Sweden jump-set their way into the beach volleyball semifinals by beating Evandro and Arthur of Brazil at the Eiffel Tower Stadium.\n\nBrazil's loss means the sport's spiritual home will not win a men's medal for the second straight Olympics. The Brazilian men took gold in Rio de Janeiro and Athens and three other medals in between.\n\nSeine River water concerns cancel marathon swim test\n\nA test run meant to allow athletes to familiarize themselves with the marathon swimming course in the Seine River was canceled over concerns about water quality in the Paris waterway.\n\nWorld Aquatics made the decision to cancel the exercise at an early morning meeting. Fluctuating bacteria levels in the long-polluted waterway have been a constant concern throughout the Games with the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming events both planned in the river.\n\nAnother marathon swimming test event is scheduled for Wednesday, and organizers will decide early that morning whether it will go forward. The women's marathon swim competition is set for Thursday, while the men are scheduled to race Friday.\n\nThe triathlon mixed relay event was held in the river this week. World Triathlon released data showing that when the triathletes swam, the levels of fecal bacteria E. coli and enterococci were within acceptable levels for the length of the triathlon relay course.",

American sprinter Brittany Brown was third.\n\nThomas finished in 21.83 seconds to add a gold to the bronze she took home in the event from Tokyo three years ago. The 27-year-old Harvard graduate, who has a Masters in public health, took the lead for good at the curve and was never challenged in the final stretch. She grabbed her head with both hands after winning.\n\nCole Hocker, meanwhile, pulled the upset of the track meet with a stunning victory in the 1,500 meters.\n\nHocker outraced favorites Jakob Ingebrigtsen and Josh Kerr to the finish line in an Olympic record 3 minutes 27.65 seconds. He pulled from fifth to first over the final 300 meters to beat his personal best by more than 3 seconds.\n\nHe beat Kerr by .14 seconds, while Ingebrigtsen, who set the pace through the first 1200 meters, ended up in fourth behind American Yared Nuguse.\n\nAnnette Nneka Echikunwoke won a silver in the women's hammer throw.\n\nA look at other events from Day 11 of the Paris Olympics:\n\nUS women's soccer team to play for gold\n\nThe United States women's soccer team advanced to the gold-medal game and will make its sixth appearance in the Olympic final following a 1-0 win over Germany.\n\nSophia Smith broke a scoreless game in extra time by outmaneuvering defender Felicitas Rauch and German goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger. It was Smith's third goal of the tournament.\n\nThe Americans are undefeated in France under new coach Emma Hayes and are vying for their fifth Olympic gold medal. They U.S. Women's National Team missed out on the finals at the last two Olympic tournaments. They were eliminated in the quarterfinals in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro and relegated to the bronze-medal match at the Tokyo Games three years ago.\n\nUS women's volleyball team advances\n\nThe reigning Olympic champion U.S. women's volleyball team posted a straight-set victory against Poland to advance to the semifinals in Paris.\n\nThe Americans next play powerhouse Brazil on Thursday.\n\nThe Americans made a lineup change after the team's five-set defeat to China on July 29 to open group stage play, moving veterans Jordan Larson and Kelsey Robinson Cook to reserve roles and bringing in Avery Skinner and Kathryn Plummer. The Americans bounced back to beat Serbia two days later.\n\nTeen wins skateboarding gold\n\nA 14-year-old won the women's park skateboarding and knew she had a podium locked up as soon as she nailed her final run.\n\nArisa Trew of Australia scored a 93.18 on her final but still had an excruciating wait to see which step on the podium she'd stand on. Only when a 92.63 popped up for Japan's Cocona Hiraki to end the competition did Trew knew she was taking home gold.\n\nAt 14 years and 88 days old, Trew became the youngest Australian to win a medal. The previous youngest was Sandra Morgan, who was 14 years and 184 days old when she won gold in the women's 4x100 freestyle relay in 1956.\n\nWrestler goes out on top\n\nMijain Lopez concluded his career at the top, retiring after winning the 130-kilogram final for his fifth consecutive gold medal in Greco-Roman wrestling.\n\nThe 41-year-old Cuban defeated Yasmani Acosta Fernandez of Chile 6-0.

Fluctuating bacteria levels in the long-polluted waterway have been a constant concern throughout the Games with the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming events both planned in the river.\n\nAnother marathon swimming test event is scheduled for Wednesday, and organizers will decide early that morning whether it will go forward.

American sprinter Brittany Brown was third.\n\nThomas finished in 21.83 seconds to add a gold to the bronze she took home in the event from Tokyo three years ago. The 27-year-old Harvard graduate, who has a Masters in public health, took the lead for good at the curve and was never challenged in the final stretch. She grabbed her head with both hands after winning.\n\nCole Hocker, meanwhile, pulled the upset of the track meet with a stunning victory in the 1,500 meters.\n\nHocker outraced favorites Jakob Ingebrigtsen and Josh Kerr to the finish line in an Olympic record 3 minutes 27.65 seconds.

It was Smith's third goal of the tournament.\n\nThe Americans are undefeated in France under new coach Emma Hayes and are vying for their fifth Olympic gold medal. They U.S. Women\u00b4s National Team missed out on the finals at the last two Olympic tournaments. They were eliminated in the quarterfinals in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro and relegated to the bronze-medal match at the Tokyo Games three years ago.\n\nThe reigning Olympic champion U.S. women\u00b4s volleyball team posted a straight-set victory against Poland to advance to the semifinals in Paris.\n\nThe Americans next play powerhouse Brazil on Thursday.\n\nThe Americans made a lineup change after the team\u00b4s five-set defeat to China on July 29 to open group stage play, moving veterans Jordan Larson and Kelsey Robinson Cook to reserve roles and bringing in Avery Skinner and Kathryn Plummer. The Americans bounced back to beat Serbia two days later.\n\nA 14-year-old won the women's park skateboarding and knew she had a podium locked up as soon as she nailed her final run.\n\nArisa Trew of Australia scored a 93.18 on her final but still had an excruciating wait to see which step on the podium she'd stand on. Only when a 92.63 popped up for Japan\u00b4s Cocona Hiraki to end the competition did Trew knew she was taking home gold.\n\nAt 14 years and 88 days old, Trew became the youngest Australian to win a medal.

The Brazilian men took gold in Rio de Janeiro and Athens and three other medals in between.\n\nA test run meant to allow athletes to familiarize themselves with the marathon swimming course in the Seine River was canceled over concerns about water quality in the Paris waterway.\n\nWorld Aquatics made the decision to cancel the exercise at an early morning meeting. Fluctuating bacteria levels in the long-polluted waterway have been a constant concern throughout the Games with the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming events both planned in the river.\n\nAnother marathon swimming test event is scheduled for Wednesday, and organizers will decide early that morning whether it will go forward.

American sprinter Brittany Brown was third.\n\nThomas finished in 21.83 seconds to add a gold to the bronze she took home in the event from Tokyo three years ago. The 27-year-old Harvard graduate, who has a Masters in public health, took the lead for good at the curve and was never challenged in the final stretch. She grabbed her head with both hands after winning.\n\nCole Hocker, meanwhile, pulled the upset of the track meet with a stunning victory in the 1,500 meters.\n\nHocker outraced favorites Jakob Ingebrigtsen and Josh Kerr to the finish line in an Olympic record 3 minutes 27.65 seconds. He pulled from fifth to first over the final 300 meters to beat his personal best by more than 3 seconds.\n\nHe beat Kerr by .14 seconds, while Ingebrigtsen, who set the pace through the first 1200 meters, ended up in fourth behind American Yared Nuguse.\n\nAnnette Nneka Echikunwoke won a silver in the women's hammer throw.\n\nA look at other events from Day 11 of the Paris Olympics:\n\nUS women's soccer team to play for gold\n\nThe United States women's soccer team advanced to the gold-medal game and will make its sixth appearance in the Olympic final following a 1-0 win over Germany.\n\nSophia Smith broke a scoreless game in extra time by outmaneuvering defender Felicitas Rauch and German goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger. It was Smith's third goal of the tournament.\n\nThe Americans are undefeated in France under new coach Emma Hayes and are vying for their fifth Olympic gold medal. They U.S. Women's National Team missed out on the finals at the last two Olympic tournaments. They were eliminated in the quarterfinals in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro and relegated to the bronze-medal match at the Tokyo Games three years ago.\n\nUS women's volleyball team advances\n\nThe reigning Olympic champion U.S. women's volleyball team posted a straight-set victory against Poland to advance to the semifinals in Paris.\n\nThe Americans next play powerhouse Brazil on Thursday.\n\nThe Americans made a lineup change after the team's five-set defeat to China on July 29 to open group stage play, moving veterans Jordan Larson and Kelsey Robinson Cook to reserve roles and bringing in Avery Skinner and Kathryn Plummer. The Americans bounced back to beat Serbia two days later.\n\nTeen wins skateboarding gold\n\nA 14-year-old won the women's park skateboarding and knew she had a podium locked up as soon as she nailed her final run.\n\nArisa Trew of Australia scored a 93.18 on her final but still had an excruciating wait to see which step on the podium she'd stand on. Only when a 92.63 popped up for Japan's Cocona Hiraki to end the competition did Trew knew she was taking home gold.\n\nAt 14 years and 88 days old, Trew became the youngest Australian to win a medal. The previous youngest was Sandra Morgan, who was 14 years and 184 days old when she won gold in the women's 4x100 freestyle relay in 1956.\n\nWrestler goes out on top\n\nMijain Lopez concluded his career at the top, retiring after winning the 130-kilogram final for his fifth consecutive gold medal in Greco-Roman wrestling.\n\nThe 41-year-old Cuban defeated Yasmani Acosta Fernandez of Chile 6-0. It made him the first Olympian to win gold in an event in five straight Games.\n\nFollowing the match, he placed his shoes in the center of the mat, symbolizing his retirement.\n\nAt the last Olympics, Lopez became the first male wrestler to win four gold medals when he dominated in Tokyo, blowing through the field unscored upon in four matches.\n\nPerfect 10 in diving\n\nQuan Hongchan of China won her second gold medal in diving competition at these Games and did it by scoring a perfect 10 on the first of her five dives.\n\nThe dive was a forward 3 1/2 somersaults and hardly made a ripple as she set off wild cheers from Chinese fans as the seven judges all registered scores of 10.\n\nThe 17-year-old, a three-time world champion, said she has scored 10 three times before -- including twice while winning gold in Tokyo.\n\nThe two Chinese women teamed up earlier to win the 10-meter synchronized.\n\nBrazil upset in beach volleyball\n\nTop-ranked David Ahman and Jonatan Hellvig of Sweden jump-set their way into the beach volleyball semifinals by beating Evandro and Arthur of Brazil at the Eiffel Tower Stadium.\n\nBrazil's loss means the sport's spiritual home will not win a men's medal for the second straight Olympics. The Brazilian men took gold in Rio de Janeiro and Athens and three other medals in between.\n\nSeine River water concerns cancel marathon swim test\n\nA test run meant to allow athletes to familiarize themselves with the marathon swimming course in the Seine River was canceled over concerns about water quality in the Paris waterway.\n\nWorld Aquatics made the decision to cancel the exercise at an early morning meeting. Fluctuating bacteria levels in the long-polluted waterway have been a constant concern throughout the Games with the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming events both planned in the river.\n\nAnother marathon swimming test event is scheduled for Wednesday, and organizers will decide early that morning whether it will go forward. The women's marathon swim competition is set for Thursday, while the men are scheduled to race Friday.\n\nThe triathlon mixed relay event was held in the river this week. World Triathlon released data showing that when the triathletes swam, the levels of fecal bacteria E. coli and enterococci were within acceptable levels for the length of the triathlon relay course.\n\n___\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

American sprinter Brittany Brown was third.\n\nThomas finished in 21.83 seconds to add a gold to the bronze she took home in the event from Tokyo three years ago.

Also, sprinter Gabby Thomas seeks to improve on her 200m bronze from Tokyo, and two-time world medalist DeAnna Price aims for her first podium in three Olympic appearances.\n\nElsewhere, the USWNT competes in the semifinals, the U.S. men's basketball and women's volleyball teams play in the quarterfinals, and on the wrestling mat, 20-year-old American Amit Elor grapples for gold.\n\nBelow, a full breakdown of the top events and athletes to watch on Day 11.\n\nFive finals, including the men's 1500m and women's 200m, headline Day 6 of track and field.\n\nBrimming with talent, world-record potential and big personalities, the men's 1500m final could be the greatest mid-distance race we've seen in decades. It's a must-watch event, regardless of your familiarity with the sport.\n\nAt the center of the hype lies a rare rivalry between Norweigan Jakob Ingebrigtsen, the defending Olympic gold medalist, and Great Britain's reigning world champion Josh Kerr. Kerr's 2023 world-title race plan involved sitting and outkicking Ingebrigtsen in the final stretch, and since then, the two have traded wins -- and barbs -- in the leadup to Paris.\n\nBut that's not all. The U.S. brings perhaps its most talented trio in history: Yared Nuguse, Cole Hocker and and 21-year-old Hobbs Kesler. And don't forget Tokyo silver medalist Timothy Cheruiyot of Kenya, who may be back in form.\n\nWithout Jamaica's Shericka Jackson, the women's 200m appears all but locked up for American Gabby Thomas. The fourth-fastest woman in 200m history won bronze in Tokyo and finished second to Jackson at 2023 Worlds. The 27-year-old Harvard grad will likely have Saint Lucia's Julien Alfred, who stunned in Saturday's 100m final winning gold, on her heels.\n\nTeam USA also has a strong chance to land on the women's hammer podium with 2019 world champion DeAnna Price and reigning national champion Annette Echikunwoke. The pair ranked third and fourth in Sunday's qualifying.\n\nSEE MORE: Track and field preview, Aug. 6: Gabby Thomas goes for first Olympic gold\n\nThe USWNT faces 2016 Rio gold medalist Germany -- a team it beat 4-1 when the teams met in group play -- in the semifinals.\n\nThe Americans beat Australia 2-1 last week to claim Group B, then defeated Japan 1-0 Saturday in the quarterfinals on an extra-time beauty from Trinity Rodman.\n\nGermany barely made it through the quarterfinals in a match decided by penalty kicks.\n\nBrazil and Spain compete in the other semifinal. Spain won their earlier group-play match 2-0, but are without captain Marta who was sent off with a red card in that game.\n\nVictor Wembanyama and France play Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Canada; reigning FIBA World Cup champion Germany faces Giannis Antetokounmpo and Greece; and Nikola Jokic and Serbia take on Australia.\n\nSEE MORE: Basketball preview, Aug. 6: U.S. faces Brazil on men's quarterfinals day\n\nWith reigning Olympic champion Tamyra Mensah-Stock gone after signing a deal with WWE, the U.S. turns to newcomer Amit Elor to defend its title in the women's freestyle 68 kg (149 lbs.) class. She'll wrestle in the gold medal match on Tuesday.\n\nElor, 20, became the youngest U.S woman to compete in wrestling at the Olympics when she took the mat Monday. She's the two-time reigning senior world champion in the non-Olympic 72 kg weight.\n\nAll eyes will also be on Cuba's four-time defending Olympic gold medalist Mijain Lopez in the Greco-Roman 130kg (287 lbs.) class. With a win, he will become the first person in any sport to win the same individual Olympic event five times.\n\nSEE MORE: Wrestling preview, Aug 6: Will USA's Amit Elor and Cuba's Mijain Lopez grab gold?\n\nThe U.S. women's volleyball team squares off against Poland in one of four quarterfinal matches. The Americans are the defending gold medalists.\n\nSEE MORE: Women's volleyball knockout round bracket set: Team USA gets Poland\n\nReigning world champions Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng duel with Switzerland in the women's beach volleyball quarterfinals. In total, the day will include two quarterfinal matches for the men and two for the women.\n\nSEE MORE: Beach volleyball quarterfinals preview: Breaking down Tuesday's matches\n\nThe U.S women's team continues its pursuit of an unprecedented fourth-straight Olympic water polo gold with a quarterfinal match vs. reigning world runner-up Hungary, who lost just one group-stage match in Paris.\n\nMeanwhile, Spain -- the team the Americans beat for gold at the Tokyo Games -- plays Canada. If both teams win out through the bracket, they'll meet in a rematch for the gold medal.\n\nSEE MORE: U.S. women's water polo ready for 'whole new tournament' in quarterfinals\n\nPrimetime in Paris will air on NBC at 8 p.m. ET/8 p.m. PT on Tuesday night. Check local listings for the time in your area.\n\nTuesday night's primetime show will include coverage of women's 10m platform in diving, and in track and field, semis in the men's 400m and women's 400m hurdles, as well as the women's 200m final.", "source": {"uri": "nbcboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But at the same time I know how hard I've fought for it,\" said Thomas, who said had taken inspiration from watching teammates Noah Lyles and Sha'Carri Richardson, and even Alfred in the men's and women's 100m at the weekend.\n\nThere were no complaints from Alfred about missing out on a sprint double.\n\n\"I did feel ready for the 200m tonight,\" she said. \"I feel good, no complaints at all.\"\n\nIt is the first time since the 1976 Montreal Games that no Jamaican sprinters have made the podium of either the women's 100m or 200m.\n\nIn a major track and field upset, American Cole Hocker produced a remarkable surge in the home straight to carry him past pre-race favourites Jakob Ingebrigtsen and Josh Kerr to win the men's 1,500m.\n\n- US v Brazil in women's final -\n\nThe United States and Brazil will do battle for the gold medal in women's football after claiming contrasting wins in Tuesday's last-four ties against Germany and World Cup holders Spain respectively.\n\nThe USA, record four-time women's football gold medallists, are still on course to win the title for the first time since 2012 after beating Germany 1-0 in extra time in Lyon, with Sophia Smith scoring the only goal.\n\nBrazil reached their first Olympic final since 2008 by thrashing the reigning world champions 4-2 in Marseille.\n\nIn other developments, the decision of organisers to cancel a \"familiarisation session\" for marathon swimmers on Tuesday raised questions as to why triathletes were allowed to swim in the Seine the previous day.\n\nOrganisers said Tuesday they were \"very confident\" that the women's and men's 10-kilometre swimming events would take place in the river this week as scheduled.\n\nThe United States top the medals table with 24 golds, two ahead of China while Australia have 13.\n\njw-gj/jc\n\nMore from this section\n\nEnergyCAP Appoints Shawn Lankton as Chief Executive Officer\n\nReformed Gangster Disciples Boss, Harold

The Americans went undefeated in their group, earning the top seed of the medal rounds. Brazil needed a tiebreaker to advance to the quarterfinals but shot 45% from deep during pool play.\n\nAfter defeating Japan on Saturday with a late strike from Trinity Rodman, the American women will face Germany for a spot in the gold medal soccer match. This will be the seventh Olympic semifinal match in eight appearances for the Americans. The U.S. defeated Germany 4-1 in the group stage.\n\nIt will be a busy day for Team USA on the track. Three Americans -- Gabby Thomas, McKenzie Long and Brittany Brown -- have a chance at medaling in the women's 200-meter final, while another three -- Cole Hocker, Yared Nuguse and Hobbs Kessler -- will compete in the men's 1500-meter final. Michael Norman (men's 400-meter race) and Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone (women's 400-meter hurdles) both will have a semifinal race after strong heats on Monday.\n\nSara Hughes and Kelly Cheng -- the last of the American women's or men's duos remaining in beach volleyball -- will face Switzerland's duo in the quarterfinal. Meanwhile, the U.S. women will have an indoor volleyball quarterfinal matchup against fourth-ranked Poland.\n\nA full list of Tuesday's schedule can be found here.\n\nIt's one thing to break a world record. It's another to break it in the qualifying rounds. That was the case for U.S. speed climber Sam Watson. In what was a smooth elevation to the top of the course, Watson climbed his way to quarterfinals qualification in 4.75 seconds, shattering his previous record of 4.79.\n\nFor the past year, Great Britain's Josh Kerr and Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen -- two of the favorites to win the 1,500 meters in Paris -- have exchanged verbal blows and dramatic race finishes. Now the rivalry will take center stage on the biggest stage imaginable, with a prize slightly more prestigious than bragging rights up for grabs: an Olympic gold medal. -- READ MORE\n\nA test run that would allow Olympians to familiarize themselves with the marathon swimming course in the Seine was canceled on Tuesday. World Aquatics came to the conclusion to cancel the run-through due to concerns about the river's quality. World Triathlon released information Tuesday which showed that when the triathletes swam in the Seine Monday, levels of E. coli and enterococci were acceptable.\n\nFreddie Crittenden made a bold call Saturday -- nursing a minor injury ahead of his preliminary heat in the 110-meter hurdles, Crittenden opted to simply jog through his initial heat. The logic? All non-advancing competitors qualify for the repechage (or second-chance) round, which would occur three days later, regardless of their finishing time. Crittenden figured he'd be better off making sure to not tax his body too heavily and go all-in on the repechage.\n\nThe strategy worked. Crittenden blazed through his second-chance heat, advancing to the semifinal round.\n\nBrooklyn Nets guard Dennis Schroder is a problem when he puts on that German national team uniform. Schroder had 13 points off the bench -- including this dagger 3-pointer -- to send Germany on to the semifinals as they knocked out Giannis Antetokounmpo and Greece, 76-63.\n\nRana Raider, the American sprint coach of defending gold medalists Andre De Grasse and Marcell Jacobs, was kicked out of the Paris Games on Tuesday. He was investigated for alleged sexual misconduct by the U.S. Center for SafeSport and placed on a one-year probation that ended in May. He was granted accreditation for the Summer Games by the Canadian Olympic Committee for coaching De Grasse.\n\n\"On Sunday August 4th we learned of new information about the appropriateness of Mr. Reider remaining accredited by Team Canada at the Paris 2024 Games. In discussion with Athletics Canada, it was agreed that Mr. Reider's accreditation be revoked,\" the Canadian Olympic Committee said. -- READ MORE\n\nGermany's Moritz Karlitzek took a spike directly to the face in the second set against the Netherlands. The good news: Karlitzek was OK. The bad news: The ball wasn't kept in play.\n\nTara Davis-Woodhall is one of craftiest jumpers in the women's field of the long jump. Her Paris Olympic trials were filled with drama, where she fouled the majority of her attempts before getting a white flag to make Team USA. On her second attempt of the qualifying round, Davis-Woodhall easily soared past the 6.75-meter qualifying mark with a jump of 6.90 meters to move on to the final.", "source": {"uri": "espn.ph",

But at the same time I know how hard I've fought for it,\" said Thomas.\n\nThere were no complaints from Alfred about missing out on a sprint double.\n\n\"I did feel ready for the 200m tonight,\" she said. \"I feel good, no complaints at all.\"\n\nAt the velodrome, Dutch powerhouse Harrie Lavreysen led his country to the men's team sprint cycling gold meda in a new world record time to successfully defend their title.\n\n- US v Brazil in women's final -\n\nThe United States and Brazil will do battle for the gold medal in women's football after claiming contrasting wins in last-four ties against Germany and World Cup holders Spain respectively.\n\nThe USA, record four-time women's football gold medallists, are on course to win the title for the first time since 2012 after beating Germany 1-0 in extra time in Lyon, with Sophia Smith scoring the only goal.\n\nBrazil reached their first Olympic final since 2008 by thrashing the reigning world champions 4-2 in Marseille.\n\nIn other developments, the decision of organisers to cancel a \"familiarisation session\" for marathon swimmers on Tuesday raised questions as to why triathletes were allowed to swim in the Seine the previous day.\n\nOrganisers said Tuesday they were \"very confident\" that the women's and men's 10-kilometre swimming events would take place in the river this week as scheduled.\n\nThe United States top the medals table with 24 golds, two ahead of China while Australia have 13.\n\nbur/gj\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox28spokane.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 28 Spokane"},

Alfred finished second while the U.S.' Brittany Brown won bronze.\n\nThomas placed third in this event in Tokyo, and a gold had eluded her in other events, such as the 4\u00d7100-meter relay, until Tuesday's race. She said the win was \"obviously\" the favorite of her career.\n\n\"You prepare for this moment and train so hard for this moment, but when it actually comes, it's indescribable,\" Thomas said. \"I never would have imagined in my wildest dreams that I would become an Olympic gold medalist, and I am one. I'm still wrapping my head around that.\"\n\nAlso on the track, American Cole Hocker won the men's 1,500-meter and set an Olympic record while doing so, finishing the race in 3:27.65.\n\nHocker overcame two overwhelming favorites in the win: Great Britain's Josh Kerr and Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen. Kerr took home silver, while Ingebrigtsen couldn't make the podium. American Yared Nuguse won bronze.\n\nIngebrigtsen was leading after 1,200 meters while Hocker was trailing in fourth place. But that's when he made his big move.\n\n\"With 100 meters to go, I knew I had enough,\" Hocker said. \"I haven't seen the race replay or anything, but I saw Jakob. I feel like he was thinking about Kerr and started drifting out, and I thought I'd take advantage of that and try to punch that inside, which I've been able to do a couple times in my career. He's a smart enough racer where he closed that down immediately, so I had to reassess. It was special to be able to attack not only once, but twice.\"\n\nThe U.S. women's soccer team will play for gold after beating Germany 1-0 in a group stage rematch.\n\nThe United States beat Germany 4-1 during group play, but Tuesday's showdown proved to be much more tense. The teams were tied through 90 minutes before Sophia Smith scored the winner in the 95th minute after the Americans again had to go to extra time in this tournament.\n\nThe win came one year to the day of the U.S. getting knocked out in the Round of 16 at the 2023 World Cup.\n\n\"It means everything,\" Smith said afterward. \"We had a tough year last year in every way possible, but I feel like this is a new year and we're really just showing the world that we didn't ever drop off.\"\n\nThe win continues the stellar start for coach Emma Hayes, who took over the program in May. She raised eyebrows after turning over the roster to younger players headed into the Paris Games, but Hayes is now unbeaten headed into the Olympic final, with a chance to secure the USWNT's first major trophy in five years.\n\nUSA will play Brazil on Saturday for the gold. She was suspended for the last two games, but should she see the pitch on Saturday, Brazilian legend Marta would be playing for her country for the last time in search of her first major international trophy.\n\nThe U.S. men's basketball team continues to cruise through the Olympics.\n\nAfter an undefeated group round, the States steamrolled Brazil in their quarterfinal matchup, winning 122-87.\n\nBasically everybody got in on the action.\n\nDevin Booker? 18 points. Anthony Edwards? 17 points. LeBron James? 12 points and nine assists. Joel Embiid? 14 points and some taunts for the crowd. Pick an American and they probably hooped.\n\nKevin Durant, who scored 11, became the leading scorer in American Olympic basketball history for men or women.\n\n\"Records are meant to be broken, so somebody will come along and do the same to me,\" Durant said. \"My focus is on trying to win this gold.\"\n\nThe U.S. will play Serbia in the semifinal, and the only question will be if anyone can test this team during the Games. The United States has won every game by at least 15, including a 26-point win over Serbia on July 28.\n\nAmit Elor became the youngest American to win gold in wrestling, winning 3-0 against Kyrgyzstan's Meerim Zhumanazarova in their 68-kilogram final.\n\nElor dominated throughout the tournament, surrendering only two points during her entire time in Paris. She is the third woman to win gold in wrestling for the United States.\n\n\"It was one of the best moments in my life,\" Elor said. \"I think I'm going to remember it for my entire life. It's one of the best feelings in the world. And when I experience something like that, it just reminds me that everything is worth it. All the hard days, the grind, it's all worth it for moments like these.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Cuban wrestler Mijain L\u00f3pez became the first person ever to win gold in five straight Olympics. The 41-year old unlaced his shoes and placed them in the center of the mat after defeating Chile's Yasmani Acosta Fern\u00e1ndez 6-0.\n\n\"I turned in what we call 'our weaponry,'\" Lopez told NBC News's Isabel Yip. \"When one turns in their wrestling shoes, they are leaving behind a journey where from a young age they have carried out that work.\"\n\nAlgeria's Imane Khelif moved to the gold medal round of boxing in the women's 66-kg division. She won a unanimous decision against Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng.\n\n\"I just gave the performance that I was looking for,\" Khelif said via a translator, per Yahoo Sports. \"And I was trying just to let the audience and the fans who came today to be happy. The hall was full of people, and I was happy to hear the national song of my country and that made me proud. And all Algerians must be proud, and all Arab countries.\"\n\nKhelif has been the target of attacks over her gender after false accusations were made about her in the wake of her defeat of Italy's Angela Carini, who withdrew 46 seconds into their second-round match.\n\nOn Tuesday, Suwannapheng said she believes Khelif is a woman and that \"it was a fair fight, because we were under the same rules.\"\n\nWednesday brings us the final in the men's 400-meter as well as the 3000-meter steeplechase, everyone's new favorite sport.\n\nWe also have the women's pole vault final, the men's park final in skateboarding, the men's discus throw final, as well as two gold medal bouts in men's boxing.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [],

But at the same time I know how hard I've fought for it,\" said Thomas.\n\nThere were no complaints from Alfred about missing out on a sprint double.\n\n\"I did feel ready for the 200m tonight,\" she said. \"I feel good, no complaints at all.\"\n\nAt the velodrome, Dutch powerhouse Harrie Lavreysen led his country to the men's team sprint cycling gold meda in a new world record time to successfully defend their title.\n\n- US v Brazil in women's final -\n\nThe United States and Brazil will do battle for the gold medal in women's football after claiming contrasting wins in last-four ties against Germany and World Cup holders Spain respectively.\n\nThe USA, record four-time women's football gold medallists, are on course to win the title for the first time since 2012 after beating Germany 1-0 in extra time in Lyon, with Sophia Smith scoring the only goal.\n\nBrazil reached their first Olympic final since 2008 by thrashing the reigning world champions 4-2 in Marseille.\n\nIn other developments, the decision of organisers to cancel a \"familiarisation session\" for marathon swimmers on Tuesday raised questions as to why triathletes were allowed to swim in the Seine the previous day.\n\nOrganisers said Tuesday they were \"very confident\" that the women's and men's 10-kilometre swimming events would take place in the river this week as scheduled.\n\nThe United States top the medals table with 24 golds, two ahead of China while Australia have 13.\n\nbur/gj", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Canada lost to France. Serbia erased a 24-point deficit to beat Australia. Germany had to shake off a double-digit deficit before beating Greece.\n\nSo, going into the fourth and final game of the night, the U.S. knew what it had to do.\n\n\"We wanted to come out and make sure we were the aggressor,\" U.S. coach Steve Kerr.\n\nThey made it look easy, too. Devin Booker led a balanced front with 18 points and the Americans had little trouble with Brazil in the quarterfinals of the Paris Olympics, winning 122-87 on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. (4-0) moves on to face Serbia (3-1) in Thursday's semifinals, while Germany (4-0) takes on France (3-1) in the other semifinal. Winners of those games will play Saturday night for the gold medal; Thursday's losers will play Saturday morning for the bronze medal.\n\n\"Everybody expects us to win,\" U.S. forward Jayson Tatum said. \"But you don't take things for granted, right? Canada lost earlier. It's a different game. It's not like playoffs, where it's a series. We've got one game and a lot of (stuff) can happen in one game, especially over here.\"\n\nIf there was one issue, it was this: LeBron James left in the third quarter after catching an elbow around his left eye, struck by Brazil's Georginho de Paula while going for a rebound. James went down, eventually pressed a towel over the eye and left for the locker room area later in the third.\n\nKerr said James needed four stitches.\n\n\"I'm all right,\" James said. \"Got hit with an inadvertent elbow around the eye.\"\n\nAnthony Edwards scored 17 points, while Joel Embiid -- booed again in France, of course -- had 14 points and seven rebounds in 12 first-half minutes for the Americans. Anthony Davis finished with 13 points and eight rebounds for the U.S. James had 12 points and nine assists.\n\nKevin Durant scored 11 points and passed Lisa Leslie as the U.S. Olympic career scoring leader, men's or women's. Leslie had 488 points in her four Olympic appearances, all of which ended with gold medals. Durant is trying to go 4 for 4 on the gold front as well; he's two wins away from getting that done.\n\n* As she processed winning an Olympic gold medal, American wrestler Amit Elor still felt like that little girl just starting out in the sport.\n\nPerhaps it's because she's not so far removed from that point.\n\nElor, just 20 years old, defeated Kyrgyzstan's Meerim Zhumanazarova 3-0 in the 68-kilogram final at the Paris Games to become the youngest Olympic wrestling gold medalist in U.S. history, male or female.\n\n\"I'm still in disbelief,\" she said. \"I think I have a little bit of impostor syndrome.\"\n\nElor's dominance was very real to her opponents. She had a 31-2 advantage over four matches and was not scored upon in her final three contests.\n\nShe became the third American woman to win gold, following Helen Maroulis in 2016 and Tamyra Mensah-Stock in 2021. Women started wrestling at the Olympics in 2004.\n\nAfter the win, she draped the U.S. flag over her back and skipped around the mat.\n\n\"It was one of the best moments in my life,\" she said. \"I think I'm going to remember it for my entire life.\"\n\n* Cole Hocker pulled the upset of the track meet with a stunning victory in the 1,500 meters.\n\nHocker outraced favorites Jakob Ingebrigtsen and Josh Kerr to the finish line in an Olympic record 3 minutes 27.65 seconds. He pulled from fifth to first over the final 300 meters to beat his personal best by more than 3 seconds.\n\nHe beat Kerr by .14 seconds, while Ingebrigtsen, who set the pace through the first 1200 meters, ended up in fourth behind American Yared Nuguse.\n\nAnnette Nneka Echikunwoke won a silver in the women's hammer throw.\n\n* Boxer Imane Khelif of Algeria advanced to the gold-medal bout in the women's welterweight division with a semifinal victory.\n\nKhelif defeated Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand 5:0 in the semifinals at Roland Garros, where the crowd roared and chanted her name throughout her three-round fight. Khelif has won three consecutive bouts in Paris, and she will win either a gold or a silver medal when she completes the tournament on Friday.\n\nShe has faced scrutiny during these Games over misconceptions about her gender.\n\nKhelif had already clinched Algeria's first medal in women's boxing before she stepped into the ring to rousing roars at Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nWith one more victory, Khelif would win Algeria's second boxing gold medal, joining Hocine Soltani (1996).\n\n* The reigning Olympic champion U.S. women's volleyball team posted a straight-set victory against Poland to advance to the semifinals in Paris.\n\nThe Americans next play powerhouse Brazil on Thursday.\n\nThe Americans made a lineup change after the team's five-set defeat to China on July 29 to open group stage play, moving veterans Jordan Larson and Kelsey Robinson Cook to reserve roles and bringing in Avery Skinner and Kathryn Plummer. The Americans bounced back to beat Serbia two days later.", "source": {"uri": "news-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News-Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Alfred finished second while the U.S.' Brittany Brown won bronze.\n\nThomas placed third in this event in Tokyo, and a gold had eluded her in other events, such as the 4x100-meter relay, until Tuesday's race. She said the win was \"obviously\" the favorite of her career.\n\n\"You prepare for this moment and train so hard for this moment, but when it actually comes, it's indescribable,\" Thomas said. \"I never would have imagined in my wildest dreams that I would become an Olympic gold medalist, and I am one. I'm still wrapping my head around that.\"\n\nAlso on the track, American Cole Hocker won the men's 1,500-meter and set an Olympic record while doing so, finishing the race in 3:27.65.\n\nHocker overcame two overwhelming favorites in the win: Great Britain's Josh Kerr and Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen. Kerr took home silver, while Ingebrigtsen couldn't make the podium. American Yared Nuguse won bronze.\n\nIngebrigtsen was leading after 1,200 meters while Hocker was trailing in fourth place. But that's when he made his big move.\n\n\"With 100 meters to go, I knew I had enough,\" Hocker said. \"I haven't seen the race replay or anything, but I saw Jakob. I feel like he was thinking about Kerr and started drifting out, and I thought I'd take advantage of that and try to punch that inside, which I've been able to do a couple times in my career. He's a smart enough racer where he closed that down immediately, so I had to reassess. It was special to be able to attack not only once, but twice.\"\n\nThe U.S. women's soccer team will play for gold after beating Germany 1-0 in a group stage rematch.\n\nThe United States beat Germany 4-1 during group play, but Tuesday's showdown proved to be much more tense. The teams were tied through 90 minutes before Sophia Smith scored the winner in the 95th minute after the Americans again had to go to extra time in this tournament.\n\nThe win came one year to the day of the U.S. getting knocked out in the Round of 16 at the 2023 World Cup.\n\n\"It means everything,\" Smith said afterward. \"We had a tough year last year in every way possible, but I feel like this is a new year and we're really just showing the world that we didn't ever drop off.\"\n\nThe win continues the stellar start for coach Emma Hayes, who took over the program in May. She raised eyebrows after turning over the roster to younger players headed into the Paris Games, but Hayes is now unbeaten headed into the Olympic final, with a chance to secure the USWNT's first major trophy in five years.\n\nUSA will play Brazil on Saturday for the gold. She was suspended for the last two games, but should she see the pitch on Saturday, Brazilian legend Marta would be playing for her country for the last time in search of her first major international trophy.\n\nThe U.S. men's basketball team continues to cruise through the Olympics.\n\nAfter an undefeated group round, the States steamrolled Brazil in their quarterfinal matchup, winning 122-87.\n\nBasically everybody got in on the action.\n\nDevin Booker? 18 points. Anthony Edwards? 17 points. LeBron James? 12 points and nine assists. Joel Embiid? 14 points and some taunts for the crowd. Pick an American and they probably hooped.\n\nKevin Durant, who scored 11, became the leading scorer in American Olympic basketball history for men or women.\n\n\"Records are meant to be broken, so somebody will come along and do the same to me,\" Durant said. \"My focus is on trying to win this gold.\"\n\nThe U.S. will play Serbia in the semifinal, and the only question will be if anyone can test this team during the Games. The United States has won every game by at least 15, including a 26-point win over Serbia on July 28.\n\nAmit Elor became the youngest American to win gold in wrestling, winning 3-0 against Kyrgyzstan's Meerim Zhumanazarova in their 68-kilogram final.\n\nElor dominated throughout the tournament, surrendering only two points during her entire time in Paris. She is the third woman to win gold in wrestling for the United States.\n\n\"It was one of the best moments in my life,\" Elor said. \"I think I'm going to remember it for my entire life. It's one of the best feelings in the world. And when I experience something like that, it just reminds me that everything is worth it. All the hard days, the grind, it's all worth it for moments like these.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Cuban wrestler Mijain L\u00f3pez became the first person ever to win gold in five straight Olympics. The 41-year old unlaced his shoes and placed them in the center of the mat after defeating Chile's Yasmani Acosta Fern\u00e1ndez 6-0.\n\n\"I turned in what we call 'our weaponry,'\" Lopez told NBC News's Isabel Yip. \"When one turns in their wrestling shoes, they are leaving behind a journey where from a young age they have carried out that work.\"\n\nAlgeria's Imane Khelif moved to the gold medal round of boxing in the women's 66-kg division. She won a unanimous decision against Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng.\n\n\"I just gave the performance that I was looking for,\" Khelif said via a translator, per Yahoo Sports. \"And I was trying just to let the audience and the fans who came today to be happy. The hall was full of people, and I was happy to hear the national song of my country and that made me proud. And all Algerians must be proud, and all Arab countries.\"\n\nKhelif has been the target of attacks over her gender after false accusations were made about her in the wake of her defeat of Italy's Angela Carini, who withdrew 46 seconds into their second-round match.\n\nOn Tuesday, Suwannapheng said she believes Khelif is a woman and that \"it was a fair fight, because we were under the same rules.\"\n\nWednesday brings us the final in the men's 400-meter as well as the 3000-meter steeplechase, everyone's new favorite sport.\n\nWe also have the women's pole vault final, the men's park final in skateboarding, the men's discus throw final, as well as two gold medal bouts in men's boxing.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [],

But at the same time I know how hard I've fought for it,\" said Thomas.\n\nThere were no complaints from Alfred about missing out on a sprint double.\n\n\"I did feel ready for the 200m tonight,\" she

Germany 1-0 in extra time in Lyon, with Sophia Smith scoring the only goal.\n\nBrazil reached their first Olympic final since 2008 by thrashing the reigning world champions 4-2 in Marseille.\n\nIn other developments, the decision of organisers to cancel a \"familiarisation session\" for marathon swimmers on Tuesday raised questions as to why triathletes were allowed to swim in the Seine the previous day.\n\nOrganisers said Tuesday they were \"very confident\" that the women's and men's 10-kilometre swimming events would take place in the river this week as scheduled.\n\nThe United States

But at the same time I know how hard I've fought for it,\" said Thomas, who said had taken inspiration from watching teammates Noah Lyles and Sha'Carri Richardson, and even Alfred in the men's and women's 100m at the weekend.\n\nThere were no complaints from Alfred about missing out on a sprint double.\n\n\"I did feel ready for the 200m tonight,\" she said. \"I feel good, no complaints at all.\"\n\nIt is the first time since the 1976 Montreal Games that no Jamaican sprinters have made the podium of either the women's 100m or 200m.\n\nIn a major track and field upset, American Cole Hocker produced a remarkable surge in the home straight to carry him past pre-race favourites Jakob Ingebrigtsen and Josh Kerr to win the men's 1,500m.\n\n- US v Brazil in women's final -\n\nThe United States and Brazil will do battle for the gold medal in women's football after claiming contrasting wins in Tuesday's last-four ties against Germany and World Cup holders Spain respectively.\n\nThe USA, record four-time women's football gold medallists, are still on course to win the title for the first time since 2012 after beating Germany 1-0 in extra time in Lyon, with Sophia Smith scoring the only goal.\n\nBrazil reached their first Olympic final since 2008 by thrashing the reigning world champions 4-2 in Marseille.\n\nIn other developments, the decision of organisers to cancel a \"familiarisation session\" for marathon swimmers on Tuesday raised questions as to why triathletes were allowed to swim in the Seine the previous day.\n\nOrganisers said Tuesday they were \"very confident\" that the women's and men's 10-kilometre swimming events would take place in the river this week as scheduled.\n\nThe United States top the medals table with 24 golds, two ahead of China while Australia have 13.\n\njw-gj/jc", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "guy_jackson@ktbs.com", "name": "Guy Jackson",

As the playoffs set to begin for many of the team sports, we look at a mixture of individual and team sports.\n\nThe first of 13 boxing finals take place on Tuesday. In the women's 60 kilogram weight class, Kellie Harrington of Ireland is facing Wenlu Yang of China in the gold medal bout. Harrington is the defending Olympic gold medalist in the women's lightweight division, while Yang is the reigning bronze medalist from the 2023 Women's World Boxing Championships in New Delhi.\n\nThree Americans are in the final of the women's 200 metres on Tuesday. They are 2019 World Championship silver medalist Brittany Brown of Claremont, California, reigning Olympic bronze medalist Gabrielle Thomas of Atlanta, and McKenzie Long. All eyes will also be on Saint Lucia's Julien Alfred, who won the gold medal in the women's 100 metres on Saturday with a time of 10.72 seconds. This was the first ever gold medal in the history of Saint Lucia.\n\nThe semifinals are taking place in women's soccer. Brazil is playing Spain and the United States is playing Germany. Spain are the reigning Women's World Cup champions as they beat England 1-0 last year in Sydney, Australia. In the history of the Olympic Women's Soccer tournament, the United States have won four Olympic gold medals, while Germany has won once. The German gold medal came at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThe quarterfinals are taking place in the Olympic men's basketball tournament on Tuesday. From an American standpoint, the focus will be on the last game as the United States faces Brazil. The Americans have looked great in the Olympic tournament so far after being ordinary in exhibition play leading up to the Olympic Games.\n\nThe United States beach volleyball team of Kelly Cheng and Sara Hughes will play Switzerland in one of four quarterfinal games in women's beach volleyball. The tournament is spectacular because of how close the court is to the Eiffel Tower.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsdaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sports Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The USWNT secured a chance to compete for gold, while Team USA had another dominant win in men's basketball to advance to the semifinals; with track and field truly ramping up, Team USA cleaned up with big wins across multiple events, while a young wrestler earned a historic gold. A crucial elimination in beach volleyball, however, leaves only one American pair remaining in play.\n\nHere are the top five stories of the day:\n\nThe USWNT have a chance to play for a gold medal, with a 1-0 win over Germany to advance to the final. Sophia Smith saved the day with a 95th-minute stunner, assisted by Mallory Swanson, that broke the stalemate and gave the U.S. the victory.\n\nNaomi Girma kept things locked up at center back to fend off the German attack, and received high praise from manager Emma Hayes after the match, earning woman of the match for her efforts. A couple of key saves from Alyssa Naeher -- including one kept out of the goal by Naeher left foot -- kept the U.S. ahead and prevented the game from moving into penalties.\n\nAs for Smith, her goal marks her third of the tournament. The three members of the USWNT's front three -- Smith, Mallory Swanson and Trinity Rodman -- now have three goals each in the tournament so far, boding well for the United States offense going forward.\n\nThe USWNT will now return to Paris for the chance to compete for its first gold medal since 2012. It will play Brazil, which upset Spain, the reigning Women's World Cup champions, with a dominant 4-2 win.\n\nThere was little doubt about this one from the opening tip.\n\nUSA men's basketball took early control en route to a dominant 122-87 win over Brazil in the Olympic quarterfinals on Tuesday. The win sets up a matchup with Nikola Joki\u0107 and Serbia in the semifinals with a trip to the gold-medal game at stake.\n\nDevin Booker paced Team USA with 18 points as six U.S. players scored in double figures. Joel Embiid responded to the French boo-birds in the stands with 14 first-half points before a scoreless second.\n\nKevin Durant became USA Basketball's all-time leading men's or women's Olympic scorer. With a dunk in the third quarter, he passed Lisa Leslie's previous mark of 488 points.\n\nHe finished with 11 points to raise his career Olympic tally to 494. LeBron James added 12 points and nine assists.\n\nUSA will take on Serbia on Thursday. Victor Wembanyama and France will face 2023 FIBA World Cup champion Germany in the other semifinal.\n\nThe United States is cleaning up in track and field, and on Tuesday continued to add to the medal count with podium finishes in the women's hammer throw, women's 200-meter and the men's 1500-meter.\n\nAnnette Echikunwoke was disqualified for the Tokyo Games because of a documentation error when competing for her parents' native Nigeria. Fast forward three years, and Echikunwoke, who lives in Ohio, is a silver medalist after throwing a season-best 75.48 meters on her third throw, good for second behind Canada's Camryn Rogers (76.97). China's Zhao Jie took bronze (74.27).\n\nIn the women's 200, two Americans made it to the podium: Gabby Thomas cruised to the gold medal in 21.38 seconds, and Brittany Brown won bronze in 22.20 seconds. The silver medalist was none other than Julien Alfred, the 100-meter winner who gave Saint Lucia its first Olympic medal of any color.\n\nAnd in a surprise, American Cole Hocker pulled off a stunning upset in the men's 1500, crossing the finish line in 3:27.65, an Olympic record time and nearly three full seconds faster than his personal best in the event.\n\n20-year-old American wrestler Amit Elor made history on Tuesday with a gold medal in the women's 68-kg division, becoming the youngest U.S. wrestler, male or female, to win an Olympic gold medal.\n\nElor, who has not lost a single match in five years as a senior wrestler, defeated Kyrgyzstan's Meerim Zhumanazarova 3-0 in the final at Arena Champ-de-Mars. Elor scored two points on a takedown in the first period and earned another point when Zhumanazarova was penalized after the activity period expired. She then controlled the second period, giving Zhumanazarova no avenues to score en route to the win.\n\nThe 20-year-old, who is a back-to-back world champion, dropped down to the 68-kg weight class to qualify for the Olympics. As a result of the switch, Elor was unseeded and drew the division's reigning world champ, Buse Tosun \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu from Turkey, in the very first Olympic round; she demolished her, 10-2. Elor swept through to the final with an aggregate score of 28-2. She came to Paris unbeaten in her last 37 international matches by a cumulative score of 322-16.\n\nNow she has officially landed in the history books.\n\nSara Hughes and Kelly Cheng, the only American team still remaining on the women's side, were eliminated on Tuesday after losing to Switzerland in straight sets. The reigning World Champion Americans lost to the Swiss pair of Tanja Hueberli and Nina Brunner in the quarterfinals, losing the two sets 18-21 and 19-21, with both sets being extremely tight.\n\nThe United States has a history of dominance in women's beach volleyball, with four of the last five Olympics featuring Americans winning gold. That trend has been broken in Paris, with no American women making it past the quarterfinals. The other pair, Kristen Nuss and Taryn Kloth, lost to Canada in the Round of 16 on Monday.\n\nHughes and Cheng's loss means that only one American pair -- Miles Partain and Andrew Benesh -- remain in contention for a medal in beach volleyball. Pertain and Benesh will play Qatar on Wednesday in the quarterfinals, in the hopes of becoming the first American men's pair to win a medal since 2008.\n\nAustralian Arisa Trew, who is only 14 years old, took home the gold medal in the women's skateboarding final, posting a stellar 93.18 in the third and final round of the event to take first.\n\nTalk about going out on a high note. Legendary Cuban wrestler Mija\u00edn L\u00f3pez went down in history on Tuesday by becoming the first person to win five consecutive gold medals in an individual Olympic event. The 41-year-old Lopez beat Chile's Yasmani Acosta Fernandez 6-0 in his greco-roman wrestling 60kg match, leaving his shoes on the mat to signify his retirement.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com",

But at the same time I know how hard I've fought for it,\" said Thomas, who said had taken inspiration from watching teammates Noah Lyles and Sha'Carri Richardson, and even Alfred in the men's and women's 100m at the weekend.\n\nThere were no complaints from Alfred about missing out on a sprint double.\n\n\"I did feel ready for the 200m tonight,\" she said. \"I feel good, no complaints at all.\"\n\nIt is the first time since the 1976 Montreal Games that no Jamaican sprinters have made the podium of either the women's 100m or 200m.\n\nIn a major track and field upset, American Cole Hocker produced a remarkable surge in the home straight to carry him past pre-race favourites Jakob Ingebrigtsen and Josh Kerr to win the men's 1,500m.\n\n- US v Brazil in women's final -\n\nThe United States and Brazil will do battle for the gold medal in women's football after claiming contrasting wins in Tuesday's last-four ties against Germany and World Cup holders Spain respectively.\n\nThe USA, record four-time women's football gold medallists, are still on course to win the title for the first time since 2012 after beating Germany 1-0 in extra time in Lyon, with Sophia Smith scoring the only goal.\n\nBrazil reached their first Olympic final since 2008 by thrashing the reigning world champions 4-2 in Marseille.\n\nIn other developments, the decision of organisers to cancel a \"familiarisation session\" for marathon swimmers on Tuesday raised questions as to why triathletes were allowed to swim in the Seine the previous day.\n\nOrganisers said Tuesday they were \"very confident\" that the women's and men's 10-kilometre swimming events would take place in the river this week as scheduled.\n\nThe United States top the medals table with 24 golds, two ahead of China while Australia have 13.\n\njw-gj/jc", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "guy_jackson@reformer.com",

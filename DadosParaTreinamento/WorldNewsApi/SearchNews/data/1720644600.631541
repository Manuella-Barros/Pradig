{"id": 231232276, "title": "Brad Pitt may be winning the legal fight, but Angelina Jolie has already won the family war", "text": "Father\u2019s Day will come and go for Brad Pitt \u2014 and he may not even hear from his six kids. Things seem to have finally reached a tipping point as the children the Oscar winner shares with his ex-wife Angelina Jolie are, one by one, making it clear whose side they\u2019ve chosen. Although Pitt, 60, has won a series of recent legal challenges against Jolie, 49, it is the actress who is winning the family war. Several of the Jolie-Pitt children no longer use Pitt in their surname, Page Six can reveal. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely upsetting,\u201d admitted a Pitt source, claiming, \u201cShe has used the kids as a weapon against Brad \u2026 she has separated them from him. \u201cThere is a whole pattern: Any time he has a win in court, she hits back with something to do with the kids.\u201d The \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\u201d star has been embroiled in a custody fight with Jolie since their 2016 split and things have become increasingly bitter over the years. Pitt lost a 50-50 custody agreement that was sealed for privacy in 2021. But just weeks ago, the family\u2019s former security guard Tony Webb alleged in court documents that Jolie had encouraged the children to \u201cavoid\u201d their father during visits. And now, their daughter Shiloh Jolie-Pitt, whom Page Six is told was home schooled alongside her siblings, has legally applied to remove the \u201cPitt\u201d from her surname. Multiple reports stated that Shiloh hired \u2014 and paid for \u2014 her own lawyer when she turned 18 on May 27. Page Six has seen the filing, issued on behalf of Shiloh by LA-based lawyer Peter K. Levine, which she has signed as Shiloh Jolie. However, Pitt insiders question who was really behind the move, telling Page Six: \u201cReasonable people should draw their own conclusions as to who was actually behind it.\u201d We can also confirm that the couple\u2019s oldest son, Maddox, 22, who has been studying in South Korea and has no relationship with Pitt, dropped \u201cPitt\u201d back in 2021 and just goes by Jolie. In the Playbill for the new Broadway musical \u201cThe Outsiders,\u201d which 15-year-old daughter Vivienne helped Jolie produce, she\u2019s listed as \u201cVivienne Jolie.\u201d It is unclear if her twin brother, Knox, still uses their father\u2019s name. The two turn 16 next month. Meanwhile, Pitt and Jolie\u2019s eldest daughter Zahara, 19, introduced herself as \u201cZahara Marley Jolie\u201d upon joining the Mu Pi chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority at Spelman College last November. Son Pax, 20, made an explosive Instagram rant against on Father\u2019s Day 2020. \u201cHappy Father\u2019s Day to this world class a\u2013hole!! You time and time again prove yourself to be a terrible and despicable person,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou have no consideration or empathy toward your 4 youngest children who tremble in fear when in your presence.\u201d Jolie filed for divorce in September 2016 after a now-infamous flight from Nice to the US when she alleged that Pitt grabbed her by the head and shook her, then choked one of their children and struck another when they tried to defend her. She also claimed that Pitt poured alcohol on both her and their children. He was cleared by the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services and never charged with any offense. The couple, both Oscar winners, have been battling over assets and custody ever since. \u201cBrad admitted that his behavior on the plane was wrong,\u201d said the Pitt source. \u201cHe took steps to improve himself.\u201d Indeed, Pitt told GQ in 2017 that he had quit smoking and drinking, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t have that ability to do just one or two [drinks] a day. It\u2019s not in my makeup. I\u2019m all in. And I\u2019m going to drive into the ground. I\u2019ve lost my privileges.\u201d Still, an industry source who knows Jolie points out that Pitt has never actually apologized for what happened on the flight. Twins Knox and Vivienne are the only minor children and the only ones who would be held to a visitation agreement with their father. However, when Pitt does see his children, \u201cit\u2019s very difficult,\u201d admitted the Pitt insider. Aside from their custody fight, Pitt and Jolie have been scrapping over their French vineyard, Chateau Miraval. Jolie sold her $62 million stake to Russian billionaire Yuri Shefler in 2021, which Pitt argues went against their agreement to offer the other person right of first refusal. Last month, the \u2018Tomb Raider\u2019 actress was ordered by a judge in LA Superior Court to produce every NDA agreement that she signed with a third-party over an eight-year period from 2014 \u2014 the year they married \u2014 to 2022. NDA\u2019s have become a key battleground in the dispute over Miraval after Jolie claims she backed out of their agreement because Pitt asked her to sign one as part of their business deal. Jolie is now challenging the judge\u2019s decision on the NDAs, we\u2019re told. Pitt insiders also feel that Jolie should have never even sold her share of Miraval and instead, help build it up for their children. \u201cThis is only for her benefit,\u201d argued another Pitt source. \u201cHow does separating your children from their father help and how does selling your share of Miraval help them? Anything related to Brad has been directed or choreographed by her to inflict the maximum pain on him without any regard for the longterm damage it does to the family. \u201cShe\u2019s made Miraval into a thing about the family when it was just a business dispute and she introduced the family into it.\u201d Pitt is currently filming an as-yet-untitled movie about Formula One and living with his jeweler girlfriend Ines de Ramon in Los Angeles, while Jolie looked triumphant as she and daughter Vivienne supported Kristen Bell at the opening night of the \u201cReefer Madness: The Musical\u201d revival in LA on May 31. \u201cHe has consistently refused to comment on anything relating to his children or to say anything negative about their mother despite all of these efforts to separate him from his kids,\u201d said the Pitt insider. As for the future with his children, his friends have encouraged him to believe that things will get better. \u201cAs the kids get older and end up having a life as their own,\u201d the Pitt insider said, \u201che can only hope that they will forget a relationship.\u201d", "summary": "Things seem to have finally reached a tipping point as the Oscar winners' kids drop Pitt's name, one by one.", "url": "https://pagesix.com/2024/06/08/entertainment/angelina-jolie-has-already-won-the-family-war-against-brad-pitt/", "image": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/brad-angelina_720.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=720", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:00:00", "author": "Sara Nathan", "authors": ["Sara Nathan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.051}

However, they will be playing outside the top two divisions for the first time in almost 30 years.\n\nDavies' arrival at St Andrews is the fifth managerial appointment in League One ahead of the 2024/25 season with Huddersfield Town (Michael Duff), Stevenage (Alex Revell), Barnsley (Darrell Clarke) and Burton Albion (Mark Robinson) bringing in new faces in the dugout in preparation for the new campaign.\n\nRovers haven't played Birmingham competitively since losing a League Cup tie at the Mem 2-1 in 2015.

They have been passing judgement on the appointment on social media...\n\nChris O'Brien: Amazing appointment! Bold, ambitious, exciting and refreshing from the usual suspects. Season tickets, new players and we're off! KRO\n\nAdam: Huge appointment. We believe, gaffer.\n\nGary Morgan: Great appointment.

I hope it's the first one.\n\nDean William Smith: A great and very exciting appointment. Giving someone different a chance and not reverting to one of the same old names. Let's get behind him now.\n\nRobbie Michaels: OMG - genuinely delighted by this. Let's support him one million percent. He is the right man for us.\n\nMark Jackson: Brilliant news, just the type of progressive coach we need. Well done Blues.\n\nMark Ivory: Welcome Chris! Don't know enough about him, but gets my full backing and hopefully backed in the transfer market so we have a great season. Mentally, we have to change around the club to a winning team #KRO\n\nTony Edmond: Great appointment. Left field, but I really think this will work. Recruiting the right players and getting rid of any players who are not prepared to fight for the badge.\n\nAndy Ballard: Really excited by this as we need to put together almost a whole new squad, then he will have a blank canvas to paint his ideas. I am sure he will have Ange Postecoglou to bounce ideas off. If he brings the kind of football he coached at Celtic and Spurs, then it's brilliant .\n\nDan Smith: Banger of an appointment!

You've just got to manage your emotions. Anything can happen,\" Brown said of his tying three. \"It's not over until the final buzzer sounds. ... It's not over until it's over. We found a way to win the game at the very end.\"\n\nIt gave his team a new life and helped it hang on to home-court advantage with Game 2 set for Thursday in Boston.\n\nBut guarding against complacency was also on the mind of Tatum. The Celtics have lost Game 2 in each of their previous two series.\n\n\"It doesn't prove anything,\" Tatum said. \"We won a big-time game. The series is far from over.\"\n\nTyrese Haliburton had 25 points and 10 assists for the Pacers, who knocked down 13 three-pointers and scored 56 points in the paint against a Celtics team still playing without seven-footer Kristaps Porzingis.\n\nBut Boston dialed up their defense, finishing with 11 steals - three each by Brown, Tatum and Holiday. The Celtics become the first team in NBA playoff history to have three players record 25 points and three steals in a game.\n\nThe Celtics were cold for most of the game from three-point range, but ended the night 15 of 45 from beyond the arc.\n\n\"We keep talking about protecting home court,\" Celtics forward Al Horford said. \"It's whatever it takes.\"\n\nPascal Siakam added 24 points and 12 rebounds. Myles Turner finished with 23 points and 10 rebounds for the sixth-seeded Pacers, who twice turned it over with a three-point lead in the final 30 seconds of regulation.\n\nBrown made them pay for the second one, hitting a three from the corner with Siakam right in his face to tie it at 117.\n\n\"Jrue made a good pass, (Derrick White) set a great screen and the rest is history,\" Brown said.\n\nCeltics coach Joe Mazzulla like the poise Brown showed.\n\n\"Jaylen had great balance,\" he said. \"Great pass, great shot.\"\n\nPacers coach Rick Carlisle said the loss was \"totally on me\" for not calling a timeout to advance the ball before their turnover that set up Brown's shot.\n\nAsked about the 21 turnovers Indiana committed, Haliburton said many of them were preventable.\n\n\"I think it's more on us,\" he said. \"I just felt like more of them were probably on us than them forcing turnovers.\"\n\nThe Celtics are now 2-2 when their opponent scores 100 or more points.\n\nHoliday said the Celtics never panicked after falling behind late in regulation\n\n\"I think we always knew that there's always a chance. We've seen crazy stuff happen all the time,\" Holiday said. \"I don't think that we think we lost the game until we actually lost the game and that's part of the reason why we were so resilient.\"\n\nIndiana went back ahead 123-121 when Haliburton hit all three free throws after being fouled with 1:46 remaining.

Butler / National Basketball Association / Getty\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- The Celtics entered the playoffs expecting to get everyone's best shot.\n\nThe East's top seed barely survived a tough one to open the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nJayson Tatum scored 36 points, including 10 in overtime after Jaylen Brown's tying 3-pointer with 6.1 seconds remaining in regulation, and Boston rallied just in time for a 133-128 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday night.\n\nJrue Holiday added a season-high 28 points and Brown finished with 26.\n\n\"Welcome to the NBA playoffs. You've just got to manage your emotions. Anything can happen,\" Brown said of his tying 3. \"It's not over until the final buzzer sounds. ... It's not over until it's over. We found a way to win the game at the very end.\"\n\nIt gave his team a new life and helped it hang on to home-court advantage with Game 2 set for Thursday in Boston.\n\nBut guarding against complacency was also on the mind of Tatum. The Celtics have lost Game 2 in each of their previous two series.\n\n\"It doesn't prove anything,\" Tatum said. \"We won a big-time game. The series is far from over.\"\n\nTyrese Haliburton had 25 points and 10 assists for the Pacers, who knocked down 13 3-pointers and scored 56 points in the paint against a Celtics team still playing without 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis.\n\nBut Boston dialed up its defense, finishing with 11 steals -- three each by Brown, Tatum and Holiday. The Celtics become the first team in NBA playoff history to have three players record 25 points and three steals in a game.\n\nThe Celtics were cold for most of the game from 3-point range, but ended the night 15 of 45 from beyond the arc.\n\n\"We keep talking about protecting home court,\" Celtics forward Al Horford said. \"It's whatever it takes.\"\n\nPascal Siakam added 24 points and 12 rebounds. Myles Turner finished with 23 points and 10 rebounds for the sixth-seeded Pacers, who twice turned it over with a three-point lead in the final 30 seconds of regulation.\n\nBrown made them pay for the second one, hitting a 3 from the corner with Siakam right in his face to tie it at 117.\n\n\"Jrue made a good pass, (Derrick White) set a great screen and the rest is history,\" Brown said.\n\nCeltics coach Joe Mazzulla like the poise Brown showed.\n\n\"Jaylen had great balance,\" he said. \"Great pass, great shot.\"\n\nPacers coach Rick Carlisle said the loss was \"totally on me\" for not calling a timeout to advance the ball before their turnover that set up Brown's shot.\n\nAsked about the 21 turnovers Indiana committed, Haliburton said many of them were preventable.\n\n\"I think it's more on us,\" he said. \"I just felt like more of them were probably on us than them forcing turnovers.\"\n\nThe Celtics are now 2-2 when their opponent scores 100 or more points.\n\nHoliday said the Celtics never panicked after falling behind late in regulation\n\n\"I think we always knew that there's always a chance. We've seen crazy stuff happen all the time,\" Holiday said. \"I don't think that we think we lost the game until we actually lost the game and that's part of the reason why we were so resilient.\"\n\nIndiana went back ahead 123-121 when Haliburton hit all three free throws after being fouled with 1:46 remaining. Tatum then muscled in a layup and was fouled by T.J. McConnell. He completed the three-point play to put Boston ahead for good.\n\nThe Pacers turned it over again, this time by Haliburton.

They failed to go up 2-0 on the Miami Heat in the first round, then had to settle for a 1-1 series against the Cleveland Cavaliers in the semifinals.\n\n\"We just gotta be prepared,\" Boston star Jaylen Brown said. \"We know it. We've seen it. We've been hearing it. Now we just have to come out and execute and be better. We will.\"\n\nGame 2 of the Eastern Conference finals is scheduled for Thursday in Boston.\n\nJayson Tatum collected a game-high 36 points and 12 rebounds in Boston's Game 1 victory against Indiana.

Nembhard stemmed the tide with a jumper, and Indiana took its 117-114 edge into what was originally supposed to be the game's final seconds.\n\nBut Brown knocked down a trey from the corner, knotting things at 117 with 6.1 seconds on the clock. Indiana star guard Tyrese Haliburton missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer, sending the contest to overtime.\n\nThree free throws from Haliburton in the extra session put the Pacers ahead 123-121 with 1:46 left, but Tatum answered with a three-point play, and the Celtics never gave up the lead the rest of the way.\n\nHaliburton had 25 points and 10 assists. Pascal Siakam finished with 24 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists for the sixth-seeded Pacers, who received 23 points from Myles Turner.\n\n\"Our guys just need to concentrate on fighting the way they fought in (Game 1) from start to finish, and we'll be back Thursday,\" Indiana coach Rick Carlisle said. \"We did a lot of good things that we need to continue to do. We've been a tough-minded and resilient team, really for almost the entire second half of the year. We have to continue with that and come back in here on Thursday night.\"\n\nIndiana made 9 of 10 free throws in the game. Boston was 24-for-30 from the foul line.\n\nThe Pacers committed 22 turnovers that led to 32 Celtics points.\n\nThe Celtics led 34-31 after one quarter, and it was 64-64 at halftime. The Pacers used a 9-0 spurt to pull within four points, 92-88, late in the third quarter, and they trailed 94-93 entering the fourth.\n\n\"They scored a lot of points in transition,\" Brown said. \"We gotta clean that up.

But Jaylen Brown had other plans.\n\nThe Celtics couldn't buy a basket in the final minutes of regulation and nearly let the Pacers steal Game 1 at TD Garden. But after forcing a turnover on an Indiana inbounds, Brown hit a corner three over Pascal Siakam with 5.9 seconds left in regulation to tie the game at 117-117. Tyrese Haliburton had been hitting ridiculous threes all night, but his game-winning bid didn't fall as the buzzer sounded and an extra five minutes was needed to decide Game 1.\n\nJayson Tatum took over in the final minutes of that extra time, scoring 10 of his game-high 36 points over the final 2:27, and the Celtics escaped with a 133-128 victory. Tatum's driving layup and free-throw that followed gave Boston a 124-123 with 1:12 to go, and then he canned a straight-away three with 42.8 seconds left to put the Celtics on top by four.\n\nBrown bullied the ball away from Siakam on the other end, and Derrick White (15 points, 9 assists) put in a layup to essentially seal the game for Boston despite Indy hitting some clutch free throws in the final seconds.\n\nThe Celtics can exhale after outlasting the Pacers in Game 1. But they will have to be much better in Game 2 on Thursday night. The C's have lost three straight Game 2s going back to last year's Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nJoe Mazzulla will have plenty to say about his team's cold streaks and lack of focus at times. But a playoff win is a playoff win, and Boston now owns a 1-0 lead over the Pacers. That's really all that matters at the end of the day.\n\nThe Celtics had everything going their way to start the game. Mazzulla won a challenge 35 seconds in -- the quickest challenge in NBA postseason history -- and Boston raced out to a 12-0 lead. Brown scored 10 of his 26 points in the opening frame, but the Pacers chipped away and had the Celtics lead down to 34-31 at the end of the quarter thanks to 11 points from Obi Toppin off the bench.\n\nBoston built its lead back up to 10 four minutes into the second quarter, but then Myles Turner caught fire for Indiana. The big man was hitting threes, throwing down dunks, and dishing out assists, scoring 12 points in the frame to go with two dimes and two rebounds. Turner finished with 23 points on the night.\n\nHaliburton also got hot at the end of the half, draining a ridiculous three from the Celtics logo in the closing seconds to tie the game at 64-64.\n\nHaliburton (25 points, 10 assists) came out of the locker room and scored the first five points of the second half to give the Pacers their first lead of the game. But the Celtics responded with a 7-0 run off a Horford three and layups by Tatum and Brown to take the lead right back.\n\nBoston went on a 13-0 run later in the frame sparked by some solid defense and Tatum getting into a groove on offense. He hit his first three of the game midway through the third quarter to put the Celtics on top 83-75, and then got three the hard way when he was fouled on a driving layup, giving the Celtics an 87-75 edge.\n\nBut the Pacers responded again, ripping off a quick 9-0 run with Tatum on the bench. Haliburton hit another absurd three at the buzzer, banking it in over Brown to cut Boston's lead to 94-93 heading into the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Celtics went cold after Jrue Holiday (28 points, 8 assists) tipped in his own miss to give them a 104-101 lead with 7:29 in the game, going over three minutes without any points. Indiana went on a 7-0 run thanks to Siakam, who locked down on the defensive end and turned it into points for the Pacers. He snatched a bad pass by Brown out of the air, and then took a feed from Haliburton for a jam to put Indy on top 108-104 with 4:34 to play.\n\nA White three ended that drought for Boston, but the Pacers continued to pour it on. Aaron Nesmith answered with a hoop-and-the-harm at the other end, and Siakam continued to kill the Celtics with his midrange game.\n\nWhite came up with a huge defensive rebound with the Pacers on top 115-112 with 1:12 left, but a trailing Haliburton blocked his three-point bid. After Brown hit a pair of free throws for Boston, Andrew Nembhard hit a jumper with 42 seconds left to build Indiana's lead back up to three. Tatum missed a three-pointer with 45 seconds left that would have tied the game, and when the Celtics got the ball back with 27.7 seconds on the clock, White missed a bunny and Tatum back-rimmed a fadeaway.\n\nThe game felt over that point and a loss inevitable for the Celtics. But Boston got the ball back one final time when Brown glued himself to Siakam and forced Nembhard's inbound pass to hit off the Indy forward's hands and out of bounds with 8.5 seconds left.

The East's top seed barely survived a tough one to open the Eastern Conference finals. Jayson Tatum scored 36 points, including 10 in overtime after Jaylen Brown's tying 3-pointer with 6.1 seconds remaining in regulation, and Boston rallied just in time for a 133-128 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday night.

The Celtics become the first team in NBA playoff history to have three players record 25 points and three steals in a game.\n\nALSO READ: Wembanyama becomes 1st rookie to make first-team All-Defense\n\nThe Celtics were cold for most of the game from 3-point range, but ended the night 15 of 45 from beyond the arc.\n\n\"We keep talking about protecting home court,\" Celtics forward Al Horford said. \"It's whatever it takes.\"\n\nPascal Siakam added 24 points and 12 rebounds. Myles Turner finished with 23 points and 10 rebounds for the sixth-seeded Pacers, who twice turned it over with a three-point lead in the final 30 seconds of regulation.\n\nBrown made them pay for the second one, hitting a 3 from the corner with Siakam right in his face to tie it at 117.\n\n\"Jrue made a good pass, (Derrick White) set a great screen and the rest is history,\" Brown said.\n\nCeltics coach Joe Mazzulla like the poise Brown showed.\n\n\"Jaylen had great balance,\" he said. \"Great pass, great shot.\"\n\nPacers coach Rick Carlisle said the loss was \"totally on me\" for not calling a timeout to advance the ball before their turnover that set up Brown's shot.\n\nAsked about the 21 turnovers Indiana committed, Haliburton said many of them were preventable.\n\n\"I think it's more on us,\" he said. \"I just felt like more of them were probably on us than them forcing turnovers.\"\n\nThe Celtics are now 2-2 when their opponent scores 100 or more points.\n\nHoliday said the Celtics never panicked after falling behind late in regulation\n\nIndiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton (0) reacts after missing a three point attempt against the Boston Celtics in the fourth quarter during game one of the eastern conference finals for the 2024 NBA playoffs. | Photo Credit: DAVID BUTLER II/ Reuters\n\nIndiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton (0) reacts after missing a three point attempt against the Boston Celtics in the fourth quarter during game one of the eastern conference finals for the 2024 NBA playoffs. | Photo Credit: DAVID BUTLER II/ Reuters\n\n\"I think we always knew that there's always a chance. We've seen crazy stuff happen all the time,\" Holiday said. \"I don't think that we think we lost the game until we actually lost the game and that's part of the reason why we were so resilient.\"\n\nIndiana went back ahead 123-121 when Haliburton hit all three free throws after being fouled with 1:46 remaining. Tatum then muscled in a layup and was fouled by T.J. McConnell. He completed the three-point play to put Boston ahead for good.\n\nThe Pacers turned it over again, this time by Haliburton. The ball found its way to Tatum at the top of key. He pumped, sidestepped a defender and sunk a 3 to make it 127-123 with 43 seconds left.\n\nWhite and Siakam traded layups. Holiday was fouled and hit two free throws to give Boston a 131-125 cushion.\n\n\"It's unfortunate we did so many good things in this game that it came down to a couple of mistakes at the end, but it's the NBA playoffs,\" Carlisle said. \"We've got to learn from it and we've got to bounce back.\"\n\nLatest on SportstarOffside: Shed a tear for there will never be another like themAyon SenguptaNBA: Tatum scores 36 as Celtics edge Pacers 133-128 in Game 1 of East finals APSam Curran: 'Impact Player rule is quite confusing' Shayan AcharyaIPL 2024: 'All we can do is get a win, and the rest will look after itself,' SRH assistant coach Helmot ahead of PBKS clashV.

The Celtics managed to survive the chaos of the fourth quarter and overtime, thanks to heroics from Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum. The Celtics' battle-tested experience proved to be their advantage over the Pacers in Game 1.\n\nThe 2024 NBA Playoffs have been a doozy, to say the least, and Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals between the Boston Celtics and the Indiana Pacers lived up to the billing. In the end, the No. 1 seeded Celtics managed to survive a resilient effort from the Pacers with a 133-128 overtime win.\n\nIndiana looked well on its way to stealing Game 1. However, the inexperienced Pacers committed some costly miscues down the stretch and the battle-tested Celtics took advantage.\n\nFollowing the game, Jayson Tatum gave a candid NSFW response about his thoughts on the crazy fourth quarter finish that saw Boston showcase its resiliency.\n\n\"That s--- was chaos. That s--- was wild. But... to stay present, stay in the moment. As long as there's time still on the clock and the game is within reach, we feel like we have a chance. This core group has had so many big-time games and big-time moments... I've had a lot of crazy endings in this building.\" - Jayson Tatum\n\nCeltics Survive Game 1 With Wild Sequence Boston's experience came through\n\nThe Pacers had the Celtics on the ropes. With a three-point lead, they had possession of the ball multiple times down the stretch and just needed to play the foul game to complete the series-opening shocker.\n\nHowever, Indiana's inexperience showed, and the team committed multiple miscues within the final 30 seconds of regulation. With a chance to pad onto their lead, Tyrese Haliburton lost the ball while running down the floor, which gave possession back to the Celtics with 27 seconds remaining.\n\nBoston failed to score after Derrick White and Jayson Tatum missed their respective shot attempts. This gave the Pacers the golden opportunity to close out the game. However, Indiana turned the ball over again in the backcourt with 10 seconds left, leaving the door open for the Celtics.\n\nAnd the battle-tested Celtics took advantage. Jaylen Brown came through with the biggest shot of the evening, tying the game with a cold-blooded corner three-pointer that sent the game into overtime.\n\nTatum Takeover In Overtime The Celtics star scored 10 of Boston's 16 points in OT\n\nIf there's one thing to avoid in the NBA playoffs, it's giving a great team like Boston some life. That's, unfortunately, what the Pacers did when they failed to close out the Celtics in regulation. Indiana already had Boston dead in the water. But poor execution down the stretch in the fourth quarter, which Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle took responsibility for, cost them the game.\n\nCeltics Stars in Game 1 vs. Pacers\n\nCategory\n\nJayson Tatum\n\nJaylen Brown\n\nJrue Holiday\n\nPTS\n\n36\n\n26\n\n28\n\nREB\n\n12\n\n7\n\n7\n\nAST\n\n4\n\n5\n\n8\n\nFG-A\n\n12-26\n\n10-20\n\n10-16\n\nWith that, not only did the Celtics take advantage, it also gave Jayson Tatum the opportunity to redeem himself. Tatum had an abysmal fourth quarter. He went just 2-of-7 from the field and missed a wide-open three-pointer during a crucial junction that would have tied the game.\n\nFortunately, Brown was able to save the day for the Celtics, and this opened the door for his fellow All-Star to \"wake up\" and show just what he's made of in the extra period.\n\nTatum scored 10 of Boston's 16 overtime points. He converted on an and-one to give Boston a lead that they did not relinquish and later made the put-away punch, a side-step three-pointer that gave the Celtics a four-point lead with over 40 seconds to go in OT.\n\nAs Tatum said in his post-game comments, Boston has been here before. And in Game 1, their experience and composure proved to be their advantage down the stretch against the up-start Pacers.\n\nRelated Tyrese Haliburton Says Pacers Were Great for 47 Minutes After Brutal Game 1 Loss Tyrese Haliburton said the Pacers need to focus on closing out games after they blew a late lead to the Celtics in Game 1.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-22-may-2024-01-29-am-2903.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

He scored 10 points in overtime, including five straight that gave the Celtics a 127-123 lead with 42.9 seconds to play.\n\nJrue Holiday added 28 points and Brown finished with 26 for Boston.\n\nAndrew Nembhard canned a 3-pointer to put the Pacers up 115-110 with 1:57 remaining in the fourth quarter, but then the Celtics took over.\n\nHoliday converted a layup and Brown sank two free throws to get Boston within one, 115-114, with 57.4 seconds to go. Nembhard stemmed the tide with a jumper, and Indiana took its 117-114 edge into what was originally supposed to be the game's final seconds.\n\nBut Brown knocked down a trey from the corner, knotting things at 117 with 6.1 seconds on the clock. Indiana star guard Tyrese Haliburton missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer, sending the contest to overtime.\n\nThree free throws from Haliburton in the extra session put the Pacers ahead 123-121 with 1:46 left, but Tatum answered with a three-point play, and the Celtics never gave up the lead the rest of the way.\n\nHaliburton had 25 points and 10 assists. Pascal Siakam finished with 24 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists for the sixth-seeded Pacers, who received 23 points from Myles Turner.\n\n\"Our guys just need to concentrate on fighting the way they fought in (Game 1) from start to finish, and we'll be back Thursday,\" Indiana coach Rick Carlisle said. \"We did a lot of good things that we need to continue to do. We've been a tough-minded and resilient team, really for almost the entire second half of the year. We have to continue with that and come back in here on Thursday night.\"\n\nIndiana made 9 of 10 free throws in the game. Boston was 24-for-30 from the foul line.\n\nThe Pacers committed 22 turnovers that led to 32 Celtics points.\n\nThe Celtics led 34-31 after one quarter, and it was 64-64 at halftime. The Pacers used a 9-0 spurt to pull within four points, 92-88, late in the third quarter, and they trailed 94-93 entering the fourth.\n\n\"They scored a lot of points in transition,\" Brown said. \"We gotta clean that up. We want to get them in a half-court game as much as possible.\n\n\"Defense is where we have to hang our hat. We have to make sure we execute on defense and the majority of it is transition -- getting back in transition. No layups. Gotta run.\"\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/unionleader.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/36/f36f49bf-8197-5185-a3cc-d03035fe9214/664dfa2d597f5.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

He scored 10 of them during overtime after Jaylen Brown's tying 3-pointer with 6.1 seconds left in the game. Boston made a timely comeback that resulted in a victory over the Pacers.\n\nAlong with Tatum, Jrue Holiday added a season-high 28 points, seven rebounds, and 8 assists, and Brown finished with 26 points, 7 rebounds, and five assists.\n\nThe Celtics became the first team in the history of NBA Playoffs that there were three players totaling 25+ points and three steals in a game. This is the ninth time that this has happened in a Conference Finals game ever.\n\nAlthough the Celtics struggled for most of the game with shooting in the 3-point range, they still ended the match with 15 of 45 being knocked down from beyond the arc.\n\n\"Welcome to the NBA playoffs. You've just got to manage your emotions. Anything can happen. It's not over until the final buzzer sounds. It's not over until it's over.

Lastly, Myles Turner with 23 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nHaliburton shot 13 of his 3-pointers and scored 56 points in the paint against the Celtics.\n\nBut Boston leveled up their defense. They finished with 11 steals, three of which were done by Brown, Tatum, and Holiday.\n\nThe Pacers took the lead at 123-121 after Haliburton made all three free throws after being fouled with 1:46 left. T.J. McConnell fouled Tatum after powering through for a layup. He completed the three-point play to secure the Celtics lead for the rest of the game.\n\nThe Pacers had a turnover again, this time by Haliburton. The ball ended up in Tatum's hand at the top of the key. He pumped, sidestepped a defender, and nailed a 3-pointer that made the score 127-123 with 43 seconds remaining.\n\nWhite and Siakam exchanged layups. After Holiday was fouled, he made two free throws which gave the Celtics a lead, 131-125.\n\n\"It's unfortunate we did so many good things in this game that it came down to a couple of mistakes at the end, but it's the NBA playoffs.

Game 2 is set for Thursday night in Boston.\n\nDefense was in short supply for much of the game, and Indiana thrived playing fast and aggressive. Boston couldn't quite contain the Pacers, even as the Celtics own scoring attack looked polished and methodical. The resulting foot race kept things close from wire to wire. It took Jaylen Brown connecting on an improbable corner 3-pointer to force overtime. Boston's defense in that overtime period proved to be the key, with Jayson Tatum providing his own heroic 3-pointer to secure a tight Celtics win. Tatum and Brown combined for 62 points, 19 rebounds, and 9 assists in the win.\n\nLet's take a closer look Boston's 133-128 thrilling overtime victory and recap the action from Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nFirst Quarter\n\nThe Celtics owned the NBA's best offensive rating this year, while Indiana has been an average defensive team. After Boston jumped out to a quick 12-0 lead to open the game, it appeared as if the Pacers were overmatched.\n\nIndiana owns the NBA's second-best offensive rating, however, and they soon went on a run of their own. The Pacers defense never really found its footing in the quarter, but thanks to a bevy of shooting, the road team nearly closed the gap by the end of the frame.\n\nBoston's defense looked ok, but Indiana's speed took advantage of any sluggishness on the part of the Celtics. Boston led 34-31 by the close of the quarter.\n\nSecond quarter\n\nThe second quarter looked much like the first. Boston moonwalked on offense, and looked steady and composed. Once again, the Celtics weren't bad on the defensive end, but Indiana eeked out every advantage they could.\n\nThe Pacers looked better on the glass. They had more assists. They worked hard to keep up with Boston, and were rewarded for their effort.\n\nIndiana was particularly efficient from deep. They shot a tidy 8-for-15 on 3-pointers in the first half. Not only did this prevent the Celtics from pulling away, but a deep 3 from Haliburton actually tied the game at 64-64 right before halftime.\n\nThird quarter\n\nMay 21, 2024; Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Indiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton (0) shoots the ball over Boston Celtics guard Jrue Holiday (4) in the first half for game one of the eastern conference finals for the 2024 NBA playoffs at TD Garden. Mandatory Credit: David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBoston remained hot on the offensive end. Even before the middle of the third quarter, all five Celtics starters were in double-figures scoring the ball. Part of this success had to do with Boston's patience in getting to the free throw line.\n\nFor the game, the Celtics shot 24-for-30 from the foul line, compared to a 9-for-10 showing from the Pacers. Boston's ability to slow the action down by getting more physical at the rim was a massive pivot for the game.\n\nIndiana's high-octane offense got bogged down a bit as a result, although it recovered a bit as the period came to a close. Another improbable 3-pointer from Haliburton put the score at 94-93 with the final quarter on deck.\n\nFourth quarter\n\nThe Celtics were at their best all game long with Tatum on the floor. His unique combination of size, speed, and playmaking was too much for Indiana to handle, and many of Indiana's best stretches during the game came while the former Duke Blue Devil rested. Tatum had 36 points, 12 rebounds, 4 assists, and 3 steals here in Game 1.\n\nThe Pacers refused to quit, however. Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner both benefitted from Boston's drop defense, gobbling up a number of open looks in the mid-range. This fueled Indiana to a late lead.\n\nJaylen Brown helped save the game for the Celtics. He forced a turnover on the Pacers side of the action with Boston down 3 points before banking in a heroic shot on the opposite end. Free basketball for the crowd at TD Garden.\n\nOvertime\n\nIn overtime Boston found their defensive footing once again. The Celtics forced a number of critical turnovers in this extra period. In total, the Pacers had 21 giveaways for the game, a testament to how effective Boston's defensive was when it was dialed in.\n\nCredit Brown for forcing overtime. And credit Tatum for giving Boston offensive lift at a crucial moment. In the end, though, it was defense that won the day for the Celtics and delivered a big Game 1 victory.\n\nListen to the \"Celtics Lab\" podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3zBKQY6\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3GfUPFi\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3F9DvjQ\n\nWhat will the Boston Celtics' looming Eastern Conference finals series with the Indiana Pacers look like?

We've seen it. We've been hearing it. Now we just have to come out and execute and be better. We will.\"\n\nGame 2 of the Eastern Conference finals is scheduled for Thursday, May 23, in Boston.\n\nJayson Tatum collected a game-high 36 points and 12 rebounds in Boston's Game 1 victory against Indiana. He scored 10 points in overtime, including five straight that gave the Celtics a 127-123 lead with 42.9 seconds to play.\n\nJrue Holiday added 28 points and Brown finished with 26 for Boston.\n\nAndrew Nembhard canned a three-pointer to put the Pacers up 115-110 with 1:57 remaining in the fourth quarter, but then the Celtics took over.\n\nHoliday converted a layup and Brown sank two free throws to get Boston within one, 115-114, with 57.4 seconds to go.\n\nNembhard stemmed the tide with a jumper, and Indiana took its 117-114 edge into what was originally supposed to be the game's final seconds.\n\nBut Brown knocked down a trey from the corner, knotting things at 117 with 6.1 seconds on the clock.\n\nIndiana star guard Tyrese Haliburton missed a three-pointer at the buzzer, sending the contest to overtime.\n\nThree free throws from Haliburton in the extra session put the Pacers ahead 123-121 with 1:46 left, but Tatum answered with a three-point play, and the Celtics never gave up the lead the rest of the way.\n\nHaliburton had 25 points and 10 assists. Pascal Siakam finished with 24 points, 12 rebounds, and 7 assists for the sixth-seeded Pacers, who received 23 points from Myles Turner.\n\n\"Our guys just need to concentrate on fighting the way they fought in (Game 1) from start to finish, and we'll be back Thursday,\" Indiana coach Rick Carlisle said.\n\n\"We did a lot of good things that we need to continue to do. We've been a tough-minded and resilient team, really for almost the entire second half of the year. We have to continue with that and come back in here on Thursday night.\"\n\nIndiana made 9-of-10 free throws in the game. Boston was 24-for-30 from the foul line.\n\nThe Pacers committed 22 turnovers that led to 32 Celtics points.\n\nThe Celtics led 34-31 after one quarter, and it was 64-64 at halftime. The Pacers used a 9-0 spurt to pull within four points, 92-88, late in the third quarter, and they trailed 94-93 entering the fourth.\n\n\"They scored a lot of points in transition,\" Brown said. \"We gotta clean that up. We want to get them in a half-court game as much as possible.\n\n\"Defense is where we have to hang our hat. We have to make sure we execute on defense and the majority of it is transition - getting back in transition. No layups.

Instead of taking care of business early on against the Indiana Pacers, the C's clutched up and prevailed 133-128 in overtime to take a 1-0 series lead in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nBoston led by as much as 13 points late in the third quarter, yet Indiana roared back to make it a one-point contest heading into the final frame. The Pacers used that momentum to hit shot after shot and held a 117-114 advantage with 46.1 seconds left in regulation.\n\nThe Green Team never waved the white flag, though. Boston forced some timely turnovers and star Jaylen Brown nailed a corner triple to tie it up with six seconds remaining.\n\nFrom there, the Celtics outscored the Pacers 16-11 in overtime.\n\nThis series opener probably should've belonged to the Pacers, however, the Celtics overcame the most adversity they've faced all postseason to steal the win. So, let's examine three takeaways from Boston's tight victory over Indiana in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nThe Celtics showed their resiliency\n\nPrior to their semifinal showdown with the Pacers, the Celtics only had one postseason game decided by single digits. Outside of their 109-102 win in Game 4 over the Cleveland Cavaliers, all of Boston's contests hadn't been particularly close.\n\nThis lack of a truly close victory, fair or not, was held against the Celtics. Some pundits wondered whether or not they could take over in the clutch if they'd never been \"battle-tested\" in the 2024 playoffs.\n\nIn Game 1 versus the Pacers, Boston proved its grit in a stunning comeback that was the definition of a late-game battle.\n\nWith only 10 ticks left in regulation, Indiana had a 97.4% chance of taking a 1-0 series lead, according to ESPN's analytics. Rather than giving up, Brown prevented the Pacers from properly inbounding the ball and then drained the game-tying triple:\n\n\"One, it was just a momentum play that we was able to turn them over and get an extra possession, and that led to a great drive, Jrue made a great pass, [Derrick] White set a good screen, and the rest was history,\" Brown described when asked about his big shot during his postgame presser.\n\nThe Celtics had blown multiple double-digit leads in regulation, yet they didn't let that shake their confidence when it mattered most.\n\n\"Welcome to the NBA playoffs. You just got to manage your emotions, in the game anything can happen,\" Brown stated. \"The game is not over until the final whistle -- the final buzzer sounds. That was a good example of that. We were able to turn it over a little bit towards the end. We had [Tyrese] Haliburton on the sideline, and I was able to get the deflection off of [Pascal] Siakam, that just extended the game. It's not over until it's over. We just found a way to win the game at the very end.\"\n\nAlthough Boston had all the momentum following Indiana's last-second collapse, there was still work to be done. During the regular season, the Celtics had a rough 2-4 record in overtime games, shooting 38% from the field during those extra periods.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, the C's shot 40% from the field in overtime while holding Indiana to just 25% from the floor. Celtics star Jayson Tatum had 10 of Boston's 16 points in the final five minutes, which nearly surpassed the Pacers' overtime point total of 11 points.\n\n\"It really just felt like we had a second chance,\" Tatum said of overtime in his postgame remarks. \"JB gave us a second chance by hitting that shot. And we just talked about it in the huddle. 'We got a second chance. Let's take advantage of it. Let's not mess around. And let's figure out a way to win this game.'\"\n\nFor all the doubts about Boston's preparedness for a hard-fought competition, the Celtics found a way to win in their toughest playoff game yet.\n\nThe Celtics stars aren't afraid to do the dirty work on defense\n\nIn the modern NBA, defense isn't that glamorous. The players who dazzle on offense typically get the most love from the media and fans. As a result, some stars don't emphasize the importance of that aspect of the game.\n\nThankfully for the Celtics, their stars don't typically follow this train of thought. In fact, Tatum and Brown made some of the biggest defensive plays of the night to help clinch the win.\n\nBrown forced a pivotal turnover from Siakam and had three steals overall. Tatum also had three steals and made Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton attempt a wild 3-pointer at the end of regulation. The six combined steals from Boston's dynamic duo nearly equaled the eight steals Indiana had altogether.\n\nHaving two-way stars that are on a mission on both offense and defense is a massive boon for the Celtics. Without that, and award-winning defense from guards Derrick White and Jrue Holiday, Boston wouldn't have even made it to overtime in Game 1.\n\nHowever, Indiana still managed to shoot 53.5% from the field despite the loss. Brown and company know they have work to do on that side of the ball ahead of Game 2:\n\n\"I think just trying to be as consistent as possible on the boards, trying to stop them from transition. They pass the ball up so well, they move the ball so well, especially off the rebound, that sometimes it gets tough,\" he said when asked how the Celtics can slow the Pacers' efficient offense down. \"But something we'll probably go back and take a look at is transition defense.\"\n\nThe Celtics will need more from their bench to counter the Pacers' depth\n\nBoston was fortunate to escape with a 1-0 series lead, and they know they'll need to improve to triumph in this series.\n\nThe bench is particularly aware of that, because without the scoring of center Kristaps Porzingis for the time being, someone else has to step up for the Celtics.\n\nSo far, point guard Payton Pritchard has done his best to contribute off the bench. He notched eight points and two assists in Game 1 and performed well enough to get four minutes in the fourth quarter.\n\nBesides him, Boston's bench was underwhelming in comparison to Indiana's. Pritchard, forward Sam Hauser, and center Luke Kornet combined for 13 points off the pine, while the Pacers' bench had 30 points altogether.\n\nHauser especially struggled, as he bricked his two attempts from deep and had to be subbed out before the end of the first half due to his poor defense.

Despite being massive favorites to win the series, the Celtics nearly let the Pacers steal Game 1 at TD Garden on Tuesday night.\n\nUntil Jaylen Brown stole it right back, sinking a game-tying corner three with 5.9 seconds left in regulation. Then Jayson Tatum took over in overtime, while Jrue Holiday continued to have his best game in a Celtics uniform.\n\nWho says these Celtics aren't battle tested?\n\nIt was frustrating that it even came to that, but we've come to expect that from the Celtics. They went ice cold for a three-minute stretch in the fourth quarter and seemed destined start the Conference Finals with a massive disappointment for a second straight postseason.\n\nThe Celtics didn't play in many close games during the regular season and only one of their previous 10 playoff games was decided by single digits, so questions about their championship mettle have been prevalent since the end of their second-round win over the Cavaliers. The Celtics nearly gave those doubters a lot of fresh ammo on Tuesday night.\n\nInstead, they won a game they really should have loss. It took a lot of guts at the end, a lot of big plays, and a whole lot of luck.\n\nThey're lucky that the Pacers didn't call a timeout to advance the ball before Brown forced a turnover. They're lucky the Pacers didn't foul Brown (who has struggled at the line this postseason) before he put up his game-tying three. They're lucky the Pacers coughed up their chance to put them on the ropes in this series.\n\nBut in the playoffs, it's better to be lucky than to be losers. Now the Celtics have a signature moment of this postseason, and a chance to go up 2-0 on Thursday night.\n\nTatum and Brown (mostly) played like stars\n\nBoth had their frustrating moments, whether it was an untimely turnover or forced shots. They were both pretty cold from downtown, with Tatum going 2-for-8 and Brown just 1-for-4 from deep.\n\nBut they were stars when the Celtics needed them to be stars. All Indiana had to do was inbound the ball to win at the end of regulation, but Brown velcro'd himself to Pascal Siakam and forced a Pacers turnover, setting up his game-saving three and the biggest made bucket of his career. He had another big defensive play with 37 seconds left in overtime, stealing the ball from Siakam for his third swipe of the night.\n\nAs Brown said after the game, Tatum \"woke up\" in overtime and scored 10 points to close the game. He hit a big three of his own (after missing one near the end of regulation) with 42.8 seconds left to essentially break Indy's back.\n\nTatum led all scorers with 36 points to go with a dozen rebounds. Brown finished with 26 points, seven rebounds, and five assists. They weren't perfect, but they stepped up big when they had to.\n\nJrue Holiday was a boss\n\nThis game was the exact reason every contender dreamt of adding Holiday over the summer. The veteran was as cool as a cucumber as havoc played out on the court, scoring 20 of his 28 points after halftime. Fresh off his All-Defensive second team nod efearlier in the afternoon, Holiday made a number of huge defensive plays in Game 1. In overtime, he bodied Haliburton on an in-bounds play and forced him to lose the ball out of bounds, setting up the possession that ended with Tatum's crushing three.\n\nIn addition to those 28 points, Holiday added eight assists, seven rebounds, and three steals to his ledger. He played 48 minutes on Tuesday, and was awesome for all of them. Simply awesome.\n\nThe Celtics got to the free-throw line\n\nThe Celtics did a great job waiting out Indiana's defense and drawing fouls. Boston got to the line 30 times in Game 1, scoring 24 points at the charity stripe.\n\nTatum was 10-for-12 at the line, matching his postseason-high for trips to the free-throw line. Brown worked his way into eight freebies on the night, but hit only five of them.\n\nIf the Pacers are going to let the Celtics attack the rim and send them to the line, Boston should keep taking advantage of it.\n\nThey found a way\n\nWas it pretty? No, absolutely not. But to win a title, you have to win ugly at times. A lot of people questioned if the Celtics could win ugly heading into this series, and if they had what it took to win close games.\n\nDespite putting themselves in a precarious position at the end of regulation, they found a way to rise from the dead and win Game 1. In the end, that should give the players a little more confidence, and make us feel a little bit better about the team.\n\nGoing cold in the fourth quarter\n\nAfter Holiday gave the Celtics a 104-101 lead by tipping in his own miss with with 7:29 left, the Celtics went over three minutes without points. Boston went 0-for-4 from the floor with two Brown turnovers before White ended the drought with a three at the 4:14 mark.\n\nThe Celtics had two offensive rebounds over that stretch, and missed both second-chance looks. Usually going that cold at that point in the game would sink a team. The Celtics were lucky they were able to overcome that stretch.\n\nFinishing quarters\n\nOn a number of occasions it felt like the Celtics were one make or one stop away from really blowing the game open. But each time that opportunity surfaced, they let Indiana get right back into the contest.\n\nAfter going up 29-20 near the end of the first quarter, the Celtics let the Pacers score six straight points. The two teams traded buckets before Obi Toppin ended the frame with a layup, and Boston led by just four points going into the second quarter.\n\nThe Celtics were up by eight points with less than five minutes left in the second quarter, but went into the locker room with the game tied, 64-64. They held a 13-point lead with 4:15 to go in the third quarter, but then let the Pacers go on a 16-4 run and held just a one-point lead going into the fourth. We've already touched on their cold spell in the fourth quarter.\n\nThey even tried to blow it at one point in overtime, when a bad pass by Tatum was picked off by Haliburton, followed by White fouling the Pacers star while he shot a three. His three freebies gave Indiana a 123-121 edge with 1:48 left, but that was the last time the Pacers held a lead.\n\nThe Celtics just got too comfortable after building a lead and put things on cruise control. They should know better than that against a team like the Pacers that can put points up in a hurry. Hopefully Tuesday night was the only reminder they'll need.\n\nThe Boston bench had a rough night\n\nPayton Pritchard provided a spark in the first quarter and had eight points off the bench, but was a minus-15 over his 23 minutes. Luke Kornet looked lost on defense for large stretches, and the Pacers attacked him at will. Sam Hauser played only nine minutes, but he missed both of his shots, turned the ball over, was whistled for a foul, and was a minus-8.\n\nThe Celtics got just 13 points from their bench in Game 1. Toppin scored 15 all by himself off the Indy bench, while T.J. McConnell put in 16 points off 6-for-11 shooting.\n\nPritchard will get more chances to hit shots, but Joe Mazzulla may have to look elsewhere on the bench for some much-needed production from his second unit. If Xavier Tillman is available on Thursday night, look for him to get some more run over Kornet.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Hauser", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Hauser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obi Toppin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

The Celtics become the first team in NBA playoff history to have three players record 25 points and three steals in a game.\n\n\"We keep talking about protecting home court,\" Celtics forward Al Horford said. \"It's whatever it takes.\"\n\nPascal Siakam added 24 points and 12 rebounds. Myles Turner finished with 23 points and 10 rebounds for the sixth-seeded Pacers, who twice turned it over with a three-point lead in the final 30 seconds of regulation.\n\nBrown made them pay for the second one, hitting a three-pointer from the corner with Siakam in his face to tie it at 117-117.\n\n\"Jaylen had great balance,\" Celtics Coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"Great pass, great shot.\"\n\nPacers Coach Rick Carlisle said the loss was \"totally on me\" for not calling a timeout to advance the ball before their turnover that set up Brown's shot.\n\nAsked about the 21 turnovers Indiana committed, Haliburton said many of them were preventable.\n\n\"I think it's more on us,\" he said. \"I just felt like more of them were probably on us than them forcing turnovers.\"\n\nThe Celtics are now 2-2 in the playoffs when their opponent scores 100 or more points.\n\n\"I think we always knew that there's always a chance.

Tatum then muscled in a layup and was fouled by T.J. McConnell. He completed the three-point play to put Boston ahead for good.\n\nThe Pacers turned it over again, this time by Haliburton. The ball found its way to Tatum at the top of key. He pumped, sidestepped a defender and sunk a three-pointer to make it 127-123 with 43 seconds left.\n\nDerrick White and Siakam traded layups.

Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton remains confident that they belong at this stage against Boston. Indiana faltered in regulation and the Celtics took advantage in overtime.\n\nGame 1 was right there for the taking for the Indiana Pacers. Unfortunately, poor execution late in regulation doomed them on Tuesday night and the Boston Celtics found a way to survive and win Game 1 in overtime to take a 1-0 lead in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nA loss like that could have demoralized a young team like Indiana. But the Pacers' young star Tyrese Haliburton continued to exude confidence that he and his group are fine and should continue to give the top-seeded Celtics a run for their money in this series.\n\n\"We know we can play with these guys. There are a lot of people out here saying we don't belong here. We don't really care. We know we belong.\"\n\nIndiana had plenty of naysayers entering the Eastern Conference Finals, but given how they played in the series-opener, the Pacers certainly proved they belong on this stage.\n\nPacers Nearly Upset the Celtics in Game 1 Indiana had Boston on the ropes\n\nThe Celtics threw the early haymakers in Game 1, going on a 12-0 run to start the game. But the Pacers remained resilient and managed to weather the early storm from Boston.\n\nThat essentially became the story throughout the majority of the series opener. The Celtics led by as much as 13 points in the second half before Indiana closed the third quarter with a 13-1 run to cut the deficit to one point heading into the final frame.\n\nThe game became a track meet in the fourth quarter. Indiana eventually gained the advantage as it went into crunch time. Pascal Siakam and Andrew Nembhard made multiple big plays down the stretch that swung the momentum towards the Pacers' favor.\n\nThe Pacers had the Celtics on the ropes and looked well on their way to a Game 1 upset when they had a three-point lead and the ball with 10 seconds remaining in regulation.\n\nAll they needed to do was finish out the game with freethrows.\n\nCeltics Hit Haymakers Late in Game 1 Boston's experience came through in the clutch\n\nHowever, Indiana's inexperience and Boston's resiliency surfaced in the end. The Pacers committed multiple miscues late in the game that ultimately cost them the series-opener.\n\nThey turned the ball over with 10 seconds to go, which opened the door for Jaylen Brown to knock down a tough game-tying three-pointer that sent the game into overtime.\n\nThe extra session then gave Jayson Tatum a chance to redeem himself after a discouraging fourth quarter. Tatum scored 10 of Boston's 16 points in the period, which included the dagger three-pointer that put the Celtics up by four with 42 seconds remaining.\n\nThat was essentially all she wrote for Indiana in Game 1. But despite the loss, Haliburton was still encouraged by how they played for 47 minutes before they faltered in the end.\n\n\"We'll go back, watch the film. There will be good, there will be bad. We'll learn from it and we'll be a lot better in Game 2.\"\n\nHaliburton and the Pacers will have their chance to tie the Eastern Conference Finals on Thursday in Boston.\n\nRelated Pacers' Rick Carlisle Takes Blame for Game 1 Loss to Celtics The Pacers opted not to foul the Celtics at the end of Game 1, up by three, and the Celtics made them pay.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-22-may-2024-10-23-am-3631.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Boston, the East's top seed, is heavily favored in the series. The Celtics won Game 1 on Tuesday night in dramatic fashion. Jaylen Brown hit a game-tying 3-pointer with less than 10 seconds remaining and Boston edged Indiana in overtime.\n\nJayson Tatum (36 points), Jrue Holiday (28 points) and Brown (26 points) all had big scoring nights, and Boston got the win after coughing up a 12-point second-half lead. The Pacers saw seven different players score at least 12 points in Game 1, but 21 turnovers -- including a few in the final minute of regulation -- hurt them.\n\nHere's everything you need to know as the Celtics and Pacers continue their series:\n\nCeltics vs. Pacers schedule, scores\n\nAll times Eastern | * If necessary\n\nGame 1: Celtics 133, Pacers 128 (OT) -- Boston leads 1-0Game 2: Thursday, May 23 -- Pacers at Celtics, 8 p.m., ESPN/fuboGame 3: Saturday, May 25 -- Celtics at Pacers, 8:30 p.m., ABC/fuboGame 4: Monday, May 27 -- Celtics at Pacers, 8 p.m., ESPN/fuboGame 5*: Wednesday, May 29 -- Pacers at Celtics, 8 p.m., ESPN/fuboGame 6*: Friday, May 31 -- Celtics at Pacers, 8 p.m., ESPN/fuboGame 7*: Sunday, June 2 -- Pacers at Celtics, 8 p.m., ESPN/fuboCeltics vs. Pacers, Game 2Where to watch\n\nTime: 8 p.m ET | Date: Thursday, May 23\n\nLocation: TD Garden -- Boston\n\nTV channel: ESPN | Streaming: fubo (try for free)\n\nStorylines\n\nTurnovers were a killer for the Pacers in their Game 1 loss.

So we have got to come out and be better,\" he added.\n\nThe Pacers came into the game on the back of a gruelling game seven win against the New York Knicks on Sunday and Boston were the fastest out of the traps.\n\nWith the loud home crowd sensing Indiana were struggling, Al Horford's 26-foot three pointer made it 12-0.\n\nThe Pacers got back into the game and levelled it 64-64 at half-time.\n\nA 13-point run in the third put Boston 87-77 up but again Indiana came back and with less than two minutes to go they led 115-100.\n\nCostly turnovers\n\nIndiana turned the ball over twice in the final 30 seconds of regulation before Brown's crucial three pointer, over the top of Siakam.\n\nWhen Haliburton was unable to get off a last-gasp shot the game went to overtime.\n\nA step back three-pointer from Tatum with 43 left put Boston four points up.\n\nAfter Derrick White's layup extended the advantage to six with 25 seconds left, the game was beyond the Pacers.\n\n\"We were able to make some plays at the end but we have got to be better to be honest, but I'll take the win,\" said Brown.\n\nPacers head coach Rick Carlisle said he was to blame for allowing the Celtics to take the game to overtime.\n\n\"The loss is totally on me,\" he said.\n\n\"With 10 seconds left in regulation, we should have just taken the time out, advanced the ball and found a way to get it in and made a free throw or two and ended the game.\n\n\"But it didn't happen and we made some other mistakes,\" he added, referring to the team's turnover problems.\n\n\"We know we made mistakes and that is an area we have got to clean up,\" said Carlisle.\n\n\"We have been a tough-minded, resilient team for almost the entire second half of the year but we have to continue with that and come back

Tyrese Haliburton said the Pacers played great for 47 minutes but didn't \"sustain\" it 48. Pacers showed great resilience in Game 1, but may regret not closing out Game 1 in Boston.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers needed one more minute of great play to steal a Game 1 win over the Boston Celtics.\n\nUnfortunately, they came up just short.\n\nThe Pacers lost Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals in heartbreaking fashion, blowing a late lead in the final minute to allow the Celtics to force overtime. Indiana had their chances in overtime, but couldn't keep up with the Celtics offense, as they fell, 133-128.\n\nAfter the game, Pacers star guard Tyrese Haliburton said the Pacers know they can hang with the Celtics and just need to focus on closing out after playing 47 \"great\" minutes in Game 1.\n\n\"Today we played great for about 47 minutes and just didn't sustain it for 48,\" - Tyrese Haliburton\n\nHaliburton said the Pacers had been \"trash\" in Game 1s in their first-round series against the Milwaukee Bucks and second-round series against the New York Knicks, calling Tuesday's game an improvement.\n\nWild Finish Between Pacers & Celtics in Game 1 Pacers and Celtics both had crucial turnovers in key moments late\n\nUnfortunately, Haliburton had a heavy hand in the Pacers' meltdown. Haliburton dribbled the ball out of bounds with 27 seconds to play in regulation and the Pacers leading by three. Though that play didn't lead directly to a Celtics basket, it did cost the Pacers the opportunity to run the clock down and perhaps get fouled by the Celtics.\n\nAfter Jaylen Brown hit a wild, game-tying three-pointer in the corner with six seconds to play, the Pacers still had a chance to win the game. However, Haliburton turned down several looks from deep while evading Celtics defenders and only got off a tough, well-contested shot as he fell out of bounds as time expired. Haliburton said he should have gotten a better final shot and that it had already replayed in his head over and over.\n\nHaliburton also had a costly turnover in overtime, as he lost control of the ball while being guarded by Jrue Holiday with 1:02 remaining and the Celtics up one. Jayson Tatum responded on the other end with a three-pointer that put the Celtics up four and for good.\n\n\"I had two bad turnovers that I feel like cost us the game ... I gotta be better and I will be better in Game 2,\" Haliburton said.\n\nHaliburton rued the unforced turnovers, calling them \"frustrating, to say the least.\"\n\nHaliburton also rejected the premise that the Pacers should feel \"encouraged\" by hanging with the Celtics. Haliburton said the Pacers know they can play with Boston, and that the team has ignored critics who have questioned whether Indiana would be in the conference finals if their previous two opponents hadn't been dealing with major injuries.\n\nIndiana did show great fight in Game 1. They looked to be up against the ropes in the opening minutes, when the Celtics stormed out to a 12-0 lead. Indiana responded and ended the quarter down only three. The Celtics also made a run in the third quarter to go up by 13, only for the Pacers to fight back within one point by the end of the quarter.\n\nThe Pacers have plenty to feel good about, including a 30-10 free throw disparity in favor of the Celtics.\n\nOf course, Boston didn't play a full 48 minutes, either. Whether Indiana comes to regret not closing out Game 1 will be a major storyline in the series going forward.\n\nRelated Jaylen Brown Says Jayson Tatum 'Finally Woke Up' Late in Celtics' Game 1 Win vs. Pacers Jayson Tatum scored 10 of Boston's 16 points in overtime to lead the Celtics to Game 1 win over the Pacers.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill_and_Spell", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill and Spell", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-07-may-2024-01-45-pm-2614.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Be disappointed. But don\u00b4t fret.\n\n\"We know we can play with these guys,\" Haliburton said. \"There\u00b4s a lot of people out there saying we don\u00b4t belong here. We don\u00b4t really care. We know we belong.\"\n\nBoston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum (0) and guard Derrick White (9) celebrate after defeating the Indiana Pacers in overtime of Game 1 of the NBA Eastern Conference basketball finals, Tuesday, May 21, 2024, in Boston. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer)\n\nWhat\u00b4s clear is that how both teams adjust for Game 2 on Thursday night will set the tone for the balance of this series.\n\nRecent history aside, the similarities between the Celtics and Pacers were on display throughout Game 1.\n\nBoth teams thrived offensively this season and did so again, combining for 261 points Tuesday night. It was the highest scoring game of this postseason and the most in a conference finals game since Boston and Detroit totaled 264 in Game 4 of the 1987 East finals.\n\nWhat was also on display were both teams\u00b4 vulnerabilities. Indiana exploited Boston\u00b4s weakened interior defense throughout, racking up 56 points in the paint. But the Celtics ultimately prevailed, benefiting from a myriad of mistakes by a young Pacers team short on playoff experience.\n\nHaliburton had two key turnovers to help the Celtics rebound from a five-point deficit in the final two minutes of regulation. First, he dribbled off his foot as he was bringing the ball up the floor with less than 30 seconds remaining in a three-point game. He also fumbled the ball out of bounds with just over a minute to play in OT.\n\nThe two miscues were part of 22 turnovers on the night for a Pacers team that came in averaging fewer than 12 per game in these playoffs.\n\nIt\u00b4s part of the growing pains Indiana coach Rick Carlisle expected his youth-heavy team would have to endure during this playoff run.\n\n\"You have to go through it to really experience what it\u00b4s all about,\" Carlisle said. \"We try to help prepare them for those experiences. But there\u00b4s nothing like going through it.\"\n\nLikewise, Boston learned in Game 1 that it can expect to continue to be pushed by an underdog Pacers team that has the depth to keep up with the Celtics.\n\nIndiana got the usual contributions of Haliburton, Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner, who combined for 72 points. But the Pacers also got a huge lift from reserves Obi Toppin (15 points) and T.J. McConnell (13 points), who helped Indiana\u00b4s reserve outscore its Boston counterparts 30-13.\n\nIt\u00b4s yet another wrinkle that makes the Pacers a hard team to prepare for, Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said.\n\n\"With their ability to play different lineups, the way they sub - they sub two or three different guys at a time. They are willing to go away from sub patterns for certain guys,\" Mazzulla said. \"You have to be wary of going to any and everything at any particular time. ... Anything is on the table versus a team like this because of their versatility.\"\n\nTatum is expecting both teams to play with renewed confidence in Game 2.\n\n\"(Game 1) being a close game going into overtime they certainly feel like they probably should have won. And we feel like we can play a lot better,\" he said. \"So, I\u00b4m excited for us to come out and respond. And just do a better job of protecting home court than we have done recently.\"\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba\n\nIndiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton (0) reacts after missing a shot against the Boston Celtics to end regulation time in Game 1 of the NBA Eastern Conference basketball finals, Tuesday, May 21, 2024, in Boston.

It took overtime, but the Celtics inched closer to a berth in the 2024 NBA Finals after a 133-128 victory at TD Garden.\n\nIt was a roller-coaster affair for Boston. At times, the Celtics looked sharp and hungry. Other times, they looked sluggish and careless. In any case, they ran their record to 9-2 in the postseason and got the Game 1 victory. More importantly, they got exactly what they needed.\n\nIn Boston's previous eight postseason victories this year, only one was by 10 points or less. Even their two losses were blowouts. The Celtics hadn't been in a game that came down to the wire. Game 1 against the Pacers did.\n\nDespite jumping out to the early lead, the Celtics and Pacers were tied at halftime. The Pacers even tattled off the first five points of the second half to take a 69-64 lead. Boston led by as many as 13 in the third quarter, but the lead never felt safe.\n\nThe Pacers had a chance to put the game away late, but turned the ball over with a three-point lead. Jaylen Brown then sent the game into overtime with an in-your-face 3-pointer. Boston outscored Indiana 16-11 in the extra session to pull out the win.\n\nIt's a victory the Celtics probably wouldn't have pulled out a year ago. Age, experience, and maturity took over against the young Pacers.\n\nCeltics star Jayson Tatum, who scored 36 points and had 12 rebounds, called the game \"chaos.\" Chaos is exactly what the doctor ordered for Boston.\n\n\"That (expletive) was chaos,\" Tatum told reporters after the game. \"That (expletive) was wild. Just stay present. Stay in the moment.\n\n\"As long as there's time on the clock, and the game is within reach, we feel like we have a chance. This core group has been in so many big-time games, big-time moments, where we've had a lead, lost it and still won or been down and figured out a way to win. I've had a lot of crazy endings in this building. In a weird way, we've been there before. We always believe.\"\n\nPacers coach Rick Carlisle took full responsibility for the loss, but in the end, Indiana committed 21 turnovers, including several in key moments. One of those came in the final seconds with the Packers holding a lead.

It's hard to explain how the Celtics were even in a position to win in the first place, but we'll do our best.\n\nOne thing to know about this series is that it will be very stressful for both teams. The Pacers are not a good defensive group, but they can really score. That means there will be stretches where the Celtics go up by double figures, and moments shortly afterward when the Pacers come roaring back. There might very well be times when the Pacers go up by double figures, but Celtics fans shouldn't despair: There's a good chance they will come roaring back as well.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Celtics held a 13-point lead in the second half, and a five-point lead in overtime, but the Pacers - predictably - rallied, and they held a three-point lead and possession of the ball with 37 seconds remaining after Jayson Tatum missed a makeable 3-pointer. Things looked bleak for the Celtics.\n\nBut the wheels came off entirely for the Pacers. Tyrese Haliburton turned the ball over by dribbling it off his knee. The Pacers got a stop, and after an ill-advised and unnecessary turnaround jumper by Tatum in the paint with 16 seconds remaining, the Pacers had another chance to put the game away up three. Things looked very bleak for the Celtics.\n\nBut once again, the Pacers threw away their opportunity. This time, Nembhard panicked up against a five-second call, and Jaylen Brown made a spectacular play disrupting Nembhard's pass to a streaking Pascal Siakam. Siakam couldn't grab it before it went out of bounds, and the Celtics had one more chance.\n\nThat set up this moment.\n\n\"Before the inbound I was talking to myself,\" Brown said. \"'If I get this shot, it's going in.' I was telling myself the whole time, you get it, it's going up and it's going in. I happened to create some space on the backside and was able to make a big-time play.\"\n\n\"It's simple,\" Tatum added. \"Big-time players make big-time plays. That was a hell of a shot he made. The deflection that gave us the opportunity to make that shot.\"\n\nIn overtime, Tatum took the wheel. The Celtics trailed by two with 1:20 remaining, but Tatum scored a layup and was fouled by T.J. McConnell, and he buried a 3-pointer on the next possession that pushed the lead to four with 43 seconds left. The Celtics held on for a wild 1-0 series lead.\n\n\"Just staying with it, man,\" Joe Mazzulla said. \"You can't have any expectations about how it's supposed to go. You miss a layup, you miss a three, you give something up, it doesn't matter. I thought our guys had that kind of mindset, and credit to him for just changing the frequency.\"\n\n2. The discussion around Tatum will be fascinating over the next few days. On the one hand, he missed two big shots - the potential game-tying triple and his turnaround jumper with 16 seconds left, which really was a terrible shot. If the Pacers hadn't lost control of their limbs, he never would have had a chance to be the overtime hero. Even in overtime, he was a little shaky - his turnover with 1:30 left led to three free throws by Tyrese Haliburton, which allowed the Pacers to regain the lead.\n\nOn the other hand, well, the Pacers did lose control of their limbs, and Tatum was the overtime hero.\n\n\"That s -- was chaos,\" Tatum said. \"That s -- was wild. But just stay present, stay in the moment. As long as there's time still on the clock and the game is within reach, we feel like we have a chance. This core group has been in so many big-time games, big-time moments.\"\n\nIn the end, Tatum scored 11 of his 36 points in overtime and finished with a 36-12-4 stat line with three steals.\n\n3. Brown, meanwhile, scored 26 points on 10-for-20 shooting to go with seven rebounds, five assists and three steals. As is often the case, he got the Celtics off to a great start offensively with 10 points on 5-for-6 shooting in the first quarter.\n\nThe Celtics needed everything from their stars, and both stars came through in a big way at the last possible second.\n\n4. Jrue Holiday had one of his best games of the postseason with 28 points on 10-for-16 shooting and a number of nice defensive plays. Haliburton will have to work for his offense throughout the series against Holiday, and he'll have to give a little more than he appears comfortable giving on the defensive end - Holiday dominated opposing guards in the post and went at Haliburton at every available opportunity.\n\n\"He was unbelievable tonight,\" Al Horford said. \"It was a lot of fun watching him just kind of go and do his thing and just put his imprint on the game. Whether it's posting up or whether it's shooting threes. He was just all over the place.\"\n\n5. The Celtics could really use Kristaps Porzingis in this series. The Pacers gave up a lot of pick-and-pop 3-pointers, and Horford struggled to take advantage consistently - he finished 3-for-12 from behind the arc. Porzingis would stress an already-stressed Pacers defense to a breaking point.\n\nThe good news? The Celtics seem to have some momentum on that front.\n\n6. Horford had a difficult game defensively - the Pacers targeted him in the pick-and-roll with some success, especially late as they tried to put the game away.\n\n\"It's hard to tell right now because the way that I prepared for the shots, that at least that I felt like I gave up, were the shots that I can be okay with the results,\" Horford said. \"Played good defense, mid-range pull up jump shots. But I definitely will go back and look at it. And even in that regard, I want to be better. So, I'll make sure that I'm better defensively for this next game.\"\n\n7. Sam Hauser missed both of his 3-point attempts and had a couple of really rough sequences, including one in the second half where he gave up a jumper to McConnell before setting an illegal screen that gave the Pacers the ball back for a final shot. Haliburton nailed a 3-pointer.\n\nHauser played nine minutes and was -8.\n\n8. This is a difficult series for Luke Kornet as well: The Pacers targeted him with pick-and-pops for Myles Turner, who shot 9-for-13 from the floor and 3-for-4 from three to finish with 23 points. With Xavier Tillman out for personal reasons, the Celtics needed to figure out a way to make it work, and they shuffled things in the second half enough to flip Kornet's -4 in the first half to a +6 in the final two quarters.\n\n9. After four quarters, the Celtics held a 23-3 advantage in free throws. They finished with 30 to the Pacers' 10.\n\nRick Carlisle opted not to complain postgame, citing the amount of money he has already lost on complaining about officials.\n\nFor what it's worth, that disparity is odd, but the Celtics were called for just 16.2 fouls per game during the regular season (second-fewest in the NBA) while the Pacers were whistled for 21.4 (most in the NBA). So while 23-3 is ... lopsided to say the least, there's reason to believe the Pacers will commit more fouls than the Celtics over the course of this series naturally.\n\n10. Game 2 will tip off at 8 p.m. on Thursday.\n\n\"[This game] doesn't prove anything,\" Tatum said. \"We won a big time game. Series is far from over. We got to come back and play well enough to win again on Thursday. I'm not trying to prove anything individually. I know the ultimate goal is to try to win a championship, but one step at a time. It's a big-time win tonight and come back and be ready for Thursday.\"", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_westerholm@boston.com", "name": "Tom Westerholm", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

So we have got to come out and be better,\" he added.\n\nThe Pacers came into the game on the back of a gruelling Game 7 win against the New York Knicks on Sunday and Boston were the fastest out of the traps.\n\nWith the loud home crowd sensing Indiana were struggling, Al Horford's 26-foot three pointer made it 12-0.\n\nThe Pacers got back into the game and levelled it 64-64 at halftime.\n\nA 13-point run in the third put Boston 87-77 up but again Indiana came back and with less than two minutes to go they led 115-100.\n\nIndiana turned the ball over twice in the final 30 seconds of regulation before Brown's crucial three pointer, over the top of Siakam.\n\nWhen Haliburton was unable to get off a last-gasp shot the game went to overtime.\n\nA step back three-pointer from Tatum with 43 left put Boston four points up.\n\nAfter Derrick White's layup extended the advantage to six with 25 seconds left, the game was beyond the Pacers.\n\n\"We were able to make some plays at the end but we have got to be better to be honest, but I'll take the win,\" said Brown.\n\nPacers head coach Rick Carlisle said he was to blame for allowing the Celtics to take the game to overtime.\n\n\"The loss is totally on me,\" he said.\n\n\"With 10 seconds left in regulation, we should have just taken the time out, advanced the ball and found a way to get it in and made a free throw or two and ended the game.\n\n\"But it didn't happen and we made some other mistakes,\" he added, referring to the team's turnover problems.\n\n\"We know we made mistakes and that is an area we have got to clean up,\" said Carlisle.\n\n\"We have been a tough-minded, resilient team for almost the entire second half of the year but we have to continue with that and come back here on Thursday night.\"", "source": {"uri": "philstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Philstar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score":

Pacers", "body": "BOSTON -- The Celtics started off the Eastern Conference finals on the right note, but it didn't come easy with Boston earning a 133-128 Game 1 win in overtime the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday night at TD Garden.\n\nThe Celtics took a 1-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.\n\nCheck out the full box score here.\n\nONE BIG TAKEAWAY\n\nNobody was giving the sixth-seeded Pacers a chance against the juggernaut Celtics heading into the conference finals.\n\nWell, the Pacers had something to say about that and still made a statement even though they came out on the losing end.\n\nThe Pacers were their usual pesky selves and continued to shoot the ball extremely well. Indiana challenged and pushed the Celtics at points and never backed down from Boston even when it start the game with a fury by scoring the first 12 points of the contest. The Pacers even overcame a 13-point deficit in the third quarter and remained unfazed during crunch time.\n\nThe same can't be said about the Celtics, who rushed 3-pointers at time in the final minutes. Jayson Tatum even missed a wide open triple that would have tied the game with under a minute left to play. But Jaylen Brown erased all of that with a shot from the corner that will live on in Celtics history if they go on to win the NBA title.\n\nThis will serve as a massive wake-up call to the Celtics. The Pacers aren't going to be a pushover like the Miami Heat and Cleveland Cavaliers. Boston showed its mettle when it mattered most, but it was supposed to be easier than this for the Celtics.\n\nSTARS OF THE GAME\n\n-- Brown rescued the Celtics in regulation. Brown knocked down a 3-pointer from the corner in front of Indiana's bench with six seconds left in the fourth quarter to level the score at 117-all. Brown finished with 26 points along with seven rebounds and five assists.\n\n-- Tyrese Haliburton was the catalyst for the Pacers. He scored a team-high 25 points and dished out 10 assists. Haliburton also had a couple of critical 3-pointers -- he hit six in the game -- including a logo trey near the end of the first half and a buzzer-beating triple to close out the third quarter. Haliburton also came up with a critical block on a Derrick White 3-point attempt late in the fourth quarter.\n\n-- Tatum came through in overtime to help push the Celtics across the finish line. The Celtics star netted a game-high 36 points on 12-for-26 shooting to go along with 12 rebounds and four assists.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Celtics and Pacers square off in Game 2 of the conference finals Thursday night.

I don't think that we think we lost the game until we actually lost the game. And that's part of the reason why we were so resilient toward the end of the game.\n\n\"Like I said, anything can happen. A couple turnovers, a great shot, great look by [Brown] or on the other end, we make a couple other shots that were wide open and it could be a completely different game. So [we're] just the type of team that's going to keep on fighting no matter how long and no matter what it takes.\"\n\nThe Pacers outshot the Celtics 53.5% to 47.5%. They also held a 30-13 edge in bench points. Star guard Tyrese Haliburton logged 25 points, 10 assists, three rebounds and three steals in the loss. Forward Pascal Siakam and center Myles Turner scored 24 and 23 points, respectively, for the Pacers.\n\nThe Celtics went on a 12-0 run off the tip off and carried a 34-31 lead into the second quarter. They continued to hold the lead until the Pacers went on a 10-2 run and tied the score several times. The score was 64-64 at halftime.\n\nThe Pacers took their first lead off a 5-0 run to start the second half. The Celtics later responded with a 15-2 run to push their lead back to double digits. The Pacers then outscored their foes 14-2 over the final 2:39 of the third quarter, but still trailed 94-93 to start the fourth.\n\nThe Pacers and Celtics exchanged the lead twice over the next few minutes before the Pacers used a 7-0 run to jump ahead once again.\n\nThe Celtics trailed 117-114 with 47 seconds remaining. Tatum and Derrick White each missed key shots over the next several seconds before a Pacers turnover set up their final possession of regulation.\n\nHoliday threw an inbound pass from the baseline to start that sequence. Brown caught the feed in the left corner. He did a quick ball fake before launching a fadeaway shot, which fell in the net and tied the score with just 5.7 seconds remaining.\n\nHaliburton missed a 3-pointer on the next possession, sending the game to overtime.\n\nThe Pacers guard redeemed himself by making a shot from downtown for the first points of overtime. The Celtics answered with a 12-3 run, which included a string of eight-consecutive points from Tatum, to snatch back momentum for good.\n\n\"As long as there is time still on the clock and the game is still in reach, we feel like we have a chance,\" Brown said. \"This core group has been in so many big time games and big time moments. ... We always believe.\"\n\nThe top-seeded Celtics will host the No. 6 Pacers in Game 2 at 8 p.m. EDT Thursday in Boston. Game 3 of the best-of-seven game series will be Saturday in Indianapolis.", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_butler@star-telegram.com", "name": "Alex Butler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_format", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoff format"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/fo8hww/picture288629320/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/18f2d82f-f09d-4062-97b6-0551de58c063", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Holiday also added eight assists, seven rebounds and three steals in his best all-around performance of the postseason.\n\nHoliday, Tatum and Brown all played at least 44 minutes for Boston, which improved to 9-2 in the playoffs. Game 2 is Thursday night on Causeway Street.\n\nThe Celtics withstood a similarly balanced scoring output from the Pacers, who led the league in points per game during the regular season. Seven different Indiana players scored in double figures, with Tyrese Haliburton leading the way with 25 points and 10 assists.\n\nPacers head coach Rick Carlisle called the Celtics \"impossible\" to defend during his pregame news conference, and they looked that way in the opening minutes.\n\nA rim-rattling Brown dunk seconds into the game -- off a Tatum steal -- ignited an early 12-0 run for Boston that also included 3-pointers from Holiday and Al Horford.\n\nThe Pacers, two days removed from the best playoff shooting performance in NBA history in Game 7 against the Knicks, missed their first six shots before finding their stroke. Indiana quickly trimmed Boston's lead and trailed 34-31 at the start of the second quarter, buoyed by 11 first-quarter points off the bench Obi Toppin.\n\nIndiana found success targeting Boston's backups during that flurry, scoring against Payton Pritchard and Sam Hauser on three successive possessions. But Pritchard with responded one 3-pointer late in the first and another early in the second, then pulled out a nifty juke to hit a midrange jumper over T.J. McConnell.\n\nThe Celtics built their lead back to double digits four minutes into the second quarter, but difficulties defending big man Myles Turner caused that to swiftly evaporate. Turner scored 12 straight points for the Pacers, all with Horford off the floor, exploiting a one-sided matchup against backup Celtics center Luke Kornet.\n\nKornet typically is Boston's third option when starting big Kristaps Porzingis is healthy. Porzingis reportedly could return as Game 4 of this series, but he's missed the last seven games with a calf strain.\n\nKornet was better in his second-half minutes, though, and was a plus-2 for the game, compared to minus-8 and minus-15 for fellow backups Hauser and Pritchard, respectively.\n\nA dunk by ex-Celtic Aaron Nesmith pulled Indiana even with 2:43 remaining in the half, and the teams proceeded to trade clutch threes in the final second, with Haliburton countering White's second-chance trey with a towering 35-footer. The two high-octane squads entered halftime tied at 64-64.\n\nBoth shot better than 50% from the floor over the first two frames, but the Pacers owned a clear edge from beyond the arc (53.3% to Boston's 31.8%) after their shaky start.\n\nBrown, Tatum and White all were in double figures for Boston at half.\n\nFive quick points from Haliburton out of the break gave Indiana its first lead of the night, but the Celtics responded with a 7-0 run to vault back ahead. After a Horford three, Brown slithered past Turner for a layup, then forced a turnover at the other end to spring Tatum in transition.\n\nWhite, Brown and Holiday then powered a 16-2 run that gave Boston its largest lead yet, 90-77. The Celtics succeeded in attacking the basket during that spurt, drawing five fouls in a span of eight possessions, and Brown delivered a defensive highlight when he swatted a Nesmith 3-pointer into the Boston bench.\n\nNesmith, Boston's first-round pick in 2020, finished with 14 points and four turnovers and fouled out in overtime.\n\nThe Celtics missed five of their 13 free throws in the third quarter, however, keeping Indiana within striking distance. And again, the Pacers rallied. Down 92-79 late in the third, they ripped off eight straight points, then cut the deficit to one with an off-balance, buzzer-beating three by Haliburton.\n\nSeconds into the fourth, it was 95-94 Pacers. The Celtics pulled back ahead on a Tatum jumper and led by five after 10 straight points from Tatum and Holiday, but Indiana drew even again on a Turner three with 5:43 remaining.\n\nIndiana led by three with a minute remaining. Two Brown free throws cut that to one, but Aaron Nembhard hit a stepback over Horford on the next possession. After Tatum missed a straightaway three that would have tied the game with 14.1 left, forced a Nembhard miscue on the ensuing inbounds pass to give Boston another shot.\n\nOut of a Mazzulla timeout, Holiday found Brown in the corner for a three that sent the Garden crowd -- rabid all night -- into hysterics.\n\nHaliburton nearly delivered another highlight-reel 3-pointer as time expired, but it missed the mark, sending the game to overtime tied at 117-117.\n\nDown 123-121 with 1:12 remaining in the extra session, Tatum drove baseline for a tough layup, drawing a foul on McConnell and sinking his and-1 free throw. Holiday promptly forced a turnover, and Tatum buried a three put Boston up four.\n\nHaliburton, Indiana's All-Star point guard, buried his face in his palms as he walked back to the Pacers bench. Indiana now will look to replicate what Miami and Cleveland did in the previous two rounds and beat Boston on its home floor in Game 2.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zack_cox@bostonherald.com", "name": "Zack Cox", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_format", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoff format"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obi Toppin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clutch (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

As the higher-seeded, heavy favorite team at home, you play with fire when you give away an early game in the series.\n\nIndiana was up by 5 with 1:43 left in regulation in the TD Garden, and they were still up 3 with 10 seconds to go when they botched an inbounds play, giving Boston one more chance to tie the game. The Pacers didn't foul and Jalen Brown didn't miss.\n\nIn overtime, Jayson Tatum took over scoring 10 points, both hitting 3s and getting into the paint and drawing fouls.\n\nBoston came from behind -- but it feels more like an escape -- and got the win, 133-128 in OT.\n\nThe Celtics lead the series 1-0 with Game 2 in Boston on Thursday.\n\nThat is going to feel like an exceedingly long 48 hours for the Pacers.\n\n\"This loss is totally on me,\" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \"With 10 seconds in regulation, we should have just taken the timeout, advance the ball and found a way to get it in and made a free throw or two and ended the game.\"\n\nBoston players sounded like they were exhaling more than celebrating.\n\n\"Would you be?\" Brown said. \"We almost dropped a game on our home floor. We need to come out and be better in Game 2.\"\n\nIt started out pretty. The Celtics race out to 12-0 lead after the opening tip -- including a successful Boston challenge -- and early on the Celtics were getting whatever they wanted against the Pacers defense.\n\nHowever, as the game settled in, Boston was happy to run with the Pacers in a free-flowing, wide-open game -- and that's exactly what the Pacers want. The Celtics were content to move the ball around on the perimeter and shoot a lot of 3s, but that plays into the Pacers' hands. Indiana's pick-and-roll also gave Boston fits all game long -- the Celtics switched but didn't want to put two on the ball and they may have to.\n\nMyles Turner was hot and scored 18 points in the first half, Tyrese Haliburton hit three 3-pointers, Obi Toppin had a spark with 11 off the bench, and the game was tied at 64-64 at the half.\n\nIn the second half, Boston did better in stretches to play north and south, but Indiana was in its groove. At the end of the game, they attacked Al Horford relentlessly, dragging him into every pick-and-roll then isolating against him.\n\nHaliburton finished the game with 25 points and 10 assists, Pascal Siakam had 24 points and 12 rebounds, and Turner had 23 points and 10 boards. Obi Toppin had a strong game off the bench with 15 points.

So we have got to come out and be better,\" he added.\n\nThe Pacers came into the game on the back of a gruelling game seven win against the New York Knicks on Sunday and Boston were the fastest out of the traps.\n\nWith the loud home crowd sensing Indiana were struggling, Al Horford's 26-foot three pointer made it 12-0.\n\nThe Pacers got back into the game and levelled it 64-64 at

twice in the final 30 seconds of regulation before Brown's crucial three pointer, over the top of Siakam.\n\nWhen Haliburton was unable to get off a last-gasp shot the game went to overtime.\n\nA step back three-pointer from Tatum with 43 left put Boston four points up.\n\nAfter Derrick White's layup extended the advantage to six with 25 seconds left, the game was beyond the Pacers.\n\n\"We were able to make some plays at the end but we have got to be better to be honest, but I'll take the win,\" said Brown.\n\nPacers head coach Rick Carlisle said he was to blame for allowing the Celtics to take the game to overtime.\n\n\"The loss is totally on me,\" he said.\n\n\"With 10 seconds left in regulation, we should have just taken the time out, advanced the ball and found a way to get it in and made a free throw or two and ended the game.\n\n\"But it didn't happen and we made some other mistakes,\" he added, referring to the team's turnover problems.\n\n\"We know we made mistakes and that is an area we have got to clean up,\" said Carlisle.\n\n\"We have been a tough-minded, resilient team for almost the entire second half of the year but we have to continue with that and come back

The Celtics were able to come out on top with a 133-128 overtime win. Jayson Tatum led the Celtics with 36 points, 12 rebounds, and he was 10-12 from the charity stripe. Jrue Holiday and Jaylen Brown each had over 25 points in the win, as well. As a team, the Celtics were able to shoot 47.5 from the floor, and they took a total of 30 free throws. The Celtics Kristaps Porzingis remains out for this game.\n\nThe Pacers had a very good offensive game in the loss as they put up 128 points. Tyrese Haliburton stole the show for Indiana. He had 25 points and 10 assists, including a couple shots made at the buzzer. Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner each recorded a 20+ point double-double, as well. The Pacers shot just 10 free throws in the loss, but they did shoot over 50 percent from the floor.\n\nThe Pacers win games on the offensive side of the floor, and this series is going to be no different. They di not play great defensively during the regular season, and they are not all the good in the playoffs either. However, Indiana is leading all playoff teams in scoring with 115.2 points per game. In fact, the Pacers lead that category by almost five full points. Indiana needs to continue this type of offensive play if they want to upset the Celtics in this game.\n\nThe Pacers allowed the Celtics to shoot 30 free throws in game one of this series. That is a big reason why they lost the game. Indiana has to stay out of foul trouble. The Pacers are not afraid to foul, but it has gotten them in trouble. If they can keep their hands off, and keep the Celtics away from the free throw line, they will have a chance to win this game.\n\nWhy The Celtics Could Cover The Spread/Win\n\nBoston put up 133 points in the first game of the series, but it was not really a surprise. The Pacers, as mentioned, are not the greatest defensive team. In the regular season, the Pacers allowed the 120.2 points per game, which was the fourth-most in the NBA. In the playoffs, the Pacers are allowing 112.4, so a little better, but still the third-most of all playoff teams. Boston should be able to have the same type of offensive game Thursday night, and win the game.\n\nDefensively, the Celtics allowed 128 points in game one. However, that is an anomaly. Boston is usually much better than that on the defensive side of the floor. In fact, the Celtics have allowed less than 100 points per game in the playoffs this season. That is something that should continue in this game. They need to find a way to contain one of either Siakam or Haliburton, but Boston should not give up another 128 points in this game.\n\nFinal Pacers-Celtics Prediction & Pick\n\nI do think the Celtics win this game. However, I think nine points is too large of a spread.

Jayson Tatum led the team in scoring.\n\nJrue Holiday was the best Celtic on the court and they don't win Game 1 without him. Don't take my word for it.\n\n\"Shoutout to Jrue. He's the reason why we won this game...\" Jaylen Brown said. \"That was special from Jrue Holiday.\"\n\nOn offense, he attacked Tyrese Haliburton on his way to a season-high 28 points on 10-of-16 shooting, adding eight assists and seven rebounds. However, his defense on Halibuton, particularly in overtime, was even more critical.\n\n\"[Holiday] is the best defender in the NBA and has been for a long time...\" Tyrese Haliburton said postgame. \"I'll learn from it and I'll be better in Game 2.\"\n\nHoliday is the one guy on the Celtics with a ring and this is exactly why Brad Stevens went and got him right before the season -- on an up-and-down night for most of the Celtics, Holiday was steady. The Celtics aren't up 1-0 in this series without them.\n\nIndiana did not take care of the ball and it cost them -- and not just the obvious turnover inbounding the ball with 10 seconds left, giving Boston and Brown one more chance to tie the game. It was all night long.\n\nIndiana turned the ball over 22 times, or 19.6% of their possessions -- in almost one-in-five trips down the court, the Pacers coughed up the ball (or had a 24 second violation, or an offensive foul).\n\nThose 22 turnovers became 32 Boston points in a game that went to overtime.\n\nIf the Pacers are going to keep the rest of this series close and have a chance to come back, they have to take care of the ball.\n\nFor much of the night -- particularly in the first half, but for stretches in the second as well -- the Celtics were happy to get sucked into the Pacers up-tempo, free-flowing game. It almost cost them the win.\n\nIndiana is not a great defensive team but they play relentlessly fast and it's easy for other teams to get sucked into that pace -- they just can't do it as well as Indiana.\n\nBoston raced out to a 12-0 lead to open the game but got sucked into Indiana's style of play, was happy to move the ball around the perimeter rather than get inside, and by halftime, it was 64-64. The Celtics did a better but inconsistent job in the second half slowing the game down and playing north/south with Tatum, Brown and Holiday driving into the paint.\n\nBoston has to play that way, if it plays Indiana's game it will lose.\n\nRick Carlisle is in the \"don't foul late when up 3\" camp -- his teams don't do it.\n\nThey didn't do it after the turnover near the end of regulation. Indiana was still up 3 with 8.5 seconds left, the Pacers didn't play to foul and Brown hit the 3-pointer to force overtime. LeBron James commented from home.\n\nLeBron and J.J. Redick discussed this on their \"Mind the Game\" podcast. It's situational, but if time and the situation allow it, LeBron is in the \"foul and give up two free throws\" camp.\n\nCould Pascal Siakam have fouled Brown? Maybe not in this case because he was so intent on fighting through Derrick White's screen below the arc (despite the Pacers being up 3) that he was late to close out and Brown got a clean look. The Pacers didn't defend that well, but they didn't appear to be looking to foul -- Carlisle's teams generally do not foul anyway. It cost them in this case.\n\nAt the end of the game, the Pacers relentlessly targeted Al Horford, even if it meant an Andrew Nembhard isolation (not exactly Indiana's best play). It worked.\n\nIt was clear throughout the game, not just at the end, how much Kristaps Porzingis, his defense, his 3-point shooting, and his mobility would matter in this series.\n\nPorzingis is targeting a Game 4 return, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported pregame. What Porzignis will the Celtics get? How is\n\nhe moving coming off a calf strain? Is he on a minute's limit? How long will it take him to shake off the rust.\n\nBoston may not get the 100% of Porzingis when he returns, but it needs whatever he can give in this series.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Stevens", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Stevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/24b3e7d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5772x3247+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa2%2Fa5%2F47815d564695bdf25a87615a5413%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2154072021", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The two teams combined for 261, the highest-scoring game so far this postseason and the most combined points in a conference finals game since 1987.\n\nThere were critical turnovers. The Pacers gave it away 22 times, their second most this season, but it didn't stop the heavy underdog from overcoming multiple double-digit deficits, including a 12-0 run by the Celtics to open the game.\n\nThere were momentum-shifting shots from long range. Pacers All-Star guard Tyrese Haliburton hit two of them, one from 35 feet just before halftime and another that banked off the backboard twice before beating the third-quarter buzzer.\n\nIt all led to the frantic final moments of regulation that featured multiple miscues by the Pacers, culminating in Celtics wing Jaylen Brown burying a contested corner 3-pointer that forced overtime and helped Boston pull off a 133-128 miracle win.\n\nNow that we're up to speed on one of the wildest games of the 2024 postseason, our NBA insiders are breaking down the biggest moments of Game 1, what could be next in Thursday's Game 2 (8 p.m. ET on ESPN) and how to describe that wild late sequence inside Boston's TD Garden.\n\nTim Bontemps: The Celtics escaped. Boston was seconds away from falling to 15-15 at home over the last three postseasons -- an inexplicable statistic for a team that lost just four games inside TD Garden this season -- and drop another game to a massive playoff underdog. And yet, Boston found a way to survive behind Jaylen Brown's game-tying 3 - and the poise and presence of guard Jrue Holiday. In many ways, this was the first true playoff game Boston has played in this postseason, and Holiday delivered everything the Celtics hoped he would when they acquired him on the eve of training camp back in September.\n\nJamal Collier: The Pacers showed they can hang with the Celtics. A few minutes into the game after Boston raced out to a 12-0 lead in the first quarter, it looked like this was headed for a blowout. But Indiana responded as it has all season, overcoming two separate double-digit deficits in the game to take the lead both times. The Pacers showed they have a blueprint to make this a competitive series against the top-seeded Celtics, especially if Haliburton can continue shooting this well. He hit six 3-pointers in Game 1, including back-to-back buzzer beaters to end the second and third quarters.\n\nChris Herring: Playoffs or not, this is going to be a wildly uptempo series -- even in the closing moments, which can and should make for more chaos than we're used to.\n\nMore importantly, we're already seeing that Indiana is likely going to lose the free-throw battle by a considerable margin each game. During the regular season, on a per-shot-attempt basis, the Pacers sent their opponents to the line at the highest rate in the league, while the Celtics sent their opponents to the stripe at the NBA's lowest rate. That dichotomy played out in Game 1. Boston got 30 free throws to Indiana's 10, and Jayson Tatum had 12 attempts by himself.\n\nBontemps: Boston desperately needs to improve its defense inside the 3-point line. Indiana shot 62.5% from 2-point range in Game 1 -- 66.1% at the end of regulation -- as the Celtics felt the loss of 7-foot-3 Kristaps Porzingis' paint protection. Brown said postgame that Boston had to adjust to Indiana's level of pace as the game wore on despite the Pacers needing to overcome a grueling seven-game series against the New York Knicks just two days ago.\n\nCollier: The Pacers have to take care of the ball. It's obvious and hasn't been an issue for the Indy for most of this season (they averaged the second fewest turnovers per game among playoff teams entering Game 1), but the Pacers got careless with the ball when it mattered most at the end of Game 1. Indiana center Myles Turner said it was the first time during this playoff run he thought the team showed its age with such uncharacteristic mistakes. Whatever the cause may be, the Pacers have to hold onto the ball in Game 2 and not allow Boston to get anywhere close to the 32 points off turnovers they recorded in the first game.\n\nHerring: After how the Pacers pulled ahead late, I wouldn't be surprised if the Celtics look for a way to tighten things up defensively in clutch time, whether it's through different switch patterns or simply playing up higher and risking leaving the rim area a bit more vulnerable; especially considering how rarely Indiana got to the free throw line.\n\nSpecifically, the Pacers carved up 37-year-old big man Al Horford from the midrange in the fourth quarter and in overtime, connecting on 6-of-9 attempts when Horford was the primary defender during that stretch. That shouldn't come as a surprise; the Pacers were the league's most efficient midrange shooting team during the regular season.\n\nBontemps: Chaotic. There were wild passes. Inexplicable turnovers. Wide open shots missing badly. It was everything that comes with the crucible of the final moments of a nip-and-tuck playoff game. Both Jaylen Brown and Jrue Holiday essentially said the same thing postgame: Boston never believed the game was over until it actually was. The Celtics may have been the only ones inside TD Garden to believe that, but they wound up being right.\n\nCollier: Unpredictable. That game went from \"close but Boston doesn't really look threatened here\" to \"wait, the Pacers are going to steal this game\" to \"Oh my, how did the Pacers blow this?\" Losing a playoff game after inbounding the ball up three points with 10 seconds remaining put the Pacers in a category with historically unlikely losers; they were the first team to drop a playoff game in such fashion since 1997-98.\n\nHerring: Ugly. Indiana had so many \"we've never been here\" mistakes. Haliburton lost the ball multiple times, and waited too long to get a shot off as time expired in regulation. The Pacers forced a terrible inbounds pass late, even though they had a timeout to spare. And none of this even touches on the fact that Haliburton looked as if he was trying to commit a late intentional foul in transition, which would have given Boston two critical free throws.\n\nIn all, Indy had more than twice as many turnovers (five) as it had field goals (two) in the final 5:30 of regulation and overtime. Boston made plenty of miscues, too. But as the favorite and the club with home court advantage, the Celtics can afford that. The Pacers can't.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzer_beater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buzzer beater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clutch (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0522%2Fr1336061_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The two teams combined for 261 points, the highest-scoring game so far this postseason and the most combined points in a conference finals game since 1987.\n\nThere were critical turnovers. The Pacers gave it away 22 times, their second most this season, but it didn't stop the heavy underdog from overcoming multiple double-digit deficits, including a 12-0 run by the Celtics to open the game.\n\nThere were momentum-shifting shots from long range. Pacers All-Star guard Tyrese Haliburton hit two of them, one from 35 feet just before halftime and another that banked off the backboard twice before beating the third-quarter buzzer.\n\nIt all led to the frantic final moments of regulation that featured multiple miscues by the Pacers, culminating in Celtics wing Jaylen Brown burying a contested corner 3-pointer that forced overtime and helped Boston pull off a 133-128 miracle win.\n\nNow that we're up to speed on one of the wildest games of the 2024 postseason, our NBA insiders are breaking down the biggest moments of Game 1, what could be next in Thursday's Game 2 (8 p.m. ET on ESPN) and how to describe that wild late sequence inside Boston's TD Garden.\n\nTim Bontemps: The Celtics escaped. Boston was seconds away from falling to 15-15 at home over the past three postseasons -- an inexplicable statistic for a team that lost just four times at TD Garden during the 2023-24 regular season -- and dropping another game to a massive playoff underdog. And yet, Boston found a way to survive behind Brown's game-tying 3 and the poise and presence of guard Jrue Holiday. In many ways, this was the first true playoff game Boston has played during this postseason, and Holiday delivered everything the Celtics hoped he would when they acquired him on the eve of training camp in September.\n\nJamal Collier: The Pacers showed they can hang with the Celtics. After Boston raced out to a 12-0 lead in the first quarter, Game 1 looked like it was headed for a blowout. But Indiana responded as it has all season, overcoming two separate double-digit deficits in the contest to take the lead both times. The Pacers showed they have a blueprint to make this a competitive series against the top-seeded Celtics, especially if Haliburton can continue shooting this well. He hit six 3-pointers in Game 1, including back-to-back buzzer-beaters, in the second and third quarters.\n\nChris Herring: Playoffs or not, this is going to be a wildly up-tempo series -- even in the closing moments, which can and should make for more chaos than we're used to.\n\nMore importantly, we're already seeing that Indiana is likely going to lose the free throw battle by a considerable margin in each game. During the regular season, on a per-shot-attempt basis, the Pacers sent their opponents to the line at the highest rate in the league, while the Celtics did so at the NBA's lowest rate. That dichotomy played out in Game 1. Boston registered 30 free throws to Indiana's 10, and Jayson Tatum had 12 attempts by himself.\n\nBontemps: Boston desperately needs to improve its defense inside the 3-point line. Indiana shot 62.5% from 2-point range in Game 1 -- 66.1% at the end of regulation -- as the Celtics felt the loss of 7-foot-3 Kristaps Porzingis' paint protection. Brown said postgame that Boston had to adjust to Indiana's level of pace as the game wore on despite the Pacers needing to overcome a grueling seven-game series against the New York Knicks that concluded just two days prior.\n\nCollier: The Pacers have to take care of the ball. It hasn't been an issue for the Indy for most of this season (they averaged the second-fewest turnovers per game among playoff teams entering the conference finals), but the Pacers got careless with the ball when it mattered most at the end of Game 1. Indiana center Myles Turner said it was the first time during this playoff run he thought the team showed its age with such uncharacteristic mistakes. Whatever the cause might be, the Pacers have to hold onto the ball in Game 2 and not allow Boston to get anywhere close to the 32 points off turnovers it recorded Tuesday.\n\nHerring: After how the Pacers pulled ahead late in Game 1, I wouldn't be surprised if the Celtics look for a way to tighten things up defensively in clutch time -- whether it's through different switch patterns or simply playing up higher and risking leaving the rim area a bit more vulnerable, especially considering how rarely Indiana got to the free throw line.\n\nSpecifically, the Pacers carved up 37-year-old big man Al Horford from midrange in the fourth quarter and in overtime, connecting on 6 of 9 attempts when Horford was the primary defender during that stretch. That shouldn't come as a surprise: The Pacers were the league's most efficient midrange shooting team during the regular season.\n\nBontemps: Chaotic. There were wild passes, inexplicable turnovers and wide-open shots that missed badly. It was everything that comes with the crucible of the final moments of a nip and tuck playoff game. But Brown and Holiday essentially said the same thing postgame: Boston never believed the game was over until it actually was. The Celtics might have been the only ones inside TD Garden to believe that, but they wound up being right.\n\nCollier: Unpredictable. That game went from \"close, but Boston doesn't really look threatened here\" to \"wait, the Pacers are going to steal this game\" to \"oh my, how did the Pacers blow this?\" Losing a playoff game after inbounding the ball up three points with 10 seconds remaining put the Pacers in a category with historically unlikely losers; they were the first team to drop a playoff game in such fashion since the 1997-98 campaign.\n\nHerring: Ugly. Indiana had so many \"we've never been here\" mistakes. Haliburton lost the ball multiple times, and he waited too long to get a shot off as time expired in regulation. The Pacers forced a terrible inbounds pass late, even though they had a timeout to spare. And none of this even touches on Haliburton looking as if he was trying to commit a late intentional foul in transition, which would have given Boston two critical free throws.\n\nBoston made plenty of miscues too. But as the favorite and the club with home-court advantage, the Celtics can afford that. The Pacers can't.", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clutch (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0522%2Fr1336061_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

The Pacers were up by three, 117-114, and had possession with less than 10 seconds remaining in regulation. Alas, the Pacers threw it all away.\n\nInstead of going up 1-0 in the series and cementing themselves as a legitimate threat to a Celtics team that has had a cakewalk of a postseason run to this point, the Pacers find themselves on the losing end after suffering a 133-128 defeat in overtime. The Pacers' meltdown on Tuesday required a comedy of errors, and that's exactly what they were guilty of.\n\nFor this exercise, we'll be examining just how detrimental each Pacers gaffe actually was, and we'll be ranking just how devastating each was in the grand scheme of their Game 1 loss to the Celtics.\n\n7. Tyrese Haliburton's fourth quarter turnover with 27 seconds to go (117-114, IND)\n\nThe Pacers were very fortunate that with 36 seconds left on the game clock, Jayson Tatum misfired on a three-pointer that would have tied the game. The Celtics went two for one and created a good shot, but Tatum clanked his open three to put the Pacers in the driver's seat.\n\nAll the Pacers had to do was burn some clock and perhaps get a chance at extending the lead to a two-possession game to put the nail in the Celtics' Game 1 coffin. Instead, Tyrese Haliburton bobbled the basketball, losing it along the sideline.\n\nThe saving grace of this Haliburton turnover was that the Pacers were able to put up a resolute defensive stand on the subsequent possession. Derrick White may have gotten a step on Nesmith, but White blew the layup. And even though the Celtics managed to corral the offensive rebound, Jayson Tatum ended up missing on a fadeaway two-pointer that would have made him the subject of vitriol had they gone on to lose the game.\n\nThe Pacers' win probability jumped up by 7.9 percent after Tatum was forced to foul Myles Turner to play the clock management game. So in the end, as frustrating as this Tyrese Haliburton turnover may be, it's not like this was their most backbreaking gaffe.\n\n6. Pascal Siakam coughs up the ball on a spin move, 37.1 in OT (127-123 BOS)\n\nPascal Siakam had himself a solid Game 1. But he wasn't much of a factor for the Pacers late in the fourth quarter and in overtime. The Pacers, however, looked towards Siakam to get them a quick bucket to trim the lead to two on a two for one opportunity. However, Siakam was unable to shake Jaylen Brown off. Brown corraled the ball that came loose from Siakam's grasp, essentially ending the game.\n\nBrown came up huge with multiple defensive stops for the Celtics, and this was one of them. It would have been more backbreaking for the Pacers if the game was closer at this point, but climbing back from a four-point deficit with around 30 seconds left was always going to be difficult.\n\n5. The Pacers' star guard hoists a difficult look at the buzzer, 0:01 in 4Q (117-117)\n\nTyrese Haliburton has run into some trouble this postseason when it comes to creating open looks for himself. He is a pull-up artist, but there are times when he doesn't have the quick first step to shake off his defender. The Pacers have adjusted by utilizing him more off the ball.\n\nBut with the game tied in the dying embers of regulation, Haliburton found himself open from three; however, the problem was that he was open from multiple feet beyond the arc. Nonetheless, Haliburton certainly had the range to give the Pacers a chance if he pulled up from that deep. Instead, he chose to come closer, attracting the help of Jayson Tatum, and then Tatum promptly clamped him to prevent a repeat of the bonkers three Haliburton hit to end the third quarter.\n\n4. TJ McConnell's foul on Jayson Tatum and-one, 1:12 in OT (124-123 BOS)\n\nOne underrated subplot in overtime of Game 1 was that Aaron Nesmith fouled out with 3:09 remaining. This forced TJ McConnell back into the game, which isn't exactly a bad thing. But the Pacers had to field a lineup of three guards; the onus to guard Jayson Tatum then fell on Andrew Nembhard's shoulders.\n\nTatum was aggressive in trying to post up Nembhard, and with a little over a minute to go in OT, the Celtics star was able to shake off his defender, with Nembhard even falling to the ground. This then forced TJ McConnell to be the last line of defense due to the Celtics' spacing. McConnell could do nothing to contest Tatum at the rim. But the Pacers guard compounded matters by hacking Tatum softly, allowing him to make an and-one layup to give the Celtics the lead.\n\nThe smart play would have been for McConnell to just let Tatum score. Instead, the Celtics took the lead for good. But it's hard to blame McConnell too much for this, as the Pacers are running into a bit of personnel issue where they lack viable wings outside of Nesmith and perhaps Ben Sheppard to deal with the Celtics' stars.\n\nThe Pacers have taken plenty of haymakers from the Celtics in Game 1, only for them to come back with uppercuts of their own. After the crucial Tatum and-one, the Pacers were only down by one. Their offense has been on point for most of the night, so they had a good chance to regain the lead.\n\nInstead, they didn't even get a shot away. Jrue Holiday smothered Tyrese Haliburton, forcing him to fumble the ball out of bounds. This then led to the Tatum triple that gave the Celtics a four-point lead (this slashed the Pacers' win probability by 20.4 percent).\n\nHaliburton, as the best player of this up-and-coming Pacers team, has to be better moving forward.\n\nThe discussion surrounding the Pacers' inexplicable Game 1 loss has mostly revolved around whether or not it's the best idea to foul when up by three. However, the Pacers didn't exactly give themselves a chance to foul. Thanks to a solid screen from Derrick White, Jaylen Brown was able to catch the ball cleanly on the left corner. This allowed Brown to set his feet for a good look at a game-tying triple, which he promptly made.\n\nNow, it's unclear if the strategy for the Pacers was to go over screens. Andrew Nembhard did not show any indication that he was willing to switch. But still, Siakam was a step too late on the play. He was scrambling to chase the Celtics star, which meant that he had to contort his body to avoid fouling on a three-point attempt.\n\nOne would think that the Pacers would be more attuned to guarding the three-point line while protecting a three-point lead. The typical coverage these days that teams deploy is a switch all scheme to prevent anyone from getting up a good look from deep. But the Pacers' defense, which has put up a much better stand than their track record would indicate, faltered at the worst possible time.\n\nThat 5.2 percent decline in win probability does not fully capture how heartbreaking this play was for the Pacers. They put up two defensive stops in a row, and all they needed to do was make two free throws to seal the game for good. They did not even have to inbound from the backcourt; Rick Carlisle even admitted that he should have taken a timeout so they could use the entire court to get the ball in, draw some free throws, and ice the game.\n\nBut then there's Andrew Nembhard and Pascal Siakam's decision-making. One of the worst things a team can do is to throw the ball towards the opposing basket in this sort of scenario. Throwing it towards the baseline might be worse. But that's exactly what the Pacers did. If Nembhard was having such difficulty in getting the ball in, could he not have taken a timeout?\n\nThis was the play where the Pacers had the most options to seal the deal. But they let it slip away from their fingertips -- literally -- with an error of this magnitude.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jedd_pagaduan@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jedd Pagaduan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fadeaway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fadeaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_foul_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal foul (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-out_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Time-out (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ranking-Pacers-worst-gaffes-in-Game-1-collapse-vs.-Celtics.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Jalen Brown didn't miss.\n\nIn overtime, Jayson Tatum took over scoring 10 points, both hitting 3s and getting into the paint and drawing fouls.\n\nBoston came from behind -- but it feels more like an escape -- and got the win, 133-128 in OT.\n\nThe Celtics lead the series 1-0 with Game 2 in Boston on Thursday.\n\nThat is going to feel like an exceedingly long 48 hours for the Pacers.\n\n\"This loss is totally on me,\" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \"With 10 seconds in regulation, we should have just taken the timeout, advance the ball and found a way to get it in and made a free throw or two and ended the game.\"\n\nBoston players sounded like they were exhaling more than celebrating.\n\n\"Would you be?\" Brown said. \"We almost dropped a game on our home floor.

And it's whatever it takes,\" Al Horford said.\n\nIt wasn't pretty, but it was a win.\n\nIt started out pretty. The Celtics race out to 12-0 lead after the opening tip -- including a successful Boston challenge -- and early on the Celtics were getting whatever they wanted against the Pacers defense.\n\nHowever, as the game settled in, Boston was happy to run with the Pacers in a free-flowing, wide-open game -- and that's exactly what the Pacers want. The Celtics were to move the ball around on the perimeter and shoot a lot of 3s, but that plays into the Pacers' hands.\n\nMyles Turner was hot and scored 18 points in the first half, Tyrese Haliburton hit three 3-pointers, Obi Toppin had a spark with 11 off the bench, and the game was tied at 64-64 at the half.\n\nIn the second half, Boston did better in stretches to play north and south, but Indiana was in its groove. At the end of the game, they attacked\n\nHaliburton finished the game with 25 points and 10 assists, Pascal Siakam had 24 points and 12 rebounds, and Turner had 23 points and 10 boards. Obi Toppin had a strong game off the bench with 15 points. This team had a plan and relentlessly attacked Al Horford at the end of the game.\n\nIndiana did everything it needed to except execute with the lead in the clutch.\n\nBoston did.\n\nTatum finished with 36 points and 12 rebounds, Brown had 26, and Jrue Holiday had a strong game with 28 points and eight assists.\n\nGame 2 will be as much a mental test for the Pacers as a physical one. Can the Pacers bounce back after losing one they should have put in the win column?\n\nIndiana made one thing clear -- this is a series.

And they were on the verge of sending the Celtics to a stunning home loss to open this series when they had the ball and a 3-point lead with just 8.5 seconds left in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut after the Pacers threw away an inbounds pass, Brown, who had not made a 3-pointer all night, lined one up from the left corner and drilled it with 5.7 seconds left, helping send the game to overtime, where Boston rode its momentum to a 133-128 win.\n\nJayson Tatum had a rough fourth quarter and start to overtime before pouring in 8 points in the final 2:27 of the extra session to finish with 36 points and 12 rebounds. Brown had 26 points and 3 of them will be remembered for years to come. Jrue Holiday had his finest game as a Celtic, tallying 28 points, 8 assists, and 7 rebounds.\n\nTyrese Haliburton had 25 points and 10 assists to lead Indiana, which shot 53.5 percent from the field.\n\nThe Celtics coughed up a 12-point first-half lead, stormed back to take a 13-point third-quarter advantage, only to lose that, too. Pascal Siakam hit a mid-range jumper before coming up with a steal and dunk that gave Indiana a 108-104-lead with 4:33 to play in the fourth.\n\nEvery time the Celtics hit a potentially momentum-swinging shot over the next few minutes, the Pacers had an answer. Two free throws by Brown pulled the Celtics within 115-114 with 57 seconds left, but Andrew Nembhard answered at the with a tough 19-footer after Al Horford switched onto him, a trend down the stretch.\n\nAfter a timeout, Tatum lined up a wide-open 3-pointer but it was off. Haliburton dribbled upcourt and somehow simply coughed up the ball despite no defender even bothering him. But Boston was unable to capitalize. Derrick White drove and missed a layup, and Tatum's mid-range putback attempt was off.\n\nThe game seemed just about over there, but after Haliburton was fouled, the ensuing inbounds pass was kicked out of bounds, giving Boston one more chance with 8.5 seconds to play. Brown caught the ball in the left corner, faked twice, and threw in a dart that tied the score with 5.7 seconds left.\n\nHaliburton struggled to find space for a game-winner and his heave from the right arc at the buzzer never had a chance.\n\nThe Celtics led, 121-120, with two minutes left in the extra session when Tatum coughed up a turnover and the Pacers raced the other way. Derrick White lined up a block attempt on Haliburton but fouled him instead, and he hit all three free throws to put the Pacers back in front, 123-121.\n\nThe Pacers went small after Aaron Nesmith fouled out, and Tatum scored inside as he was fouled by T.J. McConnell. He made the free throw to give Boston a 1-point lead, and after another Haliburton turnover, Tatum calmly stepped into a 3-pointer and finally connected, making it 127-123 with 42.8 seconds to play.\n\nSiakam then committed the Pacers' 22nd turnover of the night, and Indiana faded away.\n\nObservations from the game:\n\n\u25aa The first two rounds of the playoffs at TD Garden just didn't feel like the playoffs. It was partly because of the undermanned opponents, partly because the Celtics lost Game 2 both times, and partly because there were few tense moments. But the start on Tuesday felt more like vintage TD Garden. Fans were standing at their seats long before tipoff, and the buzz at the opening tip was palpable. Welcome back, playoffs.\n\n\u25aa The Celtics, of course, have made conference finals appearances near annual occurrences. This is not new. But the same cannot be said of the Pacers, and during the first four minutes Indiana's nerves seemed to show.\n\nThe Pacers missed their first six shots, committed a pair of early turnovers, and stumbled around on defense as the Celtics surged to the rim with little trouble. Former Celtic Nesmith appeared particularly out of sorts. He coughed up both early turnovers, including Tatum's steal on the first possession that led to a thunderous Brown dunk, and then missed a relatively easy layup and left a wide-open 3-pointer short.\n\nThe Celtics held a 12-0 lead less than three minutes into the game.\n\n\u25aa Coaches generally condense their rotations when the playoffs arrive, but Indiana's Rick Carlisle continues to roll with his bench groups. Two minutes into the second quarter he already had used 10 players. But the approach is understandable given how productive his second unit has been.\n\nThree subs came in less than five minutes into the game, with the Pacers still reeling a bit, and helped steady Indiana. Obi Toppin had an especially productive stint, going 5 for 6 from the field.\n\n\u25aa For most of the playoffs Tatum has played the entire first quarter and started the second before getting a brief break. His sub pattern Tuesday resembled the regular-season approach, with brief breaks in each quarter.\n\nTatum appeared to be pressing a bit in the first half, determined to put an early stamp on the game. But that led to a few awkward isolation situations after the Celtics had seized control with such a big start. In the second quarter he missed a fadeaway by about a foot, had a 3-pointer blocked by Isaiah Jackson, and committed an offensive foul when he tried to clear space by pushing off. Like most of the Celtics, he did have success getting to the rim within the flow of the offense, although he missed both of his first-half 3-pointers.\n\nThe Pacers don't switch on screens nearly as often as a team such as the Heat did, so hunting mismatches is not as clear.\n\n\u25aa Tatum did show good awareness on one second-quarter possession. He passed to Horford near the left arc, and Horford quickly started looking for a path to get the ball back to Tatum. But Tatum saw Horford was being guarded by Jalen Smith and motioned to Horford to attack the rim. The Celtics big man wasted no time backing down Smith with a few powerful dribbles before scoring inside as he was fouled.\n\n\u25aa The Pacers showed in their Game 7 win over the Knicks on Sunday that their offense remains flammable. After their 0-for-6 start, the Pacers closed the half by making 27 of 40 shots (67.5 percent), including 8 of 15 3-pointers.\n\nMyles Turner was dominant. The Pacers big man had his way inside and out, with 18 first-half points on 7-of-10 shooting, along with four assists. The Celtics did not really miss Kristaps Porzingis against the Cavaliers, but this was a situation where his rim protection would have been valuable. The Pacers mostly ignored backup center Luke Kornet at both ends of the floor in the first half.\n\nIndiana never led in the first half but tied the score several times late in the second quarter, including when Haliburton's 39-footer sent the game to halftime knotted at 64.\n\n\u25aa The Pacers took their first lead in the opening minute of the third quarter, and there were some nervous groans when a Haliburton 3-pointer gave Indiana a 69-64 lead, its largest. But the Celtics had to feel good about the fact that with a quick pass and cut they could mostly get whatever shot they wanted against this defense.\n\nThe Celtics responded with a 23-6 surge that was capped by a Holiday 3-pointer for a 90-77 lead, their largest, with 4:15 left in the third.\n\nThis is usually the point that teams crumble against this dominant Celtics squad, but the Pacers were unbothered. They closed the quarter with a 16-4 burst and pulled within 94-93 when Haliburton leaned and banked in a 3-pointer at the buzzer. Tatum was on the bench for most of that surge.\n\n\u25aa The Pacers' defense is not great, but it is built to take away 3-point looks. It appeared that the Pacers were focused on forcing Horford to beat them from long range. Through three quarters he had attempted nine 3-pointers, while Tatum and Brown had taken just four combined.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-out_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Time-out (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_moves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball moves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

Jaylen Brown hit a game-tying 3-pointer with six seconds left in regulation to force overtime, and the top-seeded Celtics held on in the extra period to get the series-opening win.\n\nThe Pacers, who entered the game as 9.5-point underdogs, were well positioned to get a surprising win. However, they turned the ball over twice in the final 30 seconds of regulation and Tyrese Haliburton's game-winning attempt at the end of the fourth quarter was off the mark.\n\nHaliburton led Indiana with 25 points and 10 assists in the loss and hit buzzer-beating 3-pointers to end both the second and third quarters. Seven different Pacers players scored at least 12 points.\n\nJrue Holiday had 28 points -- his highest total of this playoff run -- to go with eight assists and seven rebounds. He hit half of his eight 3-point attempts.\n\nHere are three takeaways from Boston's Game 1 win.\n\nOne play doesn't decide a game, or so every coach on the planet will tell you, but we just cannot talk about anything in this game until we talk about the Pacers not fouling Boston with a 3-point lead and less than 10 seconds to play. Instead, they allowed Jaylen Brown to catch in the corner and raise up for the tying 3.\n\nNow, both Rick Carlisle and Tyrese Haliburton said the intent was to foul, but with the way Brown caught the pass already faced up to the basket with the threat of pulling the trigger immediately, Pascal Siakam made the quick and correct decision to not risk fouling on a 3-point attempt.\n\nThat's true. Once Brown caught the ball in that position, Siakam would've been playing with fire reaching in for a quick hack. The problem was Brown catching the ball in that position in the first place, which was only possible because Siakam was trailing so far behind off the misdirection screening action that Boston ran.\n\nIndiana's entire defensive alignment and subsequent execution should've been devoted to nothing except guarding the 3-point line. Matchups don't matter. Anything inside the arc doesn't matter. Watch the 3-point clip again and you will see T.J. McConnell, initially defending Derrick White, in perfect position to switch out to Brown as Siakam is tangled up. If McConnell switches he can beat Brown to the spot and either thwart a pass altogether or be in position to foul immediately on the catch.\n\nBut McConnell stuck with White, forcing Siakam to chase Brown from a step behind, and by the time he arrived it was too much of a bang-bang situation to make contact.\n\n\"As soon as I got to him, I was a little late because of the screen, he was going up so I didn't want to do it,\" Siakam told reporters of the decision not to foul. \"When I thought I was going to do it, it was a little too late... it was just a judgment call. I felt like he was going through the motion, he had a pump fake. I didn't want to foul then. And it was a tough shot, I was in front of him. Maybe I could have contested it better but it was just a tough play.\"\n\nIt was a tough shot. Give Brown credit for knocking it down. But these guys are pros. They make great shots look routine all the time. You just cannot give them the opportunity if you have any way to avoid it. The Pacers had a way. Now, I don't know if Carlisle instructed his guys not to switch or if McConnell just made a bad read, but either way, that's where the mistake happened. And it cost the Pacers big time.\n\nIndiana followed an almost perfect blueprint to win this game: Play fast as hell, keep shooting the lights out (53% and 37% from 3), hope for a down, or at least mediocre, 3-point night from the Celtics (33%), and win the bench battle (30-13) The one and only thing the Pacers did wrong was turn the ball over 21 times, which led to 32 Boston points, the most points off turnovers the Celtics have been gifted this entire season.\n\nAnd 11-point turnover margin is too much when you're already trying to pull an upset, and it was really bad when it mattered most as Indiana committed five turnovers against just two made baskets over the final five minutes and thirty seconds of the fourth quarter.\n\nIt was very fitting that the game started with an Indiana turnover leading to a Jaylen Brown dunk.\n\nThen to bookend things, Haliburton dribbled the ball off his knee with a 3-point lead and under 30 seconds to play in regulation.\n\nThen with 10 seconds left, and the Pacers still holding a 3-point lead, Andrew Nembhard couldn't get the ball inbounds and the deflection was deemed off Siakam. Celtics ball. If the Pacers simply get the ball in safely there and go make a couple free throws, or even one free throw, the game is probably over. Instead, Brown got the shot for the tie, and he didn't miss.\n\n\"This loss is totally on me,\" Rick Carlisle said. \"With 10 seconds in regulation, we should have just taken the timeout, advance the ball and found a way to get it in and made a free throw or two and ended the game.\"\n\nIt's true, advancing the ball would've given the Pacers more room to operate. That low sideline inbound spot can be tricky. But you still have to make a basic inbound pass or, if you're Nembhard, call a timeout yourself if nothing is materializing. Hindsight is 20/20.\n\nJayson Tatum led Boston's starters with 36 points while Derrick White and Al Horford were the low men with 15 each. In between, Jrue Holiday had 28 and Jaylen Brown had 26. Holiday hit four 3s. White and Horford hit three each.\n\nHoliday was particularly awesome on both ends. He created his own 3s, got to the basket and found his way to open space off the ball for easy buckets. White led the Celtics with nine assists and had one of the best defensive plays you'll see from a guard when he peeled back from out of nowhere to break up a lob pass. White also secured a game-swinging offensive rebound with the Celtics down two and a minute to play, leading to Tatum bucket to tie the game. Then he delivered the dime for the Tatum 3 that sealed it.\n\nBoston has All-Stars all over, and it's that cumulative firepower that gets you over time.

The game then went into overtime, where the Celtics prevailed, 132-128 to take a 1-0 series lead.\n\nThe Pacers led, 115-110 late and appeared to be in control with the ball and a 117-114 advantage with 10 seconds left in regulation. But they turned the ball over on a sloppy inbounds pass to breath new life into the Celtics. Brown took full advantage.\n\nWith Pascal Siakam in his face, Brown launched a 3-pointer from the left corner that found the bottom of the net as the clock read 5.7 seconds to secure the extra session.\n\nThere, Jayson Tatum scored 10 points including a 3-pointer with 42.8 seconds remaining to extend a Boston lead to 127-123. From there, the Celtics controlled game that saw dramatic swings for both sides from the game's opening tip. Boston walks with the early advantage in a series they're heavily favored to win.\n\nIndiana leaves with a bitter taste, having blown a golden opportunity to take a 1-0 advantage over the NBA's best team from the regular season as the No. 6 seed in the East. On a night where they shot 53.5% from the field and 37.1% from 3, the late turnover that set up Brown's 3-point heroics was Indiana's defining play of the night.\n\nIndiana had possession of the ball in the backcourt on an inbounds play with 10 seconds remaining. Andrew Nembhard was the inbounds man and first looked to Tyrese Haliburton on the baseline. With Jrue Holiday smothering Haliburton, Nembhard then looked to a cutting Siakam. But Brown was in close pursuit and made a play on the soft pass from Nembhard. The ball bounced off Siakam's hands out of bounds to set up Brown's game-tying 3-pointer.\n\nThe turnover was one of 21 on the night for Indiana on a night where their offense was otherwise stellar. But the giveaways ultimately cost the Pacers the game. The turned the ball over three more times in overtime, including twice in the final 1:02.\n\nThe game got off to an ominous start for the Pacers, which found themselves in a 12-0 hole less than 3 minutes into the first quarter. But Indiana's league-best offense bounced back to tie the game at 64-64 at halftime thanks in part to a logo 3 from Haliburton in the final seconds of the second quarter.\n\nThe clutch 3 was one of several from Haliburton, who shot 6 of 14 from long distance while tallying 25 points, 10 assists and three steals. He hit another early in the third quarter to give Indiana a 69-64 advantage.\n\nBut the Celtics hit back with a 13-0 run later in the quarter to take an 87-75 lead. The Pacers committed three turnovers during the Boston run. But they didn't wilt.\n\nThey responded with a 18-7 run of their own capped by another Haliburton 3-pointer at the third-quarter buzzer to cut Boston's lead to 94-93.\n\nThe fourth quarter was then taut throughout before the fateful final seconds ultimately secured the Boston win.\n\nThe Celtics matched the Pacers offense with big performances from across the starting lineup. Tatum tallied a game-high 36 points including his 10 in overtime alongside 12 rebounds, four assists and three steals. Jrue Holiday scored a season-high 28 points alongside eight assists, seven rebounds and three steals.\n\nBrown hit just 1 of his 4 3-pointers on the night. But it led to Boston's victory. He was otherwise on point while tallying 26 points, seven rebounds, five assists and three steals. The Celtics shot 46.5% from the field and 33.3% from 3-point distance and secured a significant advantage at the free-throw line. Boston shot 24 of 30 from the stripe, while Indiana hit 9 shots on just 10 free-throw attempts.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Streetball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Streetball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/isf0tv2L_Meib23V8faqFQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/9f44e710-17e4-11ef-bb47-e470b9bc455a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

The two teams combined for 261 points, the highest-scoring game so far this postseason and the most combined points in a conference finals game since 1987.\n\nThere were critical turnovers. The Pacers gave it away 22 times, their second most this season, but it didn't stop the heavy underdog from overcoming multiple double-digit deficits, including a 12-0 run by the Celtics to open the game.\n\nThere were momentum-shifting shots from long range. Pacers All-Star guard Tyrese Haliburton hit two of them, one from 35 feet just before halftime and another that banked off the backboard twice before beating the third-quarter buzzer.\n\nIt all led to the frantic final moments of regulation that featured multiple miscues by the Pacers, culminating in Celtics wing Jaylen Brown burying a contested corner 3-pointer that forced overtime and helped Boston pull off a 133-128 miracle win.\n\nNow that we're up to speed on one of the wildest games of the 2024 postseason, our NBA insiders are breaking down the biggest moments of Game 1, what could be next in Thursday's Game 2 (8 p.m. ET on ESPN) and how to describe that wild late sequence inside Boston's TD Garden.\n\nWhat is your biggest takeaway from Game 1?\n\nTim Bontemps: The Celtics escaped. Boston was seconds away from falling to 15-15 at home over the past three postseasons -- an inexplicable statistic for a team that lost just four times at TD Garden during the 2023-24 regular season -- and dropping another game to a massive playoff underdog. And yet, Boston found a way to survive behind Brown's game-tying 3 and the poise and presence of guard Jrue Holiday. In many ways, this was the first true playoff game Boston has played during this postseason, and Holiday delivered everything the Celtics hoped he would when they acquired him on the eve of training camp in September.\n\nJamal Collier: The Pacers showed they can hang with the Celtics. After Boston raced out to a 12-0 lead in the first quarter, Game 1 looked like it was headed for a blowout. But Indiana responded as it has all season, overcoming two separate double-digit deficits in the contest to take the lead both times. The Pacers showed they have a blueprint to make this a competitive series against the top-seeded Celtics, especially if Haliburton can continue shooting this well. He hit six 3-pointers in Game 1, including back-to-back buzzer-beaters, in the second and third quarters.\n\nChris Herring: Playoffs or not, this is going to be a wildly up-tempo series -- even in the closing moments, which can and should make for more chaos than we're used to.\n\nMore importantly, we're already seeing that Indiana is likely going to lose the free throw battle by a considerable margin in each game. During the regular season, on a per-shot-attempt basis, the Pacers sent their opponents to the line at the highest rate in the league, while the Celtics did so at the NBA's lowest rate. That dichotomy played out in Game 1. Boston registered 30 free throws to Indiana's 10, and Jayson Tatum had 12 attempts by himself.\n\nWhat is one big adjustment we could see in Game 2?\n\nBontemps: Boston desperately needs to improve its defense inside the 3-point line. Indiana shot 62.5% from 2-point range in Game 1 -- 66.1% at the end of regulation -- as the Celtics felt the loss of 7-foot-3 Kristaps Porzingis' paint protection. Brown said postgame that Boston had to adjust to Indiana's level of pace as the game wore on despite the Pacers needing to overcome a grueling seven-game series against the New York Knicks that concluded just two days prior.\n\nCollier: The Pacers have to take care of the ball. It hasn't been an issue for the Indy for most of this season (they averaged the second-fewest turnovers per game among playoff teams entering the conference finals), but the Pacers got careless with the ball when it mattered most at the end of Game 1. Indiana center Myles Turner said it was the first time during this playoff run he thought the team showed its age with such uncharacteristic mistakes. Whatever the cause might be, the Pacers have to hold onto the ball in Game 2 and not allow Boston to get anywhere close to the 32 points off turnovers it recorded Tuesday.\n\nHerring: After how the Pacers pulled ahead late in Game 1, I wouldn't be surprised if the Celtics look for a way to tighten things up defensively in clutch time -- whether it's through different switch patterns or simply playing up higher and risking leaving the rim area a bit more vulnerable, especially considering how rarely Indiana got to the free throw line.\n\nSpecifically, the Pacers carved up 37-year-old big man Al Horford from midrange in the fourth quarter and in overtime, connecting on 6 of 9 attempts when Horford was the primary defender during that stretch. That shouldn't come as a surprise: The Pacers were the league's most efficient midrange shooting team during the regular season.\n\nThe final moments of regulation and overtime were ____.\n\nBontemps: Chaotic. There were wild passes, inexplicable turnovers and wide-open shots that missed badly. It was everything that comes with the crucible of the final moments of a nip and tuck playoff game. But Brown and Holiday essentially said the same thing postgame: Boston never believed the game was over until it actually was. The Celtics might have been the only ones inside TD Garden to believe that, but they wound up being right.\n\nCollier: Unpredictable. That game went from \"close, but Boston doesn't really look threatened here\" to \"wait, the Pacers are going to steal this game\" to \"oh my, how did the Pacers blow this?\" Losing a playoff game after inbounding the ball up three points with 10 seconds remaining put the Pacers in a category with historically unlikely losers; they were the first team to drop a playoff game in such fashion since the 1997-98 campaign.\n\nHerring: Ugly. Indiana had so many \"we've never been here\" mistakes. Haliburton lost the ball multiple times, and he waited too long to get a shot off as time expired in regulation. The Pacers forced a terrible inbounds pass late, even though they had a timeout to spare. And none of this even touches on Haliburton looking as if he was trying to commit a late intentional foul in transition, which would have given Boston two critical free throws.\n\nBoston made plenty of miscues too. But as the favorite and the club with home-court advantage, the Celtics can afford that.

But, the Celtics' 133-128 overtime win over the Indiana Pacers in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals was arguably the craziest playoff game he's been a part of.\n\n\"That sh** was chaos. That sh** was wild,\" he said with a smile in his postgame remarks.\n\nDown three with 10 seconds to go, the Celtics looked well on their way to a brutal loss. Indiana had possession and was lighting it up down the stretch. Meanwhile, Tatum was struggling to get any kind of shot to fall in the fourth quarter, going 2-for-7 in the final 12 minutes of regulation.\n\nSo, how did Tatum and company end up taking a 1-0 series lead on Tuesday night?\n\nWhat exactly happened at the end of Game 1 between the Celtics and Pacers?\n\nAlthough Indiana had the ball and lead with just 10 ticks remaining in the fourth quarter, that quickly changed.\n\nWhen the Pacers tried to inbound the ball, 2024 All-Star Jaylen Brown helped force a turnover which gave the C's possession and an opportunity for a quick timeout.\n\nThis break in the action allowed Boston to dial up a play, and Brown delivered with a clutch 3-pointer in the corner, tying the game 117-117 with 5.7 seconds on the clock.\n\n\"I was just talking to myself, 'if I get this shot, it's going in,'\" Brown, who finished with 26 points, revealed in his postgame press conference. \"I was telling myself the whole time, 'If you get it, it's going up, and it's going in.' I can create some space on their backside, and was able to make a big-time play.\"\n\nDespite Brown's massive triple, the Pacers still had a chance to redeem themselves in regulation with one final possession. Yet, Tatum forced a tough shot attempt from Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton that was way off the mark.\n\nHeading into overtime, the Celtics had the momentum in their favor and a chance to steal Game 1.\n\n\"It really just felt like we had a second chance,\" Tatum said. \"We didn't necessarily play well enough where we may have deserved the win ... JB gave us a second chance by hitting that shot. And we just talked about it in the huddle. 'We got a second chance. Let's take advantage of it. Let's not mess around. And let's figure out a way to win this game.'\"\n\nTatum made the most of the five extra minutes of play. In overtime, he scored 10 of Boston's 16 points, going 2-for-4 from the field and a perfect 5-for-5 from the charity stripe. The five-time All-Star recorded 36 points, 12 rebounds, four assists, and three steals on the evening.\n\n\"It's as simple as just believing that the next one is going in,\" Tatum described when asked how he keeps his confidence up amidst shooting struggles. \"I always feel like I'm just, I'm one make away from being hot or being in a great rhythm. So, taking the right shots, playing within the flow of the game, and doing all the other necessary things to impact the game.\"\n\nEven though the C's went an underwhelming 2-4 in overtime games during the regular season, they outscored Indiana 16-11 in extra time. When Boston led 124-123 with under 50 seconds to go in overtime, Tatum drained a pivotal 3-pointer to give his team a massive two-possession advantage. From there, the Celtics made their free throws to clinch the narrow victory.\n\nThis rollercoaster of a game was very different from the Celtics' previous outings in the 2024 playoffs, which featured nine contests decided by double digits. However, the wild ending didn't seem too unfamiliar for Tatum, who's played in over 100 postseason games.\n\n\"As long as the time is still on the clock and the game is in reach, we feel like we have a chance,\" Tatum declared. \"This core group has been in so many big-time games, big-time moments where we've had a lead and lost it and still won or been down a lot and figured out a way to win. I've had a lot of crazy endings in [TD Garden]. So, in a weird way, we've been there before, and we always believe, in the sense.\"\n\nBoston's experience helped it weather the storm against an Indiana team that hasn't been to the Eastern Conference Finals in over a decade. Past history aside, the Celtics know they have to be better in order to curb the Pacers' blistering offense.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_donabedian@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Daniel Donabedian", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clutch (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jayson-Tatum-drops-wild-NSFW-response-to-end-of-Game-1-vs.-Pacers.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

So we have got to come out and be better,\" he added.\n\nThe Pacers came into the game on the back of a gruelling game seven win against the New York Knicks on Sunday and Boston were the fastest out of the traps.\n\nWith the loud home crowd sensing Indiana were struggling, Al Horford's 26-foot three pointer made it 12-0.\n\nThe Pacers got back into the game and levelled it 64-64 at half-time.\n\nA 13-point run in the third put Boston 87-77 up but again Indiana came back and with less than two minutes to go they led 115-100.\n\n- Costly turnovers - More from this section Cannabis Edibles Are Triggering Poisonings Among Older Users Tracking Exercise by Steps or Minutes?

crucial three pointer, over the top of Siakam.\n\nWhen Haliburton was unable to get off a last-gasp shot the game went to overtime.\n\nA step back three-pointer from Tatum with 43 left put Boston four

better to be honest, but I'll take the win,\" said Brown.\n\nPacers head coach Rick Carlisle said he was to blame for allowing the Celtics to take the game to overtime.\n\n\"The loss is totally on me,\" he said.\n\n\"With 10 seconds left in regulation, we should have just taken the time out, advanced the ball and found a way to get it in and made a free throw or two and ended the game.\n\n\"But it didn't happen and we made some other mistakes,\" he added, referring to the team's turnover problems.\n\n\"We know we made mistakes and that is an area we have got to clean up,\" said

Don't take my word for it.\n\n\"Shoutout to Jrue. He's the reason why we won this game...\" Jaylen Brown said. \"That was special from Jrue Holiday.\"\n\nOn offense, he attacked Tyrese Haliburton on his way to a season-high 28 points on 10-of-16 shooting, adding eight assists and seven rebounds. However, his defense on Halibuton, particularly in overtime, was even more critical.\n\n\"[Holiday] is the best defender in the NBA and has been for a long time...\" Tyrese Haliburton said postgame. \"I'll learn from it and I'll be better in Game 2.\"\n\nHoliday is the one guy on the Celtics with a ring and this is exactly why Brad Stevens went and got him right before the season -- on an up-and-down night for most of the Celtics, Holiday was steady. The Celtics aren't up 1-0 in this series without them.\n\nIndiana did not take care of the ball and it cost them -- and not just the obvious turnover inbounding the ball with 10 seconds left, giving Boston and Brown one more chance to tie the game. It was all night long.\n\nIndiana turned the ball over 22 times, or 19.6% of their possessions -- in almost one-in-five trips down the court, the Pacers coughed up the ball (or had a 24 second violation, or an offensive foul).\n\nThose 22 turnovers became 32 Boston points in a game that went to overtime.\n\nIf the Pacers are going to keep the rest of this series close and have a chance to come back, they have to take care of the ball.\n\nFor much of the night -- particularly in the first half, but for stretches in the second as well -- the Celtics were happy to get sucked into the Pacers up-tempo, free-flowing game. It almost cost them the win.\n\nIndiana is not a great defensive team but they play relentlessly fast and it's easy for other teams to get sucked into that pace -- they just can't do it as well as Indiana.\n\nBoston raced out to a 12-0 lead to open the game but got sucked into Indiana's style of play, was happy to move the ball around the perimeter rather than get inside, and by halftime, it was 64-64. The Celtics did a better but inconsistent job in the second half slowing the game down and playing north/south with Tatum, Brown and Holiday driving into the paint.\n\nBoston has to play that way, if it plays Indiana's game it will lose.\n\nRick Carlisle is in the \"don't foul late when up 3\" camp -- his teams don't do it.\n\nThey didn't do it after the turnover near the end of regulation. Indiana was still up 3 with 8.5 seconds left, the Pacers didn't play to foul and Brown hit the 3-pointer to force overtime. LeBron James commented from home.\n\nLeBron and J.J. Redick discussed this on their \"Mind the Game\" podcast. It's situational, but if time and the situation allow it, LeBron is in the \"foul and give up two free throws\" camp.\n\nCould Pascal Siakam have fouled Brown? Maybe not in this case because he was so intent on fighting through Derrick White's screen below the arc (despite the Pacers being up 3) that he was late to close out and Brown got a clean look. The Pacers didn't defend that well, but they didn't appear to be looking to foul -- Carlisle's teams generally do not foul anyway. It cost them in this case.\n\nAt the end of the game, the Pacers relentlessly targeted Al Horford, even if it meant an Andrew Nembhard isolation (not exactly Indiana's best play). It worked.\n\nIt was clear throughout the game, not just at the end, how much Kristaps Porzingis, his defense, his 3-point shooting, and his mobility would matter in this series.\n\nPorzingis is targeting a Game 4 return, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported pregame. What Porzignis will the Celtics get? How is he moving coming off a calf strain? Is he on a minute's limit? How long will it take him to shake off the rust.\n\nBoston may not get the 100% of Porzingis when he returns, but it needs whatever he can give in this series.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Stevens", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Stevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3TtND5ZlyCr2OGT.v5iF5Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/nbcsports.com/0ca2534932f009f2076ea4646cb01e86", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Instead, they're left to ponder what went wrong in an epic meltdown.\n\nNot too many expected the 2023-24 Indiana Pacers to make it this deep into the playoffs, but here they are, standing within four wins away of a first trip to the NBA Finals since 2000. But what stands in their way in the Eastern Conference Finals is the Boston Celtics, the team that finished with the best record in the league this past season. The Celtics, despite not having Kristaps Porzingis, remain perhaps the most lethal team remaining in the playoffs, having gone through a cakewalk in the first two rounds of the 2024 postseason.\n\nBut on Tuesday night, it seemed as though the Pacers will finally be the first team to pose a legitimate challenge to the Celtics. The Celtics, during the first two rounds, blew their opponent out of the water in Game 1, but there the Pacers were, hanging around like they have usually done in this year's playoffs. In fact, the Pacers almost stole, nay, earned a Game 1 victory, much to the surprise of fans, but instead, they were guilty of one costly meltdown after another as they suffered a brutal 133-128 loss in overtime.\n\nAssigning blame for a loss that nearly everyone expected out of them may not be the best idea. The Celtics are the favorite to win the series, after all, and the Pacers are merely playing with house money in their first playoff run with Tyrese Haliburton as the star. But when you're only a few solid plays away from securing a road victory in the Conference Finals, there will be plenty of justifiable frustration as they let a very winnable game slip away from their grasp.\n\nIt can be disingenuous to blame the coach for a team's shortcomings. After all, the coach is not the one who executes plays on the basketball court. He is the man who draws up plays and tells the team what strategies they must deploy on the court. And for the Pacers, Rick Carlisle deserves plenty of credit. He pushed the right buttons as the Pacers took a 117-114 lead in the dying seconds of Game 1, and it was him that has turned the Pacers into a high-octane offensive unit by imploring them to push the pace (no pun intended) on every possession.\n\nBut it's safe to say that Carlisle did not have the best showing in the final 30 seconds of regulation during the Pacers' Game 1 loss to the Celtics. They were up by three with eight seconds left in the game; the Celtics took a foul and forced them to inbound from the backcourt. Now, the Pacers still had a timeout left. Carlisle could have used it to advance the basketball and give them a much more advantageous position on the inbounds.\n\nInstead, Rick Carlisle let the game play out, and Andrew Nembhard proceeded to throw a terrible inbounds pass towards a smothered Pascal Siakam. Siakam bobbled the basketball and turned the ball over. It's also questionable that Nembhard would throw the basketball towards the opposing basket, but, again, advancing the basketball could have solved a lot of issues for the Pacers on that play.\n\nFor starters, advancing the basketball would have allowed them to use the entire court to inbound the ball. It also would have given them a better inbound vantage point. But still, despite the turnover, the Pacers still had a three-point lead. A defensive stop would have had the game in the bag for them.\n\nThe age old debate when up by three without possession of the basketball is whether or not it's smart to foul to prevent a three-point attempt from the opposition. JJ Redick, who was on ESPN's commentating crew, said that he'd do so every time; LeBron James, someone whom Redick could potentially coach on the Los Angeles Lakers, shares this sentiment. Rick Carlisle could have done this and trusted in the Pacers' ability to make free throws. Instead, they let the play unfold yet again, leading to a backbreaking, game-tying Jaylen Brown triple that eventually led to the Celtics' victory.\n\nIt might have been difficult for Siakam to foul Brown as the Celtics created a ton of space for their star man with a very good screen from White; but upon closer review, the Pacers may have had time to wrap Brown up if that was their strategy. It clearly wasn't. Instead of taking a chance that Brown would miss a free throw, which is very likely seeing as he entered the night having made just 61.4 percent of his freebies thus far in this year's playoffs, the Pacers played the odds by letting Brown take a three and were promptly burned.\n\nThe Pacers' resiliency should keep them in this series. But their chances at an upset against the Celtics take a major hit, as they gave them their best shot and still failed to come away with a victory. In the end, however, the Pacers have nobody else to blame but themselves.\n\nAgain, it might be questionable that Rick Carlisle did not call a timeout to advance the basketball or that he didn't instruct his team to foul when they were up by three. But it wasn't Carlisle who was guilty of turning the ball over in crucial moments. Prior to the Pacers meltdown in the final few possessions of regulation, Tyrese Haliburton also coughed up the basketball when he lost his dribble, forcing Aaron Nesmith to save the ball, to no avail.\n\nThere were 27 seconds left in the game when Haliburton's turnover occurred; instead of burning time off the clock and getting a chance to push the lead to a two-possession game, the Pacers were forced to get a stop. Now, that is what they did; they forced a miss from Derrick White at the rim and they contested beautifully a tough midrange fall-away from Jayson Tatum. That, however, only served to set up Andrew Nembhard's inbound gone wrong.\n\nAnd then in overtime, more turnover woes ensued for the Pacers. With Indiana down by just one, 124-123, Haliburton was trying to create a good shot to try and regain the lead. Instead, he ran into the brick wall of a defender that was Jrue Holiday. Holiday harassed him near the halfcourt line, forcing the Pacers guard to fumble his dribble and go out of bounds. This then led to a Tatum triple that essentially sealed the game for the Celtics.\n\nBut their turnover issues did not stop there. The Pacers, despite being down by four, 127-123, still had a chance to cut it into a single-possession game. They went to Pascal Siakam, who was brilliant for most of the night. However, Siakam, after driving the ball hard to the hole with his patented spin move, lost the ball after Jaylen Brown played marvelous defense.\n\nOn the night, the Pacers finished with 22 turnovers, although at least they tallied 37 assists. But it was always going to be difficult to win when you turn over the ball that often. During the regular season, the Pacers averaged just 12.9 giveaways per contest; meanwhile, the Celtics were the least turnover-prone team in the NBA, coughing up the ball just 11.9 times per outing.\n\nStill, despite their turnover issues, the Pacers almost won the game. It was thanks to their 53.5 percent shooting from the field that they pushed the Celtics to the brink, and it did not help matters for Indiana that they shot only 10 free throws on the night compared to 30 for the Celtics.

Turnovers,\" Haliburton began. \"I had two bad turnovers that I feel cost us the game.\"\n\nThe Pacers arrived in Boston after upsetting the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round and the New York Knicks in the second - both times after losing Game 1. The Celtics are the NBA's top-seeded team, seven wins ahead of their closest competition and 17 wins better than the Pacers.\n\nAnd when Boston opened a 12-0 lead on Tuesday night, it looked like the series might not even be competitive. But Indiana tied it by halftime, led 115-110 with 1:57 left in regulation and even had a three-point lead with 40 seconds left.\n\n\"We know we can play with these guys,\" Haliburton said. There\u00b4s a lot of people out here saying we don\u00b4t belong here. We don\u00b4t really care. We know we belong.\"\n\nIndiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton (0) reacts after missing a shot against the Boston Celtics to end regulation time in Game 1 of the NBA Eastern Conference basketball finals, Tuesday, May 21, 2024, in Boston. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)\n\nIt was turnovers - 22 of them for 32 points, and several in key spots - that cost them. In addition to Haliburton dribbling off his foot with 28 seconds left in a three-point game when he wasn\u00b4t being closely guarded, he also lost the ball out of bounds with 1:02 left in overtime.\n\n\"Big-time turnovers,\" Pacers center Myles Turner said. \"We showed our age a little bit tonight, being a youthful team in this high stakes of a game. We made some mistakes. A lot of uncharacteristic turnovers.\"\n\nThe Pacers led 117-114 with the ball after Jayson Tatum missed a potential game-tying 3-pointer with 37 seconds left. But Haliburton dribbled off his foot, giving Boston two more looks at the basket before Turner grabbed a rebound and was fouled with 10 seconds remaining.\n\nThat\u00b4s when Andrew Nembhard threw away the inbounds pass, handing the Celtics yet another chance. Jrue Holiday found Jaylen Brown in the left corner; Pascal Siakam was supposed to foul him but hesitated, fearful of giving up three free throws.\n\nBrown drained the 3, tying the score 117-all. Haliburton got the ball with a decent look at the basket, but he went looking for a better one and wound up tossing up a heavily contested, off-balance shot at the buzzer.\n\n\"That\u00b4s replayed a bunch of times in my head already,\" Haliburton said. \"That was probably the look for me to shoot.\"\n\nGame 2 is Thursday night before the series shifts to Indianapolis. The Pacers will need to win at least once in Boston, and they aren\u00b4t likely to get a better chance.\n\n\"This loss is totally on me,\" coach Rick Carlisle said, blaming himself for not calling a timeout to advance the ball with 10 seconds left. \"We made some other mistakes. ... We\u00b4ve got to own it, and we\u00b4ve got to get ready for Thursday.\"\n\nCarlisle, who was fined $35,000 for complaining about the officiating in the second-round series against the Knicks, declined to comment on a 30-10 free throw differential - 23-3 in regulation.\n\n\"My daughter\u00b4s already going to sit out one semester of college,\" he said. \"I can\u00b4t have her take a whole year off.\"\n\nIndiana Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle reacts to his bench as guard Tyrese Haliburton (0) follows behind during the first quarter of Game 1 of the NBA Eastern Conference basketball finals against the Boston Celtics, Tuesday, May 21, 2024, in Boston.

So we have got to come out and be better,\" he added.\n\nThe Pacers came into the game on the back of a gruelling game seven win against the New York Knicks on Sunday and Boston were the fastest out of the traps.\n\nWith the loud home crowd sensing Indiana were struggling, Al Horford's 26-foot three pointer made it 12-0.\n\nThe Pacers got back into the game and levelled it 64-64 at half-time.

Boston led by as many as 13 in the second half and it looked like they were going to cruise to a win. However, the Indiana Pacers wouldn't go away. The Pacers climbed back into the game, and they took a five-point lead with under two minutes to go. They also led by three with under 10 seconds left and they had the ball. They ended up committing a turnover, and then Jaylen Brown drilled a three to send the game to over time.\n\nJaylen Brown was the hero for the Celtics in game one after his heroic shot to send the game to overtime. It looked like Boston was dead in the water, but Brown sparked some life back into his team, and they found a way to get the win in OT.\n\nAfter the Pacers turned the ball over and gave it back to the Celtics with under 10 seconds left, Boston had a chance to draw up a play. It worked to perfection, and Brown knew that he was going to be open for the three.\n\n\"We drew up a play, and it was perfectly executed, I told Jrue [Holiday] I was going to be open in the corner, and I was,\" Brown said after the game during a post-game interview.\n\nJaylen Brown was right, he had an opening in the corner, and he took it. The Celtics are now up 1-0 in the series.\n\nThe Pacers let game one slip away\n\nIf you're the Celtics, you're feeling great right now after surviving game one and taking a 1-0 lead in the series. Boston is the heavy favorite to win the series, and they are now one step closer to achieving their goal after Jaylen Brown helped them get the win.\n\nAs for the Pacers, that one hurts bad. Indiana had a chance to go on the road and completely change the perception of this series. If they can go up 1-0 in this series, they put a ton of pressure on the Celtics. As the favorite to win it all, there is already a lot of pressure on Boston. The Pacers let a golden opportunity slip right through their fingertips in game one.\n\nNow, the Pacers have to regroup as game two will be on Thursday.

They grew strong in those pivotal, got-to-have it moments.\n\nThey took advantage of the countless gaffes made by the Pacers, making them pay for their miscues, but none greater than the one with a few ticks remaining in regulation.\n\nDown three with the clock running down from 10 seconds after the Pacers' umpteenth turnover, Celtics forward Jaylen Brown calmly hit a corner bomb to tie the game and send it to overtime.\n\nBrown, who had a disastrous Game 7 performance in the Eastern finals last season, said he basically willed the shot in.\n\n\"I was just telling myself the whole time, if you get it, it's going up and it's going in,\" Brown said. \"I was able to make a big-time play.\"\n\nHe sure did with Pascal Siakam in his face as he launched his off-balance prayer to tie the game.\n\nThen it was Jayson Tatum's turn to be the hero. He scored 10 of his 36 points in overtime, including a 3-pointer that put the nail in the Pacers' coffin with 42.8 seconds to go.\n\nTatum, who was having a rough shooting night (12-of-26, 2-of-8 from three), finally dialed it up during crunch time.\n\nBut Tatum and Brown weren't alone.\n\nJrue Holiday, who has largely sacrificed his scoring this season, also rose down the stretch and overtime with 20 of his 28 points coming after halftime.\n\nBottom line: The Celtics needed to win a game like this. If they do advance to the NBA Finals, they needed to know they can deliver in key spots, in the big games.\n\nAlthough, listening to the players after the game, they never doubted they were capable.\n\n\"I think we always knew we could (win),\" said Holiday. \"Close games, I don't think, have ever bothered us. I think we've always stayed poised no matter if it's a win or a loss. We'd always give ourselves a chance again today. But, down 3, with seconds left, making a big shot and making big plays after that, we knew we had it in us.\"\n\nOf course, the Pacers were a willing accomplice. They helped the Celtics, giving them life, or, as Tatum put it, \"a second chance\" with all of their bumbling. Their whopping 21 turnovers led to 32 Celtics points.\n\nAt different points during the fourth quarter when they seemed to have the game in hand, the Pacers just gave the Celtics more chances time and again. Ditto overtime.\n\nAndrew Nembhard's wayward inbound pass with 10 seconds to play set up Brown for the tying score. Then why didn't the Pacers foul Brown, who is not the best free throw shooter in the world, before allowing him to take that three? It's almost an automatic to foul if a team is up by three with little time left on the clock.\n\nPacers had coach Rick Carlisle fell on the sword for his team's meltdown, saying he should have called a timeout to advance the ball, and draw up a better inbounds play.\n\nSo maybe the Celtics were lucky. Maybe the Pacers gift-wrapped the win. By the same token, Boston took advantage of its good fortune.\n\n\"I felt like we hit, they responded. They hit, we responded. It was just a lot of back-and-forth,\" Boston's Al Horford said after the Game 1 win. \"I think, despite all that, our group just stayed the course. We continued to work. We continued to try to play the right way. Eventually, we needed some sort of break and we got it there. I'm glad we were able to close it out in overtime.\"\n\nAdded Holiday: \"I think we always knew there was a chance. We've seen crazy stuff happen all the time ... Anything can happen. We're just the type of team that's going to keep fighting, no matter how long, no matter what it takes.\"\n\nThe Celtics were able to snatch a victory from defeat. In many cases, it's been the other way around. They've grabbed defeat, out of sure wins.\n\n\"It's not over til it's over,\" Brown said, spouting a familiar refrain, \"and we found a way to win this game at the very end.\"\n\nFinding a way in Game 1, could very well pay bigger dividends when they're forced to muster similar resolve down the road.", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karen_guregian_masslive_com@unionleader.com", "name": "Karen Guregian Masslive.Com", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-out_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Time-out (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/unionleader.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/9f/39f152d0-c44f-59ff-9bfe-13aaee59df78/664e14602df19.image.jpg?crop=1696%2C890%2C0%2C165&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The Pacers didn't foul and Celtics forward Jaylen Brown drilled a 3-pointer in the corner with 5.7 seconds to go to tie the game. Pacers All-Star point guard Tyrese Haliburton got in several tied-up positions on the final possession and missed a heave at the buzzer to send the game into overtime.\n\nCeltics All-Star forward Jayson Tatum scored 10 points in overtime including a critical three-point play and 3-pointer. He finished with 36 points on 12 of 26 shooting. Brown had 26 points and guard Jrue Holiday had 28 as the Celtics veterans stepped it up in critical moments.\n\nMyles Turner took advantage of his matchups\n\nWith Kristaps Porzingis out for at least the first two games of this series with a calf strain, there was an obvious imperative for Pacers center Myles Turner to take advantage of his matchups and he very much did.\n\nThe Celtics used 37-year-old Al Horford and gangly 7-2, 240-pounder Luke Kornet at center. Turner went after both, but Kornet especially. In the first half, Turner scored 18 points on 7 of 10 shooting, knocking down a pair of 3-pointers on three attempts and also throwing down a few vicious dunks. He also added four rebounds and dished out four assists as well. He found it harder to take advantage of those matchups in the second half but finished with 23 points on 9 of 13 shooting, grabbing 10 rebounds.\n\nTyrese Haliburton keeps it up\n\nTyrese Haliburton found a rhythm in Game 6 against the Knicks and kept it going against the Celtics, showing aggression off the bounce and accuracy from deep.\n\nHaliburton had to deal with not one but two All-NBA defenders in Celtics guards Jrue Holiday and Derrick White, who were both named to the second team earlier on Tuesday, but ball screens by Turner gave Haliburton opportunities to go down hill and space to step back. He focused on getting the ball to Turner and Obi Toppin at first, but then took advantage of his opportunities as he saw them.\n\nHaliburton scored 11 points in the first half on 4 of 7 shooting including 3 of 5 from 3, hitting a deep 3-pointer just before the half to tie the game. He finished with 25 points on 8 of 18 shooting including 6 of 14 3-pointers to go with 10 assists, but he did have struggles late in the game with turnovers.\n\nPascal Siakam goes off in the second half\n\nThe Pacers started finding Pascal Siakam for mid-range jumpers in the second half and suddenly he couldn't stop making them.\n\nThe All-Star forward scored 16 of his 24 points in the second half, shooting 8 of 14 after the break and 12 of 23 for the game. He also grabbed 12 rebounds and dished out seven assists.", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "indianapolis_star@indystar.com", "name": "Indianapolis Star", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Kornet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Kornet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/22/PIND/73795325007-usatsi-23342872.jpg?auto=webp&crop=3726,2096,x0,y124&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The Celtics then got the better of overtime to take a series lead, leaving Carlisle to rue the missed opportunity.\n\n\"I love the way our guys fought in this game. This loss is totally on me.

Boston, for example, had twice led by double digits in the game but Indiana came back on both occasions to take the lead.\n\nThe Pacers head coach was confident his team would recover in time for Game 2 on Thursday.\n\n\"We did a lot of good things that we need to continue to do and we've been a tough minded, resilient team for almost the entire second half of the year and we have to continue that,\" he added.\n\nFor the Celtics, it was a morale boosting start to the series, with Brown and Jayson Tatum leading the charge.\n\nTatum finished on a game-high 36 points, coming up clutch in overtime after Brown had saved the day.\n\n\"Welcome to the NBA Playoffs,\" Brown told reporters. \"You've just got to manage your emotions of the game. Anything can happen. The game is not over until the final buzzer sounds.\"\n\nThe Celtics were also boosted by a career-best performance from Jrue Holiday who totalled 28 points, seven rebounds, eight assists, and three steals.\n\n\"We've seen crazy stuff happen all the time,\" Holiday told reporters.\n\n\"I don't think that we think we've lost a game until we've actually lost a game.

Brown responded:\n\n\"A lot of ups and downs, [I] don't think we played out best. But the game is fast, you don't have no time to make excuses, you have to keep going and that's what we did tonight... we found a way to win in the end.\"\n\nAs the post-game interviews continued, Brown's frustration was apparent through his answers. When asked about why he didn't seem happy with the win, Brown responded:\n\n\"Would you be? We almost dropped a game on our home floor. We need to come out and be better in Game 2.\"\n\nBrown, although not pleased with the way they won, finished the night with 26 points, seven rebounds, five assists, three steals and a block while shooting 50.0 percent from the field.\n\nDespite the Celtics Win, Pacers Played Extremely Well Besides points scored, Indiana outplayed Boston in a number of different areas\n\nWhen comparing the teams' stats for the game, it's apparent why Brown wasn't pleased with the win. Besides scoring more points, the Pacers grabbed more rebounds, dished more assists and shot better all around than the Celtics.\n\nGame 1 Team Comparison\n\nTeam\n\nPTS\n\nREB\n\nAST\n\nFG%\n\n3P%\n\nPacers\n\n128\n\n44\n\n38\n\n53.5\n\n37.1\n\nCeltics\n\n133\n\n43\n\n30\n\n47.5\n\n33.3\n\nThe Pacers also spread their scoring over their roster, while the majority of the Celtics' points were concentrated to a few players. While only five Celtics scored in double digits, all but one of the Pacers (Ben Sheppard) scored double digits, while three players (Tyrese Haliburton, Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner) scored more than 20.\n\nOne area where Boston did outperform Indiana, though, was in hustle points. Although only edging out the Pacers slightly in these areas, it proved to make enough of a difference to grab the win.\n\nGame 1 Hustle Point Comparison\n\nTeam\n\nPTS in the Paint\n\n2nd Chance PTS\n\nFastbreak PTS\n\nPacers\n\n56\n\n15\n\n14\n\nCeltics\n\n58\n\n19\n\n16\n\nGoing into Game 2, the Celtics will no doubt enter the game with an increased focus on playing tightly and allowing as little room for error as possible. Seemingly an easy task when looking at their home and away splits, but made more interesting by the fact that Boston has yet to win a Game 2 in this postseason (both of which were in Boston).\n\nBoston 2024 Postseason Splits\n\nLocation\n\nPPG\n\nAPG\n\nFG%\n\n3P%\n\nHome\n\n113.3\n\n25.3\n\n48.3\n\n37.9\n\nAway\n\n105.3\n\n20.0\n\n47.2\n\n35.7\n\nWhether or not the Pacers are able to give the Celtics as much trouble as they did in this game, they proved that they belong on this stage and could provide the Celtics with their biggest challenge in this postseason so far.\n\nRelated Why the Boston Celtics Will Reach the 2024 NBA Finals The Boston Celtics are just one round away from reaching the NBA Finals - here's what they need to do to get there.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ice hockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mixcollage-22-apr-2024-04-57-pm-5810.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

So we have got to come out and be better,\" he added.\n\nThe Pacers came into the game on the back of a gruelling game seven win against the New York Knicks on Sunday and Boston were the fastest out of the traps.\n\nWith the loud home crowd sensing Indiana were struggling, Al Horford's 26-foot three pointer made it 12-0.\n\nThe Pacers got back into the game and levelled it 64-64 at half-time.\n\nA 13-point run in the third put Boston 87-77 up but again Indiana came back and with less than two minutes to go they led 115-100.\n\nIndiana turned the ball over twice in the final 30

plays at the end but we have got to be better to be honest, but I'll take the win,\" said Brown.\n\nPacers head coach Rick Carlisle said he was to blame for allowing the Celtics to take the game to overtime.\n\n\"The loss is totally on me,\" he said.\n\n\"With 10 seconds left in regulation, we should have just taken the time out, advanced the ball and found a way to get it in and made a free

Raising his arms into the air, he looked to different sections of the arena and called for more and more cheers from the adoring crowd. He deserved all the love after knocking home a game-tying 3-pointer in the final seconds of regulation and coming up with a crucial steal late in the extra period.\n\nAs Brown demanded more noise, the Boston Celtics were nearing the end of a 133-128 Game 1 victory. After two smooth rounds nearly entirely devoid of drama, they were escaping a wild, fortunate and breathtaking ending.\n\n\"Welcome to the NBA playoffs,\" Brown said.\n\nAt long last, a Celtics playoff game felt like one. To take a 1-0 lead in the Eastern Conference finals, the Celtics needed to persevere through mistakes. They needed to endure pressure. They needed to summon clutch shots and game-saving stops and, sure, several instances of luck, especially late in regulation when Indiana coughed up a turnover while trying to protect a three-point lead. The Pacers' failure to inbound the ball successfully gave possession back to the Celtics with a chance to tie. Brown seized the opportunity with a triple from the corner after Pascal Siakam, with orders to intentionally foul and send Boston to the line, apparently decided hacking Brown before his shot attempt would be too risky. Rick Carlisle defended Siakam's choice, though not his own call to forego a timeout before Indiana's disastrous inbound pass.\n\nThe Celtics needed all of that, a gritty stop on the final possession of regulation and a string of timely plays in overtime. Jayson Tatum, who went quiet for much of the second half, delivered 10 points in overtime to save himself from a few days of criticism. If the Celtics had lost, he said he would have been sick after a bad turnover in overtime and an open miss late in regulation. Instead, they capitalized on the chaos presented to them.\n\n\"That's a great way (to describe it),\" Tatum said. \"That s -- was chaos. That s -- was wild, but just stay present, stay in the moment. As long as that time is still on the clock and the game is within reach, we feel like we have a chance. This core group has been in so many big-time games, big-time moments. We've had a lead and lost it and still won. We've been down a lot and figured out a way to win. I've had a lot of crazy endings in this building, so we've already been there before. And we always believe, in a sense.\"\n\nDid the win inspire more confidence that the Celtics will win the championship this season? To them, it didn't seem to matter. They stepped one win closer to their ultimate goal anyway. In the locker room, they have used the mantra \"whatever it takes.\" If they need to win a slugfest, they want to go ahead and do it. If they need to rescue themselves with a few key plays at the end of a bad outing, they want to figure out a way. If they can't pile up consistent stops and need to outscore one of the best offenses in basketball instead, they want to get it done. The Celtics allowed the Pacers to shoot 53.5 percent from the field, but yanked away the win anyway with an ending that packed more tension and excitement than the first two rounds of Boston's postseason run combined.\n\n\"I felt like we hit, they responded,\" Al Horford said. \"They hit, we responded. It was just a lot of back and forth. I think, despite all that, our group just stayed the course. We continued to work. We continued to try to play the right way. Eventually, we needed some sort of break and we got it there.\"\n\nThe Celtics nearly cost themselves many times. In the final 1:10 alone, Derrick White pulled up for a 3-pointer that Tyrese Haliburton swatted away; Tatum bricked a wide-open potential game-tying shot from the top of the key; and the Celtics botched a pair of close 2-pointers that would have pulled them within one point with less than 15 seconds left.\n\nThe second of those, a Tatum fadeaway from 16 feet, would have likely been shredded by the pundits if Boston had gone on to lose. With his team needing three points to tie, he followed a big offensive rebound with a dribble that took him from the restricted area toward the foul line. From there, Tatum didn't try to find one of his teammates for a 3-pointer to tie. He didn't try to produce a layup or draw a foul. His missed one-legged jumper over the top of Myles Turner could have doomed the Celtics. They prevailed anyway. Brown's pressure forced a turnover on the inbounds pass. Moments later, Brown tied the game with 5.7 seconds left on a fadeaway from in front of the Pacers bench.\n\nThe Celtics still needed a stop to force overtime. On the Pacers' final possession of regulation, Tatum switched onto Haliburton with force and physicality to prevent even a halfway decent look. Haliburton could only crash a desperation heave off the backboard as time expired.\n\n\"It was a hard-fought game and it was important for us,\" Horford said. \"We keep talking about protecting home court and it's whatever it takes.\"\n\nHorford almost seemed to chuckle as he mentioned protecting home court. He knew how close the Celtics came to dropping the series opener at TD Garden. They could have lost, and would have lost if the final 10 seconds of regulation -- the stretch from Indiana's misguided inbounds pass through Tatum's stop on Haliburton -- had been any less generous to them. If the ending had gone any differently, the Celtics would have had plenty of stretches to regret.\n\nAfter surging ahead 12-0 over the first three-plus minutes, they allowed the Pacers to pull within three points by the end of the first quarter. After producing double-digit leads in the second and third quarters, the Celtics again failed to hold onto the advantages. The Pacers bench, a key to the team's postseason success to date, brought an energy Boston couldn't match, at least when Tatum was resting. The Celtics failed to consistently slow down the high-powered Indiana offense, but saved themselves anyway with a shocking finish.\n\n\"You can't have any expectations about how it's supposed to go,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"You miss a layup, you miss a 3, you give something up, it doesn't matter. I thought our guys had that kind of mindset.\"\n\nThe Celtics needed that mindset to prevail in easily their closest game of the postseason so far. Finally, after almost nothing but blowouts against shorthanded opponents over the first two rounds, the Celtics were welcomed into the playoff heat Tuesday night. They needed to fight through dumb errors. They needed to shrug off defensive lapses. They gave the crowd every emotion from raucous joy to stunned disappointment and back again. The ending to regulation barely made sense. In overtime, Tatum followed an and-1 layup with a sidestep 3-pointer to put the Celtics ahead for good.\n\n\"Nothing other than what I expected,\" Mazzulla said. \"Two high-level teams competing for a great opportunity. So I expect all the games to be like that, and there's going to be more of that. And I thought both teams competed at a high level. For us, I thought our guys -- obviously we weren't perfect, we can get better, but I thought we maintained a level of poise, a level of mental toughness to just continue to work through some of the mistakes. That's the bind they put you in, because of the way they play. So we handled it well, and we need to get better.\"\n\nBefore Tuesday, the Celtics had handled seven of their eight playoff wins by double digits. After the lone single-digit victory over the first two rounds, Jrue Holiday suggested he was happy in some ways to see his team in a closer game. Holiday's response revealed how methodically Boston handled the banged-up Miami Heat and Cleveland Cavaliers. For most of those two series, the Celtics were barely tested. They didn't need late-game heroics. They didn't have any gut-check experiences. They deserved credit for a boring start to the playoffs, which any team would want. But it was mostly boring.\n\nIt will take more later on. Even after the win, Brown sounded disappointed in the way his team played Tuesday night. The Celtics let Haliburton, T.J. McConnell and Obi Toppin run too freely. Even in Boston, the Pacers were comfortable and confident. Only 22 turnovers, including some very punishing ones, kept them from a huge offensive outing.\n\n\"I think it's always great to come out with a win,\" Brown said, \"but obviously we got to tighten up in some areas. We're going to watch the film. I think the majority of it was just transition. ...

But still, leaving in a close playoff game like that is crazy. It would have been one thing if the Celtics were down double digits with two minutes left, but the Pacers were up by just five points with 1:57 remaining. Yes, they were also up three with the ball with 10 seconds left, but Andrew Nembhard turned the ball over with an errant inbounds pass.\n\nBrown then sunk the game-tying triple with six seconds left on the clock, and the Celtics got a stop to force overtime.\n\nDid the Celtics absorb the Pacers' best shot in Game 1?\n\nThis was nearly a disastrous loss for the Celtics, even with how shaky they have been at home in the playoffs the last few years. Dropping Game 1 of the conference finals in your own building to a largely inferior opponent? Where have we seen that before?\n\nAnyway, Boston was able to get the job done by making clutch plays on both ends, which is something the C's have been widely criticized for not consistently doing throughout the season. Perhaps the Celtics needed a close game like this to build some mettle.\n\nThis may also end up being one of the closest games Boston may play in this series.\n\nThe Pacers shot a blistering 53.5 percent from the floor and were absolutely making some unbelievable shots. Many of the three-pointers that Tyrese Haliburton and Co. sunk were very contested, but they just happened to fall.\n\nIndiana is a very good three-point shooting team, ranking eighth in percentage and ninth in makes this year. But some of the shots the Pacers were draining in Game 1 will probably not be falling very much for the remainder of the series (if it continues, the Celtics may be in some trouble).\n\nYou kind of get the feeling that this may have been the best offensive performance Indy will put forth in this set, at least on the road. The Pacers just scored 128 points (117 in regulation) in Boston. Against one of the best defensive teams in the league.\n\nMaybe the Pacers will be able to have another hot shooting night at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, but it seems kind of hard to imagine Indiana doing this again in Beantown.\n\nIndiana also got over 20 points from each of Haliburton, Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner and still lost. When your three best players perform that well and you still lose, it's tough. On the flip side, though, one can argue that the Celtics got 90 combined points from Jayson Tatum, Jrue Holiday and Brown, and the Pacers managed to hang in there.\n\nWe'll see if Boston can take a commanding 2-0 lead on Thursday night, something the C's were unable to do in their previous two playoff series this spring.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_schmidt@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Matthew Schmidt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Boston-fans-who-left-Game-1-early-before-Jaylen-Brown-shot-get-clowned.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

So one of the inquisitors charitably tried to frame it and spin it all at once: Does it help to know they didn't win the game as much as you guys lost the game?\n\nThe Celtics weren't just happy beneficiaries. The Pacers didn't have control of all that took place. You could tell it stung by how often the Pacers' point guard sighed and shook his head. But he found a through line for his team as this moves forward.\n\n\"What I will say is encouraging,\" Haliburton said, \"is that we've been trash in Game 1s, first series and second series. And today we played great for about 47 minutes.\"\n\nThe Pacers got spanked in Game 1 in Milwaukee a month ago, then took the series in six. They lost Game 1 at New York (and Game 2 for that matter) in the just completed seven-game conference semis, yet here they are.\n\nThe trouble Tuesday was, this one lasted 53 minutes. Forty-seven wasn't near good enough. Game 2 is Thursday (8 p.m. ET, ESPN).\n\nHere are five takeaways from the victory at TD Garden that put Boston up 1-0:\n\n1. That's the way to open a series\n\nIt was big, it was sloppy, it was crammed with key plays and glaring mistakes - and it was just what NBA fans should have wanted as the table-setter for as many as six games to follow.\n\nThree times, the Celtics built, then blew double-digit leads. Twenty-two times, Indiana possessions ended in turnovers. Boston only trailed for 2:41 in the game's first 43 minutes, yet needed every Pacers gaffe and Hail Mary moment it could muster just to force overtime.\n\n\"That [expletive] was chaos,\" Boston's Jayson Tatum said.\n\nIndiana coach Rick Carlisle threw himself under the bus because he didn't use a timeout with 10 seconds left, his team up 117-114 and Andrew Nembhard searching, searching for a teammate with his inbounds pass. The ball went out of bounds off Pascal Siakam and, naturally, the Celtics capitalized when Jaylen Brown took Jrue Holiday's inbounds pass in the left corner and drilled a line-drive, game-tying 3-pointer.\n\nHad Carlisle used the timeout, the Pacers would have inbounded at the far end. Less stress, less panic. Fouling Brown? No good, because the Celtics wing already was squared up to the basket.\n\nThen Haliburton had the ball as regulation ran out, dribbling himself into a thicket of defenders.\n\n\"I understand [Carlisle is] protecting us, protecting me as well,\" Haliburton said. \"But I'll take that more than he should. I've got to be better and I will be better in Game 2.\"\n\n2. The shoes, oops, gotta be the shoes\n\nHaliburton seemed incredulous over his turnovers. He only had three but two in particular were game-changers. And they were unforced, in his opinion.\n\n\"There were three different occasions where I dribbled the ball off my foot,\" he said. \"I don't know what happened. Nobody forced it. Frustrating, to say the least.\"\n\nThe two most damaging came on the left sideline, and he lost the ball out of bounds both times. The first was with 27.7 seconds left, snuffing hopes of extending that 117-114 lead. In the final minute of OT, he did it again and what was a 124-123 Celtics lead stretched to 127-123 when Tatum hit from way out top.\n\nLet it be known, Indiana was a top-10 team this season in not turning over the ball, and of the four teams left, it entered this round with the lowest turnover rate (11.6 per 100 possessions). The 22 miscues matched their second-most all season.\n\nBoston does have a pair of All-Defensive guards in Jrue Holiday and Derrick White. But Indiana's whoopsies came every which way. Jitters seemed part of it early.\n\nIt was so debilitating that no one from Indiana bothered to grumble about Boston's 30-10 advantage at the foul line.\n\n3. Night lasted long enough for Tatum\n\nTatum missed five of his seven shots in the fourth quarter, including a 3-pointer out of a timeout with 36.7 seconds left and his team down three. If not for what was described above, he would have been hearing more and louder criticism about his inconsistency and unreliability.\n\nThen in the five minutes of overtime, the Celtics' smooth forward scored 10 of their 16 points. Five of them came off free throws. He had a 3-point play in which he abused Pacers guard T.J. McConnell inside. Then that dagger that let Boston manage its four-point lead near the end.\n\n\"He just plays with a level of poise and a level of comfort,\" coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"Knowing that the next one has a chance to go.\"\n\nTatum finished with the gaudiest numbers of the night: 36 points, 12 rebounds, four assists, three steals, 10-for-12 from the line and a game-high plus-20. But he shot 12-for-26 from the field, including 2-for-8 on 3s, so there still is room for nitpicking.\n\n\"Prove? It doesn't prove anything,\" Tatum said of the performance. \"We won a big-time game. Series is far from over.\"\n\nAt this rate, Tatum will be hearing and responding to his critics right through the NBA Finals.\n\n4. This is a 'No Dame Lillard' zone, so...\n\nNo need to rub any noses in the fact that Boston's Jrue Holiday still is playing and that guy for whom he was traded is not. We can say that the veteran point guard was the Celtics' most vital player Tuesday, scoring 28 points (many to bail out sketchy possessions) and captaining the defense. He had seven boards and eight assists.\n\nMazzulla said: \"He's the kind of guy that can impact the game in different ways every night.\"\n\nHaliburton called Holiday \"the best defender in the NBA, and he has been for a long time.\"\n\nHoliday just said his mission, and his message to teammates, in Game 1 was to keep coming. This was only the second official \"clutch\" game of the postseason for Boston in 11 outings and the team has shown a tendency to play down to the level of its foes.\n\n\"Continually being aggressive,\" Holiday said of his readiness. \"Continually working on my game. Continually having the coaches and my teammates in my ear telling me they're going to need me.\"\n\nKeeping pace with Indiana's preferred up-and-down style was key - the teams combined for 128 points by halftime. Things got noticeably grittier from there.\n\n5. Biggest coaches' challenge gap ever?\n\nUntil we hear otherwise, we're going to proclaim that Boston set an NBA mark for the greatest amount of time between using its two challenges. Mazzulla turned on the green light just 35 seconds into the game to overturn a goaltending call against Al Horford. That kept Indiana from tying the game ... at 2-2.\n\nRewarded with a second one, Mazzulla used it with just 12.9 seconds left in overtime. He hoped to overturn a foul on Tatum, but lost that one. Obi Toppin sank two free throws for the Pacers' final points, briefly making it 131-128.", "source": {"uri": "nba.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBA.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-out_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Time-out (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obi Toppin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clutch (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

The series is far from over.\"\n\nThe Pacers came into the game on the back of a grueling Game 7 win against the New York Knicks on Sunday and Boston were the fastest out of the traps.\n\nWith the loud home crowd sensing Indiana were struggling, Al Horford's 26-foot three-pointer made it 12-0.\n\nThe Pacers got back into the game and leveled it 64-64 at halftime.\n\nA 13-point run in the third put Boston 87-77 up, but again Indiana came back and with less than two minutes to go they led 115-100.\n\nIndiana turned the ball over twice in the final 30 seconds of regulation before Brown's crucial three-pointer, over the top of Siakam.\n\nWhen Haliburton was unable to get off a last-gasp shot the game went to overtime.\n\nA step back three-pointer from Tatum with 43 seconds left put Boston four points up.\n\nAfter Derrick White's layup extended the advantage to six with 25 seconds left, the game was beyond the Pacers.\n\n\"We were able to make some plays at the end, but we have got to be better to be honest, but I'll take the win,\" Brown said.", "source": {"uri": "taipeitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Taipei Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2024/05/23/p07-240523-302.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Things then went awry in the final moments of regulation.\n\nWith 10 seconds left in the fourth quarter, the Pacers had the ball, a three-point lead and a win probability of over 90 percent. A few mishaps later, Indiana was gearing up for overtime against the East's No. 1 seed.\n\nHere's what went wrong for the Pacers in the fourth quarter and overtime.\n\nMORE: How Celtics survived thrilling OT clash with Pacers\n\nTurnovers plagued the Pacers throughout Game 1. Indiana committed 21 turnovers in the game but none were more crucial than the two it committed in the game's final 30 seconds.\n\nWith a 117-114 lead, Indiana got a crucial stop and regained possession with an opportunity to make it a two-possession game. Tyrese Haliburton committed an unforced turnover, dribbling off his knee to give the Celtics the ball back.\n\nDespite the mishap, the Pacers got another defensive stop, forcing the Celtics to foul with 10.0 seconds remaining. Because Indiana was not yet in the bonus, it had to take the ball out from the sideline, setting up its most crucial turnover.\n\nAfter the Celtics regained possession, things went from bad to worse for the Pacers.\n\nWith 8.5 seconds remaining, Boston, trailing by three, inbounded the ball from under its basket. Jaylen Brown briefly freed himself to the left corner before being met by an intense closeout from Indiana's Pascal Siakam.\n\nBrown remained poised and hit an incredibly difficult corner 3 over Siakam, who did his best to not foul.\n\nBrown's game-tying 3 immediately brought back the philosophical discussion of whether or not basketball teams with a three-point lead should intentionally foul to prevent teams from tying the game.\n\nLeBron James was among the many to chime in.\n\nMORE: LeBron James chimes in on Pacers' decision not to foul at end of regulation in Game 1\n\nDespite the demoralizing end to regulation, the Pacers still had opportunities in overtime.\n\nWith 1:46 remaining in the extra period, Haliburton sank three free throws to put Indiana back up by two points. It would be the Pacers' last lead of the game.\n\nOn the ensuing possession, Indiana allowed three offensive rebounds before Jayson Tatum put Boston ahead with an and-one finish. One play later, another turnover from Haliburton caused a change in possession. And the Celtics took a four-point lead after a Tatum 3 with 42 seconds remaining.\n\nThe Pacers would turn the ball over again on the next possession and Boston's lead grew to six points after a Derrick White layup. Indiana would play the foul game from then on but it was too late.\n\n\"With 10 seconds (left) in regulation, we should have just taken the timeout, advanced the ball and found a way to get it in, and made a free throw or two and ended the game but it didn't happen.\"\n\nCarlisle called back to Nembhard's turnover after Boston's first intentional foul with 10 seconds remaining. The Pacers had one timeout remaining and, had they used it, would have advanced the ball to the front court.\n\nInbounding the ball in the frontcourt would have greatly decreased the chances of such a catastrophic turn of events for Indiana.\n\n\"We made some other mistakes,\" Carlisle added, \"but our guys just need to concentrate on fighting the way they fought this game from start to finish and we'll be back Thursday.\"\n\nIndiana dropped a golden opportunity to steal home court in Game 1, but it will be right back in action less than 48 hours after the final buzzer sounded.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Streetball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Streetball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-05/GettyImages-2154072114%20%281%29.jpg?itok=m8EHP68H", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

They sure seemed to be headed down a familiar path. But just when it looked like they were destined to keep the choke collar, they rose up. They grew strong in those pivotal, got-to-have it moments.\n\nThey took advantage of the countless gaffes made by the Pacers, making them pay for their miscues, but none greater than the one with a few ticks remaining in regulation.\n\nDown three with the clock running down from 10 seconds after the Pacers umpteenth turnover, Celtics forward Jaylen Brown calmly hit a corner bomb to tie the game and send it to overtime.\n\nBrown, who had a disasterous Game 7 performance in the Eastern finals last season, said he basically willed the shot in ahead of time.\n\n\"I was just telling myself the whole time, if you get it, it's going up and it's going in,\" Brown said. \"I was able to make a big-time play.\"\n\nHe sure did with Pascal Siakam in his face as he launched his off-balance prayer to tie the game.\n\nThen it was Jayson Tatum's turn to be the hero. He scored 10 of his 36 points in overtime, including a three-pointer that put the nail in the Pacers coffin with 42.8 seconds to go.\n\nTatum, who was having a rough shooting night (12-of-26, 2-of-8 from three), finally dialed it up during crunch time.\n\nBut the dynamic duo weren't alone.\n\nJrue Holiday, who has largely sacrificed his scoring this season, also rose down the stretch and overtime with 20 of his 28 points coming after halftime.\n\nBottom line: The Celtics needed to win a game like this. If they do advance to the NBA Finals, they needed to know they can deliver in key spots, in the big games.\n\nAlthough, listening to the players after the game, they never doubted they were capable.\n\n\"I think we always knew we could (win),\" said Holiday. \"Close games I don't think have ever bothered us. I think we've always stayed poised no matter if it's a win or a loss. We'd always give ourselves a chance again today. But, down 3, with some seconds left, making a big shot, and making big plays after that, we knew we had it in us.\"\n\nOf course, the Pacers were a willing accomplice. They helped the Celtics, giving them life, or, as Tatum put it, \"a second chance\" with all of their bumbling. Their whopping 21 turnovers led to 32 Celtics points.\n\nAt different points during the fourth quarter when they seemed to have the game in hand, the Pacers just gave the Celtics more chances time and again. Ditto overtime.\n\nTalk about not knowing how to close out a game, the Pacers took the cake in Game 1.\n\nAndrew Nembhard's wayward inbound pass with 10 seconds to play set up Brown for the tying score. Then how do the Pacers not foul Brown, who is not the best free throw shooter in the world, before allowing him to take that three?\n\nIt's almost an automatic to foul if a team is up by three with little time left on the clock.\n\nEven Pacers had coach Rick Carlisle fell on the sword for his team's meltdown, saying he should have called a timeout to advance the ball, and draw up a better in-bounds play.\n\nSo maybe the Celtics were lucky. Maybe the Pacers gift-wrapped the win. By the same token, they took advantage of their good fortune.\n\n\"I felt like we hit, they responded. They hit, we responded. It was just a lot of back-and-forth,\" Al Horford said following the Game 1 win. \"I think, despite all that, our group just stayed the course. We continued to work. We continued to try to play the right way. Eventually, we needed some sort of break and we got it there. I'm glad we were able to close it out in overtime.\"\n\nAdded Holiday: \"I think we always knew there was a chance. We've seen crazy stuff happen all the time ... Anything can happen. We're just the type of team that's going to keep fighting, no matter how long, no matter what it takes.\"\n\nThe Celtics were able to snatch a victory out of defeat.

Bodes well for future, right?", "body": "The Pacers shot an NBA playoff record 67.1% from the floor to beat the Knicks 130-109 and advance to the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nBoston Celtics guard Jaylen Brown is in the corner, and he's not going to make this shot. The 2024 Indiana Pacers, the most underappreciated Eastern Conference Finals team since, ahem, the 2013 Indiana Pacers, are about to storm out of another garden with another NBA playoff win, this one at TD Garden in Game 1, two days after beating the Knicks in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals at Madison Square Garden. All the Pacers need is for Brown, hemmed in the corner between Paskal Siakam on the court and Bennedict Mathurin on the bench, to miss this prayer and this game's going to --\n\nInsider Dustin Dopirak: Pacers don't foul, Jaylen Brown's 3 forces OT, and Celtics win\n\nMore: LeBron James, others believe Pacers should have fouled while up three points\n\nThe Pacers, who let this one slip through their fingers in the final seconds of regulation, threw the damn thing out of bounds in overtime. This was a game they could've won despite committing seven more turnovers, should've won despite attempting 20 less free throws, but didn't win because their best players made some bad mistakes at the worst time.\n\nBoston stole Game 1 with a 133-128 victory in overtime, and if you'd like to feel better about this for a moment, re-read the first four words of this sentence:\n\nBoston stole Game 1.\n\nYou can tell me the Celtics are the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference, went 64-18 in the regular season - seven more wins than anyone else in the NBA - and barely broke a sweat in winning each of their first two series by a 4-1 tally. You can tell me the Pacers are the No. 6 seed, won 47 games in the regular season and needed six games to beat a Milwaukee team missing MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, then seven games to beat a New York team missing half its roster.\n\nYou can tell me all that, and it's true. But so is this:\n\nThe Pacers could've won this game Tuesday night in Boston. No, they should've won this game Tuesday night in Boston.\n\nMakes you think the Pacers are going to win a handful of games in this series, eventually. Who knows? Might even win four.\n\nBoston stinks. Well, it does.\n\nEnough with the positive spin, though hang around. More coming, but first we've got to address what went wrong, because this was a playoff game, this was a loss, and after playing with valor for most of the first 47 minutes, the Pacers didn't exactly acquit themselves well in the final minute of regulation, or most of overtime.\n\nIn Boston, where the rude people are actually the nicest folks in town, memes of a dog urinating down its leg - hey look, it's the Pacers in Game 1 - were circulating on social media. Because that's what they do in that miserable town. They mock a No. 6 seed for almost beating the No. 1 seed at home.\n\nYou can have Boston.\n\nBut can the Pacers please have a better handle on the basketball Thursday night in Game 2? The Pacers committed 21 turnovers Tuesday night, and sure, some of that was caused by a Boston defense that is the stingiest, peskiest in these playoffs. The Celtics have a handful of elite defenders among a roster of savvy, smart veterans, and those guys made things difficult on the Pacers. Know who else made it difficult on the Pacers?\n\nThe Pacers made it difficult on the Pacers.\n\nIt started early, when the Celtics roared to a 12-0 lead after the Pacers missed three layups and committed two turnovers in the first 2\u00bd minutes. It was later in the quarter when Tyrese Haliburton drove into the lane and kicked out a pass to T.J. McConnell, who could've caught it only if he'd been sitting in the crowd.\n\nIt was Obi Toppin committing a series of absurd turnovers in the third quarter, as I noted in the play-by-play I keep. On one turnover, it says in my barely legible shorthand, Toppin dropped a pass out of bounds. On the other, it says only: \"Toppin: silly turnover.\"\n\nLook, if the Pacers can give away an Eastern Conference Finals game on the road, against the No. 1 seed, because of 21 turnovers, you damn right I can quote my own notebook. Might as well quote Pacers coach Rick Carlisle, too, especially since he sat down for his postgame remarks and immediately said:\n\n\"This loss is totally on me.\"\n\nCarlisle explained why, and while he's wrong about that, we'll double back to it in a moment.\n\nPacers lose, but it's a special group\n\nThe Pacers do have something special here, and the country saw what we already know.\n\nHaliburton was playing with joy, making a 35-footer in the final seconds of the first half and sinking a double-pump 3-pointer at the third quarter horn, then skipping away in glee. Haliburton had 25 points and 10 assists, including a pair of no-look passes to Siakam for dunks.\n\nSiakam was playing with force, going for 24 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists. Aaron Nesmith and Andrew Nembhard were playing their way into their next contracts someday - 14 points and six rebounds for Nesmith, 12 points and seven assists for Nembhard, hard-nosed defense by each against Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. And Myles Turner was lighting social media on fire in the first half, scoring 18 of his 23 points, including a run of 10 straight that started with one of his angry, reach-way-back dunks and ended with a pump fake followed by a slide step to the left for a 3-pointer.\n\nTurner scored those 10 consecutive points, so obviously he was hot, but he passed up an open 15-footer moments later when he spotted Nembhard alone in the corner. Nembhard made the 3.\n\nThis is a team that plays hard, plays the right way, and plays with class - not a single jerk, nary a Donte DiVincenzo or Patrick Beverley to be found on this roster. America saw that Tuesday night, and will see it five or six more times this series. Might even see it in the NBA Finals. Who knows?\n\nDoyel before Game 1: Pacers are still here, and whatever happens vs. Boston, aren't going away\n\nBut America also saw this team lose its composure in the final minute of regulation and overtime. Leading 117-114 in the final 27 seconds of regulation, the Pacers turned it over twice; Haliburton dribbled it out of bounds with 27.1 seconds left, and Nembhard threw an inbounds pass out of bounds off Siakam with 8.1 seconds left.\n\nThat's where Carlisle was trying to take the blame, continuing his first quote above like this:\n\n\"We should have just taken the timeout, advanced the ball and found a way to get it in and make a free throw or two and win the game,\" he said. \"It didn't happen and we made some other mistakes, but our guys just need to concentrate on fighting the way they fought in this game from start to finish, and we'll be back Thursday.\"\n\nEven with those late turnovers in regulation, Boston couldn't capitalize - missing four straight shots in the final 70 seconds - but Brown didn't miss No. 5. That was his 3-point heave between Siakam and Mathurin to force overtime.\n\nThe Pacers had their fingers on this game again in overtime, but like the ball kept doing, the game slipped away. After hitting a 3-pointer for a 120-117 lead and then making three free throws to make it 123-121, Haliburton lost another ball out of bounds. Then Siakam had the ball taken from him by Brown. Then the Celtics, who kept scoring at the other end, had a 129-123 lead with 20 seconds left, and it was over.\n\nThat's the bad news, and while there is finality to Game 1, the rest of this series is there for the taking. Sounds crazy, I know. Boston won 64 games! It's the No. 1 seed! Actually, it sounds like you're shouting. Settle down, and keep this in mind: Boston shot a respectable 47.5% from the floor, made 15 shots from behind the arc, committed seven less turnovers and attempted 20 more free throws than the Pacers.\n\nAnd still Boston needed the Pacers' help to win this one. At home.\n\n\"A lot of things had to go wrong for us and right for them,\" Carlisle said. \"They did, and so we've got to own it - and we've got to get ready for Thursday.\"\n\nFind IndyStar columnist Gregg Doyel on Twitter at @GreggDoyelStar or at www.facebook.com/greggdoyelstar.", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "indianapolis_star@indystar.com", "name": "Indianapolis Star", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennedict_Mathurin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bennedict Mathurin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obi Toppin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

David Ortiz, a Boston legend, captured Brown's shot on video courtside. The Boston Celtics capitalized on the Indiana Pacers' turnovers late, showing veteran experience under pressure.\n\nBoston Celtics star Jaylen Brown knocked down the biggest shot of the night to send Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals into overtime. Play-by-play broadcaster Mike Breen even added a \"double bang\" on the telecast when the ball swished through the net. However, he was not the only one with an incredible call for Brown's game-tying, contested three from the corner.\n\nBoston Red Sox legend, David Ortiz, was sitting courtside to support the Celtics and captured the shot on video. He, along with thousands of other Celtics fans, let out screams of joy when Brown tied the contest at 117 apiece with 5.7 seconds left.\n\nOrtiz is no stranger to being a part of clutch moments. He came through when the Red Sox needed him the most many times in his career.\n\nIn Game 2 of the 2013 American League Championship Series, the equivalent of the conference finals in Major League Baseball, Ortiz stepped up to the plate in the bottom of the eighth inning with the bases loaded and two outs. Boston trailed 5-1, but he changed the game with one swing. He launched the first pitch he saw from Joaqu\u00edn Benoit over the right-field wall for a grand slam, tying the game. Ortiz sent Boston fans into a frenzy at Fenway Park.\n\nEleven years later, he felt the joy those fans felt at Fenway at TD Garden when Brown came through when the Celtics needed him the most.\n\nBoston Handled the Pressure Down the Stretch Celtics took advantage of the Indiana Pacers' mistakes\n\nThe Celtics are veterans when it comes to handling the pressure late in a playoff run. In contrast, outside of Pascal Siakam, the young Indiana Pacers are in unfamiliar territory in the Eastern Conference Finals. Their inexperience proved costly in the final 30 seconds of Game 1.\n\nIndiana led 117-114 with 30 seconds left, but Tyrese Haliburton dribbled the ball off his leg for a turnover. The Pacers got a stop on the next possession, forcing Boston to foul. However, Indiana turned the ball over for a second straight possession when they attempted to inbound it. This led to Brown's triple, tying the game. On the final possession in regulation, Haliburton did not find a quality look, sending the game to overtime.\n\nIndiana Pacers and Boston Celtics Overtime Record 2023-2024\n\nTeam\n\nOT Record\n\nIndiana Pacers\n\n0-1\n\nBoston Celtics\n\n2-4\n\nThe Pacers committed 21 turnovers for the contest. If they are to upset the Celtics, Indiana has to take care of the ball better for the rest of the series. Boston ranked first in offensive and second in defensive rating for the season, so they can rely on their strengths on both ends. While the Pacers finished second in offensive rating, their defense was not strong, finishing 24th in defensive rating. Indiana cannot afford to give Boston extra possessions for this reason.

Brown took full advantage.\n\nWith Pascal Siakam in his face, Brown launched a 3-pointer from the left corner that found the bottom of the net as the clock read 5.7 seconds to secure the extra session.\n\nThere, Jayson Tatum scored 10 points including a 3-pointer with 42.8 seconds remaining to extend a Boston lead to 127-123. From there, the Celtics controlled game that saw dramatic swings for both sides from the game's opening tip. Boston walks with the early advantage in a series they're heavily favored to win.\n\nIndiana leaves with a bitter taste, having blown a golden opportunity to take a 1-0 advantage over the NBA's best team from the regular season as the No. 6 seed in the East. On a night where they shot 53.5% from the field and 37.1% from 3, the late turnover that set up Brown's 3-point heroics was Indiana's defining play of the night.\n\nIndiana had possession of the ball in the backcourt on an inbounds play with 10 seconds remaining. Andrew Nembhard was the inbounds man and first looked to Tyrese Haliburton on the baseline. With Jrue Holiday smothering Haliburton, Nembhard then looked to a cutting Siakam. But Brown was in close pursuit and made a play on the soft pass from Nembhard. The ball bounced off Siakam's hands out of bounds to set up Brown's fateful 3-pointer.\n\nThe turnover was one of 21 on the night for Indiana on a night where their offense was otherwise stellar. But the giveaways ultimately cost the Pacers the game.

The Pacers had three double-doubles in the game, including Pascal Siakam's effort, but the Celtics prevailed. The Celtics narrowly won Game 1 in overtime, and the Pacers will seek to bounce back in Game 2, which Boston is 0-2 in during this postseason.\n\nGame 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals was a demonstration of grit and grime. The Boston Celtics began the game on a 12-0 run, and the Indiana Pacers responded to eliminate that lead. It would be a back-and-forth affair until a controversial play at the end of the game, which saw the Pacers fail to foul.\n\nWith 8.5 seconds remaining in the game, the Pacers, up by three, turned ball over on an inbound pass. However, they elected not to foul, leading to Jaylen Brown obtaining the ball and nailing a corner three to tie the game at 117 apiece.\n\nTyrese Haliburton was unable to answer on the other end, so the game would end up going into overtime. There, the Celtics would win the game by a score of 133-128 to take a 1-0 series lead. Boston is now 3-0 in Game 1s this postseason.\n\nRick Carlisle Takes Blame Pacers coach Rick Carlisle took the blame for the Game 1 loss\n\nDown the stretch, the Pacers had five turnovers, including two within the last 27 seconds of the game, one of which was the critical turnover that led to Brown tying up the game.\n\nThe primary outcry ended up being Pacers' coach Rick Carlisle's failure to foul the Celtics in that moment, which would have most likely given Indiana the possession they needed to win the game. Carlisle took full responsibility for the loss during the postgame.\n\n\"This loss is totally on me with 10 seconds in regulation. We should have just taken the time out, advanced the ball, and found a way to get it in and made a free throw or two and ended the game. But it didn't happen and we made some other mistakes, but our guys just need to concentrate on fighting the way they fought in this game from start to finish.\" -Rick Carlisle\n\nHowever, according to Carlisle, there were instructions for the Pacers to foul the Celtics at that moment. But the opportunity did not present itself, leading to the Pacers holding off and electing not to foul in that moment.\n\n\"Yes [there was instruction to foul], but he caught the ball and he was faced up. So Pascal [Siakam] decided to lay off, which was, I understand, that's probably the right decision. You don't want to give up a four point play. So, you know, a lot of things had to go wrong for us and right for them. They did. And so, you know, we gotta own it.\" -Rick Carlisle\n\nTriple Double-Doubles Pacers recorded three double-doubles in the game, but it was for naught\n\nAccording to Carlisle, Pascal Siakam was willing to foul, but the moment did not present itself, and they opted not to foul. Siakam made his presence known in the game, recording a double-double with 24 points and 12 assists. Haliburton added 25 points and 10 assists, notching a double-double of his own.\n\nAnd Myles Turner put up a double-double as well, notching 23 points and 10 rebounds, meaning that three Pacers put up double-doubles in this game. Unfortunately for them, it was all for naught.\n\nMeanwhile for the Celtics, Jayson Tatum led the charge, with 36 points, including 10 clutch points in overtime. Brown had 26 points including the huge three to tie the game, and All-Defender Jrue Holiday put up a season-high 28 points.\n\n\"Our battle cry has been [to] continue to play, continue to push tempo, continue to execute, keep playing no matter what. It's served us well and it did tonight too. We got, it's unfortunate we did so many good things in this game that it came down to a couple of mistakes at the end. This is the NBA playoffs and we've got to learn from it and we got to bounce back [in Game 2].\" -Rick Carlisle\n\nBoston was sharp all-around, but by the skin of their teeth, pulled away with the Game 1 win. They are 0-2 in Game 2s this postseason, however, and the Pacers will seek to take advantage of that and bounce back on Thursday night.\n\nRelated LeBron James Critical of Key Decision Late in Pacers-Celtics Game 1 Game 1 between the Pacers and Celtics featured a dramatic end to regulation.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rick-carlisle-pacers-celtics.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Holiday's 28-point offensive explosion and stellar defensive play turned the tide in favor of Boston against Indiana. Despite a resilient effort by the Pacers, Holiday's impact, along with stellar defense from Tatum and Brown, made the difference.\n\nThe stars can have the spotlight following a big win in the NBA Playoffs, but there are players who can come through during the biggest stretches of the game.\n\nThe Boston Celtics pulled out a 133-128 overtime victory over the Indiana Pacers in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals on Tuesday night. The TD Garden witnessed remarkable heroics from stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown to have Boston take down Indiana. But there was another player Brown made sure to point out who made a huge difference in helping the team win.\n\n\"Jrue was fantastic... he's the reason why we won this game.\"\n\nHoliday's Impact In Game 1 Provided 28-8-7-3 Stat Line\n\nJrue Holiday had a strong performance of 28 points, eight assists, seven rebounds, and three steals on 10-of-16 shooting from the field and 4-of-8 from beyond the arc.\n\nHis offensive production stood out the most in this game. According to StatMuse, it's the most points he has ever scored in a game as a member of the Celtics.\n\nHis display on the defensive side of the ball was excellent, guarding Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton on multiple occasions. During overtime, Holiday forced Haliburton to lose control of the ball and step out of bounds, indicating the momentum had shifted in Boston's favor after Indiana was on the brink of stunning the Celtics on the road.\n\nBrown, who finished with 26 points to go with seven rebounds and five assists as he made the game-tying three-pointer to force overtime, praised his teammate. He believed Holiday's performance at both ends throughout the course of the game provided Boston with what they needed to secure the win.\n\nHoliday's defense was heavily noted with three steals throughout the night. He helped Boston finish with 11 steals -- three each by him, Brown, and Tatum. According to ESPN, the Celtics became the first team in NBA playoff history to have three players record 25 points and three steals in a game.\n\nDespite falling behind near the end of regulation, Holiday said the Celtics stayed resilient in their approach to find ways to win.\n\n\"I think we always knew that there's always a chance. We've seen crazy stuff happen all the time. I don't think that we think we lost the game until we actually lost the game and that's part of the reason why we were so resilient.\"\n\nWhat's Next For Celtics-Pacers Boston Leads 1-0 In Series\n\nHaving gotten a lot of rest following a five-game series win over Cleveland in the East Semis, there was bound to be some rust from Boston. This came to be true on defense, giving up 128 points even though they came through on that side of the ball when they needed to.\n\nOn the other side, it was a missed opportunity for Indiana to take the series lead to begin the conference finals. With their defensive miscues costing them the game, it would take a lot of adjusting for them to bounce back against a potent Celtics squad.\n\nGame 2 is set to begin with Boston hosting Indiana on May 23 at 8:00 p.m. EST.\n\nRelated Tyrese Haliburton Tabs Celtics' Star as 'Best Defender in the NBA' After the Indiana Pacers dropped a competitive Game 1 to the Boston Celtics, Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton was asked postgame about Jrue Holiday.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/usatsi_23342685.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-23", "textStart": 3438, "textEnd": 3444}], "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Luckily, on an inbounds pass with 10 seconds left, Pascal Siakam touched the ball out of bounds on a play that likely would've been called out on Brown.\n\nTatum's 3-pointer that put the Cs up 127-123 with 42.8 seconds left on the clock in overtime was the dagger in Indiana's heart.\n\nNBA talking heads are going to be empty without the ridiculous anti-Tatum discourse after Game 1. Even during the game, many tried to share the \"LUHVGO\" dancing Tatum memes, but No. 0 gave them zero credibility with his star performance.\n\nEven without Kristaps Porzingis for the first couple games of the Eastern Conference Finals, Boston is heavily favored to knock off Indiana. A Game 1 loss would've caused the greatest overreaction ever seen in playoff history.\n\nSome will likely hold it against the Celtics that they didn't cover the spread and needed overtime to put down the Pacers, but that's disregarding the momentum Indiana created with their Game 7 Eastern Conference Semifinals win against the New York Knicks at MSG.\n\nA legacy was not saved on May 21. It was cemented. Tatum's legend has grown, as has Brown's, and the Celtics are closing in on their second Finals appearance of the post-Big Three era with the win.", "source": {"uri": "hardwoodhoudini.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hardwood Houdini"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5061,h_2846,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/18/01hyf4ctdbxjqtnrx80t.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 1651, "textEnd": 1657}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

It was the first time that the Pacers were in this position since 2014, and they were looking forward to the opportunity.\n\nBut they knew the Celtics would be tough. \"These guys are almost impossible to match up with really because of their size and skill,\" Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle said before Game 1. Indiana went 2-3 against Boston in the regular season, and the hosts won 60+ games for a reason. They are talented, and the start of the series was going to be vital.\n\nBoston started off the game with two highlight plays -- a dunk from Jaylen Brown and a block from Al Horford. The Celtics crowd was vibrant and invested in the game after just a 2-0 stretch. It was a dream start for the hosts.\n\nIndiana was trying to play fast early. They were getting the ball up the floor quickly even after Boston made shots. But the Celtics defense was crushing them, and the hosts were shooting well. It was 12-0 after less than three minutes when Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle took a timeout to talk things over.\n\nThe stoppage helped as the Pacers quickly went on a 7-2 run. They finally knocked down some shots and were back in the game. They needed to pair it with some stops, though, and that was much harder.\n\nEven as the Pacers reached 16 on the scoreboard, they were down by nine. They weren't able to slow down the Celtics and their offensive attack. Every screen and quick action messed up Indiana's scheme, and they took the ball out of the net often in the first eight minutes of play.\n\nIndiana kept pushing, though, and they cut the lead to three at 29-26 late in the frame. They had erased most of their poor start, which was important, but they still had work to do. Boston is relentless on both ends.\n\nReserve forward Obi Toppin was particularly valuable for the blue and gold early. He was efficient and made shots from all over the court. Thanks to his strong offensive play, it was a three-point game after one quarter. The Celtics led 34-31 after 12 minutes, and Toppin had 11 points.\n\nTo kick off the second period, the Celtics hit a few shots to expand their lead to eight. Even when they weren't knocking down their good looks, the top-seeded group was able to generate open shots. It made it hard for the Pacers to keep up.\n\nBoston's advantage reached 10 after four minutes of second quarter play, and Carlisle took a timeout. His team needed to play better defense if they were going to keep the scoreboard close.\n\nIndiana rolled out a bigger lineup after the stoppage with Pascal Siakam at the three spot, and that unit was successful for a few trips to keep the margin narrow. Those bursts are what the Pacers would need throughout the night to complete a comeback.\n\nMyles Turner pulled the visitors back into the game with several impressive offensive plays in a row. He finished a tough layup, threw down a dunk, and drilled a three in quick succession, and it cut the edge down to five. The Celtics took a timeout at the time, and Turner was up to 18 points.\n\nIndiana's starting five re-entered the game not long after the stoppage, and they went on a run. Tyrese Haliburton made some plays, and Indiana was generating, and making, open shots. They were able to surge and tie the game at 57 with under three minutes to go until halftime. Their bad start was a thing of the past.\n\nThey were able to keep the score tied going into halftime. It was 64 all at the break, with Haliburton getting going in the final stretch. He hit a deep three just before the second quarter buzzer. Haliburton had 11 points at halftime, as did Toppin. Turner led Indiana with 18.\n\nTo kick off the third quarter, Haliburton kept rolling. He scored to give Indiana their first lead of the game to start the half, and he hit a three-point shot on the next possession to extend that edge. He looked great after a slower start.\n\nBoston responded with a quick 7-0 run, though, and they were back in front. Keeping the Celtics away is as tough as it gets, and the Pacers were finding out the hard way. Stopping them for multiple possessions in a row was difficult.\n\nTurnovers were becoming an issue for the Pacers. They kept giving the ball away with sloppy ball handling or a lazy pass, and the Celtics took advantage. The hosts raced ahead to an eight-point lead in the middle of the third quarter as the blue and gold had some self-inflicted errors.\n\nThose mistakes, combined with an offensive drought, for the Pacers led to a 12-0 Boston run. The Celtics were up by double figures again and looked as potent as they did to start the game. Carlisle took a timeout to stop the bleeding.\n\nThey struggled to catch back up. The Celtics lead remained just over 10 for the next few minutes as the squads traded baskets. Indiana needed a run, but they couldn't get it. Their defense needed to level up again.\n\nIt finally did for a few possessions, and it ignited a 9-0 run from the visitors. They cut the advantage to four and were right back in the game. Siakam was playing well in that stretch, as was T.J. McConnell. The Pacers second unit was effective to that point.\n\nAfter three quarters, the Celtics were ahead 94-93. Haliburton hit a tough three at the buzzer of the quarter to cut into the edge, but Indiana still was behind entering winning time. They needed a strong close. Turner's 20 points led the way through three frames.\n\nTo kick off the final period, the Pacers took the lead once again. Even when the Celtics were up double-digits, the blue and gold didn't quit. They kept giving themselves a chance, which was setting up an exciting finish.\n\nThe score stayed close for the next few minutes, and the Celtics led by three when half of the fourth quarter had passed at 104-101. But soon after, Turner hit a three to tie the game, and Siakam followed it up with a mid-range shot. Suddenly, it was crunch time and the Pacers were ahead. They were playing with confidence.\n\nTheir four-point advantage stuck around for a few minutes, but with three minutes to go Horford hit a triple to cut the Pacers edge to one. It was going to be an epic final stretch to kick off the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nThe Pacers lead reached five in the last two minutes of play after a tough jumper from Andrew Nembhard. They were a few strong possessions away from stealing Game 1 on the road, but they still needed to make some plays.\n\nLeading by one with under one minute to go, Nembhard found the bottom of the net and buried another shot. The Celtics called a timeout on their next possession trailing by three with 39.1 seconds to go.They had a massive possession coming up.\n\nThe Pacers got a stop, but they turned it over on their next possession. Boston had another chance, but they missed two shots from in close. Indiana grabbed the rebound, meaning they could win the game by making foul shots.\n\nInstead, the Pacers fumbled an inbounds opportunity and turned it over again. That gave Boston the ball down by three with 8.5 seconds to go. The final stretch of the game featured many mistakes from both teams.\n\nBrown stepped up. With 5.7 seconds left in the game, he rose up for a three in the left corner and buried it. That tied the game at 117. The Pacers had one more chance, but it was an epic shot to possibly extend the game.\n\nHaliburton missed a three at the buzzer, and the game was off to overtime. The Pacers had a few chances to put the game away in the final seconds, but they weren't able to do so. Now, they had to be better than the Celtics for an additional five-minute period.\n\nTo kick off the extra five minutes, Haliburton hit a three to give Indiana the lead again. It was a massive shot. The Pacers needed some momentum and stability after their tough close to regulation, and Haliburton provided it.\n\nBoston scored the next four points to reclaim the lead, though, and Pacers wing Aaron Nesmith fouled out in that stretch. Things were going to be that much tougher for the blue and gold in the final minutes without him.\n\nIndiana scored via three foul shots from Haliburton to re-capture the advantage. Every possession was tense down the stretch, and the Celtics were now in need of points to catch back up on the scoreboard.\n\nThey got three via a Tatum and-one, and then Haliburton turned the ball over. The hosts led by one with under a minute remaining -- the Pacers needed a stop. But they didn't get it as Tatum drilled a three to give the Celtics a four-point lead with 42.8 left.\n\nThe Pacers turned it over on their next possession, putting their chances on life support. And Derrick White all but put the game away with a layup on the next possession. Indiana needed a miracle.\n\nThey didn't get it. Despite leading late in regulation, the Pacers dropped Game 1 133-128 in overtime. They had chances to win it, but 21 turnovers was too many to overcome. Boston leads the series 1-0.\n\nHaliburton finished with 25 points and 10 assists. Siakam added 24 points and great defense. Turner had 23 points.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-out_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Time-out (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Obi Toppin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

For Jaylen Brown, though, maybe the quiet made it easier to find clarity.\n\n\"I was talking to myself,\" he said. \"'If I get this shot, it's going in.' I was telling myself the whole time, 'You get it, it's going up and it's going in.'\"\n\nBrown had just given the Celtics a chance when he forced a turnover on an inbounds pass with 8.5 seconds left and his team trailing by 3. Now, Jrue Holiday was preparing to inbound the ball from under Boston's basket, and Brown was wrapping up his inner pep talk.\n\nHoliday looked to his left, where Jayson Tatum was caught up in congestion. Then Holiday looked to his right, where Brown had found space in the left corner after curling off a screen from Derrick White.\n\nWith Indiana's Pascal Siakam close enough to smell his breath, Brown pump-faked once before flinging up a shot that skimmed off the back of the rim and through the net with 5.7 seconds left.\n\nThere were still important moments to come, including a defensive stop to end regulation and a strong overtime, but that all felt inevitable following Brown's instant-classic shot that became the catalyst for this wild 133-128 win.\n\n\"We always knew that there's always a chance,\" Holiday said. \"We've seen crazy stuff happen all the time, so I don't think that we think we lost the game until we actually lost the game.\"\n\nLast season the Celtics lost Game 1 of the conference finals here to the Heat and spiraled into a 3-0 hole before eventually losing the series in seven games. Now, they have survived a scare while also taking early control of this series. But the sixth-seeded Pacers clearly have their attention.\n\nIndiana won just 47 games during the regular season and reached this round by slipping past the undermanned Bucks and Knicks. It entered Tuesday as substantial underdogs despite the fact that Celtics center Kristaps Porzingis is likely to miss at least several more games due to a calf strain.\n\nStill, in recent days the Celtics spoke with caution about the challenges Indiana will present with its high-powered, fast-paced offense. It may have even been more jarring than they were expecting.\n\n\"It's one thing watching it on film,\" Brown said, \"and then [another] seeing it in person.\"\n\nAfter the Pacers missed their first six shots, there were long stretches in which they hardly missed again. They wiped away an early 12-point deficit and also climbed out of a 13-point third-quarter hole thanks to their relentless and precise shot-making.\n\nIndiana shot 53.5 percent from the field overall, but was unable to overcome its 22 turnovers, some of which were perplexing.\n\nOn one, with 30 seconds left in regulation and Indiana leading, 117-114, Tyrese Haliburton dribbled upcourt and simply lost the ball as if it had been poked away by a ghost.\n\nThe Celtics were initially unable to capitalize. White missed a layup and Tatum grabbed the offensive rebound and missed a fadeaway jumper. The Celtics fouled, leading to a sideline out of bounds play, and Pacers coach Rick Carlisle later said he should have used a timeout to advance the ball past halfcourt.\n\nInstead, Andrew Nembhard's cross-court pass to Siakam was obstructed by Brown, and the ball caromed out of bounds in Boston's favor. Two unlikely turnovers in a 20-second span.\n\n\"That [expletive] was chaos,\" Tatum said. \"That [expletive] was wild. But just stay present, stay in the moment. As long as there's time still on the clock and the game is within reach, we feel like we have a chance.\"\n\nTatum was at the center of the Celtics' struggles as they unraveled down the stretch in regulation and had to fight through challenging moments in overtime. In the final minute of the fourth quarter he missed a wide-open 3-pointer that could have tied the score, along with the late putback attempt.\n\nThen with the Celtics clinging to a 121-120 lead with 1:50 left in overtime there was miscommunication as he turned and lofted a pass into empty space, allowing Haliburton to streak in for a steal that led to him being fouled on a 3-pointer soon after.\n\nBut Tatum redeemed himself in the final 72 seconds. He converted a three-point play in the paint to give Boston a 124-123 lead, and after another Haliburton turnover caused by the fierce ball pressure of Jrue Holiday, Tatum calmly stepped into a 3-pointer from the top of the key that all but finished off Indiana.\n\n\"Big-time players make big-time plays,\" he said. \"Simple as that.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fadeaway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fadeaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-out_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Time-out (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_moves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball moves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/1IwBg__ihkkZG4sLSQ6-wvlPJu8=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/GLJJR3BUBRKZ2TA3LS4YFEJVSA.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Indiana went toe to toe against the Celtics from start to end in large part because of a brilliant all-around effort by Pascal Siakam. The versatile forward was expected to play a huge role for the Pacers in the series opener and he looked great for the most part of the contest. He even duplicated a franchise feat only one man had ever done before in Pacers club history, per StatMuse.\n\nThe Pacers suffered a deflating 133-128 loss to the Celtics in Game 1 that put Siakam's production to waste. It is also worth noting that it was Siakam who challenged Jaylen Brown's shot near the end of regulation that went in and forced overtime. That hurts Siakam and the Pacers but they can take heart from the fact that they made the Celtics sweat. They entered the game as a double-digit underdog and nearly completed a stunner at TD Garden. A moral victory doesn't reflect on paper but that's the best the Pacers could take away from their series-opening loss, notwithstanding the errors and poor decisions they made that led to their painful loss at the hands of Jayson Tatum and company.\n\nSiakam finished Game 1 with 24 points on 12/23 shooting from the field, 12 rebounds, seven assists, and a steal. He probably has to be even more aggressive going forward in the series, considering that he got zero trips to the foul line in the Celtics game. However, it's seemingly an issue the Pacers, as a team, have been constantly dealing with since the playoffs started.\n\n\"The Celtics have the highest free throw differential (+93) this playoffs. The Pacers have the lowest free throw differential (-100) this playoffs,\" shared StatMuse after Game 1.\n\nSo far in the 2024 NBA Playoffs, Siakam, who won a title in 2019 with the Toronto Raptors, is pacing Indiana with 21.1 points per game on 53.7 percent shooting from the floor, 7.5 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per contest.\n\nThe Pacers also got ample production in Game 1 from Tyrese Haliburton and Myles Turner, who had 25 and 23 points, respectively. Haliburton also dished out 10 assists, while Turner grabbed 10 boards to go with four assists and two blocks.\n\nBack to the drawing board for the Pacers after brutal Game 1 loss to Celtics\n\nLosing the series opener against the top seed in the Eastern Conference (and in the entire NBA, for that matter) in such a painful manner was definitely not the best way to kick off the conference finals round for the Pacers, but it is also worth mentioning that Indiana lost both Game 1s of their first and second-round series versus the Milwaukee Bucks and the New York Knicks, respectively. They even dropped the first two games of the Knicks series and trailed New York after five games before stitching together two wins in a row while staring playoff death in the eyes.\n\nSiakam and the Pacers will look to get back on track and steal a win in Boston this coming Saturday before flying back to Indiana for Games 3 and 4. It will always be a tough assignment for the Pacers to take down a team like Boston, but the signs are there that they could do it.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rexwell_villas@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Rexwell Villas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/f4f1e41a-17e9-11ef-b7fc-76a2217e7cb7.avif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

It's not going to be easy.", "body": "Boston forward Jayson Tatum puts up a shot against Indiana's Aaron Nesmith during Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals on Tuesday in Boston. Michael Dwyer/Associated Press\n\nBOSTON -- The Boston Celtics have made a tradition out of this time of year.\n\nWhen the weather beckons people outside, with robed graduates posing around Boston Public Garden and tourists falling for the Swan Boats trap, the Celtics celebrate the end of May by hosting the Eastern Conference finals. It has become a birthright of the team's young, bright stars who have been aged by playoff successes, and failures, and have been saddled with the kind of criticism usually reserved for superstars who fall short of expectations.\n\nFive appearances in the conference finals in seven seasons together can equally varnish and vaporize a reputation when you're as talented as perennial all-star Jayson Tatum, or as acclaimed as Jaylen Brown, an all-NBA selection a year ago, yet you don't possess a championship ring to completely silence the pundits.\n\nAnd so they're at it again. These Celtics are back in another conference finals, now against the Indiana Pacers. They're again teasing a spoiled fan base that awaits an 18th championship banner, once more proving who runs the East while breezing into the end of May, yet reminding everyone this wouldn't be a Celtics conference finals without the crazy. It's their tradition.\n\nMaking sure there'd be bedlam, the Celtics opened the series on their home floor Tuesday night with a 133-128 overtime win. They needed Brown to make a heroic shot late in the fourth quarter to steal Game 1.\n\n\"I think it's always great to come out with a win,\" Brown said after he scored 26 points and saved Boston by nailing a tying 3-pointer in front of the Pacers' bench with 6.1 seconds remaining in regulation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Obviously, we've got to tighten up in some areas,\" Brown continued. \"I think the majority of it was just transition. We knew (the Pacers) were going to be fast. They didn't surprise us. But it's one thing watching it on film and then seeing it in person. They just got out of a dogfight in New York, and it just felt like they were flying by us. We got to get better. We've got to match their intensity if we want to win this series.\"\n\nAlthough the sixth-seeded Pacers - the gate crashers of the East - were coming off a seven-game rumble against the New York Knicks, they looked fresh and bouncy, rather than like a team that had just one full day to rest and prepare for top-seeded Boston. The Pacers showed they didn't come this far for the sightseeing.\n\nEach time Boston pushed the lead to double digits, Indiana punched right back. The Pacers didn't need the officials' whistles to aid their comeback. Although there were no blatant blown calls - plenty plagued the Pacers in the Knicks series - by the end of the third quarter, Indiana had been awarded just two free throws, compared with the Celtics' 21 attempts. The imbalance didn't harm the Pacers, and they still moved ahead 115-110 with less than two minutes left in regulation.\n\nWatching Boston fall behind late compelled many fans inside TD Garden to leave their seats and search for the nearest exits. They had seen heartbreak before in the conference finals, including just last year when the eighth-seeded Miami Heat snatched away Boston's home-court advantage. But things were supposed to be different this time. At least that's what the signs say.\n\nDifferent Here. That's the theme for the 2023-24 season, introduced way back before Boston set a franchise record with 20 straight wins at home to start the year and then finished the schedule 14 games ahead of everyone else in the Eastern Conference. After the sparkling regular season, the motto has carried into the playoffs, where the Celtics needed only 10 games to get through the first and second rounds, bullying a pair of teams weakened by injuries (Miami and Cleveland). The slogan still decorates the back hallways of the arena and unfurls on a giant green flag while being waved on the court by Lucky, the human mascot dressed as a leprechaun.\n\nDifferent Here. OK, but is it really? Boston might have rolled through the regular season, then glided in the opening rounds of the playoffs, but here, during this important stretch of the calendar, this team bears a striking resemblance to last year's juggernaut that reached the Eastern Conference finals: it's just as vulnerable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndiana forward Aaron Nesmith is called for a charge against Boston guard Jrue Holiday during Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals on Tuesday in Boston. Michael Dwyer/Associated Press\n\nNow playing the role of the 2023 playoff Celtics ... the 2024 playoff Celtics.\n\nThere are issues with this top seed. There's the fact that - again - the reserves might look great in their green and white warm-ups but then look unplayable for stretches out on the floor. Last year, Miami had more reliable play from its bench than the Celtics got from theirs. On Tuesday night, the Pacers' shortened rotation - essentially consisting of two reserves in Obi Toppin and T.J. McConnell - outscored Boston's backups 30-13. As the series moves forward, Boston Coach Joe Mazzulla may have to lean more on his starters, as he did Tuesday by playing point guard Jrue Holiday 48 minutes (11 more than he averaged during the first two rounds).\n\n\"Jrue was exceptional,\" Brown said. \"Shout out to Jrue. He's the reason we've won this game.\"\n\nBoston can get away with wearing out Holiday, a dogged defender and former champion who had 28 points, eight assists and seven rebounds Tuesday. But there is no hiding starting center Al Horford on the floor when Pacers players are hunting him for matchups, and there's no place to sit him on the sideline when the alternative would be giving more minutes to 7-foot-1 Luke Kornet, who would be tasked with minding versatile center Myles Turner or springy leapers such as Toppin or Isaiah Jackson.\n\nThen there's the matter of those vanishing double-digit leads. Boston peaked with a 13-point cushion late in the third quarter of Game 1, and considering the team's free-throw and home-court advantage, it shouldn't have been a hard ask to tilt the scoreboard even more. Instead, the Pacers paired their energy guys off the bench with two starters, and the Celtics squandered the lead. Then they nearly squandered the game.\n\n\"It really just felt like we had a second chance,\" Tatum, who finished with 36 points and 12 rebounds, said of his feeling when overtime arrived. \"The end of the third and fourth quarter, we didn't necessarily play well enough where we may have deserved to win. We obviously made some plays at the end. J.B. gave us a second chance by hitting the shot.\"\n\nIn their first real test of the postseason, the Celtics barely survived a game against a team they're heavily favored to beat. Only after Brown submitted his latest entry for Celtics lore, and his teammates took control in overtime, did the night feel secure, even if the series does not. Then again, it wouldn't be springtime in Boston without a little drama.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

It seemed like it was a foregone conclusion that they'll be taking a 1-0 lead in the series, as they led the game 117-114 with eight seconds remaining in the game while having control of the basketball. Instead, a comedy of errors ensued, and the Pacers are now staring at a 1-0 series deficit after the Celtics came storming back with a 133-128 victory in overtime.\n\nThere will be plenty of blame thrown at Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle for his mismanagement of the final few seconds of the game. The trendiest topic will be his decision not to foul the Celtics with eight seconds remaining and Indiana up by three, as it would have prevented Boston from hoisting up a game-tying three-point attempt.\n\nCarlisle, however, did not see that as his fatal mistake. During his postgame presser, the Pacers head coach admitted that he should have called a timeout on the possession prior to Jaylen Brown's game-tying three that sent the game to overtime to prevent what ended up being a crucial turnover from Andrew Nembhard.\n\n\"This loss is totally on me. With 10 seconds in regulation, we should have just taken the timeout, advanced the ball and found a way to get it in and made a free throw or two and ended the game,\" Carlisle said, via ClutchPoints Twitter (X). \"But it didn't happen. We made some other mistakes. But our guys just need to concentrate on fighting the way they fought in this game from start to finish and we'll be back Thursday.\"\n\nIndeed, the Pacers could have made it easier for themselves had they taken a timeout with eight seconds to go in the contest. Inbounding from the sideline in the backcourt is not easy; advancing the basketball would not have guaranteed a successful inbound, but it would have at least allowed them to use the entire court to try and get the ball in.\n\nBut now, it's too late for the Pacers to do anything about their Game 1 loss. What's going to be important from here on out is that they stay the course and then just clean up their execution late in games if push comes to shove.\n\nTyrese Haliburton points the finger away from the Pacers head coach\n\nBlaming the head coach seems to be the easy way out for pundits whenever a team fails to execute late in games. In the Pacers' case, attributing some of the blame to Rick Carlisle seems rather fair, however. Carlisle himself accepted that he had a part to play in the Pacers' late-game meltdown against the Celtics. But the players also deserve their fair share of the blame as well.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's the players who produce on the court, not the coaches. The blame falls even more on a star player's shoulders, as it's his responsibility to lead the team to victory. For Tyrese Haliburton, he was not shy in owning up to some of the mistakes he made in a heartbreaking 133-128 overtime loss to the Celtics in Game 1.\n\n\"That's not on him. Us as players, we have to do a better job. I had two bad turnovers that I feel like cost us the game. One in the fourth, one in overtime. I understand he's protecting us, protecting me as well, but I'll take [the blame] more than he should,\" Haliburton said, via NBA TV on Twitter (X).\n\nIndeed, Haliburton had a few careless turnovers at such crucial moments. One came with around 30 seconds left in regulation; Haliburton, when advancing the ball past the halfcourt line, lost the ball, forcing Aaron Nesmith to save it and fail at doing so. That gave the Celtics a chance to tie the game or come within one, but the Pacers caught a break when Derrick White blew a layup and Jayson Tatum missed a fadeaway.\n\nAnd then in overtime, with the Pacers only down by one, 124-123, Haliburton could not shake off Jrue Holiday's defense. Holiday was smothering him, and as a result, Haliburton lost his dribble and then his balance. He proceeded to turn the ball over, setting up a dagger three from Jayson Tatum that put the Celtics up by three.\n\nThese are the kinds of losses that snatch a team's soul. But for Haliburton and the Pacers, this is not the first Game 1 they have lost in this year's playoffs.

Turnovers,\" Haliburton began. \"I had two bad turnovers that I feel cost us the game.\"\n\nThe Pacers arrived in Boston after upsetting the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round and the New York Knicks in the second - both times after losing Game 1. The Celtics are the NBA's top-seeded team, seven wins ahead of their closest competition and 17 wins better than the Pacers.\n\nAnd when Boston opened a 12-0 lead on Tuesday night, it looked like the series might not even be competitive. But Indiana tied it by halftime, led 115-110 with 1:57 left in regulation and even had a three-point lead with 40 seconds left.\n\n\"We know we can play with these guys,\" Haliburton said. There's a lot of people out here saying we don't belong here. We don't really care. We know we belong.\"\n\nIt was turnovers - 22 of them for 32 points, and several in key spots - that cost them. In addition to Haliburton dribbling off his foot with 28 seconds left in a three-point game when he wasn't being closely guarded, he also lost the ball out of bounds with 1:02 left in overtime.\n\n\"Big-time turnovers,\" Pacers center Myles Turner said. \"We showed our age a little bit tonight, being a youthful team in this high stakes of a game. We made some mistakes. A lot of uncharacteristic turnovers.\"\n\nThe Pacers led 117-114 with the ball after Jayson Tatum missed a potential game-tying 3-pointer with 37 seconds left. But Haliburton dribbled off his foot, giving Boston two more looks at the basket before Turner grabbed a rebound and was fouled with 10 seconds remaining.\n\nThat's when Andrew Nembhard threw away the inbounds pass, handing the Celtics yet another chance. Jrue Holiday found Jaylen Brown in the left corner; Pascal Siakam was supposed to foul him but hesitated, fearful of giving up three free throws.\n\nBrown drained the 3, tying the score 117-all. Haliburton got the ball with a decent look at the basket, but he went looking for a better one and wound up tossing up a heavily contested, off-balance shot at the buzzer.\n\n\"That's replayed a bunch of times in my head already,\" Haliburton said. \"That was probably the look for me to shoot.\"\n\nGame 2 is Thursday night before the series shifts to Indianapolis. The Pacers will need to win at least once in Boston, and they aren't likely to get a better chance.\n\n\"This loss is totally on me,\" coach Rick Carlisle said, blaming himself for not calling a timeout to advance the ball with 10 seconds left. \"We made some other mistakes. ... We've got to own it, and we've got to get ready for Thursday.\"\n\nCarlisle, who was fined $35,000 for complaining about the officiating in the second-round series against the Knicks, declined to comment on a 30-10 free throw differential - 23-3 in regulation.\n\n\"My daughter's already going to sit out one semester of college,\" he said. \"I can't have her take a whole year off.\"", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jimmy_golen@eagletribune.com", "name": "Jimmy Golen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/1a/11a7e6e4-5d84-5677-bc93-8254a4f8975a/664d7ac0253ed.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

They are not strangers to unfriendly arenas having just beat the New York Knicks in a Game 7 Sunday at Madison Square Garden.\n\nIndiana's relentless offense got it back in the game, and the Pacers owned a 3-point lead with 46.8 seconds left in the fourth quarter. The Pacers then committed costly turnovers and failed to protect the lead.\n\nTatum followed a 3-point play with a 3-pointer from the top of the arc, giving Boston a 127-123 lead with 42.9 seconds to go, and it was enough cushion to escape with a victory.\n\nTatum scored a game-high 36 points and collected 12 rebounds and had three steals. He was one of three Celtics players with at least 26 points, seven rebounds and three steals. Brown had 26 pints, six rebounds, five assists and three steals, and Jrue Holiday produced 28 points, eight assists, seven rebounds and three steals.\n\nGame 2 is Thursday in Boston (8 p.m. ET, ESPN).\n\nThe Celtics had the No. 1 offense and the Pacers the No. 2 offense during the regular season. The scoring prowess was apparent. Both teams hovered at the 50% mark from the field with Boston 47.5% and Indiana at 53.5%, and seven Pacers scored in double-figured led by Tyrese Haliburton's 25 points and 10 assists. Pascal Siakam had 24 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists and Myles Turner added 23 points and 10 rebounds for the Pacers.\n\nWhile Boston had the league's No. 2 defense, Indiana's plan is to apply as much pressure as possible with their pace.\n\nVeteran big man Al Horford, who is in the starting lineup for the injured Kristaps Porzingis, had 15 points and six rebounds. He doesn't place what Porzingis does but his experience helps minimize Porzingis' absence. Porzingis hasn't played since Game 4 of the first round because of strained right calf. He is targeting a possible Game 4 return, ESPN reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe Celtics shot 30 free throws, making 24, and the Pacers were just 9-for-10 from the foul line with seven of those attempts coming overtime. That's in a part a byproduct of how both teams play. Pacers coach Rick Carlisle complained about the officiating during the Knicks series, and the NBA fined him $35,000 for \"public criticism of the officiating and questioning the integrity of the league and its officials,\" the league said in a news release.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/v0X8fF_HpGEbX6pmyoiwHg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_sports_articles_558/6c6cd86b67c9adc981c4ed2a75414e0e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

One of those plays, the final play of the fourth quarter, continued to linger.\n\n\"That's replayed in my head a hundred times already and it'll replay after I get out of here, but I can't dwell on it,\" Haliburton said following a 25-point, 10-assist performance. \"I felt like that was probably the look for me to shoot and wish I did, but I didn't.\"\n\nTo be clear, from a process standpoint, Haliburton did his job on the final play. With 5.7 seconds remaining in a tie game, he took the final shot. He gave his team a chance to win the game, while also not putting his team at risk of losing the game by taking a shot too early and giving possession back to the Celtics. The shot just didn't go in.\n\nBut as he detailed following the game, Haliburton couldn't help but think that a deep 3-point attempt shortly after catching the inbounds pass would have had a much better chance of going in than his off-balance, double-pumped attempt just before the buzzer five seconds later.\n\nAnd he may be right.\n\nWith 6.2 seconds remaining before the end of the second quarter, the Pacers ran an inbounds play that quickly put the ball in Haliburton's hands and the Pacers guard attempted a 35-foot 3-point shot. He knocked that shot down with 1.8 seconds remaining before halftime.\n\nBut also consider Haliburton's buzzer-beater at the end of the third quarter.\n\nWith 3.4 seconds, the Pacers inbounded the ball to Haliburton. He took one dribble and thought he was going to have an open look, but Jaylen Brown shut down his space. After a few pivots, the Pacers guard dipped past Brown, leaped in the air, double-pumped and threw in a 29-footer off the glass as the buzzer expired.\n\nHitting the shot at the end of the second quarter showed that Haliburton might have been right to think that he should have taken a deep 3 with five seconds remaining when he initially had the space to fire off a 3-pointer before Derrick White arrived. But hitting the shot at the end of the third quarter showed that Haliburton is capable of hitting tough, leaning shots that take all of the possible time off the clock. In general, making sure your opponent does not get another chance to score is the priority in a tie game at that stage.\n\nHaliburton contemplating whether or not the shot he took at the end of regulation and was the right one may not be all that productive of an activity, but it is certainly going to be tough for the Pacers to not dwell on the missed opportunity of stealing Game 1 and opening the Eastern Conference finals with a win on the road in Boston.\n\n\"Really, really tough pill to swallow,\" Pacers guard T.J. McConnell told The Athletic. \"Knowing how close we were to getting that game (sighs), it's difficult, but we have to move on and come with the same intensity and mindset in Game 2.\"\n\n\"We gave it away,\" Pacers wing Aaron Nesmith said. \"We should have won the game.\"\n\nThat is where the other two mistakes Haliburton lamented during his post-game press conference come into the picture. Those two mistakes were far more controllable and thus, far more meaningful moving forward as the Pacers try to bounce back and put together a plan to win Game 2.\n\nWith 36.7 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, Pacers guard Andrew Nembhard secured a defensive rebound with the Pacers up by three. To get to that point, the Pacers erased a 13-point second-half deficit by playing like the more composed team.\n\nAs the Celtics struggled to score in the fourth quarter, the Pacers manipulated defenders and put themselves in advantageous positions.\n\nPascal Siakam, as he has throughout the Pacers' postseason run, served as a calming presence and scored 10 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter. Repeatedly in the fourth quarter, Haliburton found Siakam at the free throw line and the Pacers' midseason acquisition showed why the organization believed he could be a difference maker for them with mid-range jumpers to score points in half court situations.\n\nAfter the Celtics worked to take away those looks for Siakam, the Pacers went to Nembhard working against Celtics center Al Horford. All postseason, Nembhard has looked cool under pressure and he did it again on Tuesday, hitting two massive shots in isolation against Horford to help the Pacers maintain their lead late in the game.\n\nFollowing Nembhard's second clutch bucket with 46.8 seconds remaining to give the Pacers a 117-114 lead, Celtics star Jayson Tatum missed an open top-of-the-key 3 with 36.7 seconds remaining and Nembhard grabbed the rebound. He pitched it ahead to Haliburton, who looked to push in transition and then bounced the ball off his right leg. Nesmith tried to save it, but it was too late.\n\n\"I don't know, there was like three different occasions where I dribbled the ball off my foot today,\" Haliburton said. \"I don't know what happened. It's frustrating because that's not something that happens normally for me and nobody forced it, I just dribbled the ball off my foot. So (it's) frustrating, to say the least, but I'll learn from it, and I'll be better in Game 2.\"\n\nEven with that mistake, very little changed for Indiana as the Celtics missed two more shots before the Pacers were able to corral a defensive rebound and draw a foul. Up by three points with 10 seconds left, all the Pacers needed to do to close out the game was inbound the ball, take a foul and hit some free throws.\n\nThat is not what happened.\n\nFirst, the Pacers committed a turnover trying to inbound the ball.\n\nThen, the Celtics inbounded the ball to Jaylen Brown in the corner and he knocked down a 3-pointer to tie the game with Siakam in his face.\n\nIn the post-game press conference, as detailed following the game, Pacers coach Rick Carlisle took the blame for his team blowing the lead in the final 10 seconds of regulation, telling reporters that he should have taken a timeout to advance the ball.\n\nWhile Boston pulled out a win in overtime, they didn't initially dominate the five-minute overtime period. As they have all postseason, the Pacers once again showed their resilience. Losing a lead like that late in the fourth quarter could have sunk any team, but the Pacers answered the bell in overtime.\n\nAfter a sloppy first minute, Haliburton gave the Pacers the lead with a stepback 3 against Horford. After a few empty possessions led to the Celtics grabbing the lead, Haliburton stole an errant Tatum pass and went the other way for a pull-up 3, which White disrupted with a foul. Three free throws from Haliburton gave the Pacers a two-point lead with 1:46 remaining in overtime.\n\nNesmith, the Pacers' best wing defender, fouled out midway through the overtime period and the Celtics took advantage with Tatum getting a mismatch on McConnell and tallying an and-1 to give the Celtics a one-point lead with 1:12 remaining.\n\nAnd that is when Haliburton committed another costly turnover as he attempted to break down Celtics guard Jrue Holiday off the dribble.\n\n\"I mean, he's the best defender in NBA. He has been for a long time,\" Haliburton said of the turnover against Holiday. \"I was trying to get him as far to the left wing as I could, so I could come downhill to my right. And I had the spin to set it up and I just dribbled it off my foot.\n\n\"So it's unfortunate. It's frustrating, for sure, but it happens. We make mistakes. We're human. And I'll learn from it and I'll be better in Game 2.\"\n\nFollowing the turnover, Tatum knocked down a 3 and gave the Celtics a four-point lead, a lead the Pacers were never able to track down.\n\nThe three plays that Haliburton was thinking about after the game all had a profound impact on the outcome of Game 1. But while what Haliburton did on the final play is an intriguing hypothetical to ponder, the other two were detrimental mistakes that kept the Pacers from taking an unexpected, early advantage in the series.\n\nIf the Pacers want to avoid falling into a deeper hole in this series, they will have to focus on taking care of the things that they can control, like cleaning up the 22 turnovers they committed against the Celtics in Game 1.\n\n\"We know we can play with these guys,\" Haliburton said. \"We know we belong. I think it's discouraging just because of the plays that that happened down the stretch. We feel like we were in position to win the game and just didn't win the game.\n\n\"But what I will say is encouraging is we have been trash in Game 1s. First series and second series. And today we played great for about 47 minutes, just didn't didn't sustain it for 48. So, we'll go back, watch the film. There will be good, there will be bad. And we'll learn from it. And we will be a lot better in Game 2.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_nehm@nytimes.com", "name": "Eric Nehm", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysart_et_al,_Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dysart et al, Ontario"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzer_beater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buzzer beater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clutch (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

A prime example came when Siakam banked in a turnaround jumper from the left block, only for the hosts to get those two points back by quickly getting the ball up the floor, leading to a Jayson Tatum layup.\n\nMaintaining that method resulted in the Celtics assisting on 11/14 field goals in the first quarter and shooting 58.3% from the floor.\n\nBrown led the hosts with ten points, while Tatum chipped in eight and three assists.\n\n3.\u00c2 While they often had success running the Pacers off the three-point line, there were still instances of closeouts that weren't up to par, resulting in the defense collapsing and overall difficulty keeping the visitors from the basket.\n\nIndiana produced 16 points in the paint in the first frame,\u00c2 with each of those\u00c2 occurring in the restricted area. With Obi Toppin coming off the bench to manufacture much of that, coming off the bench to provide 11 points, the most in the period, the Pacers only trailed 34-31 entering the second quarter.\n\n4.\u00c2 With Boston's pace slowing in the second period and the offense too often lacking on and off-ball movement, a stagnant approach propped up the visitors' defense.\n\nThe hosts faring 3/11 (27.3%) from beyond the arc in the 12 minutes before halftime fed into Indiana's up-tempo attack. Out-of-control closeouts at the other end of the floor made it\u00c2 that much\u00c2 more difficult to disrupt the Pacers' offense and get them out of rhythm.\n\nWhile the Celtics' ability to make difficult shots, like a Jaylen Brown long two, fading away while Andrew Nembhard contested his attempt, allowed them to put 30 points on the board despite an approach that's challenging to sustain success with, the visitors looked more comfortable when they had the ball.\n\nThe Pacers generated 33 points on\u00c2 63.6%\u00c2 shooting\u00c2 in the second quarter. That includes making 5/9 threes (55.6%). Myles Turner produced 12 of those points, entering intermission with 18, leading all participants.\u00c2\n\nTyrese Haliburton registered 11 in the first 24 minutes, including burying a three from 35 feet with three seconds left in the first half. That shot tied the game at 64 entering intermission.\n\n5.\u00c2 As for the Celtics, a 34-30 edge in the paint, an 11-4 advantage in points off turnovers, and manufacturing ten second-chance points to Indiana's six helped them play from in front for the entire first half until Haliburton's 35-foot triple.\n\nBrown led Boston with 14 points, Tatum had 11 at the break, and Derrick White had ten on 3/6 shooting.\n\n6.\u00c2 The third quarter featured some of the Celtics' best defense, raising their energy and physicality, which translated to keeping their guests under 30 points after failing to do so in the first two frames.\n\nBut even with Boston limiting the Pacers to 3/11 (27.3%) from beyond the arc, Haliburton carving out the sliver of daylight necessary to get off a three before the end-of-period buzzer that found its way through the net, pulled the visitors within one, entering the final 12 minutes trailing 94-93.\n\n7.\u00c2 While no one on Indiana reached double figures, the hosts got 11 points in the period from Tatum, including him driving downhill, not allowing former teammate Aaron Nesmith to knock him off his line, before finishing a layup through contact.\n\nThey also got ten points from Jrue Holiday, who consistently pushed the tempo and attacked downhill, including for multiple post-ups.\n\nBut six turnovers, which\u00c2 led to nine points for the Pacers, who got 23 from their bench in the first 36 minutes while the hosts' second unit struggled to contribute, chipping in 13 points in that span, acted as an anchor weighing down Boston.\n\nThrough the first three quarters, the C's were a +16 in the 29 minutes with Tatum on the floor and -15 in the seven minutes with him on the bench.\n\n8.\u00c2 In a significant swing late in the series opener, after a Derrick White three and forcing a miss by Turner, Tatum lined up an open three that would've put the hosts up by two with 3:28 left, only to see it not find the mark.\n\nNesmith attacked from the right wing at the other end, finishing a layup through contact from White. He then tacked on the free throw, completing an old-school three-point play. That extended Indiana's advantage to 111-107 with 3:18 remaining.\n\n9.\u00c2 With the Celtics within three, trailing 117-114 with 27.7 seconds on the game clock and the ball in their hands, Derrick White couldn't get a layup to go with Nesmith contesting. That came on the heels of Tatum missing an open look at a three.\n\nIt looked like\u00c2 those failed opportunities would propel the Pacers to a 1-0 lead to start the Eastern Conference Finals. However, in a remarkable effort by Brown, he disrupted an in-bounds pass to Pascal Siakam that went out off the latter, giving the hosts life.\n\nBrown then buried a corner three with Siakam crowding him, sending the TD Garden faithful into a frenzy and Game 1 into overtime.\n\n10.\u00c2 After Indiana struck first in the fifth frame, thanks to a Haliburton three, the hosts countered by attacking the basket, starting with Brown muscling his way to two points at the rim. Tatum then gave Boston the lead at the free-throw line on a transition opportunity courtesy of a block by Horford on Andrew Nembhard.\n\nAs the lead continued changing hands, a Tatum layup while getting wrapped up by T.J. McConnell produced an old-fashioned three-point play.\u00c2\n\nThe Celtics followed that up with Jrue Holiday forcing a Tyrese Haliburton turnover and Tatum delivering the knockout blow with a step-back three to put Boston ahead 127-123 with 42.8 seconds left.\n\n11.\u00c2 Game 2 between the Celtics and Pacers is on Thursday night. It will tip off at 8:00 EST at TD Garden.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nAaron Nesmith Left Lasting Impression with Celtics Before Finding a Home with Pacers\n\nTrivializing Celtics' Success in Tatum-Brown Era a Take Not Measured Properly: 'Doing\n\nPast Hardships Brought Out Best in Al Horford in Career Night: 'You Saw His Gift'\n\nJayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown Still Shaking Off Criticism While Growing as Leaders\n\nJrue Holiday Delivers 'Masterclass' in Game 3 Win vs. Cavs\n\nJayson Tatum Breaks Out of Scoring Slump That Never Defined Him: 'Underappreciated'\n\nDerrick White Discusses Joining Elite Company in Game 1 Win vs. Cavaliers", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "\u00c2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Bulldogs_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler Bulldogs men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

A crowd that filled completely for the first 8 p.m. start of the playoffs exploded out of their seats watching a 12-0 Boston run sparked by a Jayson Tatum steal on Aaron Nesmith that fed Jaylen Brown for a one-handed slam. The Celtics scored on four straight possessions. The Pacers missed their first six shots.\n\nYet in the final seconds, some fans moved toward the exits. Jayson Tatum had missed back-to-back shots trailing by three and Indiana had the ball with 10 seconds remaining. All they had to do was in-bound the ball and hit a pair of free throws to shock the Celtics on their home court. But while Indiana showed their age by turning the ball over 21 times in an even more stunning 133-128 overtime win, Boston flexed its experience in those spots.\n\n\"That s*** was chaos,\" Tatum said. \"That s*** was wild. Just stay present. Stay in the moment. As long as there's time still on the clock and the game is within reach, we feel like we have a chance. This core group has been in so many big time games, big time moments where we've had the lead and lost it and still won, or been down a lot and figured out a way to win. I've had a lot of crazy endings in this building, so in a weird way, we've been there before. We always believe.\"\n\nBrown knocked Andrew Nembhard's sideline out-of-bounds pass off Pascal Siakam for one of 21 turnovers, the most by Indiana this postseason and only the third time they committed more than 12. An inflection point for the series. Brown knocked down an iconic game-tying three over a late arriving Siakam with two hands behind his back. Tatum scored 10 points in overtime, including a go-ahead post up finish through TJ McConnell's foul and a decisive pull-up three over two defenders on the following play. The Pacers stayed confident after the game, asserting the opportunity they created for themselves and their experience rallying from losses earlier this postseason, but they squandered a golden opportunity. Boston, meanwhile, nearly lost another gut-wrenching home playoff game.\n\nIn a sense -- it's a series.\n\n\"I think that early in the playoffs, when we got tested a little bit, we started to separate a bit and we nipped that in the bud in that first round and it's only brought us closer,\" Myles Turner said. \"As disappointing as tonight's loss was, we obviously did some encouraging stuff. It's one of those things that's gonna bring us closer as well. You got back to the Milwaukee series, we lost that Game 1. You go back to New York, we lost that Game 1 in a close fashion as well. It's definitely a long series. That's the message we're gonna continue to convey.\"\n\nIndiana walked away deeming the giveaways uncharacteristic and set a tone for the pace of the game out of timeout with a 31-22 run to close the first quarter. Boston's defensive intensity waned, with slow handoffs in switches, drop coverages that empowered Pacers shooters and 14 turnovers of their own. The worst of the night, a botched pick-and-pop between Tatum and Jrue Holiday nearly squandered the game in overtime when Haliburton turned it into three free throws and a two-point lead. Tatum answered immediately, scoring 36 points with 12 rebounds, four assists, three steals and a 12-for-26 shooting line that marked some improvement over previous rounds. Brown added 26 points on 10-for-20 efficiency.\n\nThe Celtics knew they'd find the rim throughout this series given the Pacers' propensity to stay home on shooters. That led to an advantage for Indiana behind the line to begin the night, which they finished 37.1% to Boston's 33.3%. The Celtics attempted and hit more, though, a credit to the hedge they deployed late in the Cleveland series to allow for more difficult twos, and even some paint looks, if it limits the opponent's three point attempts. The Pacers heavily targeted Al Horford like the Cavs did, shooting 47.6% on 21 attempts in the opener. Boston's pick-and-roll defense fell to the worst in the playoffs, according to Synergy data, while they've allowed 69.5% shooting at the rim, the third-worst mark among all 16 playoff teams.\n\n\"The way that I prepared for this. The shots that at least I felt like I gave up are the shots that I can be ok with the result,\" Horford said. \"Played good defense. Mid-range pull up jump shots. I definitely will go back and look at it. Even in that regard, I want to be better.\"\n\nXavier Tillman Sr. missed Game 1 for personal reasons, leaving Luke Kornet's 13 minutes as the lone relief, who similarly gave up 6-for-11 shooting while his stints opposite of Turner forced him to barrel out to the three-point line to contest pick-and-pops. Turner later noted that when Boston switched Horford's matchup to Siakam, they went to him on his way to 24 points on 12-for-23 shooting. The former Raptor who once ground to a halt offensively against Boston's wings in the slower-paced Toronto offense played free and in space for his second straight good game with his new team. The Celtics did not try to go small, likely fearing a loss on the boards.\n\nThe persistence to play through Pacers mid-range shooting paid off though, Siakam missing two shots inside the arc late in the fourth and in overtime while Horford blocked Nembhard after his pair of in-between looks nearly delivered an Indiana win in regulation. The Pacers started 12-for-21 from the mid range before missing two in overtime. Joe Mazzulla sprinkled in some zone and pressure looks on defense that led to several Indiana droughts, but the Pacers' spurts on a night where they finished 53.5% from the field erased a pair of double-digit Celtics leads in the second and third quarters in a matter of minutes. Even one fewer Pacers turnover might've burned Boston as they tried to embrace the points available from playing Indiana's high-speed game.\n\n\"A lot of people are gonna talk about the free throw discrepancy,\" Turner said. \"But at the end of the day, when you have ... big time turnovers. We showed our age a little bit tonight. I think being a youthful team in this high stakes of a game, those uncharacteristic mistakes made their way out.\"", "source": {"uri": "clnsmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CLNS Media"},

Be disappointed. But don't fret.\n\n\"We know we can play with these guys,\" Haliburton said. \"There's a lot of people out there saying we don't belong here. We don't really care. We know we belong.\"\n\nWhat's clear is that how both teams adjust for Game 2 on Thursday night will set the tone for the balance of this series.\n\nRecent history aside, the similarities between the Celtics and Pacers were on display throughout Game 1.\n\nBoth teams thrived offensively this season and did so again, combining for 261 points Tuesday night. It was the highest scoring game of this postseason and the most in a conference finals game since Boston and Detroit totaled 264 in Game 4 of the 1987 East finals.\n\nWhat was also on display were both teams' vulnerabilities. Indiana exploited Boston's weakened interior defense throughout, racking up 56 points in the paint. But the Celtics ultimately prevailed, benefiting from a myriad of mistakes by a young Pacers team short on playoff experience.\n\nHaliburton had two key turnovers to help the Celtics rebound from a five-point deficit in the final two minutes of regulation. First, he dribbled off his foot as he was bringing the ball up the floor with less than 30 seconds remaining in a three-point game. He also fumbled the ball out of bounds with just over a minute to play in OT.\n\nThe two miscues were part of 22 turnovers on the night for a Pacers team that came in averaging fewer than 12 per game in these playoffs.\n\nIt's part of the growing pains Indiana coach Rick Carlisle expected his youth-heavy team would have to endure during this playoff run.\n\n\"You have to go through it to really experience what it's all about,\" Carlisle said. \"We try to help prepare them for those experiences. But there's nothing like going through it.\"\n\nLikewise, Boston learned in Game 1 that it can expect to continue to be pushed by an underdog Pacers team that has the depth to keep up with the Celtics.\n\nIndiana got the usual contributions of Haliburton, Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner, who combined for 72 points. But the Pacers also got a huge lift from reserves Obi Toppin (15 points) and T.J. McConnell (13 points), who helped Indiana's reserve outscore its Boston counterparts 30-13.\n\nIt's yet another wrinkle that makes the Pacers a hard team to prepare for, Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said.\n\n\"With their ability to play different lineups, the way they sub -- they sub two or three different guys at a time. They are willing to go away from sub patterns for certain guys,\" Mazzulla said. \"You have to be wary of going to any and everything at any particular time. ... Anything is on the table versus a team like this because of their versatility.\"\n\nTatum is expecting both teams to play with renewed confidence in Game 2.\n\n\"(Game 1) being a close game going into overtime they certainly feel like they probably should have won. And we feel like we can play a lot better,\" he said. \"So, I'm excited for us to come out and respond. And just do a better job of protecting home court than we have done recently.\"", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obi Toppin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

The Celtics then got the better of overtime to take a series lead, leaving Carlisle to rue the missed opportunity.\n\n\"I love the way our guys fought in this game. This loss is totally on me. With 10 seconds of regulation, we should have just taken the timeout, advanced the ball and found a way to get it in,\" Carlisle admitted to reporters after the game at Boston's TD Garden.\n\n\"We made some other mistakes, but our guys just need to concentrate on fighting the way they fought in this game, from start to finish.\"\n\nDespite Carlisle taking responsibility for the chaotic end to regulation time, it was an error strewn night from the Pacers, who tallied 22 turnovers which led to 32 points for Boston, according to ESPN.\n\nCarlisle, though, wanted to focus on the positives of which there were some. Boston, for example, had twice led by double digits in the game but Indiana came back on both occasions to take the lead.\n\nThe Pacers head coach was confident his team would recover in time for Game 2 on Thursday.\n\n\"We did a lot of good things that we need to continue to do and we've been a tough minded, resilient team for almost the entire second half of the year and we have to continue that,\" he added.\n\nFor the Celtics, it was a morale boosting start to the series, with Brown and Jayson Tatum leading the charge.\n\nTatum finished on a game-high 36 points, coming up clutch in overtime after Brown had saved the day.\n\n\"Welcome to the NBA Playoffs,\" Brown told reporters. \"You've just got to manage your emotions of the game. Anything can happen. The game is not over until the final buzzer sounds.\"\n\nThe Celtics were also boosted by a career-best performance from Jrue Holiday who totalled 28 points, seven rebounds, eight assists, and three steals.\n\n\"We've seen crazy stuff happen all the time,\" Holiday told reporters.\n\n\"I don't think that we think we've lost a game until we've actually lost a game.

The 2021 champion inbounded from the baseline and found his star wing in the corner, leading to a forced, off-balance triple in the grill of Siakam. TD Garden was gifted one of it's more memorable and iconic moments in the last number of years here in their urgent championship pursuit. For the home-grown, eight-year, longest tenured face of the franchise, it was the biggest shot of his career. And a perfect exhibit of the best season of his career.\n\nIn heroic fashion, the Boston Celtics took a 1-0 lead over the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday night in a thriller with their backs against the wall, 133-128.\n\nThe Pacers took a five-point lead with under two minutes remaining, thanks to more big shots from Andrew Nembhard. TD Garden, as it usually does in these familiar stagnant instances, was beginning to go quiet as a mouse with fans riddled with anxiety, facing defeat.\n\nJayson Tatum was 2-10 in crunch time, forcing bad threes in a one-possession game. Amongst one-and-done isolated trips down, easy puppies were missed at the basket between the main five. The Celtics were stuck at 104 points for three and a half minutes.\n\nDerrick White missed a layup in what seemed to be their last chance to score, as Tatum got the rebound and missed his signature fade in the paint to force the ball away. Less than 10 seconds remaining, Brown began to channel that leadership of his again and forced the turnover on the inbound to Pascal Siakam. Then came chaos -- Brown's prayer.\n\n\"Welcome to the NBA playoffs,\" Brown said. \"You just got to manage your emotions, in the game anything can happen. The game is not over until the final whistle - the final buzzer sounds. That was a good example of that. We were able to turn it over a little bit towards the end. We had Haliburton on the sideline, and I was able to get the deflection off of Siakam, that just extended the game. It's not over till it's over. We just found a way to win the game at the very end.\"\n\nTatum had 10 in the overtime to give himself 36 points, 12 rebounds, four assists, and three steals, shooting 48 percent after typically disappearing after a great first half. He hit the dagger three to put Boston up four with under a minute to go in OT.\n\n\"Stay present. Stay in the moment,\" Tatum said. \"As long as the time is still on the clock and the game is in reach, we feel like we have a chance. This core group has been in so many big-time games, big-time moments where we've had a lead and lost it and still won or been down a lot and figured out a way to win. I've had a lot of crazy endings in this building. So, in a weird way, we've been there before, and we always believe, in the sense.\"\n\nOne of Holiday's best all-around playoff games of his career, and certainly as a Celtic, he also spoke about pulling it out and Boston keeping their composure. He had a big time force of a turnover near the announcing table at half court on Tyrese Haliburton, further flashing memories of what Marcus Smart would do for the Celtics a year ago. The three-time teammate of the year award winner and new heart and soul of Boston has aced the role.\n\n\"I think we always knew there's always a chance,\" Holiday said. \"Crazy stuff happens all the time. I don't think we think we lost the game until we actually lost the game, and that's part of the reason why we're so resilient toward the end of the game. Like I said, anything can happen. Couple of turnovers, great shot, great look by JB. But on the other hand, if we made a couple of shots that were wide open, it could be a completely different game. We're the type of team that's gonna keep on fighting no matter how long and no matter what it takes.\"\n\nNow in control, escaping in mayhem, awaiting the potential Game 4 return of Kristaps Porzingis, the Celtics will look to continue to take care of business at home right away this time in Game 2 on Thursday night.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nJrue Holiday Starts Eastern Conference Finals with Best Game as a Celtic\n\nJaylen Brown's Heroics Propel Celtics to 1-0 Lead in Conference Finals\n\nAaron Nesmith Left Lasting Impression with Celtics Before Finding a Home with Pacers\n\nTrivializing Celtics' Success in Tatum-Brown Era a Take Not Measured Properly: 'Doing\n\nPast Hardships Brought Out Best in Al Horford in Career Night: 'You Saw His Gift'\n\nJayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown Still Shaking Off Criticism While Growing as Leaders\n\nJayson Tatum Breaks Out of Scoring Slump That Never Defined Him: 'Underappreciated'\n\nDerrick White Discusses Joining Elite Company in Game 1 Win vs. Cavaliers", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Bulldogs_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler Bulldogs men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Smart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Smart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5620,h_3161,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_celtics/01hygnpn4bam5ndm6hmw.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

They had a three-point lead and possession with eight seconds remaining in regulation but committed a brutal turnover on an inbound pass and allowed Jaylen Brown to hit a game-tying corner 3-pointer before blowing another lead in overtime en route to a 133-128 defeat.\n\nYou could argue this was the Pacers' best chance to beat a heavily-favored Celtics team, and that after squandering such a golden opportunity, their hopes of winning this series are all but lost.\n\nPacers star Tyrese Haliburton is viewing the loss in a very different light, however.\n\n\"We know we can play with these guys,\" Haliburton said after the game. \"We know we belong.\"\n\nIf you're a Pacers optimist, you might note that Indiana committed a postseason-high 21 turnovers, gave Boston 30 free throw attempts (compared to 10 of its own) and still almost beat the best team in basketball. Despite their mistakes, the Pacers matched the Celtics blow-for-blow on their own floor, shooting 53.5 percent and racking up 38 assists on 53 made field goals.\n\n\"I think it's discouraging just because of the plays that that happened down the stretch. We feel like we were in position to win the game and just didn't win the game,\" Haliburton added. \"But what I will say is encouraging is we have been trash in Game 1s. First series and second series (of these playoffs).\n\n\"And today we played great for about 47 minutes, just didn't didn't sustain it for 48. So, we'll go back, watch the film. There will be good, there will be bad. And we'll learn from it, and we will be a lot better in Game 2.\"\n\nThe Celtics cruised to gentleman's sweeps over the depleted Heat and Cavaliers in Rounds 1 and 2, respectively, but Tuesday was their reminder that Indiana is significantly better than both Miami and Cleveland, particularly on the offensive end.\n\nMost importantly, Haliburton and his teammates are unafraid of the big stage and fully believe they can win Thursday's Game 2 if they cut down on their miscues.

They didn't attempt one, while the Celtics shot 13, but they didn't miss one!!\"\n\nPacers look to bounce back after dropping Game 1 to Celtics\n\nTyrese Haliburton had 25 points and 10 assists for the Pacers, who knocked down 13 3-pointers and scored 56 points in the paint against the Celtics, but it wasn't enough to overcome the free throw disparity and a pair of turnovers in the final 30 seconds of regulation with Indiana up three. Indiana ended up with 21 turnovers on the night.\n\nPascal Siakam added 24 points and 12 rebounds. Myles Turner finished with 23 points and 10 rebounds for the sixth-seeded Pacers.\n\nThe age-old debate when up by three without possession of the basketball is whether or not it's smart to foul to prevent a three-point attempt from the opposition. Rick Carlisle could have done this and trusted in the Pacers' ability to make free throws. Instead, they let the play unfold yet again, leading to a backbreaking, game-tying Jaylen Brown triple that eventually led to the Celtics' victory.\n\nJayson Tatum scored 36 points for the Celtics, including 10 in overtime after Brown's tying 3-pointer with 6.1 seconds remaining in regulation.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_sampson@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Peter Sampson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Special_Diets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Special Diets", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Ethnic_and_Regional/European", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Ethnic and Regional/European", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Throws", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Throws", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Knives/Activities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Knives/Activities", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Celtics-crazy-free-throw-discrepancy-sparks-Indiana-fans-anger.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Don't blame me if your Celtics fan nerves are shot this morning.\n\nThe Celtics need a close game, you said. They need a genuine playoff test, to show that they close a tight game late, or better yet, seize victory when all looks lost.\n\nThey need to prove that they have mettle, the clutch gene, guts -- definitely guts -- and assorted synonyms for guts, too.\n\nI caught your call on that certain sports radio program, 2 to 6 p.m. weekdays. The words were heard. I suspect it was you.\n\nAnd so it must be asked, after the Celtics' fast-paced, often frustrating, and ultimately emboldening 133-128 overtime victory over the Indiana Pacers in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals Tuesday night at TD Garden:\n\nThe Celtics didn't just win a close one. They practically stole it, after appearing to have let it slip.\n\nLeading, 92-79, with a little less than three minutes to play in the third quarter, the Celtics gave up a 14-2 run to end the quarter (with Jayson Tatum sitting on the bench), then battled back and forth with Tyrese Haliburton (25 points) and Pascal Siakam (23) in the fourth quarter.\n\nWith 1:57 remaining in regulation, the Celtics found themselves down, 115-110, after an Andrew Nembhard 3-pointer.\n\nBut the Celtics didn't panic, or fold, or say \"we'll get 'em in Game 2.\" They fought. Jrue Holiday -- who was magnificent with 28 points on 10-of-16 shooting, 8 assists, 7 rebounds, and an endless reservoir of poise -- made a layup, then Jaylen Brown (26 points) hit a pair of free throws, which hasn't always been a sure thing with him late in tight games.\n\nNembhard stuck a 19-footer to put the Pacers up, 117-114, with 46.3 seconds left. That was the last points for either team until six seconds remained. That's when Brown took a pass from Holiday in the corner and buried a contested three to tie the score and send TD Garden and everyone watching at home into Jack Buck, I-can't-believe-what-I-just-saw mode.\n\nHaliburton bricked a last-gasp 3-pointer with Tatum all over him, sending the game to overtime.\n\nHaliburton knocked down a three at 3:45 for the first points of the extra time, but again the Celtics refused to fold. Tatum, who scored 36 points but made some curious decisions among his 26 shot attempts (he made 12, but was just 2 of 8 on threes, and the stepback remains too overly relied upon in his repertoire), finally got one of his takeover attempts to stick.\n\nHe scored a conventional 3-point play with 1:12 remaining to put the Celtics ahead, 124-123, then drilled the second-biggest shot of the night (after Brown's tying three in regulation, of course), knocking down a straight-on three after Nembhard bit for his pump fake.\n\nFrom there, the Celtics took care of business at the line, as teams that win close playoff games do, and what looked like an inauspicious start to this series turned into an emboldening victory.\n\n\"I think we always knew we could [win a close game],\" said Holiday, who did acknowledge that the victory was emboldening to some degree. \"Close games I don't think have ever bothered us.\"\n\nThe more vocal factions of their fan base would beg to differ. As tiresome as the \"yeah, but can they win a close playoff game?\" narrative became, and as irresistible as it is to mock in the moments after they won one, even someone that fully believes in this Celtics team can acknowledge the truth.\n\nThere is no argument against that. Every playoff victory matters, and the relative breezes past the Heat in the first round and Cavaliers in the second -- both five-game series, with the Celtics taking a nap in Game 2 of both -- were won the way the 64-win, net-rating-darling Celtics should have won them: with ease, and only fleeting pockets of suspense.\n\nThere are still things to be concerned about in this series, if you insist. Tatum's shot selection needs to get better. Al Horford has to knock down the open 3-pointers -- he was 3 of 12 from long range Tuesday -- that Pacers coach Rick Carlisle seems to content to cede to him. Joe Mazzulla's unwillingness in earlier playoff games to give some run to Xavier Tillman and to a lesser degree Oshae Brissett makes them pretty much unplayable in this series, which is too bad, because Luke Kornet and Sam Hauser were eaten alive by the Pacers' rapid and efficient offense in Game 1. The Celtics could use another counterpoint or two to the Pacers' 10-deep lineup.\n\nBut those are minor nitpicks while we wait to see what Game 2 brings. And we cannot forget that what happened in Game 1 might just be the best-case scenario for the Celtics.\n\nThey played a tight, taut game, and they won the thing, even after it was starting to feel lost.\n\nThey won a close one, just as they needed to do, even if we heard about that need way too often as the wins stacked up.\n\nNine victories into their postseason, we can now say it. The playoffs have officially begun.\n\nThe Celtics won a close one, and it will not be their last during this run.", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chad_finn@boston.com", "name": "Chad Finn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Hauser", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Hauser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oshae_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oshae Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Kornet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Kornet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Musketeers_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavier Musketeers men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Word_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Word Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Pacers_Celtics_Basketball_31380-664dd5ed5289f-768x432.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

But his response was in the chamber and ready to go.\n\nHe's been around for too many postseason games - 116 to be exact -- to know anything can happen to flip a game on its head. To Brown, there is no situation where his Boston Celtics lose hope, or fail to believe.\n\n\"Welcome to the NBA playoffs,\" he said.\n\nAppearing handcuffed, with Indiana on the verge of stealing homecourt, the NBA's number one seed proved this will not be the same old story. While past versions of the Celtics wouldn't have landed a counter punch, knowing they can fight another day, this group took a stand.\n\nThey weren't about to drop a third home game. Not yet.\n\nThe Pacers had to take it. Instead, they threw it away -- literally.\n\nTrailing by three points, the Celtics intentionally fouled with 10 seconds left in regulation. The next foul would've sent Indiana to the line for a chance to ice the game.\n\nHowever, the longest-tenured Celtic (and vocal leader) stepped up with two critical plays, saving them from another head-scratching loss after leading by 13 in the third quarter.\n\nBrown aggressively blew up the Pacers' inbound pass in the backcourt, staying glued to Pascal Siakam and leaving no window for a catch. It forced a turnover and gave Boston another opportunity to tie the game.\n\nThat's when more chaos ensued.\n\nBoston executed a baseline out-of-bounds (BLOB) set, using Derrick White for misdirection. Notice Brown start the possession in the left corner, then run toward White to engage in this off-ball screening action:\n\nThe whole point was to get Siakam chasing from behind, which would lead directly into White's screen. It bought enough time for Brown to catch the ball cleanly, but that was only half the battle.\n\nYou can run all the beautiful plays you want -- basketball is about elite shotmaking.\n\nBrown still had to deliver the magic to send the game to overtime.\n\n\"You just got to manage your emotions in the game,\" Brown said regarding his team's poise. \"Anything can happen. The game is not over until the final whistle, when the final buzzer sounds. That was a good example of that.\"\n\nAfter the Celtics forced overtime, it was Tatum's time to close the deal. He punished Indiana's smaller wings in the post before going to Boston's favorite action: High pick-and-roll between Tatum and White. That generated a wide-open three for the Celtics' franchise star as Indiana put two defenders on White's drive. It was all Boston needed to pull away.\n\nSince the NBA started tracking play-by-play data in 1997, Tatum is just the 11th player to score at least 10 points in an overtime period. It's the first time since 2021.\n\nTatum ended with 36 points, 12 rebounds, four assists, and three steals. His playoff performances are easily taken for granted, perhaps because only the questionable shot attempts and puzzling turnovers become the topic of discussion on social media.\n\nMinus an awful fadeaway jumper late in regulation and a silly turnover when he threw the ball away in overtime, it was another high-quality Tatum game that inches Boston one step closer to another Finals berth.\n\nSometimes, even the overwhelming favorites have to win ugly. That's just how it goes in the playoffs when the best coaching staffs in the world have studied your tendencies and developed smart gameplans to exploit certain weakness.\n\nNarrow victories against the six seed count the same as blowout wins against a team with the same record. To win a championship, the 16 wins you accumulate will not look the same. But in the end, will anyone care how they look?\n\nAnd if the Celtics need to win in different ways, that's where the acquisition of Jrue Holiday will pay dividends.\n\nHoliday, known for his checkered playoff history and lack of efficiency in these moments, turned back the clock and stole the show on Tuesday. Shooting 10-of-16 from the field, including four three-pointers, he bailed out the Celtics' offense on multiple possessions. He utilized his strength in the post, sealing weaker defenders when Boston noticed a mismatch.\n\nBut if they need him to simply space the floor while\n\nIt was Holiday's first playoff game with at least 25 points since May 2022. If you recall, that was during the Bucks' second round matchup with Boston -- in the same building -- when Holiday was tasked with more offensive usage due to Khris Middleton's absence.\n\n\"Jrue was fantastic, he was exceptional,\" Brown said. \"Shoutout to Jrue. He came out and balled. He's the reason we won this game. I think he was just poised, took advantage of his matchups. He was just so elite, and he's guarding Haliburton, picking him up and chasing him around. That was special from Jrue Holiday.\"\n\nAlthough he did hound Haliburton and create havoc on the defensive end, the Pacers still lost Game 1 due to unforced errors and, frankly, terrible luck. In hindsight, if Haliburton doesn't dribble off his knee and turn it over, or if Siakam finds a way to foul Brown before the 3-point attempt, Indy would've stolen homecourt.\n\nThose are just the breaks. Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle has seen it happen during his playoff runs in Dallas. He knows you can't dwell on it.\n\n\"Look, a lot of things had to go wrong for us and right for them,\" Carlisle said. \"They did. So, we have to own it and get ready for Thursday.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Celtics aren't satisfied. They understand it's not going to be a perfect road to the Finals and there will be speed-bumps, even against a massive underdog.\n\nMazzulla's major theme this season has centered on process over results. He doesn't buy into the notion a top-seeded team should blitz every opponent, or have the expectation every game will be a cakewalk.\n\nInstead, every situation is a data point to learn and grow from. Even the ones that look ugly until a miracle strikes.\n\n\"I expect all of the games to be like that,\" Mazzulla said after Game 1. \"I thought both teams competed at a high level. For us, obviously we weren't perfect, we can get better. But I thought we maintained a level of poise and mental toughness. Just continue to work through some of the mistakes. That's the bind (the Pacers) put you in, because of the way they play. We handled it well, and we have to get better.\"\n\nThe playoffs are about matchups and adjustments. There's a reason most superstars and coaches consider Game 1 of any series to be a feel-out game. Any time your defense is facing an All-NBA level creator and playmaker, which Haliburton is, there will be a learning curve early on.\n\n\"They are going to test your discipline every single possession, whether you're up five or up 25,\" Mazzulla said. \"So I think, at the end of the day, we shouldn't even really look at the scoreboard. We should just keep playing as much as we can.\"\n\nRegardless of how clean the victories are for the Celtics, this is already a much better playoff showing than last season.\n\nBoston is 9-2 during this playoff run with the best defensive rating (107.1) among the remaining teams. They have outscored teams by 11.6 points per 100 possessions, still the highest mark in the postseason by a wide margin.\n\nFor context, the 2008 Celtics were only 6-5 with a +7.3 net rating after their first 11 playoff games. They are (rightly) recognized as one of the all-time great units in NBA history ... despite going to seven games in the first two rounds. That group ultimately pushed through and got it done, solving different problems and gaining more confidence in each series.\n\nHad the Celtics dropped this Game 1, the idea of them being a 'fraudulent' 64-win team would've permeated throughout the media for 48 hours.\n\nYet, they continue grinding out playoff wins despite their starting center, Kristaps Porzingis, being out with a calf strain. Porzingis is nearing a return, which would open up their offense even more with reliable five-out spacing.\n\nBoston still has work to do. But so far, they have done exactly what the outsiders have begged of them.\n\nTuesday was only their second instance of playing 'clutch-time' minutes since the playoffs began. They are 2-0 in those situations and 23-12 overall when you include the regular season. That's a slightly better record than Minnesota (24-15) and right behind Dallas (26-11), the two Finals contenders out West. So, why does everyone act as if Boston isn't tested in the clutch?\n\nIt's a strange concept when it comes to them, specifically. Boston is supposed to win decisively against every East opponent, but simultaneously needs to prove they can win close battles. Nothing they do is good enough.\n\nThe Celtics will never be 100% mistake-free. Good thing for them -- no champion across the NBA's 77-year history needed to be perfect.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tatum overcame his fourth-quarter struggles with an impressive overtime performance. Jaylen Brown's clutch three-pointer saved the game for the Celtics in regulation.\n\nThe Boston Celtics survived the Indiana Pacers in Game 1 with a 133-128 overtime win to draw first blood in the Eastern Conference Finals. The thirsty Pacers were certainly out there for Boston's blood on Tuesday night as they gave the East's No. 1 seed all they can handle in the series opener.\n\nIn the end, however, the Celtics leaned on the heroics of their two stars, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, to make the big plays and lead them to the Game 1 victory. Brown made the game-tying three-pointer in regulation that sent the game into overtime, while Tatum scored 11 of Boston's 16 overtime points to seal the win for the Celtics.\n\nAsked about what made the difference for Boston in the extra session, Brown credited Tatum for coming alive in overtime for leading them to victory.\n\n\"I think we just made some momentum plays. [Jayson Tatum] finally woke up, made some baskets.\" - Jaylen Brown\n\nTatum's naysayers may have a field day with that one. But Brown is likely just crediting his All-Star teammate for coming through for them when they needed him most.\n\nJayson Tatum Came Up Huge In Overtime Tatum struggled in the 4th quarter before OT explosion\n\nJayson Tatum has received criticism in the past for coming up small in big moments. It was almost looking like one of those days for the All-Star in the fourth quarter as he struggled to put the ball in the basket down the stretch.\n\nTatum went 2-7 from the field in the final period and missed his final four attempts in regulation. He clanked a wide open three-pointer with 36.1 seconds left that would have tied the game and then later missed a mid-range jumper that would have cut Indiana's lead down to one with 14.1 ticks left.\n\nLuckily for him, Jaylen Brown was there to save the day with a clutch corner three-pointer that forced overtime and gave Tatum a chance to redeem himself. And that is exactly what he did.\n\nTatum scored 10 of Boston's 16 points in the extra session, including two big shots that ultimately swung the momentum towards their way. The last one, in particular, put the Celtics up by four with 42.8 seconds left in overtime.\n\nDespite his notable struggles in the fourth quarter, Tatum still had a big night with 36 points, 12 rebounds, and four assists on 12-of-26 shooting. He did significant damage from the free throw line as well, where he converted 10 of his 12 attempts. As for Brown, not only did he make the biggest shot of the game, he also tallied 26 points, seven rebounds, and five assists on 10-of-20 shooting.\n\nGIVE ME SPORT Key Statistic: With 36 points in Game 1 of the ECF, Jayson Tatum has nine (9) 30-point games in the conference finals, which is tied for 10th most in NBA history.\n\nThe Celtics certainly did enough to survive Game 1.

Tuesday's Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals ultimately provided the answer: Chaotically.\n\n\"That's a great word,\" said Boston's Jayson Tatum, \"because that s*** was chaos. That s*** was wild.\"\n\nJaylen Brown's mad-dash 3-pointer with six seconds left in the fourth quarter sent the game to an extra period, and Tatum's back-to-back three-point plays in the final 75 seconds of overtime put a 133-128 win out of reach from the feisty Indiana Pacers. Yet somehow we are left to wonder if they are clutch or not.\n\nYou are clutch if you are victorious, I guess, but there were plenty of times Boston felt anything but.\n\nBrown's turnover with 4:39 remaining in regulation of a two-point game was Exhibit A. He telegraphed a pass that he threw directly to Pascal Siakam, whose dunk on the other end gave Indiana a 108-104 lead.\n\nThat malfunction was topped by Tatum's pass to no one with 1:48 left in overtime. When Pacers point guard Tyrese Haliburton corralled the careless turnover, Boston's Derrick White fouled him on a 3-point attempt in transition, gifting Indiana a trio of free throws. Haliburton made all three for a 123-121 lead.\n\n\"I'm so glad we won the game,\" said Tatum, \"because I would've been sick.\"\n\nThere were more meltdowns. The Celtics coughed up a 13-point lead in the final minutes of the third quarter. Their fourth-quarter offense got stuck in a muddy mixture of isolation, 3-pointers and isolation 3-pointers. They flubbed the open 3s they did manufacture -- until Brown made his in Siakam's grill.\n\nThe Celtics had more lives than Kenny from \"South Park,\" and Indiana granted most of them. With his team leading 117-114 inside of 30 seconds remaining in regulation, Haliburton inexplicably dribbled out of bounds. Rather than attempt a game-tying 3, White missed a layup, and Tatum missed the follow-up -- a fadeaway jump shot -- and again the Pacers had the ball, a three-point lead and the game in their hands.\n\nAnd again they resuscitated Boston, throwing the ensuing inbounds pass off of Siakam's hands. Celtics ball. Eight seconds left. Jrue Holiday feeds Brown in the corner. \"Bang!\" yelped ESPN's Mike Breen. \"Bang!\"\n\nThe Pacers were not without their positives, either. They rebounded from a 12-0 deficit in the opening minutes. Haliburton's last-second 35-footer tied the game at halftime, 64-64. He banked home another 3 to draw Indiana within 94-93 at the third-quarter buzzer. The Pacers scored five times on six possessions in the first three minutes of crunch time, taking a 115-110 lead with two minutes left in the fourth quarter.\n\nThen it all went to hell. Or elsewhere, depending on your perspective.\n\nMost of it from both teams was far from clutch. Some was extremely clutch. Did the Pacers fumble the bag? Did the Celtics pull one out of their you-know-whats? This game was all in the eye of the beholder.\n\nAnd this beholder thinks this kind of performance will not be enough against whichever Western Conference opponent awaits in the NBA Finals. A better team would have extinguished Boston. Would have being the operative phrase. We have no idea what will happen next, as Tuesday made crystal clear.\n\nWhat we do know: Boston has played 11 postseason games, won nine of them, and needs seven more to deliver the franchise's 18th championship. That was one hell of a basketball contest, the Celtics' first real test and one it passed -- barely, but nobody will remember the grade we give them in this moment.\n\nWe will just remember the chaos.

They had a three-point lead and possession with eight seconds remaining in regulation but committed a brutal turnover on an inbound pass and allowed Jaylen Brown to hit a game-tying corner 3-pointer before blowing another lead in overtime en route to a 133-128 defeat.\n\nYou could argue this was the Pacers' best chance to beat a heavily-favored Celtics team, and that after squandering such a golden opportunity, their hopes of winning this series are all but lost.\n\nPacers star Tyrese Haliburton views Tuesday night's result in a very different light, however.\n\n\"We know we can play with these guys,\" Haliburton said after the game. \"We know we belong.\"\n\nIf you're a Pacers optimist, you might note that Indiana committed a postseason-high 21 turnovers, gave Boston 30 free throw attempts (compared to 10 of its own) and still was one inbound pass away from beating the best team in basketball. Despite their mistakes, the Pacers matched the Celtics blow-for-blow on their own floor, shooting 53.5 percent and racking up 38 assists on 53 made field goals.\n\n\"I think it's discouraging just because of the plays that that happened down the stretch. We feel like we were in position to win the game and just didn't win the game,\" Haliburton added. \"But what I will say is encouraging is, we have been trash in Game 1s. First series and second series (of these playoffs).\n\n\"And today we played great for about 47 minutes, just didn't didn't sustain it for 48. So, we'll go back, watch the film. There will be good, there will be bad. And we'll learn from it, and we will be a lot better in Game 2.\"\n\nThe Celtics cruised to gentleman's sweeps over the depleted Heat and Cavaliers in Rounds 1 and 2, respectively, but Tuesday was their reminder that Indiana is significantly better than both Miami and Cleveland, particularly on the offensive end. And to Haliburton's point, the Pacers dropped Game 1 in each of their previous two series against the Milwaukee Bucks and New York Knicks before rallying to advance.\n\nPut simply, Haliburton and his teammates are unafraid of the big stage and fully believe they can win Thursday's Game 2 if they cut down on their miscues.

He was 2-for-10 from the field in the fourth and OT before scoring six straight points on an and-one layup and a clutch 3-pointer. He ended up with 10 OT points -- the second-most in Celtics playoff history -- to help his team to a thrilling 133-128 win.\n\nHad it not been for Jaylen Brown's heroic 3-pointer to force OT, the Celtics would be down 0-1 in the series and Tatum would be partly to blame. Still, as our Eddie House put it during Wednesday's Early Edition, Tatum deserves credit for stepping up when he did.\n\n\"Showing up any time is better than showing up no time,\" House said. \"So I'm cool with that. ... Don't forget, against the Pacers this year we are 4-2 in six matchups. Jayson Tatum is averaging 30 points and 10 rebounds. I don't know what more people want out of somebody.

There is also a debate over whether it was an impressive effort for the Celtics or if the Pacers cost themselves with their late-game miscues.\n\n\"Two things can be true at the same time,\" House said. \"It was an unbelievable choke job by the Indiana Pacers. They had some unforced errors, the one off Tyrese Haliburton off his knee, the pass across with (Pascal) Siakam not creating the lead.

The Celtics are 0-2 in Game 2s this postseason due to poor efficiency on both ends. Boston aims to take a 2-0 series lead against Indiana by staying focused and avoiding complacency.\n\nWhat a chaotic turn of events it was for the Boston Celtics to survive a scare against the Indiana Pacers in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nJayson Tatum led the way for Boston with a game-high 36 points, including 10 in overtime after Jaylen Brown's three-pointer that tied the game with 6.1 seconds remaining in regulation, and Boston rallied just in time for a 133-128 victory over the Pacers on Tuesday night.\n\nBrown's shot in the clutch provided the Celtics a much-needed spark and helped the team hang on to home-court advantage with Game 2 taking place on Thursday night in Boston.\n\nBut fighting off complacency after starting the series with a win was also on Tatum's mind, simplifying his response with two simple words heading into Game 2.\n\n\"Don't relax.\"\n\nTatum's Caution For Game 2 Celtics are 0-2 In Game 2s this postseason\n\nBoston hasn't been the best version of themselves against their playoff opponents in Game 2, currently with an 0-2 record.\n\nAgainst Miami in the first round, the Heat converted a franchise-record 23 three-pointers to beat the Celtics 111-101 in Game 2.\n\nThen, against Cleveland in the East Semis, six players scored in double-digits with three of them reaching the 20-point mark en route to a 118-94 blowout win against Boston.\n\nThe Celtics haven't had the same efficiency on offense and defense during those two games in question as they had in the other contests. They currently average 97.5 points and 114.5 points allowed in Game 2s this postseason, showing a negative point differential of 17 points.\n\nTheir efficiency on both sides has also been affected. They have been shooting 43.8 percent from the field and 29.9 percent from three, the complete opposite to opponents making 52.2 percent of their total attempts and 50.7 percent from downtown.\n\nEven after a big win in Game 1 following plenty of rest since they beat Cleveland in five games, Jayson Tatum is laser-focused on making sure he and the team come out strong in Game 2.\n\nQuite an important statement for Tatum to make, especially with a return trip to the NBA Finals at stake. Slip ups at this point of the postseason should not be tolerated by Boston because if they do, Indiana will take advantage.\n\nWhat's Next For the Celtics Looking for 2-0 series lead against Indiana\n\nThe rest Boston got from their series win against Cleveland will surely benefit them against Indiana, coming off of seven grueling contests with New York.\n\nBoston is close to realizing their objective of returning to the NBA Finals for the second time in three seasons, and are three wins away from doing so. All they need is solid execution on both ends and the will to fight through the adversity the Pacers will put on them throughout the series.\n\nThe Celtics look to defend their home-court advantage and take a 2-0 series lead when they host Indiana for Game 2 on May 23 at 8:00 p.m. EST.\n\nRelated Jayson Tatum Gives Candid Take on Jaylen Brown's Game-Tying Shot vs. Pacers Jayson Tatum summed up Jaylen Brown's huge game-tying shot down the stretch that propelled them to a win in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clutch (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/usatsi_23344864.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-23", "textStart": 3280, "textEnd": 3286}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

A real stunner. To pump-fake from the bleeding edge of the left corner with Indiana Pacers star Pascal Siakam crowding his airspace, to swivel and gather the ball on his right side with Siakam shading his left, to rise from a standstill and readjust his contorted frame in midair, falling away from Siakam, whose mere presence ought to have been enough to sap the remaining probability from such a difficult attempt. It was, in a sense, a pure and timeless play, a mastery of the moment that rises above the chaos that emerged before and after.\n\nIt was a vindicating shot in spiritual commune with one of the best of the decade: a game-winning buzzer-beater by former Raptor OG Anunoby in Game 3 of the 2020 second-round series against the Boston Celtics -- one that put Brown in roughly the same ignominious position that Siakam found himself in on Tuesday night. If only Jaylen had thought to say, \"I don't shoot trying to miss\" after the game -- a 133-128 Celtics overtime victory wherein the jaws of defeat seemed all-consuming, victory snatched away by the team that has more experience with the whims of entropy and frayed nerves that can define postseason basketball.\n\nThere aren't enough satisfying answers to all the hows and whys that littered the final five and a half minutes of Tuesday's thriller. How did Tyrese Haliburton absent-mindedly dribble the ball off his knee when bringing the ball across half court with less than 30 seconds remaining in regulation and the Pacers up three? Why did Jayson Tatum, who had a remarkable game overall, instinctively rise up for a one-legged 16-foot fadeaway on a put-back attempt when the Celtics were down by three with 14 seconds remaining? Up three points with 10 seconds remaining in regulation, how did Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle not call a timeout when he recognized Andrew Nembhard's frantic indecision as a five-second violation neared? Why did Siakam go under Derrick White's screen, which freed up Brown for his heroic shot? (Which is about as far as I'll go on that particular possession -- there was no clear and present opportunity to foul up three points, as Carlisle had instructed the team to do, given how quickly Brown rose for the shot upon catching the ball in the corner.) With less than two minutes remaining in overtime, why did Tatum throw the ball away on an awkward jump pass out of a pick-and-roll when Jrue Holiday was still holding his ground on the pick? How did Haliburton once again lose his mind-body connection with just over a minute remaining in overtime, stumbling out of bounds when trying to get a step past Holiday? Wait, how, amid all the game's myriad embarrassments, did Tatum end up scoring 10 points in the extra frame?\n\n\"A lot of things had to go wrong for us and right for them,\" Carlisle said after Game 1, with his eyes still searching, his mind still reeling. \"They did.\"\n\nIndiana lost a game in which it shot markedly better than Boston but had 50 percent more turnovers (21 to the Celtics' 14) and attempted 20 fewer free throws (10, compared to the Celtics' 30). The Pacers were underdogs on the road coming off a Game 7 and were able to overcome double-digit deficits in both halves on Tuesday. Their style was imprinted on the game: Boston -- the slowest-paced team remaining in the postseason -- was goaded into playing up to the Pacers' blistering regular-season standard. Indiana's bench, a strength across the first two series, once again came through. They attacked Al Horford (who was verbally assaulted on the ESPN broadcast, repeatedly called an \"old man\" by the 63-year-old Mike Breen) in the pick-and-roll.\n\nThe synaptic current of Indiana's pass-heavy offense had Celtics defenders engaging with holograms of alternate realities. The threat that Haliburton would pull up from the logo, the calculus involved in guarding an offensively liberated Myles Turner, who could dive to the rim or space out from beyond, the unnerving persistence of Siakam's playmaking from the free throw line. It all presents the Pacers with a clear energy map for where the ball should land. And it's an offensive language far more intricate than what the Celtics have deciphered in the previous rounds. The Pacers had an astounding 38 assists in Game 1 -- only three teams this century have produced more in a postseason game (and they all recorded 39). Their shooting numbers feel like they ought to be a fluke, especially after historic efficiency against the Knicks in Game 7 on Sunday, but they're arguably the realest thing about this entire run: The last team to have shot at least 50 percent from the field throughout a playoff run that's gone on as long as the Pacers' has? The 1990-91 Chicago Bulls. With Kristaps Porzingis expected to be sidelined for at least the next two games in the series, the Pacers still have a path to make the Eastern Conference finals truly compelling.\n\nIn the afterglow of Game 1, I found myself thinking back to the grueling five-hour 2019 Wimbledon final between Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, wherein Djokovic managed to claim victory despite losing in just about every statistic recorded. In that moment Djokovic became the first men's player since 1948 to win Wimbledon after facing multiple championship points. \"Federer dominated the game of runs,\" my colleague Brian Phillips wrote then. \"But couldn't keep Djokovic from seizing control of the game of moments.\"\n\nThe flow of Tuesday's game felt like it was in Indiana's command until it wasn't. The numbers favored the Pacers until they didn't. It's impossible not to wonder whether -- at this level of competition, against this caliber of opposition -- Game 1 was the Pacers' biggest shot at this series. The Celtics are a great team that also happens to be riding a fine streak of luck, a departure from Indiana's previous opponents. The Pacers' resilience throughout these playoffs has been heartening, but it's also come largely against teams with crumbling infrastructure; how does that resilience interface against a team that seems too big to fail? Where this leaves the Pacers, now down 0-1 in their first conference final in a decade, depends on the strength of their imagination and the speed with which they can regulate emotional highs and lows. Either the team blew its best shot at stealing home-court advantage, or it has redrawn the series' battle lines in its favor.", "source": {"uri": "theringer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Ringer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danny_chau@theringer.com", "name": "Danny Chau", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

The Celtics knocked off the Cleveland Cavaliers in their last series, and they are now in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers. Game one of the series took place on Tuesday night in Boston, and the Celtics barely survived and got a win to start the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nBoston came into this series against the Pacers as big favorites, and they were obviously big favorites in game one at home as well. The Celtics came into the game favored by 9.5 points, and they were looking to defend home court. It was close, but they got the job done.\n\nAs the heavy favorite to win the NBA Finals, there is a lot of pressure on the Celtics to meet expectations. They have had some disappointing finishes in the postseason in recent years, and they are trying to avoid that this season.\n\nChris Paul has never won an NBA championship, but he is very familiar with the pressure that is felt by teams that are favorites. He talked about it during halftime of game one, and he knows that the Celtics need to take everything one game at a time.\n\n\"Well when you're in the locker room with a team, they have great leadership obviously with JT (Jayson Tatum), Jaylen Brown and all them guys, but what you gotta try to do is block out the clutter,\" Chris Paul said. \"When I say the clutter, everyone thinks I mean social media, right? But sometimes it can actually be your family and your friends. You gotta take it one game at a time, every game is different. It takes on a mind of its own every game, but the thing is that after games, every one says what your teammates did so bad. This guy couldn't make a shot, this guy couldn't do this. You have to focus on yourself and remember that it's a long series and you have to take it one game at a time.\"\n\nGame one was a thriller\n\nGame one of the Eastern Conference Finals did not disappoint. The Pacers were big underdogs on the road, but they came ready to play, and they really should've won this game. They led for the majority of the late stages of the fourth quarter, but a crazy three from Jaylen Brown tied the game with five seconds left, and the game ended up going to overtime.\n\nThe Celtics led for a good portion of this game and they were up by as many as 13 points in the second half.

The costliest turnover came with 8.5 seconds left in the fourth quarter while sixth-seeded Indiana was leading 117-114.

Turner also took advantage of Kristaps Porzingis' absence by tossing in 23 points.\n\nPorzingis, Boston's starting center, has missed the past seven games with a calf strain.

The words were heard. I suspect it was you.\n\nAnd so it must be asked, after the Celtics' fast-paced, often frustrating, and ultimately emboldening 133-128 overtime victory over the Indiana Pacers in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals Tuesday night at TD Garden:\n\nThe Celtics didn't just win a close one. They practically stole it, after appearing to have let it slip.\n\nLeading, 92-79, with a little less than three minutes to play in the third quarter, the Celtics gave up a 14-2 run to end the quarter (with Jayson Tatum sitting on the bench), then battled back and forth with Tyrese Haliburton (25 points) and Pascal Siakam (23) in the fourth quarter.\n\nWith 1:57 remaining in regulation, the Celtics found themselves down, 115-110, after an Andrew Nembhard 3-pointer.\n\nBut the Celtics didn't panic, or fold, or say \"we'll get 'em in Game 2.\" They fought. Jrue Holiday -- who was magnificent with 28 points on 10-of-16 shooting, 8 assists, 7 rebounds, and an endless reservoir of poise -- made a layup, then Jaylen Brown (26 points) hit a pair of free throws, which hasn't always been a sure thing with him late in tight games.\n\nNembhard stuck a 19-footer to put the Pacers up, 117-114, with 46.3 seconds left. That was the last points for either team until six seconds remained. That's when Brown took a pass from Holiday in the corner and buried a contested three to tie the score and send TD Garden and everyone watching at home into Jack Buck, I-can't-believe-what-I-just-saw mode.\n\nHaliburton bricked a last-gasp 3-pointer with Tatum all over him, sending the game to overtime.\n\nHaliburton knocked down a three at 3:45 for the first points of the extra time, but again the Celtics refused to fold. Tatum, who scored 36 points but made some curious decisions among his 26 shot attempts (he made 12, but was just 2 of 8 on threes, and the stepback remains too overly relied upon in his repertoire), finally got one of his takeover attempts to stick.\n\nHe scored a conventional 3-point play with 1:12 remaining to put the Celtics ahead, 124-123, then drilled the second-biggest shot of the night (after Brown's tying three in regulation, of course), knocking down a straight-on three after Nembhard bit for his pump fake.\n\nFrom there, the Celtics took care of business at the line, as teams that win close playoff games do, and what looked like an inauspicious start to this series turned into an emboldening victory.\n\n\"I think we always knew we could [win a close game],\" said Holiday, who did acknowledge that the victory was emboldening to some degree. \"Close games I don't think have ever bothered us.\"\n\nThe more vocal factions of their fan base would beg to differ. As tiresome as the \"yeah, but can they win a close playoff game?\" narrative became, and as irresistible as it is to mock in the moments after they won one, even someone that fully believes in this Celtics team can acknowledge the truth.\n\nThey needed to do this.\n\nThere is no argument against that. Every playoff victory matters, and the relative breezes past the Heat in the first round and Cavaliers in the second -- both five-game series, with the Celtics taking a nap in Game 2 of both -- were won the way the 64-win, net-rating-darling Celtics should have won them: with ease, and only fleeting pockets of suspense.\n\nThere are still things to be concerned about in this series, if you insist. Tatum's shot selection needs to get better. Al Horford has to knock down the open 3pointers -- he was 3 of 12 from long range Tuesday -- that Pacers coach Rick Carlisle seems to content to cede to him. Joe Mazzulla's unwillingness in earlier playoff games to give some run to Xavier Tillman and to a lesser degree Oshae Brissett makes them pretty much unplayable in this series, which is too bad, because Luke Kornet and Sam Hauser were eaten alive by the Pacers' rapid and efficient offense in Game 1. The Celtics could use another counterpoint or two to the Pacers' 10-deep lineup.\n\nBut those are minor nitpicks while we wait to see what Game 2 brings. And we cannot forget that what happened in Game 1 might just be the best-case scenario for the Celtics.\n\nThey played a tight, taut game, and they won the thing, even after it was starting to feel lost.\n\nThey won a close one, just as they needed to do, even if we heard about that need way too often as the wins stacked up.\n\nNine victories into their postseason, we can now say it.

Oh, and Drake Maye was there sitting next to Guy Fieri.\n\nIn the words of Jayson Tatum postgame: \"That **** was chaos.\" Let's get into it.\n\nThe Celtics beat the Pacers in overtime, 133-128, to take a 1-0 lead in the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nWith Indiana set to kill the game off with some free throws, Brown forced a turnover to give Boston life, caught the ensuing inbound in the corner with Pascal Siakam draped all over him, and somehow nailed the desperation triple to force overtime and save the Celtics.\n\nJayson Tatum (34 points) took over in OT, scoring 8 of Boston's first 10 points in the frame to put the pesky Pacers away.\n\nThe irony is not lost on us that nobody played any interior defense in that game on the same day that the NBA announced this season's All-Defense teams.\n\nThe Celtics, in their defense, are missing their best rim protector in Kristaps Porzingis. The Pacers, in their defense, think defense is for nerds, probably.\n\nHere's what else you need to know.\n\nUp next: The Celtics are back at TD Garden for Game 2 on Thursday night. That's another 8 p.m. tip on ESPN.\n\nPWHL Boston will try to regain home-ice advantage in Game 3 on Friday night in Minnesota. You can catch that one at 7 p.m. on NESN, or streaming on the PWHL's YouTube channel.\n\nAmin: You've covered a ton of games at the Garden this spring. Where does that Jaylen Brown shot rank among the biggest moments in this building in the playoffs, Bruins or Celtics?\n\nConor: It's a good problem to have for any fanbase when there are several deserving crowd reactions to choose from this spring. I'd still ever-so-slightly lean towards David Pastrnak's Game 7 OT winner against Toronto, just because my Dunkin' cold brew literally fell off our desk in the press box because the ninth floor was vibrating.\n\nBut man, it's a dead heat between that Game 7 tally and Brown's game-saving shot in the fourth quarter. The stakes were obviously greater for the Bruins when Pastrnak tucked that puck past Ilya Samsonov, but Brown's corner 3 (with Pascal Siakam right in his face) saved us all from a miserable couple of days as we pondered once again if this team is ready for the big moment.\n\nPier 6 is hosting a Pig Roast Luau today, and for $30 you can get in the door and try specialty cocktails and special bites.

But a few Celtics fans, ye of little faith, seemed to have a different outlook on that.\n\nWCVB reporter Mary Saladna spotted a few not-so-faithful Celtics faithful outside TD Garden during overtime that had seemingly left the building before Brown's big shot, only to watch the extra period through the windows of a bar once they learned of Boston's unlikely comeback.\n\nBut, like, was it that unlikely?\n\nI understand fans get out the door early when a game is all but decided, particularly if it's an embarrassing upset. But the Pacers never led by more than 3 points in the final minute; which is to say, it never really looked totally out of reach. This wasn't some Reggie-Miller-9-points-in-11-seconds situation.\n\nLook, I've been caught in the Green Line chaos at North Station, too. But in a one-possession game? In the playoffs?\n\nNot wise, my friends. No re-entry means no re-entry; once you've made that call, there's no turning back, and you might miss something special.\n\nFinn: The Celtics finally win a close one, and what a win it was\n\nHey, you asked for this. Don't blame me if your Celtics fan nerves are shot this morning. The Celtics need a close game, you said. They need a genuine playoff test, to show that they close a tight game late, or better yet, seize victory when all looks lost. They need to prove that they have mettle, the clutch gene, guts -- definitely guts -- and assorted synonyms for guts, too.\n\nGasper: The steady hand of Jrue Holiday was exactly what the Celtics needed\n\nNo Celtic played more minutes than Holiday's 48:19, a calming influence in a chaotic contest that saw 10 lead changes, 11 ties, and a dramatic final 57.4 seconds of regulation. No. 4's fingerprints were all over Boston's 133-128 overtime victory. Both a stabilizer and a driver, he contributed a Celtic career-high 28 points, adding 8 assists, 7 rebounds, and 3 steals.\n\nHoliday's play, Christopher L. Gasper writes, was a reminder of what separates the Celtics from the playoff pack and makes them putative favorites. Who else has a fifth option, the role Holiday accepts when the team is fully healthy, that is a two-time All-Star with a championship on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9? I'll wait.\n\nWashburn: Tatum at his best at the right moment\n\nJust when the Celtics needed him, Jayson Tatum was at his superstar best down the stretch in Game 1, lifting Boston to a crucial home win. He finished with a game-high 36 points, along with 12 rebounds, 4 assists, and 3 steals. In what would have been a deflating Game 1 home loss, Tatum saved the Celtics from quickly losing grip of this series.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston

The Indiana Pacers lost but didn't quite deserve to win. Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals, which the Celtics won 133-128 in Boston Tuesday night, might be the rare contest where the winning team enters the locker room more frustrated than the losing one.\n\nThe Celtics are the better team. But, as is often the case with this group, they played Tuesday night like a team that believed it had a margin for error. They rarely attacked the rim. They spent the game going side to side. Jayson Tatum finished with a game-high 36 points, but shot just 12-for-26 -- and struggled until racking up 10 points in overtime.\n\nThe Celtics' defense, meanwhile, allowed the Pacers to shoot 53.5% from the field. If not for a ridiculous, game-tying, end-of-game three from Jaylen Brown in the corner, and the Pacers turning the ball over 21 times, including a number of brutal late-game miscues, the Celtics would be walking off the floor down 0-1 and no longer in possession of home court advantage.\n\nIf you wanted to take a glass-half-full approach with the Pacers, then you could point to how successful they were in picking apart the Celtics' half-court defense. A lot of that was a result of them attacking Al Horford, who looked like the lead-footed, nearly-38-year-old big that he is. Tyrese Haliburton, who led the Pacers with 25 points and 10 assists, was able to get to his spots. He and the Pacers proved that, despite what us pundits think, they're going to be a tough out.\n\nBut this game, and series, was about and is about the Celtics. This is a team with title hopes, and yet it continues to play beneath its talent. That worked against the Jimmy Butler-less Miami Heat and Donovan Mitchell-less Cleveland Cavaliers. It will probably work against this overmatched Pacers team, too. But it won't work in the finals, whether they face the Dallas Mavericks or Minnesota Timberwolves. At some point, the Celtics are going to have to show that they can be the best version of themselves for an entire series. They might have won Game 1, but if they play this way next round in the finals, there won't be an inferior team on the other end ready to give the win back.\n\nYaron Weitzman is an NBA writer for FOX Sports and the author of Tanking to the Top: The Philadelphia 76ers and the Most Audacious Process in the History of Professional Sports.

But eventually the Celtics were going to need playoff Tatum, eventually they were going to need their superstar to play like a superstar, and in the final 72 seconds of Game 1, he was the best player on the floor.\n\nHis 6 consecutive points gave the Celtics a 4-point lead and they held on for an improbable 133-128 overtime win Tuesday at TD Garden.\n\nAfter Haliburton's free throws, Tatum muscled his way around Indiana's Andrew Nembhard, caught a lob from Derrick White, and overpowered T.J. McConnell for a layup and foul with 1:12 left to give Boston the lead for good. After Haliburton committed the Pacers' 21st turnover, Tatum took another pass from White and faked Nembhard, who inexplicably left Tatum alone to help on White.\n\nTatum had an open three: swish.\n\nHe finished with a game-high 36 points, along with 12 rebounds, 4 assists, and 3 steals. In what would have been a deflating Game 1 home loss, Tatum saved the Celtics from quickly losing grip of this series.\n\nThe Pacers played at their usual high pace, hit 53 percent of their shots and seemingly had the game won when Tatum missed a fadeaway with 14.4 seconds left in regulation and was forced to foul Myles Turner with the Celtics trailing by 3. But what Boston found out about Indiana is it has a propensity for mistakes, and Nembhard's errant pass went off Pascal Siakam with 8.5 seconds left, giving the Celtics one final chance to send it into overtime.\n\nJaylen Brown, who had been stellar most of the evening besides missed free throws, canned a corner 3-pointer in front of the Pacers bench for the tie. A Garden crowd that had been raucous for most of the night went into a frenzy.\n\nAnd after Brown saved the Celtics the first time, Tatum made up for his gaffe with his best two possessions of the postseason.\n\n\"{Tatum] plays with a level of poise and a level of comfort knowing that the next [shot] has a chance to go,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"Just stick with it. You can't have any expectations about how it's supposed to go. It doesn't matter and I thought our guys have that kind of mind-set.\n\nTatum was indispensable in his 45 minutes, finishing with a team-high plus-20. The Celtics were a far better team with him on the floor and he fueled a third-quarter run that put Boston up by 13 before Mazzulla replaced him with Sam Hauser with 2:38 left in the period.\n\nWith Tatum on the bench, the Pacers immediately went on a 12-2 quarter-ending run and the Celtics would be in a tussle the rest of the way.\n\n\"For the most part I thought his shot selection was good,\" Mazzulla said. \"And I thought his ability to either handle or screen got us open looks, whether it was for himself or others. And I thought for the most part he competed defensively.\"\n\nTatum said during the Cleveland series he listens to criticism from analysts and observers but doesn't necessarily agree with their opinions. He had sparkled with his defense and rebounding in the postseason. But Tatum is about to make in the neighborhood of $330 million this summer because of his ability to score, his knack for getting to the bucket and finishing and splashing game-deciding 3-pointers. He did all of those in Game 1.\n\nWhen the Pacers made a plethora of late mistakes to allow the Celtics to force overtime, Tatum made them pay with his relentlessness, despite that deflating turnover. His ability to bounce back along with his teammates is what kept the Celtics close enough to tie on that Brown shot.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T.

Mendoza", "body": "Basketball fans are tuned in to the battles for survival happening now in the National Basketball Association (NBA). It is the highest point of the Playoffs, the Eastern and Western Conference Finals.\n\nTo get to this stage, the four teams with dreams of winning the championship still very much alive had to pass through ordeals of fire and ice, slay dragons, manage pain and somehow emerge from it all unscathed, bloodied perhaps, but unbowed.\n\nSo Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals was disputed Wednesday by the league-leading Boston Celtics and their new nemesis, the gritty and resilient Indiana Pacers.\n\nThey were sixth place in the East, but managed to eliminate third seeded Milwaukee in the first round, the New York Knicks in the second, and are now up against the 64-18 Celtics. They've come a long way, Baby.\n\nOut West, the Dallas Mavericks buoyed by their double-barreled scoring machine of Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving are duking it out today, Thursday, against the thunderous Minnesota Timberwolves. What a duel that's going to be.\n\nThe Celtics have been the easy pick to win in the eliminations, what with their league-best win-loss record that have earned them the No. 1 overall rating during the regular season.\n\nThey cruised through Miami after surviving one bumpy ride in Game 2 of the first round and won, four-one. They eliminated badly undermanned Cleveland in five games in a testy way -- not as dominantly as expected against the Cavs. But they still had their aces, one of whom was the eternally youthful Al Horford who stood in for the injured Kristaps Porzingis, and the heirs of Boston's glorious past -- the two Jays of Jason Tatum and Jaylen Brown.\n\nNow the tougher test begins. Boston is in its sixth ECF finals appearance in eight years and third straight season. They are patently the stronger and more experienced team over the Pacers who have not made it to the division finals since 2014 and last made the finals in 1999 but lost to the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nBut these 2024 Indiana Pacers are a different breed altogether. Against Boston on Wednesday, they lived up to their names and matched the pace of the game the Celtics played. They brought it to Boston in the three-point battle. They rebounded just as hard.\n\nThe Celtics outrebounded the Pacers by just one (44-43), with Indiana getting more defensive rebounds and Boston scoring three more in the offensive side.\n\nThe Pacers outnumbered the Celtics meanwhile, 38-30, in the assists department, with crucial points scored off those brilliant assists.\n\nBut alas, the Pacers also outdid the Celtics in turnovers (22-15) and in fouls committed (23-15).\n\nLong story short, the Celtics defense held, and that was the thing that kept Fort Boston together. Joe Mazzulla's men stole the ball three times more than Indiana and scored two more fastbreak points off those steals. They edged out Rick Carlisle's army in the paint too and finished with two more paint points than Indiana.\n\nBut all is not lost for the Pacers. With the way they played Game 1, they almost brought the league leaders to their knees. It is not surprising though why they would think of Game 1 of the ECF as TOTGA (the one that got away).\n\nJaylen Brown was the magician who pulled off that well-guarded, awkward three-point shot that tied the game at 117 and sent it to overtime. They should've fouled him, pundits said, with the Pacers up by three. Yeah, but perhaps Pascal Siakam was thinking: what if he sinks those three free throws? What if it becomes a four-point play?\n\nSo the basketball gods took over in OT. Jayson Tatum scored 10 points in overtime for a total output of 36. All Boston did was capitalize on some late mistakes by the Pacers to own Game 1.\n\n\"Look, a lot of things had to go wrong for us and right for them. They did. We have to own it,\" said Rick Carlisle post-game.\n\nNow the focus shifts to the West. The Mavs are coming off a captivating six-game series win over the best-in-the-west Oklahoma City Thunder. The Timberwolves are still high -- and mighty! -- after winning a don't-blink-first seven-game series that dispatched the defending champs, the Denver Nuggets.\n\nThis is King Kong vs. Godzilla in all its glory. Although the Timberwolves and Ant Edwards have been absolutely fearsome, there are those who say that the combined experience and wisdom of Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving have a value all its own.", "source": {"uri": "businessmirror.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessMirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "al_s_mendoza@businessmirror.com.ph", "name": "Al S.

The game's pivotal moment came in the dying seconds of regulation for Jaylen Brown, who later got a shoutout from Jayson Tatum for his clutch shot.\n\nTatum took center stage at the post-game press conference when his face was adorned with satisfaction and elation. With the thrill of victory still coursing through his veins, he couldn't resist sharing his thoughts on Brown's game-changing 3-pointer in the dying seconds of regulation.\n\n\"That sh*t was wild. But stay present, stay in the moment. As long as there is time on the clock, we feel like we have a chance,\" Tatum said.\n\nBrown's momentous shot ended a frenetic sequence of events. With the Pacers committing a turnover on an errant inbounds pass, the Celtics seized the opportunity to turn the tide in their favor. Brown, who had been relatively quiet in the fourth quarter, rose to the occasion when it mattered most.\n\nNevertheless, Jrue Holiday also demands applause, as his precise pass gave Brown the perfect position to deliver the crucial shot. With just 6.1 seconds remaining on the clock, Brown's three-pointer leveled the score at 117-117, igniting a wave of momentum that carried the Celtics into overtime.\n\nThroughout the thrilling showdown between the Celtics and the Pacers, the trio of Jayson Tatum, Jrue Holiday, and Jaylen Brown put forward their basketball brilliance. Hence, the Pacers' efforts fell short of containing the relentless efforts of the Celtics' dynamic trio.\n\nMeanwhile, the Celtics' triumph wasn't just a mere win. Instead, it was a groundbreaking moment in NBA playoff history. With their exceptional display of skill and determination, Tatum, Holiday, and Brown became the first trio in NBA playoff history to record 25 points and three steals in a single game.\n\nTatum, who got a wake-up call from Kendrick Perkins, was particularly awesome among them. His stellar performance saw him tally an impressive 36 points, including 10 crucial points in overtime that proved pivotal in securing the victory.

McConnell won't do the trick, either.\n\nGive credit where credit is due, though. The Pacers nearly stole the series opener -- on the road -- and it looked like they might actually have what it takes to extend this series to five, six or maybe even seven games.\n\nBut what we saw on Tuesday is the best basketball that we're going to see from Indiana.\n\nThe Pacers went up by five following Andrew Nembhard's 3-pointer with 1:57 left in regulation, but they got sloppy down the stretch, committing a pair of turnovers in the final 27.7 seconds that helped the Celtics force the extra session.\n\nMistakes like that don't get made by seasoned teams. They do, however, get made by teams that haven't been to this stage of the playoffs in 10 years.\n\n\"That (expletive) was chaos. That (expletive) was wild,\" Celtics star Jayson Tatum said of the wild Game 1 finish. \"As long as there's time still on the clock, and the game is within reach, we feel like we have a chance. This core group has been in so many big-time games, big-time moments.\"\n\nAlthough it did come up short, Indiana was going toe-to-toe with Boston throughout Game 1 -- aside from the first three-plus minutes, where the Celtics put together a game-opening, 12-0 run.\n\nIt was the type of inspired performance that almost makes you want to be the one in the group chat who sends the \"Pacers in 7\" text just so you can have bragging rights for the foreseeable future if Indiana somehow does win the series.\n\nBut don't. You'll thank us later.\n\nCompletely writing off the Pacers feels somewhat wrong, but believing that Indiana can outlast Boston in a seven-game series could be deemed a cardinal sin.

Be disappointed. But don't fret.\n\n\"We know we can play with these guys,\" Haliburton said. \"There's a lot of people out there saying we don't belong here. We don't really care. We know we belong.\"\n\nWhat's clear is that how both teams adjust for Game 2 on Thursday night will set the tone for the balance of this series.\n\nRecent history aside, the similarities between the Celtics and Pacers were on display throughout Game 1.\n\nBoth teams thrived offensively this season and did so again, combining for 261 points Tuesday night. It was the highest scoring game of this postseason and the most in a conference finals game since Boston and Detroit totaled 264 in Game 4 of the 1987 East finals.\n\nWhat was also on display were both teams' vulnerabilities. Indiana exploited Boston's weakened interior defense throughout, racking up 56 points in the paint. But the Celtics ultimately prevailed, benefiting from a myriad of mistakes by a young Pacers team short on playoff experience.\n\nHaliburton had two key turnovers to help the Celtics rebound from a five-point deficit in the final two minutes of regulation. First, he dribbled off his foot as he was bringing the ball up the floor with less than 30 seconds remaining in a three-point game. He also fumbled the ball out of bounds with just over a minute to play in OT.\n\nThe two miscues were part of 22 turnovers on the night for a Pacers team that came in averaging fewer than 12 per game in these playoffs.\n\nIt's part of the growing pains Indiana coach Rick Carlisle expected his youth-heavy team would have to endure during this playoff run.\n\n\"You have to go through it to really experience what it's all about,\" Carlisle said. \"We try to help prepare them for those experiences. But there's nothing like going through it.\"\n\nLikewise, Boston learned in Game 1 that it can expect to continue to be pushed by an underdog Pacers team that has the depth to keep up with the Celtics.\n\nIndiana got the usual contributions of Haliburton, Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner, who combined for 72 points. But the Pacers also got a huge lift from reserves Obi Toppin (15 points) and T.J. McConnell (13 points), who helped Indiana's reserve outscore its Boston counterparts 30-13.\n\nIt's yet another wrinkle that makes the Pacers a hard team to prepare for, Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said.\n\n\"With their ability to play different lineups, the way they sub -- they sub two or three different guys at a time. They are willing to go away from sub patterns for certain guys,\" Mazzulla said. \"You have to be wary of going to any and everything at any particular time. ... Anything is on the table versus a team like this because of their versatility.\"\n\nTatum is expecting both teams to play with renewed confidence in Game 2.\n\n\"(Game 1) being a close game going into overtime they certainly feel like they probably should have won. And we feel like we can play a lot better,\" he said. \"So, I'm excited for us to come out and respond. And just do a better job of protecting home court than we have done recently.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obi Toppin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

Yet, Indiana got the ball back with a chance to seal the win at the free throw line with 10 seconds left.\n\nThe only issue was they had to inbound the ball. With 8.1 seconds remaining, an errant inbound pass from Andrew Nembhard to Pascal Siakam sailed out of bounds and gave Boston another chance to tie the score, which Jaylen Brown took advantage of with a 3-pointer in the corner.\n\n\"I think it's on us,\" Haliburton said. \"They're a great defensive team, they got great defenders, individual and team defenders, but they're not a team who forces a ton of turnovers. I just felt like more of them were on us than them. We got to clean that up.\"\n\nThe Pacers also missed a chance to foul before Brown's tying 3-pointer, which Siakam said was his intention on the play, but Brown caught the ball in the corner with his shoulders squared to the basket and Siakam did not want to risk fouling a shooter and give up a four-point play.\n\nThe Pacers became the first team since at least 1997-98 to lose a playoff game despite inbounding the ball up 3 in the final 10 seconds, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.\n\nIndiana's 22 turnovers were the second most it has committed all season and it contributed to 32 points for Boston, the most for the Celtics in any game this season.\n\n\"A lot of things had to go wrong for us and right for them,\" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said.\n\nTurning the ball over was uncharacteristic for Indiana, which entered the game committing the second fewest turnovers per game among playoff teams.\n\nOver the final 5:30, including overtime, the Pacers had more turnovers (five) than field goals (two).\n\n\"We showed our age a little bit tonight,\" Pacers center Myles Turner said. \"Being a youthful team and being in this high stakes of a game, those uncharacteristic mistakes just made their way out.\"\n\nDespite missing a chance to win the opening game in this conference finals, the Pacers did not leave TD Garden hanging their heads. Boston raced to a 12-0 lead to begin the game and appeared ready to turn it into a rout. The Celtics maintained an advantage by double digits twice before the Pacers responded to take the lead on both occasions.\n\n\"All year long, our battle cry has been 'continue to play, continue to push tempo, continue to execute, keep playing no matter what,'\" Carlisle said. \"It's served us well and it did tonight too. So, we got -- it's unfortunate we did so many good things in this game that it came down to a couple of mistakes at the end. But, this is the NBA playoffs. And, we've got to learn from it, and we got to bounce back.\"\n\nThe Pacers have dropped Game 1 in each of the previous two rounds of the postseason and then gone on to win a long series. It left Haliburton encouraged despite the disappointment of losing in such fashion, especially when he considered how well they played on Tuesday night.\n\n\"We know we can play with these guys,\" he said. \"We know we belong. It's discouraging just because of the plays that happened down the stretch, we felt like we were in position to win the game, just didn't win the game.\n\n\"But what I will say, is encouraging, we had been trash in Game 1s for the first series and second series.

Turnovers,\" Haliburton began. \"I had two bad turnovers that I feel cost us the game.\"\n\nThe Pacers arrived in Boston after upsetting the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round and the New York Knicks in the second - both times after losing Game 1. The Celtics are the NBA's top-seeded team, seven wins ahead of their closest competition and 17 wins better than the Pacers.\n\nAnd when Boston opened a 12-0 lead on Tuesday night, it looked like the series might not even be competitive. But Indiana tied it by halftime, led 115-110 with 1:57 left in regulation and even had a three-point lead with 40 seconds left.\n\n\"We know we can play with these guys,\" Haliburton said. There's a lot of people out here saying we don't belong here. We don't really care. We know we belong.\"\n\nIt was turnovers - 22 of them for 32 points, and several in key spots - that cost them. In addition to Haliburton dribbling off his foot with 28 seconds left in a three-point game when he wasn't being closely guarded, he also lost the ball out of bounds with 1:02 left in overtime.\n\n\"Big-time turnovers,\" Pacers center Myles Turner said. \"We showed our age a little bit tonight, being a youthful team in this high stakes of a game. We made some mistakes. A lot of uncharacteristic turnovers.\"\n\nThe Pacers led 117-114 with the ball after Jayson Tatum missed a potential game-tying 3-pointer with 37 seconds left. But Haliburton dribbled off his foot, giving Boston two more looks at the basket before Turner grabbed a rebound and was fouled with 10 seconds remaining.\n\nThat's when Andrew Nembhard threw away the inbounds pass, handing the Celtics yet another chance. Jrue Holiday found Jaylen Brown in the left corner; Pascal Siakam was supposed to foul him but hesitated, fearful of giving up three free throws.\n\nBrown drained the 3, tying the score 117-all. Haliburton got the ball with a decent look at the basket, but he went looking for a better one and wound up tossing up a heavily contested, off-balance shot at the buzzer.\n\n\"That's replayed a bunch of times in my head already,\" Haliburton said. \"That was probably the look for me to shoot.\"\n\nGame 2 is Thursday night before the series shifts to Indianapolis. The Pacers will need to win at least once in Boston, and they aren't likely to get a better chance.\n\n\"This loss is totally on me,\" coach Rick Carlisle said, blaming himself for not calling a timeout to advance the ball with 10 seconds left. \"We made some other mistakes. ... We've got to own it, and we've got to get ready for Thursday.\"\n\nCarlisle, who was fined $35,000 for complaining about the officiating in the second-round series against the Knicks, declined to comment on a 30-10 free throw differential - 23-3 in regulation.\n\n\"My daughter's already going to sit out one semester of college,\" he said. \"I can't have her take a whole year off.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Jaylen Brown then knocked down a ridiculously difficult, well contested corner 3-ball to knot things up, Tyrese Haliburton's prayer at the buzzer was off the mark, and Boston ran away with things in overtime for an improbable 133-128 win.\n\nIn mere minutes the perception of the series went from, \"Boston may not have what it takes to beat this Pacers team\" to \"How does Indiana recover from this?\".\n\nHere's five immediate takeaways from Tuesday's wild barn burner.\n\n1. This isn't going to be easy\n\nLet's face it: Boston coasted through the first two playoff rounds with little difficulties against inferior and undermanned Cleveland and Miami teams. But if Game 1 against the Pacers is any indication of what's to come, the Celtics are finally in for a dog fight of a series. Could the top-seeded Green still come out on top in six games or fewer? Absolutely. But nothing is going to come easy, and despite the heartbreaking defeat, Indiana isn't going to back down from the challenge.\n\nHaliburton (25 points, 10 assists) is playing with supreme confidence, Myles Turner (23 points, 10 rebounds) is a problem without Kristaps Porzingis available, and the Pacers bench, led by T.J. McConnell, means business. It's a wildly impressive offensive team that's certainly capable of keeping pace with Boston's equally versatile attack. For Boston to really take control of things, it'll need to hang their hats on the defensive end in a big way.\n\n2. Holiday huge\n\nBoston received contributions across the board in the momentum swinging victory. But to get 28 points from Jrue Holiday, plus seven rebounds, eight assists and three steals, is absolutely massive. Outside of a couple of strong games against Cleveland, the prized offseason acquisition was puzzlingly quiet for the majority of the first two rounds. He seems to have found his offensive groove now, however, and that production, coupled with what he already always brings on the defensive end, is a huge boon for the Celtics. Indiana can survive games when Tatum and Brown get theirs; but they won't survive if Tatum, Brown and another player like Holiday all go for 25-plus.\n\n3. Tatum comes up clutch\n\nWhen Tatum is at his absolute best, he's attacking the basket with a purpose, using his physically-capable frame to overpower defenders and either score at the rim, or draw the foul. When he disappoints offensively, it's often because he's settling for too much one-on-one action on the perimeter and hoisting contested shots. Yes, he can make them, but it's not an efficient approach to rely on.\n\nFor extended portions of Tuesday's win, he executed the former, and it resulted in a game-high 36 points. Tatum was a team-best +20 in the plus/minus category (in a five point win!) and snagged a team-high 12 rebounds to go with four assists and three steals. He saved his best plays for late in action, too, scoring 10 of the C's 16 points in overtime and doing so in a variety of ways.\n\n4. This one was a gift\n\nGive Boston credit: They made the plays when it needed to to secure the win. But Indiana gifted them this one; they had it in the bag. All the Pacers had to do was inbound the ball, make one of two free throws in the closing seconds and the game was over. Heck, they even had a timeout they could've used to advance the ball and set up a play to get it in. Instead they rushed things, coughed it up, Brown capitalized with an incredible shot, and the Celtics put their foot on the gas in the extra frame to ice it. Overall, Indiana had 22 turnovers and Boston scored 32 points off those mishaps.\n\n5. Free throw disparity\n\nNormally if a team doubles up their opponent in free throw attempts, it's going to bode pretty well for them. Until that final shot from Brown and the successful overtime, however, it appeared that free throw advantage wasn't going to result in a win.\n\nBoston finished the game 24-for-30 from the charity stripe; Indiana knocked nine of their mere 10 tries.

Boston led Indiana by 13 in the third quarter, but the Pacers wouldn't go down easily. They kept the C's to just two points over the final 3:23 of the frame and cut the deficit back to one point.\n\nIndiana regained the lead with just under five minutes to go in the fourth, giving Boston just its second clutch time game of the postseason. The Celtics were on the verge of dropping Game 1 on their home floor, then Jaylen Brown came through with the game-tying 3-pointer with 5.7 seconds left to force overtime.\n\nIn OT, fellow C's star Jayson Tatum shook off a rough stretch and scored 10 points -- including a huge 3-pointer with 42:8 to go -- to propel Boston to a 133-128 victory.\n\nAll five C's starters scored in double figures with Tatum (36 points), Jrue Holiday (28 points), and Brown (26 points) leading the way. Al Horford and Derrick White dropped 15 apiece.\n\nIndiana had seven players in double figures, including Tyrese Halliburton (25 points), Pascal Siakam (24 points), and Myles Turner (23 points).\n\nGame 2 at TD Garden is set for Thursday at 8 p.m. ET. Coverage begins on NBC Sports Boston with Celtics Pregame Live at 7 p.m.\n\nFirst, here are three takeaways from a wild Game 1.\n\nThe Celtics needed their stars to step up with the game on the line, and they rose to the occasion.\n\nIt wasn't pretty for most of the fourth quarter. Tatum and Brown struggled mightily in the frame until it mattered most. Brown made up for his rough stretch with an incredible game-tying 3-pointer to send the game into OT.\n\nTatum went 2-for-10 in the fourth and OT before scoring six straight points on an and-one layup and a 3. He ended up with 10 points in the OT period to seal the win.\n\nBrown finished with 26 points (10-20 FG), seven rebounds, five assists, two steals and a block. His only 3-point make (1-4) may have been the biggest shot of his NBA career.\n\nTatum had a game-high 36 points (12-26 FG, 2-8 3-PT) with 12 rebounds, four assists, and three steals. Twelve of his points came from the line.\n\nHoliday picked a great time to have his best offensive performance with the C's.\n\nThe perrenial All-Defensive selection -- named second-team All-Defense earlier in the day -- stepped up with a season-high 28 points on an efficient 10-of-16 shooting (4-8 3-PT). His stellar outing continues what's been a scorching stretch dating back to Game 3 vs. Cleveland.\n\nAs Celtics stats guru Dick Lipe notes, this is the first time since late December that Holiday scored at least 13 points in four consecutive games.\n\nWhile leading the C's offensively, Holiday made his usual impact on the defensive end. His presence was felt throughout the matchup, including in the third quarter when he drew a charge on ex-Celtic Aaron Nesmith.\n\nHoliday's lockdown D on Halliburton was key to Boston finishing off the hard-fought win.\n\n\"[Jrue Holiday] is the best defender in the NBA and has been for a long time,\" Halliburton said after the game. \"I'll learn from it and I'll be better in Game 2.\"\n\nHoliday added eight assists, seven rebounds, and three steals in his outstanding all-around performance.\n\nThe Pacers' high-octane offense was as advertised in Game 1, but 53.5 percent shooting from the field still wasn't enough to overshadow their foul and turnover troubles.\n\nIndiana's 21 turnovers were a playoff-high. Boston took advantage with 32 points off those mistakes.\n\nThe C's also got to the line for a whopping 30 free throw attempts. The Pacers had just 10 attempts, and only two until Aaron Nesmith finally got to the line with 3:18 left in the fourth quarter.\n\nTheir sloppiness was the difference and it proved costly in the game's most critical moments. They turned the ball over on an inbounds pass with 8.5 seconds left in regulation, leading to Brown's game-tying 3. In OT, Halliburton's turnover with 1:02 to go was a killer.\n\nTwenty-four of the Celtics' points came from the charity stripe, meaning 56 of their 133 points came off Pacers fouls or turnovers. No matter how great Indiana's offense is, that won't cut it against this Boston team.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halliburton", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Boston", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.nbcsportsboston.com/2024/05/Holiday_Jrue_GettyImages-2153511165-e1716343931916.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

And it looked up for the fight when it quickly bounced back from the Celtics' 12-0 run to open the game and tied it by halftime thanks to a deep three from Tyrese Haliburton.\n\nIt wasn't just Haliburton, as Myles Turner was brilliant with a combination of monster slams, spin moves on the blocks, silky smooth perimeter shots and even timely facilitating. Throw in Obi Toppin providing a spark off the bench, and the visitors did not look intimidated.\n\nThat was the theme of much of the game, as Boston built a double-digit lead in the second half just for the Pacers to come storming back. Whether it was an acrobatic Haliburton three to end the third quarter, T.J. McConnell directing the show on both ends for stretches, Pascal Siakam scoring and even Andrew Nembhard hitting a clutch shot, everything lined up for Indiana.\n\nAnd then it completely collapsed.\n\nThe decision to not foul can be debated, but it was the back-to-back turnovers in the last 30 seconds of regulation that stand out the most. Even a single point on either of those possessions would have been enough to earn a monumental win on the road and take control of the series.\n\nInstead, all the momentum is on Boston's side as it looks to defend home-court advantage once again in Thursday's Game 2.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_polacek@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Scott Polacek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obi Toppin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

Here are three things the Celtics have to do to make it happen.\n\nOpponents have made a little more than half (36-of-71) of their 3-point attempts against the Celtics in Game 2s during this postseason.\n\nMiami made the bulk of those, knocking down a playoff franchise-record 23 threes while Tyler Herro dished out 14 assists.\n\nThe Celtics vowed they would do a better job of defending the 3-point line after the game, and they did. Miami shot 23 percent (21-for-90) for the rest of the series.\n\nDonovan Mitchell and Darius Garland went a combined 9-for-12 from beyond the arc in Game 2 of the Cleveland series. Mitchell missed the final two games with a calf strain, and Garland was unable to duplicate that performance.\n\nThe Pacers are more than capable of catching fire from deep. They're shooting a league-best 38 percent during the postseason, and are the only team left shooting a higher percentage than the Celtics. They outshot the Celtics in Game 1, and nearly stole the game. Expect Indiana to keep firing from the outside.\n\nThe Celtics are 9-0 this postseason when Jayson Tatum grabs 10 rebounds or more, and 0-2 when he doesn't.\n\nBoston was out-rebounded as a team in both losses, and Tuesday night in Game 1. Tatum has been the Celtics' leading rebounder all postseason, and his work on the boards is crucial with Kristaps Porzingis out.\n\nBoston has kept a short rotation with their bigs. Xavier Tillman and Neemias Queta have played sparingly. Luke Kornet is averaging 4.2 rebounds per game. Al Horford had a monster performance in Game 5 of the Cavs series with 15 rebounds.\n\nBut, the most of Boston's rebounding production will likely come from the wings in this series. Tatum and Brown have to win those battles.\n\nThe Pacers have the NBA's highest-scoring and most efficient offense. They lead the league in points per game, offensive rating, and assist to turnover ratio.\n\nIndiana had 21 turnovers in Game 1, which is nearly double their postseason average (11.6) and seven more than the Celtics had.\n\nBoston got key stops in clutch moments, including two late turnovers from Indiana star Tyrese Haliburton.\n\nThe Celtics did a better job of getting stops and taking care of the basketball.

The Celtics played clutch defense in the dying moments of the fourth quarter but their offensive display in the second half left a lot to be desired. In fact, it even got bad enough that Kendrick Perkins couldn't help but get very harsh with his criticism on X[Formerly Twitter].\n\n\"The Celtics offense makes me feel like when I take my ozempic shot... nauseated! They make me SICK\"\n\nPerkins' annoyance was spurred on the heels of Boston's horrendous third quarter, where they committed six turnovers. They then continued to struggle in the fourth and lacked rhythm on the offensive end, which handed the advantage to the Pacers.\n\nThe Celtics' infuriating dissonance on offense saw the Pacers take a five-point lead with less than 100 seconds left in the contest, which only justified Perkins' comments on the matter. After all, despite all their quality this season, the Celtics have looked beyond stagnant at times. Fortunately for them, however, it didn't ruin the result of this contest this contest.\n\nIndiana seemingly had the win in the bag as they led by three points with 10 seconds left and only needed a clean inbound pass to ice the game. But veteran guard Jrue Holiday forced a turnover before Jaylen Brown hit a circus three-pointer to level the score.\n\nJayson Tatum's sensational defensive display on the final possession pushed the game to overtime, where the Celtics outscored the Pacers 16-11 to win the game and take a 1-0 lead in the series. Boston's below-par performance on offense in the second half went unpunished in Game 1, but Perkins had predicted before the series commenced that they would have to bear the brunt of it eventually.\n\nThe Celtics looked a little rusty in Game 1 and it's understandable considering they were sitting idle for six days, waiting for either the Pacers or the New York Knicks to join them in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nWhile many believe Indiana is just another roadblock in Boston's path and the Celtics represent the East in the NBA Finals, Kendrick Perkins feels the Pacers are being underestimated. During an appearance on the Pat McAfee Show, the analyst said,\n\n\"I have this series going seven games, OK? I give the nod to the Celtics, but this Indiana Pacers team has shown me something these first two rounds. They're not going anywhere. Whether the world believes in them or not, they believe in themselves. That's the most important thing, and they're showing it.\"\n\nIf not for a careless turnover, the Pacers could've stolen Game 1 and taken the lead in the series.

They only needed to inbound the ball and hit a free throw to seal the victory.\n\nBut then Indiana threw the ball away, giving the Celtics life. And after a spectacular inbounds pass from Jrue Holiday -- one of many spectacular moments from him en route to a 28-point, 7-rebound, 8-assist, 3-steal performance -- to Jaylen Brown in the corner allowed Brown to rise and fire from 3, he hit the game-tying jumper with 5.7 seconds remaining.\n\nThe shot ultimately sent Boston on its way to a heart-stopping 133-128 overtime victory to open this best-of-7 affair.\n\n\"It was a good momentum play that we were able to get a turnover,\" said Brown, who finished with 26 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assists and 3 steals in 44 minutes. \"Jrue made a great pass. [Derrick] White set a great screen.\n\n\"And the rest was history.\"\n\nThis was the definition of a great escape from Boston, which was on the verge of dropping to an inexplicable 15-15 at TD Garden across the past three postseasons before Brown's game-saving shot and Indiana's multiple inexplicable miscues.\n\nBoston was able to survive a game that saw Jayson Tatum go 2-for-10 from the field in the fourth quarter and overtime before hitting what wound up being the game-clinching buckets on back-to-back possessions -- an and-1 over T.J. McConnell and a 3-pointer from the top of the key -- to put the game away. Tatum ended up with 36 points and was a plus-20 on the night.\n\nIn addition, Boston had several ugly turnovers late, including one each by Brown and Tatum, while Indiana feasted on getting center Al Horford isolated in switches down the stretch. Both Pacers forward Pascal Siakam and guard Andrew Nembhard repeatedly got clean mid-range jumpers that they knocked down, helping Indiana to a 5-point lead with1:57 remaining in the fourth quarter.\n\nAt that point, Boston was in trouble, magnified by Tatum missing a couple of shots inside the final 40 seconds.\n\n\"We always knew that there's always a chance,\" Holiday said. \"We've seen crazy stuff happen all the time. I don't think that we think we lost the game until we actually lost the game. And that's part of the reason why we were so resilient toward the end of the game.\n\n\"Like I said, anything can happen. A couple turnovers, a great shot, great look by JB or on the other end, we make a couple other shots that were wide open and it could be a completely different game. So just the type of team that's going to keep on fighting no matter how long and no matter what it takes.\"\n\nAfter Boston opened the game with a 12-0 run, Indiana clawed back from an early deficit, taking its first lead to open the second half with five straight points from superstar guard Tyrese Haliburton. But a 26-8 run in response gave Boston a 13-point lead in the third quarter -- its largest of the contest.\n\nIndiana, though, didn't play the part of a 9.5-point underdog, repeatedly fighting its way back into the game thanks to shooting 62.5 percent on 2-point shots after setting a new NBA record for field goal percentage in a postseason game in its Game 7 victory over the Knicks Sunday afternoon.\n\nThat stat, in particular, was a reminder of the absence of Kristaps Porzingis, who missed his seventh straight game with a calf strain. ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported before the game that Porzingis could be back as soon as Game 4 in Indianapolis on Memorial Day.\n\n\"Nothing other than what I expected,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said when asked about how he thought the game played out. \"Two high-level teams competing for a great opportunity. So I expect all the games to be like that, and there's going to be more of that. And I thought both teams competed at a high level. For us, I thought our guys, obviously we weren't perfect. We can get better. But I thought we maintained a level of poise, a level of mental toughness to just continue to work through some of the mistakes.\n\n\"That's the bind they put you in, because of the way they play. So we handled it well, and we need to get better.\"\n\nThe goal now for the Celtics is to find a way to do what they couldn't in the first two rounds of these playoffs: claim a victory in Game 2, and put a stranglehold on this series.\n\nEven that directive feels a lot different after Boston managed to escape with the win in Game 1.\n\n\"Come with the mindset of don't relax,\" Tatum said, when asked how he'll approach Game 2 Thursday. \"Different circumstances. The first two rounds we won our Game 1 by a wide margin, so maybe human nature played into that. But tonight being a close game, going into overtime, we certainly felt like we should have won and we could have played better.\n\n\"I'm excited for us to come out and respond and protect home court better than we have recently.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_bontemps@espn.ph", "name": "Tim Bontemps", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

Yet, Indiana still got the ball back with a chance to seal the game at the free throw line with 10.0 seconds remaining.\n\nThe only issue was they had to get the ball inbounds. With 8.1 seconds remaining, an errant inbound pass from Andrew Nembhard to Pascal Siakam went out of bounds and gave Boston another chance to tie the game, which Jaylen Brown took advantage of with a 3-pointer in the corner.\n\n\"I think it's on us,\" Haliburton said. \"They're a great defensive team, they got great defenders, individual and team defenders, but they're not a team who forces a ton of turnovers. I just felt like more of them were on us than them. We got to clean that up.\"\n\nThe Pacers also missed a chance to foul before Brown's game-tying 3-pointer, which Siakam said was his intention on the play, but Brown caught the ball in the corner with his shoulders lined up to the basket and Siakam did not want to risk fouling a shooter and giving up a 4-point play.\n\nThe Pacers became the first team since at least 1997-98 to lose a playoff game despite inbounding the ball up 3 in the final 10 seconds, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.\n\nIndiana's 22 turnovers were the second most it has committed in a game all season and it contributed to 32 points for Boston, the most for the Celtics in any game this season.\n\n\"A lot of things had to go wrong for us and right for them,\" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said.\n\nTurning the ball over was uncharacteristic for Indiana, which entered the game losing the second fewest turnovers per game among playoff teams.\n\nOver the final 5:30 of the game, including overtime, the Pacers had more turnovers (5) than field goals (2).\n\n\"We showed our age a little bit tonight,\" Pacers center Myles Turner said. \"Being a youthful team and being in this high stakes of a game, those uncharacteristic mistakes just made their way out.\"\n\nDespite missing a chance to win the opening game in this conference finals, the Pacers did not leave TD Garden hanging their heads. Boston raced out to a 12-0 lead to begin the game and appeared ready to turn the game into a rout. In fact, the Celtics jumped ahead by double digits twice in the game and the Pacers responded to take the lead on both occasions.\n\n\"All year long, our battle cry has been 'continue to play, continue to push tempo, continue to execute, keep playing no matter what,'\" Carlisle said. \"It's served us well and it did tonight too. So, we got - it's unfortunate we did so many good things in this game that it came down to a couple of mistakes at the end. But, this is the NBA playoffs. And, we've got to learn from it, and we got to bounce back.\"\n\nThe Pacers have dropped Game 1 in each of the previous two rounds of the postseason and then gone on to win a long series.

Mandatory Credit: Winslow Townson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAfter almost blowing Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals on their home floor, the Boston Celtics may be looking to innovate.\n\nCeltics head coach Joe Mazzulla revealed to reporters on Wednesday that it is possible that star forward Jayson Tatum could play at the 5 in certain lineups moving forward in their series against the Indiana Pacers.\n\n\"Anything is on the table against a team like this because of their versatility,\" said Mazzulla of the Pacers, per Jay King of The Athletic.\n\nThe revelation from Mazzulla comes after the Celtics were nearly stunned by the Pacers in Game 1 on Tuesday before the Pacers ultimately managed to out-choke them. With Kristaps Porzingis still sidelined with an injury, 37-year-old Al Horford had a very hard time keeping up with the run-and-gun Pacers, both in transition and on the perimeter. Equally-plodding backup center Luke Kornet also didn't have the foot speed to hold up defensively.\n\nWith Tatum playing as a de facto center (something that has only done two percent of the time in his entire career, per Basketball Reference), Boston could play five-out on offense and also blow up the Pacers' pick-and-rolls on the other end. Of course, much more would be required of Tatum, namely, boxing out and securing defensive rebounds, stepping out to contest shots by Indiana's floor-spacing big men Myles Turner and Pascal Siakam, and surviving off switches against guards like Tyrese Haliburton up top. But Tatum is long at 6-foot-8 and rebounds the ball well (8.1 per game this season), so he should be able to do so.\n\nThe Celtics might not necessarily turn to Tatum as a 5 man for more than a few minutes at a time. But it is a very useful option to have in their toolbox, especially since previous opponents have already exposed some of Boston's weaknesses with their current lineups.", "source": {"uri": "larrybrownsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Larry Brown Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darryn_albert@larrybrownsports.com", "name": "Darryn Albert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justise_Winslow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justise Winslow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Reference", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports Reference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jayson-tatum.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Boston led Indiana by 13 in the third quarter, but the Pacers wouldn't go down easily. They kept the C's to just two points over the final 3:23 of the frame and cut the deficit back to one point.\n\nIndiana regained the lead with just under five minutes to go in the fourth, giving Boston just its second clutch time game of the postseason. The Celtics were on the verge of dropping Game 1 on their home floor, then Jaylen Brown came through with the game-tying 3-pointer with 5.7 seconds left to force overtime.\n\nIn OT, fellow C's star Jayson Tatum shook off a rough stretch and scored 10 points -- including a huge 3-pointer with 42:8 to go -- to propel Boston to a 133-128 victory.\n\nGame 2 at TD Garden is set for Thursday at 8 p.m. ET. Coverage begins on NBC Sports Boston with Celtics Pregame Live at 7 p.m.\n\nFirst, here are three takeaways from a wild Game 1.\n\nThe Celtics needed their stars to step up with the game on the line, and they rose to the occasion.\n\nIt wasn't pretty for most of the fourth quarter. Tatum and Brown struggled mightily in the frame until it mattered most. Brown made up for his rough stretch with an incredible game-tying 3-pointer to send the game into OT.\n\nTatum went 2-for-10 in the fourth and OT before scoring six straight points on an and-one layup and a 3. He ended up with 10 points in the OT period to seal the win.\n\nBrown finished with 26 points (10-20 FG), seven rebounds, five assists, two steals and a block. His only 3-point make (1-4) may have been the biggest shot of his NBA career.\n\nTatum had a game-high 36 points (12-26 FG, 2-8 3-PT) with 12 rebounds, four assists, and three steals. Twelve of his points came from the line.\n\nHoliday picked a great time to have his best offensive performance with the C's.\n\nThe perrenial All-Defensive selection -- named second-team All-Defense earlier in the day -- stepped up with a season-high 28 points on an efficient 10-of-16 shooting (4-8 3-PT). His stellar outing continues what's been a scorching stretch dating back to Game 3 vs. Cleveland.\n\nAs Celtics stats guru Dick Lipe notes, this is the first time since late December that Holiday scored at least 13 points in four consecutive games.\n\nWhile leading the C's offensively, Holiday made his usual impact on the defensive end. His presence was felt throughout the matchup, including in the third quarter when he drew a charge on ex-Celtic Aaron Nesmith.\n\nHoliday's lockdown D on Halliburton was key to Boston finishing off the hard-fought win.\n\n\"[Jrue Holiday] is the best defender in the NBA and has been for a long time,\" Halliburton said after the game. \"I'll learn from it and I'll be better in Game 2.\"\n\nHoliday added eight assists, seven rebounds, and three steals in his outstanding all-around performance.\n\nThe Pacers' high-octane offense was as advertised in Game 1, but 53.5 percent shooting from the field still wasn't enough to overshadow their foul and turnover troubles.\n\nIndiana's 21 turnovers were a playoff-high. Boston took advantage with 32 points off those mistakes.\n\nThe C's also got to the line for a whopping 30 free throw attempts. The Pacers had just 10 attempts, and only two until Aaron Nesmith finally got to the line with 3:18 left in the fourth quarter.\n\nTheir sloppiness was the difference and it proved costly in the game's most critical moments. They turned the ball over on an inbounds pass with 8.5 seconds left in regulation, leading to Brown's game-tying 3. In OT, Halliburton's turnover with 1:02 to go was a killer.\n\nTwenty-four of the Celtics' points came from the charity stripe, meaning 56 of their 133 points came off Pacers fouls or turnovers. No matter how great Indiana's offense is, that won't cut it against this Boston team.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Boston", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnne.com/05887f17033858a408d3cdb524543434", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

The Pacers had a three-point lead with 10 seconds to go in the fourth quarter, so all they had to do was successfully inbound the ball, draw a foul without coughing the ball up, make a couple free throws and create an insurmountable two-possession lead. And then they could celebrate a momentous Game 1 win in the Eastern Conference finals which they managed to erase multiple double-digit deficits on the road against the NBA's best team of 2023-24 and one of its two most decorated franchises of all-time.\n\nBut as it turned out that wasn't the end of it. Not even close. Instead, there was a turnover, then a remarkable game-tying 3-pointer, then a busted possession that led to overtime. And there there were more turnovers and more remarkable shots, and when the end of it finally came the No. 6 seed upstart Pacers had lost 133-128 to the No. 1 seed Celtics at TD Garden Tuesday night to fall behind 1-0 in the series.\n\nPacers coach Rick Carlisle sat down in front of a microphone for his post-game press conference and immediately took responsibility for everything that happened in the last 10 seconds of regulation, saying that his first bad decision in that stretch begat every other breakdown, without which there would have never been an overtime and without which the Pacers would have been able to steal a road win in the series' first two games.\n\nHe regretted it more, he said, because the Pacers had done so many things well. They had fallen behind 12-0 to start the game, but cut the deficit to three points by the end of the first quarter and had the game tied by halftime. They fell behind 90-77 in the third quarter in one of those runs that the Celtics so often use to crush opponents' spirits, but the Pacers finished the period on a 16-4 run to get back within a point and never let the Celtics get ahead by more than five in the fourth.\n\n\"I love the way our guys fought in this game,\" Carlisle said. \"This loss is totally on me. With 10 seconds in regulation, we should have just taken the timeout, advanced the ball, found a way to get it in and made a free throw or two and ended the game. But it didn't happen.\"\n\nThe Pacers could have advanced the ball into the frontcourt for a sideline out-of-bounds which might have given them a few more options for how to get it in. They could have also taken the timeout when it became clear the Celtics had each of their guys covered in the backcourt.\n\nWhat happened instead, however, was second-year guard made a risky pass to forward Pascal Siakam cutting toward the opposite basket with Celtics wing Jaylen Brown closing fast and then draped over his back. Brown got a hand on the ball but it also seemed to go off of Siakam's fingertips. He continued to chase the ball to try to save it and then it went off of his hand again out of bounds. It was Boston's ball and Carlisle was out of challenges to force a review.\n\n\"It's a tough one,\" Siakam said. \"I felt like I was grabbed, then I felt like I touched it. I didn't know if he touched it. It was just a mess at the end. I was just trying to save it. Yeah frustrating play for sure.\"\n\nAnd it only got more frustrating after that.\n\nSuddenly the Celtics had life, and that was all they needed. All-NBA wing started in the left corner with Siakam on him. He in toward the paint and ran around a screen from guard Derrick White near the foul line and returned back to the corner where he caught a pass from veteran guard Jrue Holiday, immediately squared up to shoot, pump faked, then drilled a 3-pointer over Siakam's head to tie the game with 5.7 seconds to go.\n\nThe immediate question asked was why the Pacers had not decided to foul to give up two free throws rather than a chance to tie the game. The truth was, however that they had decided to foul, but even when those are the instructions, Carlisle's players know they are only to foul if they can do so before the opposing player begins the act of shooting, less they commit a three-shot foul or even worse, turn a 3-pointer into a four-point play. The screen set by White slowed down Siakam just enough that when he got to Brown, he was already heading into upward motion on the pump fake and if Siakam had fouled then he would have run the risk of a three-shot foul. He had his hands low looking for a chance to foul, so he didn't actually get his hands up to contest the shot.\n\n\"He caught the ball and he was face-up so Pascal decided to lay off,\" Carlisle said. \"I understand that's probably the right decision. You don't want to give up the four-point play.\"\n\nSiakam confirmed that version of events.\n\n\"I wanted to foul as soon as I got to him, but I was a little late because of the screen,\" Siakam said. \"He acted like he was going up, so I didn't want to do it. When I thought I was going to do it, it was too little too late. It's one of those where if you have an opportunity to do it, you do it, but it's just a judgment call. I felt like he was going to his motion. He had a pump fake, I didn't want to foul then. And it's a tough shot and I was in front of him. Maybe I could have contested it better, but it's just a tough call.\"\n\nAs it happened, the Pacers probably would have been able to successfully foul if they had decided beforehand to switch all screens. Veteran guard T.J. McConnell was guarding White, and if he had switched on to Brown he would have been able to get to the corner to foul him on the catch. But without knowing how the play would go, the Pacers knew switching McConnell on to Brown would risk having a 6-1 guard trying to contest a shot against a 6-6 wing in Brown. Even if Siakam couldn't foul he has a 7-3 wingspan that could help contest. Brown just managed to drill the shot over that.\n\nAfter that bucket, the Pacers still had a chance to win the game in regulation. This time they did start the possession on the sideline in the frontcourt.\n\nHaliburton started the possession at the right elbow being guarded by White -- named second-team All-Defense for the second straight year on Tuesday. He ran to the center court logo and White was hit by screens by center Myles Turner and forward Aaron Nesmith, which drove White into the lane. The Celtics didn't switch, which gave Haliburton open space to start the possession, but only for about a second while White broke toward the ball.\n\nHaliburton took one dribble before White met him above the 3-point line, and he would say later that was the moment he should have pulled up and shot. Instead he tried to drive around him. White funneled Haliburton over to the right elbow where the 6-8 Tatum was waiting to bottle him up. Tatum forced him back beyond the 3-point arc and then to shoot a wild shot over him, which cleared the bucket before hitting the backboard on the opposite side and falling harmlessly to the floor as the buzzer sounded.\n\n\"I felt like there was a better shot to get that I didn't get,\" Haliburton said before confirming that he meant the early deep look. \"... That's replayed in my head 100 times and it will replay after I get out of here. But I can't dwell on it. I felt like that was probably the look for me to shoot. I wish I did, but I didn't.\"\n\nThe Pacers still had more chances after that. They took the lead first on a step-back 3-pointer by Haliburton with 3:43 to go to go up 120-117, fell behind 121-120, then took it back again when Haliburton made all three free throws on a three-shot foul. However, Tatum scored on a three-point play thanks to two offensive rebounds by White. Then when Haliburton found himself forced into the sideline by Holiday for another turnover, Tatum drilled a 3-pointer that made it a four-point game. A steal by Brown turned into a layup by White to put the Celtics up six with 25 seconds left and the Pacers were basically out of time at that point.\n\nTatum scored 10 of his 36 points in overtime, but the Pacers had three turnovers that led to seven points which fit with the theme of the evening. They gave the ball away 21 times which turned into 32 Celtics points. That hasn't been a problem for the Pacers for most of the playoffs as they turned the ball over just 10.8 times per game in their first 13 playoff games. Haliburton had three of those himself, two of which were on occasions when he dribbled the ball off his foot.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it comes down to turnovers, big-time turnovers,\" Turner said. \"I really think we showed our age a little bit tonight. Being a youthful team and being in this high stakes of a game, those uncharacteristic mistakes made their way out.\"\n\nBut, Turner said, they also showed poise in all those moments they fell behind, so even though they walked away with a loss, they could walk away from Game 1 and walk into Game 2 knowing that they very much belonged on the floor with a Celtics team that won 64 regular season games, seven more than anyone else in the NBA and 14 more than anyone else in the Eastern Conference. The Pacers were beaten by the Bucks and Knicks much more decisively in Game 1 of each of those series, came back stronger in Game 2 and of course ended up advancing. Game 1 of this series showed signs that the Pacers start in a much better place than they did in either of those series.\n\nThe Pacers hit six more field goals than the Celtics, who benefitted from a 30-10 disparity in free throw attempts. Indiana won the rebounding battle 44-43 and held the Celtics to 47.5% shooting including 33.3% from beyond the 3-point arc while making 53.5% of their own shots and 37.1% of their 3s. They took powerful blows from the Celtics' biggest stars -- Tatum, Brown and Holiday combined for 90 points -- but still had the game in their hands with 10 seconds to go before they let it slip away.\n\n\"We know we can play with these guys,\" Haliburton said. \"There's a lot of people saying we don't belong here. We don't really care. We know we belong.\"", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "indianapolis_star@indystar.com", "name": "Indianapolis Star", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-out_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Time-out (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fadeaway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fadeaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

Brown's Kobe-inspired move over Pascal Siakam helped Celtics secure the Game 1 win. Despite blowing two double-digit leads, Brown's heroics allowed Boston to protect home court.\n\nJayson Tatum commended Jaylen Brown for hitting a crucial game-tying shot late that helped the Boston Celtics protect home court against the Indiana Pacers in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Pacers seized and held onto the lead from the 4:57 mark of the fourth quarter before Andrew Nembhard's 19-foot step-back jumper with 46.1 seconds left in regulation put them up 117-114 and threatened to earn them the win. Then, Jaylen Brown caught an inbounds pass from Jrue Holiday in the left corner and drilled a contested three-pointer with six seconds remaining to send the game into overtime.\n\nBoston wound up taking Game 133-128 and a 1-0 lead in the series. After the victory, Tatum told reporters exactly how he felt about Brown's clutch bucket.\n\n\"It's simple. Big-time players make big-time plays. That was a hell of a shot he made.\"\n\nBrown went Kobe 2.0 With Game-Tying Shot\n\nBrown took a page out of NBA Hall-of-Famer Kobe Bryant's book, first pump-faking before rising up over Pascal Siakam who had no choice but to keep his hands down to avoid committing a foul. The 27-year-old hot hand -- 24 points on 9-18 shooting from the field -- leading up to the play is partly what gave him and his teammates confidence to go to him in that situation.\n\nThe Celtics did give up an early 12-point lead in the first quarter and a 13-point advantage with 4:15 to go in the third quarter, which put them at risk of losing to begin with. Albeit, Brown's heroics served as a stepping stone for Boston to put away Indiana in overtime that produced the largest point differential of five points on the affair.\n\nThe Cal product did come out after the win and state that he was not happy with the way in which they came away with the win. No matter, his three in the waning moments of the fourth proved his reliability in high-pressure situations once again. That will be vital for Boston against a Pacers team that won't go down lightly in the series.\n\nRelated Jaylen Brown Credits Celtics Teammate for Game 1 Victory: 'He's The Reason Why We Won' Jrue Holiday had a strong performance of 28 points, eight assists, seven rebounds, and three steals in Boston's Game 1 win over Indiana.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mixcollage-22-apr-2024-04-57-pm-5810.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The Pacers held a 114-117 lead with 41.6 seconds left in regulation, giving the Pacers a 71.7% probability for victory, per ESPN. Boston fans at TD Garden were packing up and calling it a night, however, it only took an unlikely inbounding turnover by Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton to wake the Celtics up and muster up some heroic motivation to push a then-dud performance into overtime.\n\nWith 10 seconds left, Brown deflected an inbound pass to Indiana's Pascal Siakim, securing the biggest possesion of the night for the Celtics. And then moments later, off an inbound from teammate Jrue Holiday, Brown connected on a game-tying dagger from the corner, sending the TD Garden faithful into a frenzy -- and Boston to a 133-128 Game 1 win.\n\n\"Welcome to the NBA playoffs,\" Brown explained. \"You just gotta manage your emotions of the game. Anything can happen. The game is not over until the final buzzer sounds and that was a good example of that. We was able to turn them over a little bit towards the end; one with Haliburton on the sidelines and I was able to get the deflection off of Siakam, that just extended the game. It's not over until it's over.\"\n\nAll the Celtics needed was a chance at new life.\n\nThe faith wasn't limited to the nail-bitting ride-and-die fans who stuck with the Celtics from start to finish. Boston's defensive intensity in the final seconds of a game many interpreted as a sealed deal was a reflection of the team's collective mindset. They didn't allow the final precious seconds go to waste, didn't allow the Pacers to trot around the court and take a knee, and treated the game like a Game 7 scenario.\n\nNobody in Boston's locker room was under the impression that the Pacers had won Game 1 until the final score said so.\n\n\"I don't think that we think we lost the game until we actually lost the game, and that was part of the reason why we were so resilient toward the end of the game,\" Holiday said after Game 1. \"Like I said, anything can happen. A couple of turnovers, a great shot, great look by JB. On the other hand, we make a couple of those shots that were wide open and it could be a completely different game. We're just the type of team that's gonna keep fighting no matter how long and no matter what it takes.\"\n\nHoliday, fresh off sharing an All-NBA Defensive Second-Team nod with back-court partner in crime Derrick White, delivered on both ends of the floor. The 33-year-old scored 28 points, making Holiday's best performance this postseason, shooting an efficient 10-of-16 while collecting three steals.\n\nThe contributions came from all over the place, but most importantly it was Boston's mental strength in finding comfort in the uncomfortable, that ultimately helped log their gutsiest performance in the playoffs thus far.\n\n\"We just talked about it in the huddle.

Since the Purple and Gold have been eliminated from the NBA Playoffs for weeks now, he has had plenty of time to share his thoughts and dissect every key in-game decision.\n\nThe All-time scoring leader was not shy about expressing his opinion during Tuesday's Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals between the Boston Celtics (No. 1 seed) and the Indiana Pacers (No. 6). What looked to be a sensational road victory for Indy turned into one of the franchise's most bitter implosions, and a massively missed opportunity.\n\nJames thinks the Pacers' 133-128 loss to the Celtics was completely avoidable. According to him, the incredibly difficult 3-pointer Jaylen Brown hit from the corner to send the contest into overtime should have never been allowed to happen.\n\n\"And ya'll still wanna know why I would foul up 3 EVERY SINGLE TIME??\" James posted on X after the stunning turn of events. The four-time NBA Finals MVP knows from firsthand experience how a team's decision to let its opponent attempt a game-tying bucket can alter an entire series. He and the Miami Heat have an extra title because of that exact blunder, which the San Antonio Spurs devastatingly made back in 2013.\n\nBut James might be simplifying this specific situation.\n\nPacers made another critical mistake that cost them Game 1\n\nIndiana had multiple chances to clinch the upset win, so it feels a little short-sighted to hone in on this particular play, especially since fouling in that situation is not typically considered a no-brainer. There was 8.5 seconds left in regulation before Boston took the ball out of a timeout. If the Pacers elect to foul with that much time remaining, it could backfire on them. More importantly, though, the C's did not give them much of a choice.\n\nBrown quickly gets the inbound pass from Jrue Holiday and sets up to shoot, causing defender Pascal Siakam to cautiously refrain from initiating contact. While the result is obviously disastrous, fans should understand why the 2019 champ and two-time All-Star forward did not want to risk handing the Celtics a potential four-point play.\n\nIt is unsurprising that LeBron James would choose to focus on this moment given that he and JJ Redick recently discussed the topic of fouling up three on the latest episode of their podcast, \"Mind the Game.\" But he should probably devote an appropriate amount of scrutiny to the sequence that preceded the Jaylen Brown shot.\n\nThe Pacers were painfully unorganized on a critical inbound pass, as Andrew Nembhard (12 points, seven assists) threw an ill-advised ball that Brown disrupted. Siakam couldn't come up with it and lost it out of bounds. Rick Carlisle and Indiana's decision not to use a timeout, along with players' inability to break free from the defense, afforded Boston an unforeseen breath of oxygen.\n\nThe championship favorites capitalized, like most great teams do, and bought themselves an extra five minutes. Jayson Tatum scored 10 of his game-high 36 points in overtime to kick in the final bricks of this Pacers' collapse.\n\nThey must immediately learn from these inexcusable blunders.\n\nIndiana has to tighten things up if it is going to conquer this giant\n\nJust as LeBron James has benefited from major gaffes, he has also suffered the consequences of them. J.R. Smith inexplicably dribbled out the clock instead of going for the win against the Golden State Warriors in the 2018 Finals. The Cleveland Cavaliers lost in OT and were unceremoniously swept. Although this Boston squad does not come with the Dubs' sparkling track record, Indy has little room for error.\n\nThe Pacers cannot hand the Celtics so many gifts when there is already a disparity in quality between the two teams. It is borderline miraculous that they nearly left TD Garden with a W despite committing 22 turnovers and attempting 20 less free throws than their opponents. Another outing like that would presumably go much differently than Tuesday night's nail-biter.\n\nOn the plus side, the Celtics continue to show some vulnerability in the NBA Playoffs. They recovered effortlessly after losing on their home floor in each of the first two rounds, but Carlisle's feisty group might not stay down as easily as the Heat and Cavs did.\n\nTyrese Haliburton, Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner combined for 72 points in Game 1, and Andrew Nembhard, Obi Toppin and T.J. McConnell all contributed valuable production. Adding sound judgment to the mix can possibly lead to something special.\n\nLeBron James and the rest of the basketball world will be tuning in to see if the Pacers can mend their self-inflicted wounds and punch back at the Celtics on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_house@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Alex House", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nIn each of the previous two rounds, Boston opened its series with Miami and Cleveland with lopsided victories, only to then lose Game 2.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe Pacers have experienced the opposite, dropping Game 1 in Rounds 1 and 2 and then having to regroup to overtake Milwaukee and New York.\n\nTyrese Haliburton's takeaway from Indiana's latest Game 1 setback against the East's top seed? Be disappointed. But don't fret.\n\n\"We know we can play with these guys,\" Haliburton said. \"There's a lot of people out there saying we don't belong here. We don't really care. We know we belong.\"\n\nWhat's clear is that how both teams adjust for Game 2 on Thursday night will set the tone for the balance of this series.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRecent history aside, the similarities between the Celtics and Pacers were on display throughout Game 1.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBoth teams thrived offensively this season and did so again, combining for 261 points Tuesday night. It was the highest scoring game of this postseason and the most in a conference finals game since Boston and Detroit totaled 264 in Game 4 of the 1987 East finals.\n\nWhat was also on display were both teams' vulnerabilities. Indiana exploited Boston's weakened interior defense throughout, racking up 56 points in the paint. But the Celtics ultimately prevailed, benefiting from a myriad of mistakes by a young Pacers team short on playoff experience.\n\nHaliburton had two key turnovers to help the Celtics rebound from a five-point deficit in the final two minutes of regulation. First, he dribbled off his foot as he was bringing the ball up the floor with less than 30 seconds remaining in a three-point game. He also fumbled the ball out of bounds with just over a minute to play in OT.\n\nThe two miscues were part of 22 turnovers on the night for a Pacers team that came in averaging fewer than 12 per game in these playoffs.\n\nIt's part of the growing pains Indiana coach Rick Carlisle expected his youth-heavy team would have to endure during this playoff run.\n\n\"You have to go through it to really experience what it's all about,\" Carlisle said. \"We try to help prepare them for those experiences. But there's nothing like going through it.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nLikewise, Boston learned in Game 1 that it can expect to continue to be pushed by an underdog Pacers team that has the depth to keep up with the Celtics.\n\nIndiana got the usual contributions of Haliburton, Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner, who combined for 72 points. But the Pacers also got a huge lift from reserves Obi Toppin (15 points) and T.J. McConnell (13 points), who helped Indiana's reserve outscore its Boston counterparts 30-13.\n\nIt's yet another wrinkle that makes the Pacers a hard team to prepare for, Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said.\n\n\"With their ability to play different lineups, the way they sub -- they sub two or three different guys at a time. They are willing to go away from sub patterns for certain guys,\" Mazzulla said. \"You have to be wary of going to any and everything at any particular time. ... Anything is on the table versus a team like this because of their versatility.\"\n\nTatum is expecting both teams to play with renewed confidence in Game 2.\n\n\"(Game 1) being a close game going into overtime they certainly feel like they probably should have won. And we feel like we can play a lot better,\" he said. \"So, I'm excited for us to come out and respond. And just do a better job of protecting home court than we have done recently.\"\n\n___\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba", "source": {"uri": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterborough", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Peterborough"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Peterborough"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obi Toppin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

In the aftermath of a 133-128 overtime defeat, Pacers players were left to consider what might have been.\n\n\"We gave it away,\" Pacers forward and former Celtic Aaron Nesmith admitted, per ESPN's Jamal Collier. \"We should've won the game.\"\n\nEven after Jaylen Brown's improbable game-tying 3-pointer, Indiana still had a chance to win in regulation. But with Jayson Tatum plastered to him, Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton couldn't get the shot he wanted. In the end, his effort fell far wide of the mark and the game went to overtime.\n\n\"I felt like there was a better shot to get that I didn't get,\" Haliburton told reporters.\n\n\"That's replayed in my head 100 times and it will replay after I get out of here,\" he added. \"But I can't dwell on it. I felt like that was probably the look for me to shoot. I wish I did, but I didn't.\"\n\n\"We showed our age a little bit tonight,\" said Pacers center Myles Turner. \"Being a youthful team and being in this high-stakes of a game, those uncharacteristic mistakes just made their way out.\"\n\nIndiana finished the night with 21 turnovers.\n\nStill, Haliburton was encouraged by the team's performance with an eye on the rest of the series.\n\n\"We know we can play with these guys,\" he said. \"We know we belong.\"\n\nTrivia: The Pacers last won the Eastern Conference in 2000. That season, Indiana great Reggie Miller led the team in total points, but was second in points per game. What player, who ranked second in total points behind Miller, had a slightly higher point per game total?\n\n(Answer at the bottom).\n\nHint: He was a member of the University of Michigan's famous \"Fab Five.\"\n\nScores and schedules:\n\nThe Celtics managed to pull off a dramatic, 133-128, Game 1 win over the Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals on Tuesday. Game 2 is set for Thursday at TD Garden at 8 p.m.\n\nAlso from Tuesday: PWHL Boston lost Game 2 of the Walter Cup Finals to Minnesota, 3-0. The best-of-five series is now tied 1-1, with action heading to Minnesota's Xcel Energy Center on Friday at 7 p.m.\n\nAnd the Red Sox got a 5-2 win over the Rays. The two teams will conclude the three-game series tonight at 6:50 p.m. as Boston goes for the sweep.\n\nMore from Boston.com:\n\nThe Celtics were down and out before Jaylen Brown's save: Here's a glimpse at the statistical swings in win probability.\n\nRegrets? Not everyone kept the faith during Tuesday's Game 1. WCVB's Mary Saladna captured a humorous image of a group of fans who left TD Garden early and ended up watching the late-game drama from a bar window outside.\n\nOn this day: In 1988, the Celtics did just enough to overcome Dominique Wilkins's 47-point night in a 118-116 Game 7 win over the Hawks in the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nOn the flip side, the Bruins couldn't stop Wayne Gretzky (four assists) and the Oilers in a 6-3 defeat in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nDaily highlight: Perfect execution from the Red Sox (both Rafael Devers and, of course, Jarren Duran), resulting in

He's played in countless close games in both the regular season and playoffs, so he's prepared when these moments arise.\n\nThe Lakers forward is no longer playing in the 2024 NBA Playoffs, but he's watching closely from home. He disagreed with how the Pacers played defense in the final seconds of regulation in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nThe Celtics went on to win Game 1 thanks to late-game heroics from Jaylen Brown. James's plan would have kept Brown from tying the game.\n\nHere's what the future Hall of Famer said about the Pacers' defense at the end of regulation in Game 1.\n\nMORE: Celtics survive Pacers in Game 1 overtime clash\n\nIt's become common practice for teams to foul the opponent when leading by three points late in the game. This prevents the trailing team from getting an opportunity to tie the game.\n\nThe Pacers found themselves up 117-114 with 8.1 seconds left, with the Celtics inbounding the ball on the baseline. Fouling immediately wouldn't allow Boston the chance at tying the game, thus creating a free throw battle in the final seconds.\n\nInstead, Indiana didn't foul, and Brown nailed the game-tying shot with 6.0 seconds left. It eventually sent the game into overtime.\n\nJames also referenced his recent \"Mind the Game\" podcast with JJ Redick that featured the two discussing how to traverse a three-point lead at the end of a game.\n\nIt's clear what James would have done if he was on the court, but it's of course easier said than done.\n\nMORE: Tyrese Haliburton's 3-pointers not enough to shock Celtics in Game 1\n\nIt's easy to say Indiana should have fouled Brown while up three points, but this narrative would be different had he missed the fadeaway corner 3-ball.\n\nThat didn't happen, though. The Pacers didn't foul and left the fate in Brown's hands, but why? Well, the Pacers didn't have an opportunity to foul.\n\nT.J. McConnell and Pascal Siakam didn't switch on Derrick White's screen, thus giving Brown a clean chance to catch the ball in the corner behind the 3-point line.\n\nMORE: How long is Kristaps Porzingis out with injury?\n\nSiakam did recover, but Brown was almost immediately in the shooting motion. Had Siakam reached in at all, Brown would have started his upward motion and drawn a three-shot foul -- a cardinal sin at the end of games.\n\nIt's common for NBA players to do this, and it's a way veterans can bully rookies on defense. Siakam knows better, so he kept his hands out of the cookie jar, not allowing Brown to get three free looks at the basket.\n\nIf Brown dribbles the ball at all, it would have given Siakam an opportunity to foul and force Brown to shoot two free throws.\n\nAlas, that didn't happen, and the rest is history.

Pacers", "body": "BOSTON -- When the Celtics desperately needed a final-second uplifting, Jaylen Brown answered the call and delivered the biggest playoff moment of his eight-year career, at the perfect moment.\n\nReturning to the Eastern Conference finals for a third consecutive time, the Celtics hosted the No. 6 seed Pacers, after going 3-2 with Indiana during the regular season. Boston's 12-0 run to begin the night didn't preview what would unfold the rest of the way through as the Pacers went toe-to-toe, matching the Celtics until snagging a favorable fourth-quarter lead which led to many -- including Boston's fans -- counting the C's out of Game 1.\n\nThat was until Brown made his presence felt and at the best possible time.\n\n\"Down three we needed a big shot and big play to extend the game,\" Brown said after Boston's 133-128 win over Indiana.\n\nAfter deflecting an inbounds attempt while guarding Indiana's Pascal Siakam, with 10 seconds left in regulation, Brown secured new life for the Celtics. And then off an unbound pass from teammate Jrue Holiday, Brown knotted the game even at 117 a piece by nailing a clutch and heavily-contested 3-pointer, sending Game 1 into overtime.\n\nBrown recalled his thought process before the shot: \"I was just telling myself, 'If I get this shot, it's going in.' And I was just telling myself the whole time, 'If you get it, it's going up and it's going in.'\"\n\nIt was, by far, the biggest moment of the night and capped off an elite rise-to-the-occasion from Brown, who finished with 26 points on 10-of-20 shooting with seven rebounds and three steals. Brown rejuvenated a relatively mundane stretch from the Celtics after repeated failed attempts and getting over the hump and putting the Pacers away without leaving the TD Garden crowd on the edge of its seats biting its nails in fear.\n\n\"It's simple. Big-time players make big-time plays,\" Jayson Tatum explained. \"That was a hell of a shot he made. The deflection to give us an opportunity to make that shot. ... This is the definition of a team win.\"\n\nBrown re-energized the faithful Celtics fans still around for the final seconds of the fourth quarter while the team didn't squander its second shot at crossing the finish line. It wasn't pretty and it wasn't easy, but the Celtics understood that and didn't waver at the uncomfortable.\n\n\"Welcome to the NBA playoffs,\" Brown said. \"You just gotta manage your emotions of the game. Anything can happen. The game is not over until the final buzzer sounds and that was a good example of that. We was able to turn them over a little bit towards the end; one with Haliburton on the sidelines and I was able to get the deflection off of Siakam, that just extended the game. It's not over until it's over.\"", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gio_rivera@nesn.com", "name": "Gio Rivera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://nesn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/05/Jaylen-Brown-7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

They were up by three points with the ball after the C's failed to convert a number of solid chances to cut into the Pacers advantage.\n\nBut on the ensuing inbounds, Andrew Nembhard's pass went awry as Jaylen Brown knocked it away from Pascal Siakam. Then Brown hit an off-balance, improbable 3-pointer to tie the game as the Garden crowd -- minus some early departures -- burst with its loudest cheer of the night.\n\nThe Celtics went on to snatch Game 1 from the Pacers to take the 1-0 series lead in the East Finals. And after the game, Pacers coach Rick Carlisle was blunt in his assessment of himself.\n\n\"This loss is totally on me,\" Carlisle said. \"With 10 seconds left in regulation, we should've just taken the timeout, advance the ball and found a way to get in and made a free throw or two at the end of the game. It didn't happen. We made some other mistakes. But our guys just need to concentrate fighting the way they fought in this game from start-to-finish.\"\n\nNow, it's not all on Carlisle. The Pacers had multiple gaffes in the final 30 seconds of regulation, including a separate turnover after Tyrese Haliburton simply mis-dribbled the ball away, leading to Aaron Nesmith diving out of bounds for the ball. Indiana had 21 total turnovers Tuesday, allowing the Celtics some breathing room -- especially in the final minute. There were also mistakes in the overtime period even though the Pacers had the lead at multiple points.\n\nSo as the Celtics escaped with a win to avoid scrutiny Tuesday, on the opposite side, the Pacers faltered in the final minutes. They've been a resilient team, clawing back from a 2-0 then 3-2 series deficit against the Knicks to win in seven games in the East semifinals.\n\nBut their inexperienced showed late as they gave the best team in the NBA enough chances to improbably force overtime. All the Pacers can do is turn to Game 2, which is set for 8 p.m. Thursday at TD Garden.\n\n\"Look, a lot of things had to go wrong for us and right for them,\" Carlisle said. \"They did.

Jaylen Brown hit a clutch 3-pointer to tie it in regulation, Jayson Tatum closed it out in overtime and Jrue Holiday was the C's most consistent player on both ends.\n\nHowever, there's a sentiment that the Celtics got away with one considering the turnovers that plagued the Pacers in the fourth quarter. There also was the botched plan to foul the shooter on the final possession in regulation, which Pascal Siakiam couldn't execute properly. It left an ESPN analyst with a bold takeaway.\n\n\"The Indiana Pacers had a legendary choke job in the last minute of the game,\" Williams said on ESPN's \"Get Up\" on Wednesday. \"You can sit up there and people can say, 'Well, look at the free throw discrepancy.' But I can go through the last minute of the game. The rushed shot with like 16 seconds left in the shot clock with Tyrese Haliburton. Him turning the ball over with 30 seconds left to go, pushing the pace. There's no need for him to push the pace. Slow down the game considering they had a three-point lead. To the inbound pass, why wasn't T.J. McConnel the one throwing the inbound pass? He's a leader. ... And then on the last possession, why not just switch? We can watch that play over and over and over. ...\"\n\nRick Carlisle took the blame for the loss, but Haliburton came to his head coach's defense. There's no telling what effect Tuesday's result will have on Indiana for the rest of the series. Boston committed its fair share of miscues that won't have a large spotlight since it won.

That [expletive] was wild,\" Tatum acknowledged after Boston's 133-128 overtime victory over the Pacers on Tuesday.\n\nIn a game where Boston somehow managed to force overtime despite the Pacers holding onto a 3-point lead and possession of the ball with 8.1 seconds to go -- Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and the Celtics managed to execute in crunch time.\n\nAfter a poor shooting stretch in the fourth quarter as the Pacers clung to several slim leads, Tatum made the most of the second chance afforded to Boston after Brown's clutch 3-pointer carried play past regulation.\n\nTatum scored 10 of his 36 points in overtime -- accounting for a majority of Boston's 16 points in the extra frame en route to a momentum-shifting, series-opening win. He added another 12 rebounds, four assists and three steals.\n\nTatum's best shot of the night came after Jrue Holiday forced Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton to step out of bounds in overtime -- giving Boston possession while holding onto a 124-123 lead.\n\nOn the next possession, Tatum received a feed from Derrick White while planted beyond the arc. After getting Andrew Nembhard to bite with a fake, Tatum sank a 3-pointer to give Boston a four-point cushion with 42.8 seconds left on the clock.\n\n\"I think just mentally understand that even though I've had spurts throughout big games where I didn't hit shots or shoot the ball well -- it's as simple as just believing that the next one is going in and always feel like I'm just one make away you know from getting hot or being in a great rhythm,\" Tatum said of staying the course amid shooting slumps.\n\nTuesday stood as an important test for both Tatum and the Celtics when it came to battling against adversity and exiting the parquet floor with ugly wins during postseason play.\n\nBut even with the pressure still sitting squarely on the title-favorite Celtics and their top player in Tatum, the star forward doesn't believe that Game 1 stands as a defining moment for this latest push for Banner 18.\n\nAt least, not with plenty of work still to be done in the weeks ahead.\n\n\"Prove? It doesn't prove anything,\" Tatum said. \"We won a big-time game. Series is far from over. We got to come back and play well enough to win again on Thursday [in Game 2].

Instead, Andrew Nembhard's pass to Pascal Siakam got knocked away by Jaylen Brown and then touched by Siakam as he ran out of bounds under Boston's basket for a turnover.\n\nThe Celtics would get the ball to Brown in the corner on the ensuing inbound, where he hit a game-tying three over Siakam to force OT, where Jayson Tatum delivered the big buckets to give the Celtics the win and a 1-0 series lead.\n\nIt was a brutal loss for the Pacers, and after the game Pacers coach Rick Carlisle took full responsibility for the loss, noting Indiana should've advanced the ball to make for an easier inbounds situation than on the sideline in the backcourt.\n\n\"This loss is totally on me. With 10 seconds in regulation, we should have just taken the timeout, advance the ball and found a way to get it in and made a free throw or two and ended the game.\"\n\nCarlisle also confirmed he wanted the team to foul up three, but because Brown caught the ball in the corner and immediately went up for the shot, Siakam pulled back to avoid a potential four-point play to lose. That was the right decision, because you can't allow a chance to lose in regulation at that point, but it never should have even gotten to that point. While Indiana is a young team, Carlisle is too experienced a head coach to put his team in that position.\n\nAs the underdog in the series, the Pacers can't be the team giving away opportunities to win the game, and it certainly seems likely they'll have serious regrets once this series is over about dropping a road Game 1 they should have won.", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derrick_rossignol@uproxx.com", "name": "Derrick Rossignol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "aaron_williams@uproxx.com", "name": "Aaron Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "wongo_okon@uproxx.com", "name": "Wongo Okon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "megan_armstrong@uproxx.com", "name": "Megan Armstrong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "grant_sharples@uproxx.com", "name": "Grant Sharples", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Streetball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Streetball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/carlisle.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Big-time players make big-time plays,\" Jayson Tatum said. \"That was a hell of a shot he made.\"\n\nWith Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals hanging in the balance, Brown's three-pointer with 5.7 seconds left secured overtime for Boston and paved the way toward a momentum-shifting 133-128 victory at a raucous TD Garden.\n\n\"It really just felt like we had a second chance, right? At the end of the third and fourth quarter -- we didn't necessarily play well enough, where we may have deserved to win,\" Tatum said. \"And obviously made some plays at the end. JB gave us a second chance by hitting his shot. And we just talked about it in the huddle. We got a chance, let's take advantage of it.\"\n\nTatum's takeover performance beyond regulation (10 points in overtime) might have sealed the win for Boston, but it was Brown who left his fingerprints all over that final-minute rally against a lax Pacers defense.\n\nBrown scored all five of Boston's points over the final minute of regulation, starting with a pair of clutch free throws that cut Indianapolis's lead to one with 57.1 seconds to go. A step-back jumper from Andrew Nembhard gave the Pacers some breathing room on the subsequent possession, with a pair of missed shots from Derrick White and Tatum putting Boston on the brink of defeat.\n\nIndiana had the ball and a three-point lead with 8.1 seconds left, with a well-executed inbound feed from Nembhard setting the Pacers on the path to victory.\n\nWith Jrue Holiday smothering Nembhard's first target in Tyrese Haliburton, the Pacers guard fed the ball to a cutting Siakam. Brown closed in on Siakam as Nembhard made his move -- with the ball bouncing off of Siakam's hands and out of bounds to put the ball back in Boston's hands.\n\n\"Welcome to the NBA Playoffs,\" Brown said of Boston's resiliency in crunch time. \"You just gotta manage your emotions of the game. Anything can happen. The game is not over until the final buzzer sounds.\n\n\"That was a good example of that. I was able to get the deflection off of Siakam that just extended the game. It's not over until it's over.\"\n\nAfter orchestrating one final possession for Boston, Brown forced overtime with his clutch bucket. With White doing just enough to slow down Siakam with a screen, Brown received a clean pass from Holiday -- elevating over Siakam and sending a nervous Garden crowd into a frenzy.\n\n\"Everybody was thinking the game was lost,\" Brown said. \"But when that shot goes in, now we've got an opportunity again. That gave us a little bit of life -- I think that's fair to say. We found a way to close it.\"\n\nBrown's contributions on both ends of the court paved the way for a comeback win over the Pacers.\n\nBut an hour after sinking arguably the biggest shot of his life, Brown was focused more on preventing such a nail-biting result from repeating itself moving forward against this Indiana team.\n\n\"I think it's always great to come out with a win,\" Brown admitted. \"But obviously we've got to tighten up in some areas and we're gonna watch the film. ... We knew they were gonna be fast. It didn't surprise us, but it's one thing watching them on film and then seeing it in person.\n\n\"They just got out of a dogfight in New York and it just felt like they were just flying by us, getting these layups. We gotta be better, we've got to match their intensity if we want to win the series.\"", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conor_ryan@boston.com", "name": "Conor Ryan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-out_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Time-out (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clutch (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IU433JWVW73YT5P46JFK3DJEAQ-664dd379801e1-768x432.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

The Pacers had a three-point lead with 10 seconds to go in the fourth quarter, so all they had to do was successfully inbound the ball, draw a foul without coughing the ball up, make a couple free throws and create an insurmountable two-possession lead. And then they could celebrate a momentous Game 1 win in the Eastern Conference finals which they managed to erase multiple double-digit deficits on the road against the NBA's best team of 2023-24 and one of its two most decorated franchises of all-time.\n\nBut as it turned out that wasn't the end of it. Not even close. Instead, there was a turnover, then a remarkable game-tying 3-pointer, then a busted possession that led to overtime. And there there were more turnovers and more remarkable shots, and when the end of it finally came the No. 6 seed upstart Pacers had lost 133-128 to the No. 1 seed Celtics at TD Garden Tuesday night to fall behind 1-0 in the series.\n\nPacers coach Rick Carlisle sat down in front of a microphone for his post-game press conference and immediately took responsibility for everything that happened in the last 10 seconds of regulation, saying that his first bad decision in that stretch begat every other breakdown, without which there would have never been an overtime and without which the Pacers would have been able to steal a road win in the series' first two games.\n\nHe regretted it more, he said, because the Pacers had done so many things well. They had fallen behind 12-0 to start the game, but cut the deficit to three points by the end of the first quarter and had the game tied by halftime. They fell behind 90-77 in the third quarter in one of those runs that the Celtics so often use to crush opponents' spirits, but the Pacers finished the period on a 16-4 run to get back within a point and never let the Celtics get ahead by more than five in the fourth.\n\n\"I love the way our guys fought in this game,\" Carlisle said. \"This loss is totally on me. With 10 seconds in regulation, we should have just taken the timeout, advanced the ball, found a way to get it in and made a free throw or two and ended the game. But it didn't happen.\"\n\nThe Pacers could have advanced the ball into the frontcourt for a sideline out-of-bounds which might have given them a few more options for how to get it in. They could have also taken the timeout when it became clear the Celtics had each of their guys covered in the backcourt.\n\nWhat happened instead, however, was second-year guard made a risky pass to forward Pascal Siakam cutting toward the opposite basket with Celtics wing Jaylen Brown closing fast and then draped over his back. Brown got a hand on the ball but it also seemed to go off of Siakam's fingertips. He continued to chase the ball to try to save it and then it went off of his hand again out of bounds. It was Boston's ball and Carlisle was out of challenges to force a review.\n\n\"It's a tough one,\" Siakam said. \"I felt like I was grabbed, then I felt like I touched it. I didn't know if he touched it. It was just a mess at the end. I was just trying to save it. Yeah frustrating play for sure.\"\n\nAnd it only got more frustrating after that.\n\nSuddenly the Celtics had life, and that was all they needed. All-NBA wing started in the left corner with Siakam on him. He in toward the paint and ran around a screen from guard Derrick White near the foul line and returned back to the corner where he caught a pass from veteran guard Jrue Holiday, immediately squared up to shoot, pump faked, then drilled a 3-pointer over Siakam's head to tie the game with 5.7 seconds to go.\n\nThe immediate question asked was why the Pacers had not decided to foul to give up two free throws rather than a chance to tie the game. The truth was, however that they had decided to foul, but even when those are the instructions, Carlisle's players know they are only to foul if they can do so before the opposing player begins the act of shooting, less they commit a three-shot foul or even worse, turn a 3-pointer into a four-point play. The screen set by White slowed down Siakam just enough that when he got to Brown, he was already heading into upward motion on the pump fake and if Siakam had fouled then he would have run the risk of a three-shot foul. He had his hands low looking for a chance to foul, so he didn't actually get his hands up to contest the shot.\n\n\"He caught the ball and he was face-up so Pascal decided to lay off,\" Carlisle said. \"I understand that's probably the right decision. You don't want to give up the four-point play.\"\n\nSiakam confirmed that version of events.\n\n\"I wanted to foul as soon as I got to him, but I was a little late because of the screen,\" Siakam said. \"He acted like he was going up, so I didn't want to do it. When I thought I was going to do it, it was too little too late. It's one of those where if you have an opportunity to do it, you do it, but it's just a judgment call. I felt like he was going to his motion. He had a pump fake, I didn't want to foul then. And it's a tough shot and I was in front of him. Maybe I could have contested it better, but it's just a tough call.\"\n\nAs it happened, the Pacers probably would have been able to successfully foul if they had decided beforehand to switch all screens. Veteran guard T.J. McConnell was guarding White, and if he had switched on to Brown he would have been able to get to the corner to foul him on the catch. But without knowing how the play would go, the Pacers knew switching McConnell on to Brown would risk having a 6-1 guard trying to contest a shot against a 6-6 wing in Brown. Even if Siakam couldn't foul he has a 7-3 wingspan that could help contest. Brown just managed to drill the shot over that.\n\nAfter that bucket, the Pacers still had a chance to win the game in regulation. This time they did start the possession on the sideline in the frontcourt.\n\nHaliburton started the possession at the right elbow being guarded by White -- named second-team All-Defense for the second straight year on Tuesday. He ran to the center court logo and White was hit by screens by center Myles Turner and forward Aaron Nesmith, which drove White into the lane. The Celtics didn't switch, which gave Haliburton open space to start the possession, but only for about a second while White broke toward the ball.\n\nHaliburton took one dribble before White met him above the 3-point line, and he would say later that was the moment he should have pulled up and shot. Instead he tried to drive around him. White funneled Haliburton over to the right elbow where the 6-8 Tatum was waiting to bottle him up. Tatum forced him back beyond the 3-point arc and then to shoot a wild shot over him, which cleared the bucket before hitting the backboard on the opposite side and falling harmlessly to the floor as the buzzer sounded.\n\n\"I felt like there was a better shot to get that I didn't get,\" Haliburton said before confirming that he meant the early deep look. \"... That's replayed in my head 100 times and it will replay after I get out of here. But I can't dwell on it. I felt like that was probably the look for me to shoot. I wish I did, but I didn't.\"\n\nThe Pacers still had more chances after that. They took the lead first on a step-back 3-pointer by Haliburton with 3:43 to go to go up 120-117, fell behind 121-120, then took it back again when Haliburton made all three free throws on a three-shot foul. However, Tatum scored on a three-point play thanks to two offensive rebounds by White. Then when Haliburton found himself forced into the sideline by Holiday for another turnover, Tatum drilled a 3-pointer that made it a four-point game. A steal by Brown turned into a layup by White to put the Celtics up six with 25 seconds left and the Pacers were basically out of time at that point.\n\nTatum scored 10 of his 36 points in overtime, but the Pacers had three turnovers that led to seven points which fit with the theme of the evening. They gave the ball away 21 times which turned into 32 Celtics points. That hasn't been a problem for the Pacers for most of the playoffs as they turned the ball over just 10.8 times per game in their first 13 playoff games. Haliburton had three of those himself, two of which were on occasions when he dribbled the ball off his foot.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it comes down to turnovers, big-time turnovers,\" Turner said. \"I really think we showed our age a little bit tonight. Being a youthful team and being in this high stakes of a game, those uncharacteristic mistakes made their way out.\"\n\nBut, Turner said, they also showed poise in all those moments they fell behind, so even though they walked away with a loss, they could walk away from Game 1 and walk into Game 2 knowing that they very much belonged on the floor with a Celtics team that won 64 regular season games, seven more than anyone else in the NBA and 14 more than anyone else in the Eastern Conference. The Pacers were beaten by the Bucks and Knicks much more decisively in Game 1 of each of those series, came back stronger in Game 2 and of course ended up advancing. Game 1 of this series showed signs that the Pacers start in a much better place than they did in either of those series.\n\nThe Pacers hit six more field goals than the Celtics, who benefitted from a 30-10 disparity in free throw attempts. Indiana won the rebounding battle 44-43 and held the Celtics to 47.5% shooting including 33.3% from beyond the 3-point arc while making 53.5% of their own shots and 37.1% of their 3s. They took powerful blows from the Celtics' biggest stars -- Tatum, Brown and Holiday combined for 90 points -- but still had the game in their hands with 10 seconds to go before they let it slip away.\n\n\"We know we can play with these guys,\" Haliburton said. \"There's a lot of people saying we don't belong here. We don't really care.

Jayson Tatum had the ball, and after Jrue Holiday set a pick, Tatum thought his teammate was going to be there for a lofty pass.\n\nBut Tatum passed it to none of his teammates, instead finding Tyrese Haliburton in the process. As they raced down the floor in transition, Haliburton pulled up for the wide-open 3-pointer. Then Derrick White came soaring in from behind, fouling Haliburton on the attempt leading to three free throws. It ended up being a disastrous few seconds for the Celtics in the process.\n\nFortunately, on the ensuing possession as the C's got multiple chances, Tatum converted on the and-1 layup. Then Tatum hit a 3-pointer on the Celtics' next possession for a personal 6-0 run when they needed it most. So after some Jaylen Brown heroics to force overtime, Tatum finished off the win after some struggles earlier in the overtime period. And the end result: a dramatic Celtics overtime victory to take the 1-0 series lead on the Pacers.\n\n\"I'm so glad we won the game because I would have been sick,\" Tatum said. \"That play was some miscommunication. We just talked about afterwards and thought that I was going to come off the screen. I thought that they would corral him and double him. I thought he was going to slip. He was still (able to) jump and pass the ball, so that was on me.\"\n\nThere was plenty of back-and-forth throughout the game as the Pacers came ready to scrap. The C's built up an early 12-point lead, but the Pacers quickly battled back. It was actually the young Indiana squad that led for the majority of the fourth quarter. Whenever the C's looked like they were going to blow the game open, the Pacers played resilient ball to keep themselves in Game 1 of the East Finals.\n\nAll the Pacers can do now is flip the page to Game 2, set for 8 p.m. Thursday at TD Garden. On the flip side, the C's are looking to fix some of their areas as they allowed the Pacers some efficient offense. But all that matters is the C's protected home court to start the series. And now, they'll look to replicate that success.\n\n\"That (expletive) was chaos; that (expletive) was wild,\" Tatum said. \"But just stay present, stay in the moment.

Whilst Calling Out Pacers Choke Job - The SportsRush", "body": "May 13, 2024; Cleveland, Ohio, USA; Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum (0) and guard Jaylen Brown (7) celebrate after a win over the Cleveland Cavaliers in game four of the second round for the 2024 NBA playoffs at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse. Mandatory Credit: David Richard-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDespite their haphazard offense, the Boston Celtics escaped with a 133-128 OT win against the Indiana Pacers in the opening game of the Eastern Conference Finals. The Pacers committed numerous late-game errors and blew their chance to win. Jaylen Brown's clutch three with 6 seconds left in the fourth quarter took the game to Overtime and then Tatum's 10 points OT performance sealed the deal.\n\nOn 'UNDISPUTED', Rachel Nichols blamed Pacers HC Rick Carlisle for not calling a timeout with around 10 seconds left in the fourth quarter. This would have resulted in the Pacers not committing a turnover and probably earning two free throws after the break.\n\nNichols was flabbergasted that an experienced coach like Carlisle didn't take the right call. However, she also downplayed that the Pacers handed the Celtics a win after giving them tough competition throughout the game.\n\nThe veteran analyst highlighted that Brown made a difficult deep trey with \"Pascal Siakam in his face\" to force the OT. While agreeing that the Pacers deserve flak for their multiple errors, she also asserted that the Celtics had to earn their way to a Game 1 win.\n\n\"The Pacers deserve all the criticism that is coming to them, they choked their part of the game away but they didn't make the Celtics win, Celtics took it,\" Nichols told Skip Bayless and Keyshawn Johnson.\n\nWhile Nichols rightfully pointed out Celts' clutch quotient to seal the deal, the Pacers ruined a golden chance to steal a game away from home. With around 10 seconds left in the game, they showed horrendous game-awareness. Keyshawn Johnson broke down the play which evaporated their chances of taking a momentous 1-0 lead in the ECF.\n\nWith 10 seconds left in the game, the Pacers had a three-point lead and the ball in their hands. However, the inbound passer Aaron Nembhard threw a tough pass to Pascal Siakam who was hounded by Jaylen Brown making the ball ricochet to out-of-bounds. Keyshawn Johnson opined that veteran TJ McConnell should have in-bounded instead of Nembhard.\n\nHe also questioned Nembhard's game-awareness as he didn't call a TO after not getting a desired passing lane. At the same time, he questioned if 6'1\" McConnell should have been on the defensive end in the aftermath of the Celts' time-out. As per Johnson, a bigger athlete should have been there to make things difficult for the lengthy Celtics,\n\n\"TJ shouldn't be on the floor, he is an offensive player and a liability on the defensive end... With 8 seconds to go in the game, you're a liability, so now we need bigger and more athletic guys on the floor so we can switch.\"\n\nThe Pacers did have a golden chance to seal the deal but committed turnovers during the most crucial parts of the game. The Celtics were overwhelmed by their uptempo offense but as a seasoned playoffs team, they knew that the fight was not over until the buzzer sounded.\n\nThe ECF Game 1 is a major example of a veteran squad holding its nerves and a younger squad unable to seize the moment.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shubham_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Shubham Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Nichols_(journalist)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Nichols (journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Mortgage_FieldHouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clutch (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyshawn_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keyshawn Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-out_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Time-out (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_Bayless", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skip Bayless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/a36f6cc0-untitled-design-2024-05-23t004221.161.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2013-05-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

They immediately followed with clunkers in Game 2 of both series against the Miami Heat and Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nHow can the Celtics break the pattern this time around against the Indiana Pacers, who they beat 133-128 in overtime to take the first game of the Eastern Conference finals series.\n\nJayson Tatum, who led the Celtics with 36 points, including ten in the overtime, and was a plus-20 on the evening, said it's a matter of not taking their foot off the pedal.\n\n\"I think we have to come with the mindset of don't relax,\" Tatum said. \"It's different circumstances.

It's going up and it's going in.'\"\n\nSure enough, Brown got the pass he needed from Jrue Holiday off the timeout. And sure enough, Brown's first 3-pointer of the night came at just the right time for a reeling Celtics squad.\n\n\"It's simple. Big-time players make big-time plays,\" Jayson Tatum said. \"That was a hell of a shot he made.\"\n\nWith Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals hanging in the balance, Brown's three-pointer with 5.7 seconds left secured overtime for Boston and paved the way toward a momentum-shifting 133-128 victory at a raucous TD Garden.\n\n\"It really just felt like we had a second chance, right? At the end of the third and fourth quarter -- we didn't necessarily play well enough, where we may have deserved to win,\" Tatum said. \"And obviously made some plays at the end. JB gave us a second chance by hitting his shot. And we just talked about it in the huddle. We got a chance, let's take advantage of it.\"\n\nTatum's takeover performance beyond regulation (10 points in overtime) might have sealed the win for Boston, but it was Brown who left his fingerprints all over that final-minute rally against a lax Pacers defense.\n\nBrown scored all five of Boston's points over the final minute of regulation, starting with a pair of clutch free throws that cut Indianapolis's lead to one with 57.1 seconds to go. A step-back jumper from Andrew Nembhard gave the Pacers some breathing room on the subsequent possession, with a pair of missed shots from Derrick White and Tatum putting Boston on the brink of defeat.\n\nIndiana had the ball and a three-point lead with 8.1 seconds left, with a well-executed inbound feed from Nembhard setting the Pacers on the path to victory.\n\nBut Brown had other plans.\n\nWith Jrue Holiday smothering Nembhard's first target in Tyrese Haliburton, the Pacers guard fed the ball to a cutting Siakam. Brown closed in on Siakam as Nembhard made his move -- with the ball bouncing off of Siakam's hands and out of bounds to put the ball back in Boston's hands.\n\n\"Welcome to the NBA Playoffs,\" Brown said of Boston's resiliency in crunch time. \"You just gotta manage your emotions of the game. Anything can happen. The game is not over until the final buzzer sounds.\n\n\"That was a good example of that. I was able to get the deflection off of Siakam that just extended the game. It's not over until it's over.\"\n\nAfter orchestrating one final possession for Boston, Brown forced overtime with his clutch bucket. With White doing just enough to slow down Siakam with a screen, Brown received a clean pass from Holiday -- elevating over Siakam and sending a nervous Garden crowd into a frenzy.\n\n\"Everybody was thinking the game was lost,\" Brown said. \"But when that shot goes in, now we've got an opportunity again. That gave us a little bit of life -- I think that's fair to say. We found a way to close it.\"\n\nBrown's contributions on both ends of the court paved the way for a comeback win over the Pacers.\n\nBut an hour after sinking arguably the biggest shot of his life, Brown was focused more on preventing such a nail-biting result from repeating itself moving forward against this Indiana team.\n\n\"I think it's always great to come out with a win,\" Brown admitted. \"But obviously we've got to tighten up in some areas and we're gonna watch the film. ... We knew they were gonna be fast. It didn't surprise us, but it's one thing watching them on film and then seeing it in person.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-out_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Time-out (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/k7BmfgXlvHGF7Ao1Z_h8C1F7GRc=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/PA2YVPDMPOKPFHB2FMQCDYAQOE.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

You can choose to see Jayson Tatum's 2 for 7 shooting in the fourth quarter (0 for 3 from 3-point range) as another sign he can't deliver in the clutch.\n\nOr, you can choose to see Boston keeping its poise as things went sideways. You can choose to see Brown making an excellent defensive play to force Pascal Siakam's turnover with eight seconds remaining in regulation, then springing free for that 3-pointer on a brilliant inbound play drawn up by head coach Joe Mazzulla.\n\nYou can choose to see Tatum bouncing back from that rough fourth quarter to score 10 of the Celtics' 16 points in overtime -- including a dagger 3-pointer with 42 seconds to go -- to finish with 36 points in a hard-fought 133-128 victory.\n\nHowever you view Boston's Game 1 performance, the reality is this team emerged from a frenzied 65 minutes of basketball with a 1-0 series lead.\n\nThat s--- was chaos; that s--- was wild,\" Tatum said when asked about his team's mental resilience down the stretch. \"But just stay present, stay in the moment. As long as there's time still on the clock and the game is within reach, we feel like we have a chance.\n\n\"This core group has been in so many big-time games, big-time moments. We've had a lead and lost it and still won. We've been down a lot and figured out a way to win.\"\n\nThis is Tatum and Brown's 19th playoff series together over seven postseasons. They've been the plucky underdogs trying to take down Goliath (2018 East Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers), seen their lack of experience cost them against a squad of seasoned veterans (2022 NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors) and been undone by a more physical, mentally tough opponent (2023 East Finals against the Miami Heat).\n\nOn Tuesday night, however, the Celtics played the role of seasoned vets, forcing the inexperienced Pacers into a playoff-high 21 turnovers and capitalizing on several crucial Indiana missteps at the end of regulation.\n\n\"I think we always knew we could (win),\" said veteran guard Jrue Holiday, who had his best game as a Celtic with 28 points, seven rebounds, eight assists and three steals. \"Close games I don't think have ever bothered us. I think we've always stayed poised no matter if it's a win or a loss.\n\n\"We'd always give ourselves a chance again today. But, down 3, with some seconds left, making a big shot, and making big plays after that, we knew we had it in us.\"\n\nHoliday is the only player on Boston's roster who has won an NBA title (2021 with the Milwaukee Bucks), and his steadying presence is a huge reason why the Celtics went 21-12 in \"clutch\" games this season (score within five points within the final five minutes). But Tatum and Brown also deserve credit for showing maturity Tuesday night, bouncing back from earlier missteps to make big plays when they counted and save Boston from a disastrous loss.\n\n\"It's simple: big-time players make big-time plays,\" Tatum said of Brown's game-tying 3-pointer near the end of regulation.\n\nThe Celtics made plenty of errors to put themselves down three to the No. 6 seed in the closing seconds of Game 1.

[Brown and Tatum] stepped up and made big plays when we needed it.\"\n\nCeltics head coach Joe Mazzulla also was pleased with the team's execution on Brown's game-tying shot.\n\n\"It was a well-executed play by the guys,\" Mazzulla told the media following Tuesday night's win. \"I thought Derrick White set a great screen, I thought Jaylen [Brown] had great balance -- a great pass [from Jrue Holiday] and a great shot -- it was a well-executed play by the guys. Good situational awareness, good execution.\"\n\nAfter defending their home court advantage in Game 1, the Celtics will look to tighten their grip in hopes to take a 2-0 series lead as they return to TD Garden on Thursday night for Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Boston", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.nbcsportsboston.com/2024/05/Jaylen-Brown-GettyImages-2153512192.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Turnovers,\" Haliburton began. \"I had two bad turnovers that I feel cost us the game.\"\n\nThe Pacers arrived in Boston after upsetting the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round and the New York Knicks in the second - both times after losing Game 1. The Celtics are the NBA's top-seeded team, seven wins ahead of their closest competition and 17 wins better than the Pacers.\n\nAnd when Boston opened a 12-0 lead on Tuesday night, it looked like the series might not even be competitive. But Indiana tied it by halftime, led 115-110 with 1:57 left in regulation and even had a three-point lead with 40 seconds left.\n\n\"We know we can play with these guys,\" Haliburton said. There's a lot of people out here saying we don't belong here. We don't really care. We know we belong.\"\n\nIt was turnovers - 22 of them for 32 points, and several in key spots - that cost them. In addition to Haliburton dribbling off his foot with 28 seconds left in a three-point game when he wasn't being closely guarded, he also lost the ball out of bounds with 1:02 left in overtime.\n\n\"Big-time turnovers,\" Pacers center Myles Turner said. \"We showed our age a little bit tonight, being a youthful team in this high stakes of a game. We made some mistakes. A lot of uncharacteristic turnovers.\"\n\nThe Pacers led 117-114 with the ball after Jayson Tatum missed a potential game-tying 3-pointer with 37 seconds left. But Haliburton dribbled off his foot, giving Boston two more looks at the basket before Turner grabbed a rebound and was fouled with 10 seconds remaining.\n\nThat's when Andrew Nembhard threw away the inbounds pass, handing the Celtics yet another chance. Jrue Holiday found Jaylen Brown in the left corner; Pascal Siakam was supposed to foul him but hesitated, fearful of giving up three free throws.\n\nBrown drained the 3, tying the score 117-all. Haliburton got the ball with a decent look at the basket, but he went looking for a better one and wound up tossing up a heavily contested, off-balance shot at the buzzer.\n\n\"That's replayed a bunch of times in my head already,\" Haliburton said. \"That was probably the look for me to shoot.\"\n\nGame 2 is Thursday night before the series shifts to Indianapolis. The Pacers will need to win at least once in Boston, and they aren't likely to get a better chance.\n\n\"This loss is totally on me,\" coach Rick Carlisle said, blaming himself for not calling a timeout to advance the ball with 10 seconds left. \"We made some other mistakes. ... We've got to own it, and we've got to get ready for Thursday.\"\n\nCarlisle, who was fined $35,000 for complaining about the officiating in the second-round series against the Knicks, declined to comment on a 30-10 free throw differential - 23-3 in regulation.\n\n\"My daughter's already going to sit out one semester of college,\" he said. \"I can't have her take a whole year off.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jimmy_golen@sports.yahoo.com", "name": "Jimmy Golen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0aRbd6zykJ1Y8FwsiAAbBA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/35502762e9bb4576e8262016cb1b151f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Indeed, it took a game-tying three-pointer from Jaylen Brown to force the game into overtime.\n\nThe Pacers should take plenty of confidence from their performance despite the defeat and at 11/4 in the Money Line they look backable underdogs, while the 19/20 on offer for Indiana to win with a +8.5 handicap in the Point Spread is the option for the more cautious punter.\n\nTyrese the creator can terrorise Celtics\n\nTyrese Haliburton recorded a 25-point double-double with ten assists for Indiana on Tuesday in Game 1 and once again he will be key to his team's chances in the second game of this best-of-seven match-up.\n\nHaliburton finished as the assist leader in the regular season with an average of 10.9 per-game. His output has dipped a little in the post season as he is averaging 8.2 after 14 games, but he should be able to finish with at least nine dimes on Thursday night.\n\nThe 24-year-old guard has finished with at least nine assists in three of his last six games and he has 46 in total in five meetings with Boston this season after his 10 on Tuesday, an average of 9.2 per-game.\n\nJrue an issue for Pacers\n\nJrue Holiday finished up with 28 points in Game 1, behind only Celtics team-mate Jayson Tatum, and he should be able to score at least half that amount when the two teams meet again.\n\nHoliday averaged 12.5 points-per-game in the regular season, his lowest total since his rookie season back in 2009-10, but has still been a key man for Boston - and he looks to have found a way to hurt Indiana.\n\nThe point guard has now scored 66 points across his last three games against the Pacers and has weighed in with at least 14 points in four of his last six games, so he should be able to go over 13.5 in Game 2.\n\ntalkSPORT BET welcome offer - Get \u00a330 in free bets (app only)*\n\n*Odds correct at the time of writing and subject to change\n\n18+ New customers only.

You can also say the Minnesota Timberwolves defeating the defending champion Denver Nuggets does as well, given the Boston-Denver national discourse throughout the NBA season.\n\nThe top-two offensive teams in the league, Boston won three out of five matchups with the Pacers this season-that many due to the NBA's In-Season Tournament. The Celtics were eliminated by them in the IST, with each of the losses being without Kristaps Porzingis and Jayson Tatum. ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported on Friday night that the Celtics center is expected to miss at least the first two contests of the series.\n\nJaylen Brown, leading his Celtics in tremendous fashion, spoke on the on-going expectations during this run of being title or bust. He knows Boston is the topic of discussion, appropriately, here in their historic 72-20 season, where they have had the fifth best in NBA History analytically. Every national broadcast each night, even when they are not playing, knowing the NBA goes through the Celtics.\n\n\"You do your best to block it out,\" Brown said. \"You've just got to focus on what matters the most...Be able to focus the mind on what matters because it's easy to get distracted.\"\n\nBrown went in-depth on while he tries to ignore the noise he does see and hear about, it is unavoidable. The All-NBA forward does his best to not get distracted by it.\n\nGame 1 on Tuesday night from TD Garden will tip-off at 8 p.m. EST on ESPN.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTrivializing Celtics' Success in Tatum-Brown Era a Take Not Measured Properly: 'Doing\n\nPast Hardships Brought Out Best in Al Horford in Career Night: 'You Saw His Gift'\n\nSimple Changes Spark Stifling Second Half Defense in Celtics' Game 4 Win vs. Cavs\n\nJayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown Still Shaking Off Criticism While Growing as Leaders\n\nJrue Holiday Delivers 'Masterclass' in Game 3 Win vs. Cavs\n\nJayson Tatum Breaks Out of Scoring Slump That Never Defined Him: 'Underappreciated'\n\nDerrick White Discusses Joining Elite Company in Game 1 Win vs. Cavaliers", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Okoro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Okoro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5180,h_2913,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_celtics/01hybzqk918418m3124n.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Brown was forced overtime with a corner three after Holiday had inbounded the ball to him. The Celts won the game and the series 1-0.\n\nIn an interview with the media following the victory, Holiday praised Jaylen Brown: \"I saw Jaylen wide open. It's a great shot. He pretty much did everything.\"\n\nJaylen Brown repeatedly swung the game until he hit the game-winning shot. He also finished the game with seven rebounds, five assists, and 26 points. Jayson Tatum took the lead with a game-high 36 points and 12 rebounds. Holiday had a fantastic game with 28 points, seven rebounds, and eight assists. Derrick White and Al Horford both scored 15 points.\n\nTyrese Haliburton scored 25 points for the Pacers. Myles Turner finished with 23 points and ten rebounds, and Pascal Siakam finished with 24 points and 12 rebounds. However, it was insufficient to overcome the Celtics' offense, which displayed clinical play in the Garden on Tuesday night to take the lead.\n\nEnthusiastic NBA fans have always been captivated by Mike Breen's ability to call the game.\n\nJaylen Brown made a crucial three-pointer to send the game into overtime, prompting the ESPN NBA commentator to make his infrequent \"double bang\" call.\n\nBreen couldn't resist using his trademark \"Bang!

The game was decided in overtime, after Indiana lost a three-point lead and possession with ten seconds remaining.\n\nThe Pacers, who are playing in their first Conference Finals in ten years, were close to surprising the favorites, but their inexperience took its toll. Pascal Siakam lost the ball when they were ahead with ten seconds left and Jaylen Brown, who had recovered possession, scored a three-pointer from the corner with the Canadian on top to force overtime.\n\nThe losses squandered the Indiana team's options, as they wasted 21 possessions throughout the game. In overtime, with the score at 124-123 and the ball going to the Pacers, Haliburton gave the ball to the Celtics with one minute remaining. Tatum, on the subsequent play, punished three to achieve an irremediable distance.\n\nThe 24-year-old point guard took the blame for his team's defeat: \"It's not his (Carlisle's) fault. He is one of the players, we have to do a better job. I lost two balls that cost us the game. I understand that you want to protect us, but I take the blame. \"We are going to be better,\" said the Pacers player.\n\nBeyond the losses, Haliburton and Siakam, with 25 and 24 points respectively, kept the Pacers in the match, since on the other side were the Jays, inspired throughout the match. Tatum scored 36 points, while Brown scored 26 and scored the triple that forced overtime. In addition, they were accompanied by Jrue Holiday, with 28, in his best game of the playoffs.\n\nWembanyama continues to make history in his first year in the NBA. The French player was chosen in the best defensive quintet of the year after receiving 98 of the 99 possible votes. His presence among the five best defenders in the league is historic, because he is the first rookie to achieve it.\n\nBefore the Spurs player, the rookies who came closest to making it into the best defensive quintet of the year were Tim Duncan (1998), David Robinson (1990), Manute Bol (1986), Hakeem Olajuwon (1985) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1970). The five finished in the second best defensive quintet in their debut season in the NBA.\n\nIn addition to Wemby, the best defensive team is completed by Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves), Bam Adebayo (Miami Heat), Herb Jones (New Orleans Pelicans) and Anthony Davis (Los Angeles Lakers).\n\nOn the other hand, the second best defensive team of the season is made up of Alex Caruso (Chicago Bulls), Jalen Suggs (Orlando Magic), Jaden McDaniels (Minnesota Timberwolves), Derrick White (Boston Celtics) and Jrue Holiday (Boston Celtics).", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news",

Indiana had led the Celtics by five points heading into the final 57 seconds of the match and, had it held on to win, could have stolen homecourt advantage from the 64-win Celtics.\n\nInstead, power forward Pascal Siakam instantly fouled All-Star small forward Jaylen Brown, who nailed both his shots.\n\nAndrew Nembhard promptly nailed a 19-foot step back jumper, the Pacers sloppily turned over the ball in consecutive offensive possessions (but Jayson Tatum blew a fadeaway jumper attempt in between those possessions), and suddenly the Pacers were leading by three points, with the ball, with 8.5 seconds left in regulation.\n\nSiakam, Indiana's best defender, was draped all over Brown, and clearly had been given the directive by head coach Rick Carlisle to not foul the swingman. So Brown made the most clutch bucket of his life, a side three pointer falling away, to tie the game at 117-117 with six seconds left.\n\nTyrese Haliburton heaved up a three point attempt on the other end instead of attempting to drive, and the game went to overtime.

Maybe Boston would have gotten the ball back with a chance to win anyway, or maybe the Pacers would have moved one step closer to their first NBA Finals appearance since 2000.", "source": {"uri": "thecomeback.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Comeback"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_o_neill@thecomeback.com", "name": "Robert O'Neill", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_clock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shot clock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://cdn1.thecomeback.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/USATSI_23344583_168384754_lowres.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

They dished eight more assists than Boston and got 17 more bench points and a slightly higher offensive rebound percentage. They had a five-point lead with less than two minutes left in the fourth quarter, and they had a three-point lead plus possession of the ball with 10 seconds left. Despite all of this, they have found themselves down 1-0 in the series following a 133-128 overtime loss at TD Garden on Tuesday.\n\n\"A lot of things had to go wrong for us and right for them,\" Indiana coach Rick Carlisle told reporters. \"They did. And so we gotta own it. And we gotta get ready for Thursday.\"\n\nCarlisle blamed himself for the outcome, pointing specifically to his decision not to call timeout with 10 seconds left in regulation. \"This loss is totally on me,\" Carlisle said. The Celtics had taken their foul to give, and would have had to put a Pacer on the free-throw line if they weren't able to force a turnover on this inbounds play:\n\n\"We should've just taken the timeout, advanced the ball and found a way to get it in and made a free throw or two and ended the game,\" Carlisle said. \"But it didn't happen, and we made some other mistakes.\"\n\nIndiana had 21 turnovers, which means the team coughed up the ball up on 19.8% of its offensive possessions. In the fourth quarter, that turnover rate was 27.3%. Seventeen seconds before the botched inbounds pass (which led to Jaylen Brown's game-tying 3-pointer), Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton committed an unforced turnover, losing the ball as he crossed halfcourt in transition. Later, down by one point in overtime, Haliburton lost it out of bounds again. In his view, his sloppiness is why they lost, not Carlisle's choice not to advance the ball.\n\n\"That's not on him,\" Haliburton told reporters. \"Us as players, we gotta do a better job. I had two bad turnovers that I feel like cost us the game, one in the fourth and one in overtime. I know, I understand he's protecting us, protecting me as well, but I'll take that more than he should. I gotta be better and I will be better in Game 2 and we'll respond the right way.\"\n\nHaliburton did not have an explanation for the turnover late in the fourth. \"I don't know what happened, he said.\n\n\"It's frustrating because it's not something that happens normally for me. But nobody forced it, I just dribbled the ball off my foot.\"\n\nAnd while he said that Jrue Holiday has been \"the best defender in the NBA\" and \"has been for some time,\" Haliburton saw the turnover in overtime as another self-inflicted wound: \"I was trying to get him as far to the left wing as I could so i could come downhill to the right. And I had the spin to set it up, and I just dribbled it off my foot. So it's unfortunate, it's frustrating for sure, but it happens.\"\n\nThis was not the first time that Indiana has gotten in its own way during the playoffs, but, it's anything but typical. The series opener was the Pacers' 97th game of the season, including the In-Season Tournament final, and they've only had a higher turnover rate twice. And unlike Game 5 against the New York Knicks, this wasn't a blowout. It was a golden opportunity, squandered.\n\n\"We had a lot of turnovers that would be hard to explain,\" Carlisle said.\n\n\"I think they're a great defensive team, they got great defenders -- individual and team defenders -- but they're not a team who forces a ton of turnovers,\" Haliburton said. \"They're a solid team. I just felt like more of them were probably on us than them.\"\n\nOn the game's very first possession, Indiana wing Aaron Nesmith turned the ball over trying to feed Pascal Siakam in the post, one of his five turnovers on the night, and Brown dunked it on a fast break moments later. Haliburton threw a no-look pass in the middle of the first quarter that landed in the first row. Obi Toppin got called for three seconds in the key trying to post up Payton Pritchard after a switch in the fourth quarter, and a few possessions later lost the ball trying to make a move against Jayson Tatum one-on-one. Down by four with less than 40 seconds left in overtime, Siakam went to his spin move and Brown ripped the ball away.\n\n\"We made mistakes,\" Carlisle said, understating the issue. He also said, though, that the Pacers \"did a lot of good things\" and he loved the way that they fought.\n\nTurnovers were not the only issue: Indiana committed 23 fouls and the Celtics attempted 30 free throws (to the Pacers' 10). And on Indiana's last play of regulation, Haliburton could have taken a deep 3 as soon as he caught the inbounds pass, rather than putting the ball on the floor. \"That was probably the look for me to shoot,\" Haliburton said, but instead he ended up taking a heavily contested desperation shot at the buzzer.\n\nGiven that Indiana entered the series an extreme underdog, it could be seen as encouraging that the game was close enough that it could slip away. Carlisle described the Pacers as \"a tough-minded, resilient team,\" which was evident in the way that they bounced back from heartbreaking losses in the first two games of their second-round series in New York. If this one feels more brutal though, it's because the opponent is much stronger and, for a conference finals game, there were a ton of bad decisions on both sides. It's unclear how many more chances like this they'll get.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_herbert@cbssports.com", "name": "James Herbert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlisle", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlisle"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-out_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Time-out (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obi Toppin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowout_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blowout (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_break", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast break"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payton_Pritchard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Payton Pritchard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Streetball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Streetball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/22/82f987ae-d6e6-4bbb-94b8-3a0a59ecb022/thumbnail/1200x675/b4b51a85702815ce857607928ce8191b/haliburton-usatsi.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

The C's were down three points, so the Pacers could've fouled, but they were at least down only one possession.\n\nSo the Celtics got one more gasp at life with 8.5 seconds left in the game. Jrue Holiday found Brown in the corner, and after a pump-fake with Pascal Siakam guarding him, Brown let the shot fly. The rest is history, he said postgame, as he forced overtime then the Celtics stole the Game 1 victory over the Pacers.\n\n\"Before the inbound I was talking to myself, 'If I get this shot, it's going in,'\" Brown said. \"I was telling myself the whole time, you get it, it's going up and it's going in. I happened to create some space on the backside and was able to make a big-time play. So we've got to be able to channel our emotions, move onto the next and get ready to Game 2.\"\n\nThe C's now lead the Pacers 1-0 in the East Finals as they narrowly avoided disaster. The Pacers played a spirited game Tuesday just two days after they beat the Knicks in the East semifinals, giving another top-seeded East team a huge fight. But the C's got some luck and breaks as they finished the job off in overtime.\n\nBrown, though, was mum on his reaction to the play, crediting his teammates. He said they need to clean up some of their play as the Celtics narrowly won in the 133-128 game. Most importantly, though, the Celtics came away with the ugly win. And in the East Finals, the C's will take them however they can get on their quest to hang Banner No. 18. Next up is Game 2, set for 8 p.m. Thursday at TD Garden.\n\n\"I think it's always great to come out with a win,\" Brown said. \"But obviously, we got to tighten up in some areas. We're going to watch the film. I think the majority of it was just transition. I think they just, we knew they were going to be fast, it didn't surprise us, but it's one thing watching it on film and then seeing it in person.\"", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.masslive.com/resizer/v2/7GI7JLAEOFHW7O4U32WH7LBLKI.jpg?auth=7c8da27c7a9d6b7c39de19f28d2cacff96e61509886554506daa65d93a1ac1e2&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

The Celtics were the best team in the NBA this season and they had far and away the best regular season record. They came into the playoffs with the best odds to win it all. They are now two series wins away from a championship, and Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle knows that this series won't be easy.\n\nThere is a reason why the Celtics were the best team in basketball this year. They are riddled with talent across their roster, and they create matchup nightmares for opposing teams. They have so many threats that it's hard their competition to have an answer for everyone, and Rick Carlisle knows that guarding them in this series is going to be a big challenge.\n\n\"These guys are almost impossible to match up with, due to their size and skill,\" Carlisle said before game one, according to a tweet from Tim Bontemps.\n\nBoston has found a way to cruise so far in the playoffs as they have taken down the Miami Heat and the Cleveland Cavaliers in their first two series. Both the Heat and the Cavaliers surprisingly won game two of their respective series on the road against the Celtics, but both teams lost in just five games. Carlisle and the Pacers are hoping to put up a better fight, but it is going to be a big challenge.\n\nThere are four teams left in the NBA playoffs\n\nAfter Sunday's slate that included two game sevens, we are down to just four teams in the NBA playoffs. The Pacers and the Celtics in the East, and the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Dallas Mavericks in the West. The Timberwolves just knocked off the defending champs, the Denver Nuggets, in game seven on Sunday, and they are now favored to take down the Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals.\n\nSo far, the Pacers have defeated the Milwaukee Bucks and the New York Knicks en route to the Eastern Conference Finals. Both of those teams were dealing with some injury trouble when they took on the Pacers, and Indiana took care of business to stay alive in the postseason. Now, they are four wins away from going to the NBA Finals.\n\nThe next month in the NBA is going to be exciting. Both of these conference finals series should be good ones, and it should set up for an exciting finish to the season.\n\nRight now, the favorites to make it to the finals are the Celtics and the Timberwolves, but you never know.

In the seven games Kristaps Porzingis has been inactive, the former Florida Gator is averaging 31.5 minutes.\n\nThe hosts have already ruled out Porzingis for Thursday's matchup. But before Tuesday's series opener, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski shined light on when the former All-Star might return to the lineup.\n\nFortunately for the Celtics, they may have Xavier Tillman Sr. back for Game 2 against Indiana. The former Michigan State standout missed Tuesday's tilt for personal reasons. Boston lists him as questionable on its latest injury report.\n\nWhile his return could help lighten Horford's workload, another option that could accomplish that is playing Jayson Tatum at center. It's a possibility Joe Mazzulla addressed on Wednesday at the Auerbach Center.\n\nThe Celtics would be wise to limit how long they play the five-time All-Star at the pivot and how much they turn to it, but it's easy to see the positives in deploying Tatum at the five against a Pacers opponent that relentlessly pushes the pace but also deploys a traditional modern NBA center in Myles Turner.\n\nAs for the visitors, Indiana's injury report remains the same as the series opener. The Pacers are without their top scoring option off the bench, Bennedict Mathurin, inactive since March because of a shoulder injury that required season-ending surgery. Fortunately for them, no one else is listed.\n\nGame 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals will tip off at 8:00 EST on Thursday night at TD Garden.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nJoe Mazzulla Addresses if Celtics Will Use Jayson Tatum at Center vs. Pacers\n\nJrue Holiday Starts Eastern Conference Finals with Best Game as a Celtic\n\nJaylen Brown's Heroics Propel Celtics to 1-0 Lead in Conference Finals\n\nAaron Nesmith Left Lasting Impression with Celtics Before Finding a Home with Pacers\n\nTrivializing Celtics' Success in Tatum-Brown Era a Take Not Measured Properly: 'Doing\n\nPast Hardships Brought Out Best in Al Horford in Career Night: 'You Saw His Gift'\n\nJayson Tatum Breaks Out of Scoring Slump That Never Defined Him: 'Underappreciated'", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Tillman_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xavier Tillman Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Gators men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_Spartans_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State Spartans men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennedict_Mathurin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bennedict Mathurin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3655,h_2055,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_celtics/01hyh65w431d8jzmzwvg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

The Boston Celtics had finally clawed back to take the lead and, with two minutes left in an improbable overtime, he threw the ball away.\n\nJaylen Brown had hit a spectacular shot to force overtime and the Celtics somehow still had a chance to win this game. Tatum couldn't spoil it.\n\nHe's the crunch-time caretaker, the Celtics' captain in the clutch. Just about every play in the biggest moments flows through Tatum one way or another, and the team trusts him to live up to that responsibility. Their title hopes depend on it.\n\nIt's Brown's job to give them sparks of dominance in the biggest moments. Tatum is responsible for keeping the team in a position to capitalize.\n\n\"JB gave us a second chance by hitting that shot,\" Tatum said. \"And we just talked about it in the huddle, like, 'We got a second chance. Let's take advantage of it. Let's not mess around and just figure out a way to win this game.'\"\n\nBut in that moment, it felt like he was messing things up. Easy execution on a simple screen, this is the stuff they've done all year.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers' constant motion throughout the night had taken Boston out of its rhythm. The Celtics play a crunch-time style organically, with targeted pick-and-rolls to get the defender they want in the mix a core competency of the offense.\n\nSo throwing away a pick-and-pop action like that was far beneath Tatum's standard.\n\n\"I'm so glad we won the game because I would have been sick,\" Tatum said after beating the Pacers 133-128 in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals. \"That play was some miscommunication. We just talked about afterwards and thought that I was going to come off the screen. I thought that they would corral him and double him. I thought he was going to slip. He was still (able to) jump and pass the ball, so that was on me. But we just talked about it for a quick second, and there was still a lot of time left to try to figure out how to win the game.\"\n\nIn the past, Tatum would try to make up for these moments by dribbling out in space and running down the clock, looking to pull off a step-back shot or drive through traffic. Tatum's growth isn't just in being more physical, but in making things easier on himself.\n\nHe was 1-for-7 from deep at this point. He could force that big shot to come, but he doesn't do that much anymore.\n\nIt was time to put him in the post and force his way to the hoop. So he inbounded the ball, took Andrew Nembhard to the post, pulled the chair to send him stumbling, and got the 3-point play.\n\nThen on the next possession, the big shot came to him naturally. Just like they did in the first two rounds, they targeted the opposing star guard to create a 2-for-1 advantage.\n\nTatum was used as the screener this time, forcing Tyrese Haliburton to frantically chase Derrick White from behind as the Celtics' point guard got downhill with ease. Then it was a piece of cake getting Tatum the open 3 he had been waiting for.\n\nTatum's 10 points in overtime were the most by any player in the postseason since 2021, per Tom Haberstroh. He finished with a postseason-best 36 points with 12 rebounds and three steals. He shot 2-for-8 from deep in the end, but all that mattered was the final one.\n\n\"Big-time players make big-time plays,\" Tatum said. \"Simple as that.\"\n\nBeing a big-time player is more than just hitting extravagant shots. It's controlling the shape of the floor, something Tatum is doing at the highest level of his career now.\n\nThat is what's enabling him to keep leading the Celtics in the biggest moments deep into the postseason, even as his 3-point shot continues to elude him.\n\n\"I think just mentally understanding that I've had spurts throughout big games where I didn't hit shots or shoot the ball well, but it's as simple as just believing that the next one is going in,\" Tatum said. \"I always feel like I'm one make away from being hot or being in a great rhythm. So I'm taking the right shots, being in the flow of the game and doing all the other necessary things to impact the game.\"\n\nBut for Tatum to put them ahead, they had to stop the Pacers offense. Enter Jrue Holiday, the one person on the Celtics with a ring. The player who knows what it's like to put your foot down and take control to the point that you're the champion.\n\nIt all culminated with a minute left in overtime when he locked up Haliburton to the point that the Pacers guard went crashing into the broadcast table.\n\n\"Jrue came out and balled, man. He's the reason why we won his game,\" Brown said. \"I think he just was poised, he took advantage of his matchups. He just was so, so elite in that. It's a lot. And he's guarding Haliburton, picking him up, chasing him around. That was special from Jrue Holiday.\"\n\nHoliday had a season-high in points and has steadily emerged as an offensive weapon as the playoffs have gone on. But the Celtics go to him for his defensive calm in the big moments and he delivered.\n\n\"Close games, I don't think have ever bothered us,\" Holiday said. \"I think that we've always stayed poised and no matter if it's a win or a loss, we knew that, we'd always give ourselves a chance. So again today, down three with some seconds left and making a big shot and making big plays after that, we knew we had it in us.\"\n\nBetween Holiday's defensive pressure and Tatum's offensive force, the Celtics were able to capitalize on the second chance Brown gifted them. Tatum is still waiting for his whole game to come together, but he and Holiday were vital in taking away Indiana's comfort and flow.\n\nTatum would harp on that jumper not falling in the past.

Earn might not even be an apt description, as it took a borderline impressive late-game collapse from the Pacers to force overtime. The extra frame wasn't very pretty either, but the Celtics did enough to earn a 133-128 triumph.\n\nBoston wouldn't have had a chance to win it in OT had it not been for Jaylen Brown. The Celtics were down to their last breath with 10 seconds to go in the fourth, and Brown managed to force an Indiana turnover and knock down a game-tying 3-pointer in that short span. But despite those heroic efforts, the three-time All-Star was noticeably unsatisfied after the game.\n\nBrown was asked why he didn't seem happy after Boston's fourth straight contest.\n\n\"Would you be? We almost dropped a game on our home floor,\" Brown said, per NBA reporter Keith Smith. \"We need to come out and be better in Game 2.\"\n\nTuesday's game carried out a theme for the Celtics, who received a wake-up call early in each of their last two series. But unlike those underwhelming outings, Boston still managed to win its first go-around with Indiana. That could spell very bad news for the Pacers, who might have to deal with a juggernaut for the rest of the best-of-seven set.\n\nThe Celtics will try to protect homecourt again Thursday night when they host Game 2.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if Jaylen Brown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s game-tying shot deserved the double \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bang\u00e2\u20ac from Mike Breen.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers have been repeatedly overlooked this postseason. The narrative surrounding their wins over the Milwaukee Bucks and New York Knicks focused much more on the failings of their more high-profile opponents than on whether Indiana was capable of making a deep run. So when the Pacers took the lead late in the fourth quarter in Game 1 of the conference finals against the Boston Celtics on Tuesday, it looked like it might finally be time to start talking about whether this was a team with legitimate title aspirations.\n\nAnd then the Pacers blew it.\n\nWith 47 seconds left in the fourth quarter, Andrew Nembhard made a nice step-back jumper over Al Horford that extended Indiana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead to 117\u00e2\u20ac\"114. It was the last good play the Pacers made on offense.\n\nThe collapse began when Tyrese Haliburton denied the Pacers a chance to add to their lead with an inexplicable turnover with 27 seconds left where he just lost his dribble while bringing the ball up the court.\n\nThe Celtics failed to capitalize on their ensuing possession, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry\u00e2\u20ac\"the Pacers gave them another chance. With 10 seconds left in regulation, an Indiana inbounds pass glanced off the hands of Pascal Siakam and out of bounds, giving the ball back to the Celtics for another chance to tie the game.\n\nThat set the stage for an unforgettable shot from Jaylen Brown, who tied the game with an off-balance three from the corner. Haliburton failed to get a clean look at a potential game-winner and the game went to overtime.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glzBXmcEl-U&ab_channel=NBA\n\nAfter such a disheartening conclusion to regulation, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perhaps not a surprise that the Pacers played terribly in the overtime period. They hit just two of their eight field goal attempts and turned the ball over three times\u00e2\u20ac\"including twice on back-to-back possessions in the final minute. The Celtics went on to win, 133\u00e2\u20ac\"128.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This loss is totally on me,\u00e2\u20ac Indiana coach Rick Carlisle told reporters after the game. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With 10 seconds in regulation, we should\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just taken the timeout, advanced the ball, found a way to get it in, made a free throw or two, and ended the game. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nLosing any game in the playoffs is tough to swallow, but blowing a game on the road against the top team in the conference is especially brutal for the Pacers. Going up 1\u00e2\u20ac\"0 and immediately seizing home-court advantage would have completely changed the tenor of the series. And Indiana played really well for the first 47 minutes of the game, especially during an 18\u00e2\u20ac\"4 run in the late third quarter and early fourth quarter in which it fought back from a 13-point deficit to take the lead. The Pacers had contributions from up and down their roster. Myles Turner had 23 points on 9-of-13 shooting. Obi Tobbin and T.J. McConnell provided an offensive spark off the bench. Pascal Siakam had 10 points on 5-of-6 shooting in the fourth quarter to help build the lead they eventually squandered.\n\nGame 1 suggested that this series may be more evenly matched than the two teams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 regular-season records might indicate. But after missing a golden opportunity to draw first blood, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be that much harder for the Pacers to win the series.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac| things I saw last night:\n\n5. The Celtics fans who left the game early and had to watch the rest of the game through the windows of a sports bar.\n\n4. Jazz Chisholm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aggressive baserunning to score from second on a bunt.\u00c2\n\n3. Cameron Brink\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two game-winning blocks.\n\n2.

It wasn't pretty, but a playoff win is a playoff win, and the Celtics have plenty to hold their heads high for after earning a 1-0 lead, which required an extra five minutes of high-intensity basketball.\n\n\"Nothing other than what I expected,\" Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla said after Boston's 131-126 overtime win. \"Two high-level teams competing for a great opportunity. So I expect all the games to be like that and its gonna be more of that. I thought both teams competed at a high level. For us, our guys -- obviously we weren't perfect, we can get better -- but I thought we maintained a level of poise, a level of mental toughness and just continue to work through some of the mistakes.\"\n\nHere are three takeaways from Celtics-Pacers Game 1:\n\n1. Boston's mental strength appeared just in time\n\nIn a panic mode situation, Boston didn't panic.\n\nThe Celtics had more time than any other playing in the conference finals, to rest and stay fresh, but Indiana ruled out any chance of the Boston walking off the court to a \"Ginto Time\" win. Indiana stuck around until the very end and cornered Boston which caused some fairweather fans in attendance to make their premature exits and miss out on what the team had in store.\n\nOnce Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton tuned over an in bounds play as the Celtics trailed, 117-114, with 27.1 seconds in regulation, Boston sensed an opportunity. Fast forward just over 20 seconds later and Jaylen Brown drained an unbelievable game-tying 3-pointer, sending Game 1 into overtime to reward the team's tenacity with new life.\n\n\"It definitely was a battle and we know what type of team they are,\"Jrue Holiday explained. \"They're never gonna give up and we've seen that, not only during the year, but especially through their playoff run. Just trying to be as consistent as possible on the boards and trying to stop them in transition.\"\n\n2. Jaylen Brown wasn't willing to settle for mediocrity in the semifinal round, and that was backed from the jump\n\nAfter the Celtics laid an egg in Game 2 of the semifinal round to the Cavaliers, Brown stepped up as the spokesperson of accountability.\n\n\"Defensively, it was an unacceptable performance,\" Brown said after Cleveland evened up the series, 1-1. \"I think that's where we look at that and I'm the most upset, and defensively we gave up 118 points. Then on top of that, we lost the rebound battle so we didn't help ourselves tonight.\"\n\nBoston's first points of the night came off a vicious poster-worthy dunk that instantly the crowd with its most energy shown throughout the playoffs.\n\nBrown didn't rely on the outside shot to add to Boston score totaling, understanding the importance of maintaining an efficient offensive momentum, althought when needed, a clutch equalizer was in the bag.\n\n\"Everybody was thinking the game was lost but when that shot goes in, now we got an opportunity again. That gave us a little bit of life,\" Brown said. \"I think that's fair to say. And we found a way to close it in OT.\"\n\n3. Aaron Nesmith wasn't welcomed back with open arms in Boston\n\nMatching up with the Pacers allowed ex-Celtics draftee Aaron Nesmith (14th overall in 2020) to return, on enemy lines, to Boston and square off against a few former teammates.\n\nYet, there were no hugs or smiles between Nesmith and the Celtics. Nesmith submitted his bid at Boston's third postseason enemy, following the footsteps of Miami's Caleb Martin and Cleveland's Max Strus.\n\nIn the second quarter, Nesmith connected on a layup and dropped the ball right in front of Jayson Tatum's chest, attempting to show up the Celtics star -- and that wasn't all. During the final minute of the third quarter, Nesmith drained a 3-pointer, cutting Boston's lead to 92-88, then walked directly up to Brown and stared the three-time All-Star down.\n\nNesmith finished with a game-high in boos while scoring 14 points in 40 minutes, proving once again, to be a minor threat if any at TD Garden.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gio_rivera@nesn.com", "name": "Gio Rivera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Strus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Strus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Big_Dig", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Big Dig", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://nesn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/05/Jaylen-Brown-and-Pascal-Siakam-.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

But Indiana wasn't able to put the final nail in Boston's coffin, and Joe Mazzulla's side escaped with an overtime triumph.\n\nPerkins, who on Monday predicted the Eastern Conference finals to go the full seven games, believes the wasted opportunity could have a serious impact on Indiana.\n\n\"I'm not saying that they won't but I don't know how the Pacers regroup from this one!

Mandatory Credit: David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Boston Celtics recently defended their home court with a scintillating 133-128 overtime victory against the Indiana Pacers. However, their joyous times ended abruptly when Jaylen Brown made a questionable remark regarding his teammate, Jayson Tatum. The instance caught the eyes of the NBA followers, raising eyebrows early into the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nSoon after the game's conclusion, Brown dissected the team's comeback win in overtime. In the process, the 27-year-old hilariously outlined Tatum's contributions as a major reason behind the victory. During a post-game interview, the 3x All-Star stated, \"JT finally woke up, and made some baskets\".\n\nHis comment aptly shed light on the difference-making output of Tatum. Despite struggling early on in the clash, the Celtics talisman registered a double-double of 36 points, and 12 rebounds on the night while spearheading a win for the team. It also marked his highest individual score in this season's playoffs, justifying Brown's statement.\n\nHowever, the underlying tone of mockery in Brown's words garnered the attention of the NBA fans. They united on X (formerly Twitter) to double down on his take, mocking Tatum further in the process. One of them even declared, \"Jaylen Brown always carries then Tatum gets the credit after throwing the game. It ALWAYS happens bro\".\n\nAnother supporter outlined the Celtics star's struggles to make his efforts count throughout the game, mentioning, \"JTs 4th quarter was abysmal. OT saved him from a lot of slander\".\n\nOne more fan extended this viewpoint, raising question marks over Tatum's current tags, stating, \"\"superstar\" \"top 5\" can't wake up the whole game\".\n\nUndoubtedly, Brown made those comments in the heat of the moment. Yet, his remarks do seem a tad harsh and ended up devaluing Tatum's status around the league to a certain extent.\n\nHowever, on the other end of things here, Tatum had nothing but nice things to say about his teammate and warmed Celtics fans' hearts with his statement.\n\nWith just six seconds left to play, Brown made a fading three-pointer from the corner to tie the game at 117-a-piece in the fourth quarter. It turned the Celtics' fortunes around, aiding in them winning the game in overtime. Highlighting this instance in the post-game conference, Tatum stated, \"Big-time players make big-time plays. That was a hell of a shot he made\".\n\nFollowing this, he even revealed his mindset throughout the game-winning overtime display, mentioning, \"That s*** was chaos...Just stay present, stay in the moment. As long as there's time still on the clock, the game is within reach. We feel like we have a chance\".\n\nTatum refused to let go of his composure even after registering an exciting win in Game 1. These contrasting displays in reaction from two of the biggest contributors to the team certainly unveiled two different competitive characters.\n\nAt the same time, Tatum likely won't read too much into Brown's lines considering just how close the two have been for years. This also captures how they have found common ground amongst themselves while continuing to share a similar goal.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sourav_bose@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Sourav Bose", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Bulldogs_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler Bulldogs men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/eb311fe8-untitled-design-2024-05-22t130003.826.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Per Inside The Celtics, Holiday commented on the sequence.\n\n\"Saw Jaylen wide open. Sometimes, plays like that, it's kind of hard to see both sides, but saw one side, looked at the other side, and Jaylen was wide open. It was a great shot, he pretty much did everything.\"\n\nCeltics head coach Joe Mazzulla praised both Brown and Derrick White for their execution during the play.\n\n\"Yeah, it was a great, well-executed play by the guys. You just create, kind of, indecision. We were able to maintain it. And I thought D-White set a great screen, I thought Jaylen had a great foul. Great pass, great shot. So, just a well-executed play by the guys. Good situational awareness, situational execution.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4235,h_2382,x_0,y_535/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_celtics/01hyf8js5fr97mq03b72.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

The Celtics are taking on the Indiana Pacers in the conference finals. Indiana possesses stout role-player depth but so does Boston. Former Celtics player Eddie House revealed who Boston's prized contributor is, and his name is not Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum.\n\nHouse joined the NBC Sports Boston crew to reveal his thoughts on the battle of role players between Boston and Indiana.\n\n\"I don't want to hear about TJ McConnell...I actually wanna see Payton Pritchard go to work on him, if you keep it real with me...I know who the real dawg is and that's Payton Pritchard,\" House told the NBC Sports crew, The Celtics Files.\n\nEddie House has a point. Payton Pritchard is an offensive weapon who can make a big impact. Pritchard had a career year during the 2023-24 regular season. The 26-year-old averaged 9.6 points, 3.4 assists, and 3.2 rebounds per contest and played all 82 games, all of which were career highs. In addition, he shot an earnest 38.5 percent on three-pointers.\n\nPritchard will not hesitate to attack the Pacers' defense if given the opportunity. Thankfully, he has stout help from his teammates Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. The star duo has been vital to Boston's regular season and playoffs success.\n\nJayson Tatum has averaged 24.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, and 5.8 assists through 10 2024 postseason games. The 26-year-old is one of the driving forces behind Boston's dominance. However, the team would not be where they are without Jaylen Brown.\n\nBrown averages 23.1 points, 6.6 rebounds, 2.5 assists, and 0.7 steals through 10 playoff games. Outside of Payton Pritchard and Tatum, Brown might be the one who takes the Celtics over the hump.\n\nCeltics want to continue to exemplify two-way greatness\n\nJaylen Brown takes great pride on the defensive side of the ball, an attribute that greatly helps the Celtics. One of Brown's best performances of the 2023-24 season came against Zion Williamson and the New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nWilliamson amassed scored 25 points in New Orleans' 104-92 loss to the Celtics. Yet, nothing came easy for him. Brown played all-around hounding defense on Williamson and expressed his enthusiasm for tough matchups like the slashing forward.\n\n\"I feel like [being a versatile defender] is something my team relies on me to do now. So I take it with honor and responsibility. [Williamson] was my matchup, and I wanted to make sure we made it tough on him, and I think we did,\" Brown said, per Celtics on NBC Sports.\n\nBrown recognized Williamson for his strength, explosiveness, and craftiness around the basket, saying \"You don't see a lot of guys like Zion in the world.\"\n\nHe said Williamson's attributes were the reasons one needs to be able to hold their ground and be quick enough to stay in front of the star forward. Brown rose to the challenge and gave the Pelicans star a tough time throughout the night. He made sure everyone knew that he was not backing down.\n\n\"In that moment, I was letting him know, letting everyone else in the gym know, I'm not going anywhere. I'm strong enough to hold my ground,\" Brown added.\n\nBrown and his teammates want to continue to do everything they can on defense to help the Celtics defeat the Pacers and reach the NBA Finals.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_smith@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Christopher Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_House", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eddie House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payton_Pritchard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Payton Pritchard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Pelicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Pelicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zion_Williamson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zion Williamson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Celtics-news-Eddie-House-identifies-Bostons-real-dawg-and-its-not-Jayson-Tatum-or-Jaylen-Brown.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

So far, Joe Mazzulla's roster has looked incredibly tough to beat. Boston's losses have been based on its performance rather than anything its opponent has done differently.\n\nBoston only lost 18 games during the regular season.

Jaylen Brown's improbable 3-pointer from the left corner with 5.7 seconds left in regulation sent the game to overtime. And in the extra session Jayson Tatum shook off an uneven stretch and put the finishing touches on Boston's 133-128 win.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, though, Mazzulla pointed out that the Celtics might have avoided that predicament altogether if they'd executed more cleanly at the end of the first and third quarters.\n\n\"After losses in close games, I've said that the end of the game isn't any more or less important than the beginning of the game,\" Mazzulla said. \"And so I'll say it again, like, they outscored us by four at the end of the first quarter. They outscored us by 12 at the end of the third quarter. And so those are the things that you have to work on before you even get to that situation. And that's why we were in that situation, because of the detriment at the end of the quarters, which is something that they take advantage of.\"\n\nThe Celtics led, 34-26, with less than a minute left in the first quarter when Indiana's Pascal Siakam found Obi Toppin at the top of the key on a dribble handoff. Toppin was well beyond the arc, but he is also a 40 percent 3-point shooter.\n\nTatum and Jrue Holiday had a brief moment of miscommunication while determining how to account for Toppin, and the forward drilled the 3-pointer.\n\nThe ball went through the net with 42 seconds left, putting the Celtics in their sweet spot for the two-for-one chance they typically stalk. Ideally, they want to take the first shot with about 32 seconds to play, guaranteeing themselves a decent look at the end of the quarter.\n\nBut in this case, Holiday brought the ball up slowly and fired a crosscourt pass toward Sam Hauser that was easily intercepted by Toppin. The Celtics were a step slow in their rotations during the ensuing possession, and Siakam ultimately found Toppin for an easy layup.\n\nIf this mini 5-0 burst had been reversed, the Celtics would have taken a 13-point lead to the second quarter. Instead, their advantage had been whittled to 3.\n\n\"I thought at the end of the first quarter, end of the third quarter, I think we had five turnovers, three or four of them live-ball, which gave them opportunities,\" Mazzulla said. \"I thought when we were spaced properly, when we had great screens, I thought we got really good looks.\"\n\nIn the third quarter, the Celtics held a 92-81 lead with just over two minutes left. A powerful close could have given them control of the game.\n\nBut Boston missed three consecutive 3-pointers, as it failed to score and also helped ignite transition chances for the relentless Pacers. Two missed free throws by Brown did not help, either.\n\nWith 13 seconds left, Pacers guard T.J. McConnell slithered into the lane and converted an off-balance runner. The Celtics could have held the ball for the final shot, but that opportunity evaporated when Sam Hauser was called for an illegal screen.\n\nThere was plenty of luck involved when Tyrese Haliburton double-clutched and banked in a 3-pointer at the buzzer that pulled his team within 94-93.

For three quarters on Tuesday Tatum was brilliant, collecting points (22) and rebounds (8), all while shooting a tidy 53%. In the fourth Tatum went cold, missing five of his seven shots. He missed his first three in overtime before the early game touch returned: a three-point play gave Boston a one-point lead over Indiana and a top of the key three pushed it to four, sealing the Celtics 133-128 Game 1 win.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m so glad we won the game,\u00e2\u20ac said Tatum. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because I would have been sick.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nSick, and crucified, at least publicly. Tatum has had a target on his back this postseason, a bullseye for pundits from Bristol to L.A. His numbers (25.4 points, 10.5 rebounds, 5.6 assists) are good, but not good enough. His team is 9\u00e2\u20ac\"2, but unlike Nikola Joki\u00c4\u2021, Luka Don\u00c4i\u00c4\u2021 and the rest of Tatum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peers, he is seen as more a tire on the car than the engine. Had Boston not pulled out a win on Tuesday, Tatum would have awoken Wednesday to his name chyroned all over cable TV.\n\nThey almost didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. In its first conference finals in ten years, Indiana came to play. A 12-point Boston lead in the first quarter was erased by halftime. A 13-point Celtics lead in the third was whittled to one going into the fourth. Each time Boston put together a run to whip the TD Garden crowd into a frenzy, Indiana responded.\n\nWith ten seconds left in the fourth the Pacers clung to a three-point lead. But an inbounds pass tipped off the hands of Pascal Siakam, giving Boston one more chance. In the huddle, Joe Mazzulla drew up a play for Jaylen Brown. As Brown emerged, he told himself, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going in. Jrue Holiday found Brown in the corner. With Siakam in his chest, Brown knocked down a game-tying three.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This loss is totally on me,\u00e2\u20ac said Indiana head coach Rick Carlisle. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With ten seconds in regulation, we should have just taken the timeout, advance the ball and found a way to get it in and made a free throw or two and ended the game.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nIndiana was expected by many to be little more than cannon fodder against Boston, but Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effort served notice: The Pacers are here to win. Tyrese Haliburton (25 points, 10 assists) was brilliant, Siakam (24 points, 12 rebounds) too, while Myles Turner terrorized the Celtics from three. Indiana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bench\u00e2\u20ac\"a strength the whole postseason\u00e2\u20ac\"outscored Boston\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 30\u00e2\u20ac\"13, forcing Mazzulla to extend each of his starters to 40-plus minutes per game.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We got to match their intensity if we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to win this series,\u00e2\u20ac said Brown.\n\nThere is pressure on Boston to win this series, pressure to win a championship. Denver is out, leaving the Celtics as the most experienced team left standing. All the excuses Boston fell back on before, from age to inexperience to better teams in front of them, are gone now. The Celtics have elite defenders (Jrue Holiday, Derrick White), skilled wings (Tatum, Brown) and an ageless big man (Al Horford) who continues to produce. Indiana is good, but really\u00e2\u20ac\"even without Kristaps Porzi\u00c5\u2020\u00c4\u00a3is, Boston has advantages everywhere.\n\nThat includes Tatum. Few players possess Tatum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s combination of size and skill\u00e2\u20ac\"and fewer are under more pressure. For seven years Tatum has racked up the individual accolades, the All-Stars and All-NBAs, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all meaningless now. Entering this postseason, Tatum told people around him: This is our chance. The Celtics are loaded, connected, built to win. Said one person close to Tatum, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He is obsessed with winning a title.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nAgainst Indiana, Tatum showed the resolve needed to do it. Late in overtime, Tatum turned it over, a miscommunication with Holiday that ended with White fouling Haliburton on a three-point attempt. At the free throw line, Holiday tapped Tatum. Stay aggressive, he said. With just over a minute left, Tatum drove into T.J. McConnell, finishing a layup through contact. On the next possession, he knocked down a step back three.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It's as simple as just believing that the next one is going in,\u00e2\u20ac said Tatum. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And I always feel like I'm one make away from being hot or being in a great rhythm. So taking the right shots, playing within the flow of the game and doing all the other necessary things to impact the game.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nSaid Mazzulla, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He just plays with a level of poise and a level of comfort knowing that the next one has got a chance to go.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nTatum shrugs off questions about external criticism because, really, he puts far more pressure on himself. The sound of Golden State celebrating its 2022 championship in the Garden still haunts him and there will always be what-ifs with Game 7 of last season\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference finals, in which Tatum was injured on the opening play. At 26, Tatum knows he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaching that championship-or-bust stage, and he needs no reminder.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We won a big time game,\u00e2\u20ac said Tatum. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Series is far from over. Got to come back and play well enough to win again on Thursday. I'm not trying to prove anything individually. I know the ultimate goal is to try to win a championship, but one step at a time.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nIndeed. While the roars from a giddy home crowd rolled down Causeway St., inside Boston\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s locker room the celebration was far more muted. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one down, three to go and experience has taught the Celtics that it only gets tougher. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This core group has been in so many big time games, big time moments,\u00e2\u20ac said Tatum. The hope is, they will be in a few more.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "\u00c2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

However, always contained in that instruction to foul is the caveat to not do it if the opposing player with the ball seems to be entering his shooting motion.\n\nAnd that, Carlisle said, was why All-Star forward Pascal Siakam did not foul Celtics All-NBA wing Jaylen Brown when he caught the inbound pass in the left corner. Brown ended up draining a 3-pointer with 5.7 seconds to go to tie the game at 117 and force overtime and the Celtics eventually won 133-128 in the extra period.\n\n\"He caught the ball and he was face-up so Pascal decided to lay off,\" Carlisle said. \"I understand that's probably the right decision. You don't want to give up the four-point play.\"\n\nDoyel: Pacers could've won - should've won - Game 1 in Boston. Bodes well for future, right?\n\nSiakam confirmed Carlisle's version of events. Siakam was screened by Celtics guard Derrick White before Brown caught the pass, which held him up on the way to get to Brown. By the time he arrived, he thought Brown was ready to shoot. Brown pump-faked first but then hit the 3.\n\n\"I wanted to foul as soon as I got to him, but I was a little late because of the screen,\" Siakam said. \"He acted like he was going up, so I didn't want to do it. When I thought I was going to do it, it was too little too late. It's one of those where if you have an opportunity to do it, you do it, but it's just a judgment call. I felt like he was going to his motion. He had a pump fake, I didn't want to foul then. And it's a tough shot and I was in front of him. Maybe I could have contested it better, but it's just a tough call.\"\n\nOne way the Pacers might have been able to keep themselves out of that situation would have been to switch the screens, but there would have been some risk in that decision, too. Pacers point guard T.J. McConnell was guarding Derrick White, so he would've had to make the switch. As it happened, McConnell almost certainly would have been able to commit the foul before Brown got into his shooting motion. But the Pacers would have had to commit to that strategy before the play. Brown is 6-6, Siakam is 6-8, McConnell is 6-1, and if McConnell didn't arrive in time to foul, Brown would've had a clean look at the basket with his height advantage.\n\nSiakam was better built to contest, but Brown still made the shot anyway.", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

They are up 1-0 in the ECF against the Pacers, which beat the NY Knicks in seven games to draw the match-up against the Celts. On the 'Mind the Game pod', JJ Redick and LeBron James previewed the ECF and highlighted the Boston Celtics' ability to employ multiple ball-handlers and knock down deep-range jumpers.\n\nThey fantasized about a Knicks-Celtics match-up in the ECF and made deep observations about the squads' offensive schemes.\n\nJames remarked that the Knicks just have their leader Jalen Brunson as the one initiating the offense, while the Celtics are blessed with Jrue Holiday, Derrick White, Jayson Tatum, and Jaylen Brown who are nightmares to deal with in crunch-time situations.\n\n\"From half-court standpoint, Jalen Brunson has the ball 97% of the time. Boston have four guys in their starting lineup who can handle the ball so you can't just hide, you can't point switch because they have multiple guys who can get them into the offense and also make plays either you fu**ed up a switch or a closeout game,\" LeBron James told JJ Redick.\n\nLBJ emphasized that having those four arrows in their quiver enables the Celtics to prevail in clutch situations as the defense can't afford to be loose on any one of them. Even if the defense disrupts the initial play, they can always reset and work a fresh way to accumulate late-game points.\n\nAdditionally, he pointed out that they attempt as many as 45 triples which is nightmarish for the defense. This ability was in full display during their OT win in the first ECF game against the uptempo Pacers.\n\nAs LeBron James predicted, the Celts attempted 45 triples in Game 1 and clicked on 15 of those attempts. This game turned into an instant classic as the Celtics pinched out a 133-128 OT Win. In the fourth quarter, the Pacers were up 117-114 with around 8 seconds to go but then Jaylen Brown blasted a three-pointer to force an Overtime.\n\nIn the OT, Celtics' leading scorer Jayson Tatum took charge and scored 10 of his team's 16 points to close the book on Tyrese Haliburton and Co. Derrick White also made a crucial lay-up with around 27 seconds left in the game and Jrue Holiday played his part through some sizzling passing and late-game free-throws.\n\nAs James pointed out, the Celtics quartet showed up big in the clutch and the Pacers couldn't capitalize on the chance to steal a game from the #1 seed in the East. The Celtics are looking to repeat what they did in 2008, moreover, with all the criticism around JT and his legacy, he needs a ring on his resume.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shubham_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Shubham Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clutch (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Shedding_and_Accumulating", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Shedding and Accumulating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/60d79711-untitled-design-2024-05-22t232719.799.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Yet, it was hard not to wonder after the basket whether Brown should have been allowed to take the shot to begin with. With Indiana nursing a 3-point lead and eight seconds left in regulation, fouling is the usual play to ensure a team does not have a chance to tie the game with one shot.\n\nRick Carlisle confirmed after the loss that was the Pacers' intention on the play. However, Joe Mazzulla used a bit of craftiness to force the Pacers and Pascal Siakam into a bind. Jaylen Brown set a screen and then had a delayed one set for him by Derrick White as he curled into the corner. Jrue Holiday found him with the pass after a slight delay on the inbounds and that left Siakam in a tough situation with Brown already entering his gather in the corner.\n\n\"It looked like he was going up, so I didn't want to (foul him),\" Siakam said. \"When I thought I was going to do (foul him), it was too little, too late.\"\n\nThe hesitation by Siakam allowed Brown to get off a cleaner look and make his first 3-point attempt of the game to force overtime.\n\n\"Before the inbound I was talking to myself,\" Brown said. \"'If I get this shot, it's going in.' I was telling myself the whole time, you get it, it's going up and it's going in. I happened to create some space on the backside and was able to make a big-time play. So we've got to be able to channel our emotions, move onto the next, and get ready to Game 2.\"\n\nJoe Mazzulla tried to downplay his role after the win but the play call was a savvy choice by the second year coach to put the Pacers in a bind while creating a shot opportunity.\n\n\"it was a very well-executed play by the guys to create kind of indecision,\" Mazzulla said. \"We were maintaining. I thought D-White set a great screen, I thought Jaylen had great balance. Great pass, great shot. So just a well-executed play by the guys. Good situational awareness, and good execution.\"\n\nIt was far from a perfect game for Mazzulla and the Celtics. Boston's bench struggled in long stretches and the team was not sharp enough at points defensively. However, when it mattered most, Mazzulla got the best of veteran coach Rick Carlisle with his late-game management. The Pacers coach put the blame on himself as Indiana coughed up two turnovers late in regulation that could have led to game-clinching free throws.\n\n\"This loss is totally on me,\" Carlisle said. \"With 10 seconds to go in regulation, we should have just taken the timeout, advanced the ball, found a way to get it in, made a free throw or two, and ended the game. But, it didn't happen.\"\n\nBrown will get the limelight for his clutch make but a savvy play call created the opening for an improbable comeback, making this victory a true team win for Boston.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clutch (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-out_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Time-out (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.masslive.com/resizer/v2/IQW5CQ4OCVA5XIJU5TCSRRJJR4.jpg?auth=5e1eeeb39ad07e1255259e8795bc55817fd354f5951d0cf94889b51b27ac1e32&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

Was this the shot the Celtics were going to take to keep alive their hopes of claiming Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals after frittering away a fat early lead?\n\nWas there maybe, hopefully, a Plan B that Brown could put into play? Might he go rogue? Cuz Plan A was looking iffy before the shot was made, and with less than six seconds remaining, the Celtics down by 3, this was likely going to be their last chance.\n\nBut know this: Not for one-tenth of one second did it ever occur to Brown to try something else. What's that line, failure is not an option? In this case, doing anything other than taking an awkward 3-point attempt was not an option. And so, as Siakam clamped his arms by his side to avoid contact, Brown took that awkward, backward-falling shot and hit nothing but net with 5.7 seconds remaining.\n\nIt was Brown's first 3-pointer of the night. The Celtics had a tie game. In overtime they emerged with a 133-128 victory in Game 1, though there were some dicey moments right til the end.\n\nBut when it was all over, finally, that's when Brown said, in so many words, no. As in, no way was he going to miss that shot. No, there was no Plan B. He was going to make the shot, and that's that.\n\n\"Before, I was just talking to myself, if I get this shot, it's going in,\" Brown said. \"I was telling myself the whole time, if you get it, it's going up and going in.\n\n\"I created some space on the back side and was able to make a big-time play,\" he said.\n\nHe got the ball because Jrue Holiday passed him the ball. As Brown said, \"Jrue made a great pass ... and the rest was history.\"\n\nOr, as Holiday put it, downplaying his contribution, \"He pretty much did everything.\"\n\nWell, no. Holiday made the pass he needed to make, and Brown made the shot he needed to make. Let's be clear about that. But it's what Brown said after complimenting Holiday that bears repeating. It's that part about history.\n\nIt's Brown's shot that was history, is history. Not as in, that's history, we're on to Game 2, but as in, that's a play Celtics fans are going to be talking about for years.\n\nWe'll have plenty of time to talk about Game 2. Let's stay with Game 1, and that shot that shattered the Pacers' dream of escaping with a victory in regulation.\n\nAnd to fully understand that shot, and to fully appreciate it, and since Brown wants to talk about history, how about we bring in some historical context?\n\nThis is the Eastern Conference finals, right? That means it's the hurdle a team must clear before it can play for a championship. In that spirit, if this ends with the Celtics winning it all, what Brown did in Game 1 Tuesday night was akin to Bruins goalie Tim Thomas practically throwing his stick across the crease to rob Steve Downie of a goal in Game 5 of the 2011 Eastern Conference finals. It was Dave Roberts setting the stage for a Red Sox victory by stealing second base in Game 3 of the 2004 ALCS. It was the 2001 Patriots making it clear to the Pittsburgh Steelers they meant business when Troy Brown returned a punt 55 yards for a touchdown in the first quarter of the AFC Championship Game.\n\nBrown's shot gets a seat at that table. Had he missed it, had the Celtics lost, we're talking two days of this being yet anther edition of the Jayson Tatum-Jaylen Brown Celtics not being up to the moment. It's been a weird postseason for the Celtics, who, after easily dispatching the Miami Heat and then easily dispatching the Cleveland Cavaliers, have been looked upon as a team that's on an \"easy road\" to the NBA Finals. By winning a tough Game 1, and winning it after blowing the big lead, and winning it because Brown made the shot that put them in a position to win, it adds up to a display of mettle that critics said they didn't have.\n\nYou generally don't get to register \"statement\" victories when you own the best record in the NBA and you're in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals. You're home. You're favored. The expectation is that you'll win. But what we have here is a statement game by a team with the best record in the NBA, this because they blew a lead, fell behind, were on the cusp of losing, and then tied the game on a shot that looked improbable to everybody except for the guy that took it.\n\n\"I feel like the Pacers came out and played extremely well,\" Brown said. \"They played with pace, they played with force. And they made it tough on us. They made a lot of baskets in transition. We just have to match their intensity. We have to be the harder-playing team. We have to sprint back. It's a different series and we've got adjust.\n\n\"We will,\" Brown said. \"We'll be ready to go.\"\n\nThat's Game 2 stuff.

Jrue Holiday became the latest teammate to praise Porzingis for remaining engaged despite being inactive.\n\nBut the Latvian native's return to the lineup is inching closer. On ESPN's NBA Countdown, Adrian Wojnarowski reported, \"I'm told that he is also going to miss Game 2 in Boston. But when this series returns to Indiana, I'm told that Porzingis could return as soon as Game 4 on Monday.\"\n\nThat will be 28 days from when Porzingis suffered a soleus strain in his right calf during the first half of the Celtics' Game 4 win over the Heat.\n\nAccording to Jeff Stotts, a certified athletic trainer and an injury analyst for SMART and Rotowire, the average time lost to a soleus strain is roughly 17 days, which loosely translates to six games.\n\nBoston remains cautious about the seven-foot-three center's return, with him voicing a few days after his injury, \"I'm doing everything I can to speed it up because I want to be back out there as soon as possible,\" before adding, \"I'm understanding that the worst thing would be, probably, to reaggravate that.\"\n\nBut Porzingis returning in Game 4 against the Pacers seems like a realistic target date for when he'll rejoin the Celtics' playoff run.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nAaron Nesmith Left Lasting

In this conference-clinching NBA Playoffs series against the Indiana Pacers, Kendrick Perkins posits that there will be certain things expected out of Jayson Tatum. Why? It is largely because this is one of his few shots to enter basketball immortality.\n\nA mission for Jayson Tatum\n\nThe Celtics are probably the most balanced squad that entered the NBA Playoffs. Coach Joe Mazzulla's system does not necessitate any player to average 40 points for the series. This is probably going to hold true in the Eastern Conference Finals too. Jaylen Brown, Derrick White, Jrue Holiday, and Al Horford have all shown the ability to lead their team in every way. However, Kendrick Perkins suggests that one person in the Celtics system should take the lead over the others, via NBA on ESPN.\n\n\"Well, who has the key? Jayson Tatum. Is he going to drive the car? When we think about Jayson Tatum and all the players that are still in the league, all of the stars, Anthony Edwards, Luka, Kyrie, Tyrese Haliburton, they don't need Jayson Tatum to be the star. They need him to be the sun,\" the analyst and former player said.\n\nThe five-time All-Star has been knocking his shots at a 43% clip from all three levels of scoring. He notches 24.3 points throughout these NBA Playoffs. There is clearly something holding him back and that is his outside stroke. His shots from way out only see the bottom of the net 28.1% of the time which is not at all good. Regardless, Kendrick Perkins is still imbibing the star to take up the mission and climb the summit of greatness.\n\n\"Do you know two things about the sun? It's going to shine brightly and damn it, it's hot. They need him to be the sun because, look, it's not about All-Stars or All-NBA teams when it comes to putting on a Celtics uniform. Especially when you're that guy, you want to join the likes of Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Havlicek, and Larry Bird,\" he added.\n\nEntering the Celtics Pantheon\n\nThe task of being the primary option on both ends of the floor can be tough. But, it is nothing that the third pick of the 2017 draft can't handle. After all, he is averaging nearly a steal and block per game. So, the pursuit of being part of the greatest Celtics of all time in this NBA Playoffs run might not be too steep. A definitive step towards that goal is definitely trampling over an inexperienced Pacers squad.\n\n\"You know what that is? Celtics royalty. That's what you want to be cemented, Celtics royalty. That is completing the mission. Jayson Tatum has all the pieces, can he please take over the entire series for once? Us sitting us here saying he's the best player in the postseason,\" Perkins concluded.\n\nTatum does not need to produce a 40-piece every night unlike Doncic, Edwards, Karl-Anthony Towns, or anyone else. He just needs to get his shots up more efficiently while also not making his team lose their rhythm against the Pacers.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_postrado@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jay Postrado", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Perkins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Perkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_on_ESPN", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA on ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Havlicek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Havlicek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Perkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Perkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Garnett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Garnett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Celtics-news-What-Jayson-Tatum-must-do-to-fuel-Boston-vs.-Pacers-per-Kendrick-Perkins.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

The five-time All-Star was expecting Jrue Holiday to roll out after setting a pick near half-court, but Tatum ended up floating the basketball right to Tyrese Haliburton. The Indiana star raced up court, was fouled on a 3-point attempt and knocked down a trio from the free-throw line to give the visitors a two-point edge.\n\nFortunately for Tatum, Boston was more buttoned up from there and logged a 133-128 win in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals. After the series opener, the 26-year-old opened up about his mistake that could've doomed the C's.\n\n\"I'm so glad we won the game because I would have been sick,\" Tatum told reporters, per MassLive. \"That play was some miscommunication. We just talked about afterward and thought that I was going to come off the screen. I thought that they would corral him and double him. I thought he was going to slip.

Smith was not among those giving Boston praise.\n\nIn fact, Smith was \"disgusted\" by how Boston performed in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals. The Celtics didn't play as poorly as they did in previous playoff losses to the Miami Heat and the Cleveland Cavaliers, but the \"First Take\" co-host still was discouraged to see a team with legitimate championship aspirations play below its ability on a big stage.\n\nSmith was specifically disappointed in Boston's offense, which he thought was \"awful\" against the pesky Indiana Pacers. The former NBA beat reporter also believes Jayson Tatum and company have suffered on the offensive end of the court since transitioning from Ime Udoka to Joe Mazzulla. In fact, Smith thinks the Celtics already would have hung an 18th championship banner at TD Garden if Udoka still was at the helm on Causeway Street.\n\nYou can listen to Smith's full take on the Celtics' latest postseason effort in the video here.\n\nSmith wasn't the only ESPN analyst who thought Boston was fortunate to extend its playoff win streak to four games. Former NBA guard Jay Williams believes the Celtics would be in a 0-1 hole in the best-of-seven series had it not been for a \"legendary choke job\" from the Pacers.\n\nBoston will try to log a more convincing win Thursday night when it hosts Indiana for Game 2.

They ask how many, and the Boston Celtics are now just seven wins away from their 18th NBA title after a 133-128 overtime win over the Indiana Pacers in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nBoston jumped out to a 14-2 lead in the first quarter, and it appeared as though a blowout was inevitable. That's when the Pacers threw a counterpunch and managed to tie the game at 64 heading into halftime\n\nIndiana even led by as many as five points in the fourth quarter, but the Celtics were able to make some big plays down the stretch to send the game to overtime. None were bigger than Jaylen Brown's 3-pointer with six seconds remaining to even the score at 117.\n\nThat 3-point shot was the only one Brown made as he finished with 26 points on the night.Jayson Tatum led all scorers with 36 points, and he also recorded a game-high 12 rebounds.Jrue Holiday came up big for Boston, shooting 50% from beyond the arc and totaling 28 points.\n\nOur own Brad Botkin has key takeaways from the Celtics' victory, and keep up with all the the NBA postseason results with our updated playoff bracket/tracker here.\n\n\ud83d\udc4d Honorable mentions Phillies star Bryce Harper helped with a prom-posal that got the easiest \"yes\" of all-time.Sparks rookies Cameron Brink and Rickea Jackson threw out the first pitch at the Dodgers game.Caitlin Clark became the first women's player ever to receive a signature basketball after inking a deal with Wilson.The NFL will finally experiment with optical tracking for line-to-gain rulings this fall.Barry Bonds is getting inducted into the Pirates Hall of Fame in August.Ralph Moody, Ricky Rudd and Carl Edwards will be inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame.Takeru Kobayashi, a six-time Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest champion, has announced his retirement.The race for the AL West is murky, but luckily for you, our own Mike Axisa is here to make sense of it. \ud83c\udfc0 And not such a good morning for ...\n\nTHE INDIANA PACERS\n\nOn the other end of the court, the Pacers let a golden opportunity slip through their hands in Game 1, and they might wind up regretting it.\n\nIn the final 30 seconds of regulation, Indiana saw a three-point lead melt away due to some critical mistakes. Tyrese Haliburton and Andrew Nembhard both committed brutal turnovers, and the Pacers let Jaylen Brown get open for a 3-pointer on an in-bounds play.\n\nOn the whole, the Pacers committed 22 turnovers, and the Celtics scored 21 points off those turnovers. Our own Sam Quinn put together a blueprint for how the Pacers can pull off the upset in this series -- and spoiler alert -- coughing up the ball at key times was not in there.\n\nQuinn: \"When the Pacers knocked the Celtics out of the In-Season Tournament, they did so by winning the turnover battle by a +13 margin. Turnovers help the Pacers stick to their own fast pace and get the sort of easy shots they can't always generate in the half-court.\"\n\nIf the Pacers are looking for a silver lining here, it might be that they had a minus-7 turnover margin and yet they still managed to get overtime. Well, that and the fact Celtics have lost Game 2 at home in the previous two rounds.\n\n\ud83d\udc4e Not so honorable mentions The injury bug keeps hitting the Red Sox ... now pitcher Garrett Whitlock might need surgery.Cubs pitcher Kyle Hendricks has been moved to the bullpen after a dreadful start to the season.Lamelo Ball and the Hornets are being sued by a mother who claims the star ran over her son's foot.Speaking of lawsuits, Georgia QB Jaden Rashada is suing Florida and Billy Napier over a failed NIL deal said to be worth $13.85 million. \ud83c\udfc8 Jets giving Rodgers a chance to stay upright this fall\n\nIf the New York Jets are going to compete for a Super Bowl next season, their offensive line has to keep Aaron Rodgers on his feet.\n\nGM Joe Douglas made that position a priority in the offseason, and he has used every possible avenue to make sure the 40-year-old Rodgers stays out of the training room. Here's a summary of their moves so far this offseason:\n\nTraded for Ravens RT Morgan MosesSigned Ravens G John SimpsonSigned Cowboys LT Tyron SmithDrafted Penn State OT Olu Fashanu at No. 11 overall\n\nNot only is keeping the heat off Rodgers important for his health, but it should also positively impact his performance. Our own Douglas Clawson explains Rodgers' transformation when facing pressure.\n\nClawson: \"It's critical as Rodgers obviously isn't a spry chicken anymore and his declining numbers against pressure in recent years show it. From 2021-22, he ranked third in EPA per play when NOT pressured, but 25th when he is pressured. That's a Jekyll and Hyde act similar to turning Josh Allen into Mac Jones in terms of caliber of play.\"\n\nRegardless of what happens with the offensive line, the Jets have to feel fortunate that Rodgers is back for 2024. According to Rodgers, he was weighing a career change from football to politics this offseason.\n\n\ud83c\udfc0 2024 NBA Combine risers, fallers\n\nThe next crop of NBA stars spent the last week in Chicago showing front offices what they've got at the NBA Combine. Let's just say it went better for some players than others.\n\nAs is usually the case, a couple of players got in front of the scouts and popped. That was the case with Providence point guard Devin Carter. He topped our own Kyle Boone's list of risers and fallers after flashing some elite explosiveness.\n\nBoone: \"If there was an award for most swaggy player in attendance, he would've been the unanimous winner. He tied for first in the max standing vertical leap at 42 inches, broke an NBA Draft Combine record in the \u00be court sprint and flashed the competitive drive and dazzle that keyed his Big East Player of the Year season at Providence in front of NBA decision-makers.\"\n\nIn his junior season with the Friars, Carter averaged 19.7 points, 8.7 rebounds and 3.6 assists per game. He's now up to No. 9 on Boone's Big Board.\n\nNot every player made the same kind of positive impression that Carter did. Kentucky standout Kenny Dillingham has fallen out of Boone's top 10 after he measured in at 6-foot-1 and 164.2 pounds -- not ideal for a top NBA Draft prospect.\n\nAlso, there were mixed reviews about Bronny James in Chicago, but he came out ahead. The son of LeBron James, Bronny has now cracked the top 60 of Boone's rankings, making him a second-round option.\n\n\ud83c\udfd2 NHL conference finals previews, expert picks\n\nOnly four teams are left standing in the battle for the Stanley Cup. The New York Rangers and Florida Panthers will do battle in the East, and the Dallas Stars and Edmonton Oilers will face off out West.\n\nThe Rangers and Panthers should produce a long and highly competitive series. That's certainly how our experts see it, with both predicting a Game 7 ... and the Panthers getting it done. As Chris Bengel explains, Florida has already shown a lot of perseverance.\n\nBengel: \"This is likely going to be a very physical, tight series that will feature plenty of offensive outbursts. When push comes to shove, the Panthers are the team that I think has the mettle to persevere after being pushed to their limit against the Lightning and Bruins in the first two rounds.\"\n\nIn the West, the matchup between the Stars and Oilers might come down to Dallas' goaltending edge, which I note in my preview.\n\nNivison: \"The Stars have a bona fide No. 1 goaltender in Jake Oettinger, and the Oilers had to split minutes in their previous series between Stuart Skinner and Calvin Pickard. Oettinger has a .918 save percentage in the playoffs. Skinner and Pickard have combined for a .888 save percentage. If those trends continue, the Oilers will be in trouble.\"\n\nThe Rangers and Panthers get started tonight. Game 1 between the Stars and Oilers is set for Thursday. Keep track of the full schedule with our complete NHL playoffs bracket.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa What we're watching Wednesday\n\n\u26be Mariners at Yankees, 7:05 p.m. on ESPN+\n\n\ud83c\udfd2 Game 1: Panthers

No more taking an opponent lightly for mystifying stretches, kicking back and watching a big lead evaporate in two minutes, or struggling to execute close and late.\n\nIt's tempting to say they're fixed after Jaylen Brown's corner 3 forced overtime, where Jayson Tatum's heroics won it. But if we've learned anything even in the best of times over the last seven years, it's that nothing comes easily, and that momentum is only as good as your next barrage of missed 3-pointers or inexplicably careless turnovers.\n\nWe've seen the Celtics \"get it\" before, only to lose it in short order. Until they hang Banner 18, we are justified in maintaining a healthy skepticism even for Game 2 vs. the Pacers, with recent history as our guide.\n\nGo back to 2018, Tatum's rookie year, and recall that upstart team blowing out LeBron James and the Cavs in the first two games of the conference finals. Bring on the Warriors! The Cavs promptly returned the favor in Cleveland, the C's won Game 5, and then Boston blew two chances to close out the favorites, including a lead with six minutes left in Game 7 at home.\n\nOr jump to the bubble in 2020, when the Celtics were less than a second away from taking a 3-0 lead on the Raptors. OG Anunoby drilled a 3 at the buzzer and a series that looked like a sweep instead went seven grueling games.\n\nOr how about 2022 against Milwaukee, when the Celtics blew a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter of Game 5, but still led by one with 14 seconds left after Giannis Antetokounmpo missed a free throw? Bobby Portis put back the rebound and a rousing win became an impossible loss. The Celtics went to Milwaukee with a chance to be eliminated, but Tatum dropped 46 and then Grant Williams went off in Game 7. We can still feel the whiplash.\n\nOr hell, let's not forget every round last year, when the Celtics let the woebegone Hawks send that series back to Atlanta for Game 6, lost Game 1 to the Sixers without Joel Embiid, and then somehow forced Game 7 in the conference finals vs. the Heat after falling behind 3-0.\n\nDid the Celtics learn any lessons when they led LeBron late in Game 7? Or when they handled the overmatched Raptors for half a series? Or when they let the Bucks off the ropes? Not even Derrick White's miracle putback in Game 6 vs. the Heat could keep them from laying an egg in Game 7 after Tatum sprained his ankle. When the Celtics look the proverbial gift horse in the mouth, it kicks them in the teeth.\n\nThis team is supposed to be different, but we shouldn't just assume the Pacers are cooked. That's exactly the kind of thinking that afflicts the Celtics, which helps explain how the outgunned Heat and Cavs were each able to steal homecourt in the first two rounds.\n\nWould it shock anyone if Indiana does not, in fact, pack up for the summer and instead escapes with Game 2? The Tyrese Haliburton-led offense is the real deal, and Indy only got stronger as its first two series progressed.

They need ample time for their front offices and squads to figure things out before actually getting accolades. This was not the case for Jayson Tatum. He became part of an astounding Boston Celtics supporting cast immediately when he got drafted in 2017. Eventually, stardom beckoned him along with Jaylen Brown such that both of them could continually make deep NBA Playoffs runs. This Indiana Pacers series gives him the shot to win the 18th banner for his squad but DeMarcus Cousins posits that there's no time to rush.\n\nThe pressure on Jayson Tatum\n\nLook, being the primary option on a championship-contending Celtics squad can surely impact one's legacy. However, this does not faze Jayson Tatum at all. He constantly allows other members of Joe Mazzulla's squad like Jaylen Brown, Derrick White, and Kristaps Porzingis among others to shine. This former Duke Blue Devils star knows when he needs to take a supporting role. But, there is a lot of pressure from Celtics fans, the media, and avid spectators of the league.\n\nDeMarcus Cousins told them to all calm down. He makes it clear that Jayson Tatum should be in no rush despite playing great against the Pacers, via NBA Unplugged with Kevin Hart.\n\n\"I don't think he's under any pressure. It's more so the circumstances of the early start to his career. He came in as a young guy & he saw success early. With that being said, I feel like people have kind of gotten bored with his success. I think he's a great young player, we've never really seen him in a losing type of situation. So, that's more so where that pressure starts to creep in,\" DeMarcus Cousins said.\n\nHis role in the Celtics' runs so far\n\nWith Jayson Tatum as a staple of the rotation, the Celtics have been to six Eastern Conference Finals. They have made it to the NBA Finals once but a dynastic Golden State Warriors. DeMarcus Cousins illustrates that the Celtics superstar's success is way more than a lot of great players in the league. This could be where the vitriol and unnecessary chatter when it comes to his legacy comes from.\n\n\"At the end of the day, there are guys who have been way longer in the league than this kid and they don't receive this type of pressure. I think he's in a great place in his career, I think he's a winning player. He's done nothing but win since he stepped foot in the league. At this point, he's just gaining experience to get over the hump with winning a championship,\" the former NBA All-Star declared.\n\nSo far, Tatum has done well in the NBA Playoffs. In their latest win over the Pacers, he played 46 minutes and went 12 for 26 on his shots from all three levels of scoring for 36 points. His all-around style of play was also on display in this matchup. He had 10 rebounds and dropped four assists. The most impressive part was that the Celtics also got three steals because of him.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_postrado@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jay Postrado", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMarcus_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DeMarcus Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Pressure_Cooker", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Pressure Cooker", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Celtics-news-DeMarcus-Cousins-gets-100-real-about-why-Jayson-Tatum-has-no-pressure-to-win.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Credits: USA TODAY Sports\n\nWhile the Celtics pinched out a close 133-128 OT win against the Pacers in Game 1 of the ECF, they have faced flak for not putting together a performance worthy of a #1 seed. ESPN analyst Kendrick Perkins sounded off on their offensive schemes and referred to their offense as an \"ozempic shot\". At the same time, Brian Scalabrine, famously known as 'White Mamba', also confessed that he wasn't convinced about his former team's effort.\n\nOn the 'Run It Back' pod, the Celtics analyst expressed being \"alarmed\" about his squad's \"inconsistencies\" and expected a better effort from them in Game 1.\n\nHe pointed out how after beginning the game with a resounding 12-0 run, the Celts \"started walking the ball up\" and lacked the defensive effort. Scalabrine credited the Green Machine for not \"fouling\" the Pacers repeatedly, and limiting them to just 10 free-throw attempts in the game.\n\nHe also highlighted that if the Pacers had not committed numerous late-game errors, they could have eked out the win,\n\n\"I think they really dodged a bullet in that game. If Indiana did some minor things, call time-out to advance the ball, defend the three, step to the ball when you try to catch the ball, Celtics would be down 0-1 right now.\"\n\nWhile relaying that he isn't in \"panic\" mode regarding his former squad's struggle, Scalabrine admitted that their inconsistencies are \"strange\". As a team that finished with the best record in the 2023-24 regular season, he expected them to sort out their woes at this point. Apart from the former Celtics athlete, Stephen A. Smith was also perturbed by their offensive effort.\n\nStephen A. Smith wasn't pleased with the Celtics' offense in Game 1 and termed it \"awful\". On 'First Take', he stated that their former HC Ime Udoka would have developed better offensive schemes, as compared to their current HC Joe Mazulla. He expressed concerns over Celtics' chances in the finals because of their \"haphazard play\".\n\nWhile the Celts can escape with such mistakes against the Pacers, the ESPN analyst felt that well-rounded two-way squads like Timberwolves and Mavericks would punish them for their repeated blunders. He urged them to build a \"model of consistency\".\n\n\"If you're the Boston Celtics, you can't afford to be a bit haphazard, there has to be a model of consistency and dependency to some degree that I don't see,\" Stephen A. Smith expressed.\n\nWhile most teams will get lauded for stitching together a 133-point effort, the Celtics don't have the same luxury. Since they have been to six Conference Finals in the last eight seasons, the expectations towards them are lofty.\n\nApart from that, the East has been a cakewalk for them, thus far, and many believe that the strong Western Conference postseason window would have rendered Finals candidates Timberwolves and Mavericks better equipped to win it all.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shubham_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Shubham Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Scalabrine", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brian Scalabrine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Perkins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Perkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

And it came courtesy of Jaylen Brown.\n\nThe three-time All-Star saved his team from a huge upset loss after making a pivotal hustle play on a Pacers' inbound pass and draining a corner 3-point basket to send the action into overtime. The second of those feats electrified the legions of Boston fans in the building, many of whom were probably trying to remember where they parked their car before making the subdued trek back to the lot.\n\nAmongst the bedlam was one of the most famous chefs in the world. Fieri soaked up the thrills from courtside, a few seats away from New England Patriots rookie quarterback Drake Maye. He looked to be in complete awe of Brown, as was evident by a photo that perfectly captured the raw emotion associated with postseason heroics.\n\nBased on Fieri's expression, one can only assume that he exclaimed \"Whiz Bam Wow\" just seconds after witnessing the shot. This image could be framed on many walls if the Celtics overpower the Pacers and ultimately win the championship this year. The juxtaposition of a fierce-looking Brown, stunned Fieri and a seemingly demoralized fan a couple rows back excellently illustrates this dramatic 133-128 Game 1 Celtics' victory.\n\nThe Food Network powerhouse's facial expression appeared to add to the viewing experience for many watching at home. \"Guy Fieri being a Celtics fan just made me like them a little bit more,\" angelo_guzzels posted on X. \"The reaction from Guy Fieri and Drake Maye, Gotta love playoff basketball,\" the DraftKings account said.\n\nCeltics need to learn from this Game 1 scare\n\nWhen a larger-than-life character steps into the frenzied environment that is the NBA Playoffs, fun is bound to ensue. There are plenty of Boston fans, however, who are desperately hoping the rest of this series is not nearly as interesting as Game 1 proved to be.\n\nIt is not enough for the Celtics to book their second Finals appearance in the last three years. They also need to enter the proceedings with a bunch of momentum. Winning at home is an essential part of completing that objective.\n\nThe C's have lost both of the Game 2s they have played thus far in these playoffs, so the team must be especially engaged for another TD Garden battle this Thursday. If June is truly going to be Boston's long-awaited coronation, it must act the part of supreme ruler in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nAside from the clutch play, Jaylen Brown put forth an overall superb performance. He scored 26 points on 10-of-20 shooting while Jayson Tatum dropped 36 and grabbed 12 rebounds. Jrue Holiday enjoyed his best offensive showing of the season with 28 points (4-of-8 from distance) and Derrick White dished out a team-high nine assists. The ongoing absence of Kristaps Porzingis is becoming more apparent, but this group can bury its opponent in a variety of ways.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_house@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Alex House", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fieri", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guy Fieri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Network", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Celtics-news-Guy-Fieri-gets-ultimate-meme-treatment-after-Bostons-clutch-Pacers-win.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

Even though he scored over 30 points in Game 1, Haberstroh shares some concerning 'under the hood' stats that show Tatum is struggling in playoffs games when they matter most.\n\nAfter the break, Haberstroh shares some data that confirms we are experiencing the most injury riddled postseason in over a decade. Goodwill wonders if this is just a trend or just a part of the game now. Both agree teams will likely begin to construct their rosters differently to combat the uptick in injuries in the NBA.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wpyxgovEVxSs2401p3wvYQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/f0fb4fa0-1865-11ef-b9a7-e71dc50f2b0a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

That's seemingly the only way to take Jrue Holiday's description of how the second-year head man gets his players locked in.\n\n\"He's crazy,\" Holiday said of Mazzulla (h/t MassLive). \"Anybody who knows Joe knows he's crazy, and that's pretty much it. But I think it's, I don't know, maybe controlled madness. It's definitely his way of preparing us and I feel like preparing himself and I think it's been working.\n\n\"He honestly makes you lock in because it's so different, you definitely have to pay attention to the things that he says. Sometimes he might talk kind of fast and he might talk through something and you kind of be like, 'Wait, wait, wait, slow down.' But I think really locking in like that helps me because it really makes me go back and be like, 'Alright, what did he say? This is what we want to do.'\"\n\nIt goes without saying that the Indiana Pacers will be the best team the Celtics have faced thus far in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Had Jimmy Butler been healthy, that wouldn't have been the case. Ditto for Jarrett Allen. But alas, those players were absent and Indiana is at full strength.\n\nAnd not only at full strength. But peaking right now.\n\nTyrese Haliburton, when he's on, is the most dangerous weapon the Cs are opposite against on this current postseason run. Pascal Siakam may just be the biggest matchup nightmare the Celtics will have faced. T.J.

But on Tuesday night, he wasted no time calling for a green-light special.\n\nMazzulla challenged a goaltending call on Celtics veteran Al Horford just 35 seconds into Game 1, which set a new NBA playoff record for the quickest challenge in a game. Horford was called for the goaltend while defending a layup attempt by Pascal Siakam, and clearly got his fingertips on the ball before it hit the backboard.\n\nMazzulla quickly challenged the call, and the call was quickly overturned, giving Boston its 2-0 lead back. And it worked out well for the Celtics, who ripped off a 12-0 run to start the contest. The run was capped off by a three-pointer by Horford.\n\nMazzulla is best known for holding onto his timeouts like they're currency, which has long drawn the ire from pundits and Celtics fans alike.

Shedding what can easily become a losing habit has fed into the \"win the day\" mantra they've adopted this season.\n\nWith Boston rarely playing down to its competition and quickly moving on from one matchup to the next, regardless of outcome, opponent, or that it's no longer the regular season and the stakes are elevated, has helped produce a 64-18 campaign, registering the best record in the NBA. They're 8-2 to start the playoffs, reaching the conference finals before anyone else.\n\n\"I think the value comes from not having an expectation, voiced Joe Mazzulla on Friday while discussing the Celtics' playing without giving into the expectation for how a game is supposed to go.\n\n\"I really think that's the key to really anything. If you go into something thinking it's supposed to go a certain way, then your mind and your body is clouded by what is necessary to do in that moment. And so, the one thing this team has done a good job of this season is not playing with any expectations. If you're winning by a lot, if you're losing by a lot, it doesn't really matter. At the end of the day, it takes what it takes, and you've got to be present. And so the team has done a good job fighting for that. I think that's important. Managing our own expectations.\"\n\n\"I think it's been really good,\" said Payton Pritchard while discussing the mentality Mazzulla has worked to instill in the Celtics on Sunday at the Auerbach Center. \"I've definitely learned a lot from him.\n\n\"Joe really studies the game (and) studies the mental side of things a lot. And I think that's our biggest growth this year is how do we prepare mentally for the battle ahead and staying in the moment, and not losing ourselves? So, that's what I've learned the most from him, and I think he's done a really good job with that stuff.\"\n\nThe former Oregon Duck registered a +375 plus-minus rating, the highest total among all second-unit members this regular season, per NBA.com.\n\nPritchard generated 122.8 points per 100 possessions, the most in the league. His 13.6 net rating ranks fourth. And his 4.61 assist-to-turnover ratio is fifth among those who appeared in at least 41 games and logged 18 minutes per contest, per NBA.com.\n\nHis head coach preaching a mentality that includes treating the game with humility and letting go of expectations has sparked Boston's most significant growth from last season to this one in Pritchard's perspective.\n\n\"Like I said before, we're so talented, and I think our biggest step has been: how do we mentally bridge that gap with our talent? If we become mentally as strong as we are talented, then we're really dangerous. So, I think that's what we've really been harping on, and we've been growing on.\"\n\nMazzulla loves jiu-jitsu; he thinks about the movie The Town and how he'd rob Fenway Park when he's in the iconic venue, and he's maniacally competitive.\n\nHis coaching style is equal parts thoughtful and intense. Its authenticity is why it's embraced by players at career stages ranging from year four, like Pritchard, to a 14-year veteran like Jrue Holiday.\n\n\"You go with it,\" said Holiday. \"You go with the craziness. He honestly makes you lock in because it's so different, you definitely have to pay attention to the things that he says. Sometimes, he might talk kind of fast, and he might talk through something, and you kind of be like, 'Wait, wait, wait, slow down.' But I think really locking in like that helps me because it really makes me go back and be like, 'Alright, what did he say? This is what we want to do.'\"\n\nThe two-time All-Star defines Mazzulla's coaching style as \"maybe controlled madness. It's definitely his way of preparing us, and I feel like, preparing himself, and I think it's been working.\"\n\nAs for whether he likes that controlled madness?\n\n\"Yeah, it's fun,\" conveyed Holiday. \"It's different. I feel like some coaches, sometimes, it can be like methodical; it can be boring. But Joe definitely brings a spark and some like weird energy that I think kind of keeps us engaged and gets us going.\"\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTrivializing Celtics' Success in Tatum-Brown Era a Take Not Measured Properly: 'Doing\n\nPast Hardships Brought Out Best in Al Horford in Career Night: 'You Saw His Gift'\n\nSimple Changes Spark Stifling Second Half Defense in Celtics' Game 4 Win vs. Cavs\n\nJayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown Still Shaking Off Criticism While Growing as Leaders\n\nJrue Holiday Delivers 'Masterclass' in Game 3 Win vs. Cavs\n\nJayson Tatum Breaks Out of Scoring Slump That Never Defined Him: 'Underappreciated'\n\nDerrick White Discusses Joining Elite Company in Game 1 Win vs. Cavaliers", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payton_Pritchard", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Payton Pritchard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Bulldogs_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler Bulldogs men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fenway Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2577,h_1449,x_0,y_661/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_celtics/01hya2vkrztbfvy52x6n.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 81, "relevance": 1}

And so, the one thing this team has done a good job of this season is not playing with any expectations. If you're winning by a lot, if you're losing by a lot, it doesn't really matter,\" he told reporters Friday.\n\nMazzulla, who was named as full-time head coach in 2023, has been in this familiar position before. When the Heat knocked Boston out of banner 18 contention last season, he earned the biggest \"teachable moment\" of them all.\n\nHe learned that the battle - while against other teams on the court - is mental. And as expectations for the Celtics to win a championship continue to mount, Mazzulla is focused on keeping his team present.\n\n\"You've got to stay engaged and locked in mentally, spiritually, emotionally and physically because there's a fight coming up. It's going to be a long one. And we're just coming out of a fight,\" Mazzulla said about his approach to rest days following Sunday's practice.\n\n\"Joe really studies the game, studies the mental side of things a lot,\" Celtics point guard Payton Pritchard said about his coach Sunday.\n\nPritchard, who saw minimal playoff minutes in 2023, has proved himself to be a clutch member of the stay-ready group. Watching mostly from the sidelines last year, he said he thinks his team has done a better job at handling playoff challenges with fortitude.\n\n\"That's our biggest growth this year is, 'How do we prepare mentally for the battle ahead' and staying in the moment, and not losing ourselves?\"\n\nThat growth is due to Mazzulla's \"onto the next\" philosophy. He encourages his players to move on quickly from games - win or lose - and even implements drills in practice to simulate moments of tension during games. He calls it \"controlled madness.\"\n\n\"Some coaches sometimes can be methodical and boring, but Joe definitely brings a spark and weird energy,\" first-year Celtic Jrue Holiday said.\n\n\"Really locking in like that really helps me,\" Holiday said about Mazzulla's approach. \"You definitely have to pay attention to the things that he says. Sometimes he might talk kind of fast, and he might talk through something, and you kind of have to be like wait, wait, slow down.\"\n\nNow, as the Celtics prepare for their series against the Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals, Mazzulla says his team is in a good position following their short break.\n\n\"Guys were locked in, intentional on the things that we need to get better at. So, I thought they brought a really good mindset,\" Mazzulla said about Sunday's practice ahead of Game 1 on Tuesday.\n\nWith Kristaps Porzingis expected to make a return at some point in the series, the Celtics will have their full arsenal available. However, with the star center's status still questionable, Boston will put their mental toughness to the test as they look for a short-handed win.\n\nGame 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals tips off Tuesday at TD Garden at 8 p.m.", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "faith_pinnow@boston.com", "name": "Faith Pinnow", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payton_Pritchard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Payton Pritchard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/XGBQO4DQ3SQTJUEUQPC4E57QHA-664b8b6d5eb48-768x432.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 79, "relevance": 1}

Revisiting scandal that brought former Celtics coach's tenure to abrupt end", "body": "The Celtics came up short in the 2022 NBA Finals, but few teams finished the season with a brighter future than Boston.\n\nWith Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown as on-court leaders, the Celtics knew they had a chance to return to the Finals in the near future. They're now four wins away from doing just that -- but without the coach they once firmly believed could take them to the next level.\n\nIme Udoka's stunning exit from Boston forced assistant Joe Mazzulla into one of the NBA's premier jobs as head coach of the Celtics, a role he has embraced despite some of the highest expectations in the sport. After a 64-win season, the Celtics believe they can win a title with Mazzulla. Udoka, meanwhile, is nearly forgotten two years after the franchise's deepest run in more than a decade.\n\nHere's a look back at Udoka's unceremonious exit from the Celtics and where he is now.\n\nMORE: Full series preview for Eastern Conference Finals\n\nUdoka's rise that made him one of the best young coaches in the NBA came to an abrupt halt in September 2022 when the Celtics suspended him for the entire 2022-23 season for violating team policies. It remains the longest suspension for a head coach in NBA history.\n\nUdoka engaged in \"an intimate relationship with a female member of the franchise's staff,\" which broke team rules, according to ESPN. He also allegedly used \"crude language\" toward the woman, who was considered a subordinate.\n\nUdoka, who was in a long-term relationship with his fiance at the time of these events, was never guaranteed to return to the Celtics and never did. Mazzulla's interim tag was removed in February 2023.\n\nDespite Udoka's issues with the Celtics, the former Spurs assistant still drew interest from other teams. The Nets initially planned to hire Udoka as their head coach just weeks after he was suspended, but Brooklyn soured on the idea largely because of the improper relationship, instead sticking with interim coach Jacque Vaughn. The Rockets didn't waste much time hiring Udoka after the season, bringing him in to replace Stephen Silas.\n\nAsked for the first time about the relationship during his introductory press conference in Houston, Udoka said he \"spent this last offseason working on myself in a lot of different ways, improving in areas, and it gave me a chance to sit back, reflect, and grow.\"\n\nUdoka went 41-41 in his first season as Rockets coach, overseeing a 19-win improvement from 2022-23 with the help of an 11-game win streak late in the season. He appears to be locked in as Houston's long-term head coach after the tumultuous exit in Boston.\n\nThere was never any formal statement announcing Udoka's firing, but team president Brad Stevens revealed when Mazzulla was named the Celtics' full-time head coach that the organization had officially parted ways with Udoka.\n\nInitial reporting indicated Udoka was far from guaranteed to return as Boston's head coach after the suspension, and the Celtics told Udoka he was free to talk to other teams. While his deal to coach the Nets wasn't finalized, it was a clear sign that the two sides planned to officially move on.\n\nThe Celtics were upset by the Heat in the 2023 Eastern Conference Finals, but they stayed committed to Mazzulla and instead re-tooled the roster by bringing in Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis while trading Marcus Smart and Malcolm Brogdon. Mazzulla is now eight wins away from immortality as the Celtics' championship-or-bust season nears a conclusion one way or another.\n\nMORE: Donovan Mitchell trade rumors after Cavaliers' playoff exit\n\nThe decision to remove Mazzulla's interim tag during his first season as head coach raised a few eyebrows despite the Celtics' success. His age was likely a major reason.\n\nMazzulla was only 34 when he ascended to the head coaching role. He's now 35, set to turn 36 in June, and remains the NBA's youngest head coach.\n\nWhile the reason for Boston's disappointing exit in 2023 can be debated, Mazzulla has seemed up to the task this season. The Celtics finished at least 14 games better than every other team in the East, and they only lost two games over the first two rounds of the playoffs despite some closer-than-expected contests.\n\nMazzulla had three years of experience as an NBA assistant when he replaced Udoka, having also spent time as a G League assistant and a head coach at NCAA Division II Fairmont State.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ime_Udoka", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ime Udoka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacque_Vaughn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacque Vaughn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Silas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Silas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Brogdon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malcolm Brogdon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Smart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Smart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Stevens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Stevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_G_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA G League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2023-04/Ime%20Udoka%20042124.jpeg?itok=Ot_eXoTI", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588270", "eventUri": "eng-9588270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 78, "relevance": 1}

A native Londoner through-and-through, Mai grew up listening to the dulcet tones of Lauryn Hill, Alicia Keys, and rap icon Missy Elliott.

Age and career timeline for Celtics head coach", "body": "The Celtics' pursuit of the 18th NBA title in franchise history has been led by one of the game's sharpest young minds.\n\nJoe Mazzulla is in his second season as an NBA head coach and is largely responsible for Boston posting the best offensive rating in NBA history in 2023-24. Mazzulla's path to becoming an NBA head coach was far from traditional and resulted in him being the NBA's youngest head coach.\n\nIn addition to being the youngest head coach in the league, Mazzulla is younger than Celtics veteran center Al Horford, among many other NBA players.\n\nHow old is Mazzulla? Here is more perspective on the age of Boston's head coach.\n\nA native of Johnston, R.I., Mazzulla graduated from Bishop Hendricken High School in 2006 and pledged to play basketball collegiately at the University of West Virginia.\n\nMazzulla played five years at West Virginia, leading the Mountaineers to the Final Four in 2010. One of the biggest wins of Mazzulla's college career came against DeMarcus Cousins, John Wall and Kentucky in the 2010 Elite Eight.\n\nMORE: Previewing Eastern Conference Finals series between Pacers and Celtics\n\nAfter his playing career ended in 2011, Mazzulla began coaching as an assistant at Division II Glenville State in West Virginia.\n\nMazzulla spent two years as an assistant at Division II power Fairmont State before joining the Celtics organization as an assistant coach for the then-Maine Red Claws, the franchise's NBA G League affiliate.\n\nMazzulla bounced back to Fairmont State for his first head coaching job, spending two seasons on the sideline before leaping to the NBA as an assistant coach in Boston. He was promoted into the interim head coach position after Ime Udoka was suspended indefinitely and later hired as the franchise's head coach in 2023.\n\nMORE: Latest news and rumors on the NBA's upcoming TV deal\n\nMazzulla is the NBA's youngest coach, followed by Utah's Will Hardy. During Boston's run to the 2022 NBA Finals, both Mazzulla and Hardy were members of Ime Udoka's coaching staff.\n\nThere are five NBA coaches under the age of 40. Celtics assistant Charles Lee, who was hired as the Hornets head coach beginning in the 2024-25 season, will turn 40 in November. Grizzlies head coach Taylor Jenkins will turn 40 in September.\n\n18 players older than Mazzulla played at least one game in the 2023-24 NBA season. Among them, eight have played in the 2024 NBA Playoffs.\n\nIn addition to coaching Horford, Mazzulla will coach against Indiana's James Johnson, who turned 37 in February.", "source": {"uri":

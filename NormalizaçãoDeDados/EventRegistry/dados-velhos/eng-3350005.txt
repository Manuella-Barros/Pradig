Warner Bros. could celebrate not only the month's biggest debut but also having the week's top two films. Christopher Nolan's \"Dunkirk\" followed in second with $11.4 million in its fourth weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.\n\nEven amid an especially weak August, the well-reviewed horror sequel and modestly budgeted \"Annabelle: Creation\" found eager audiences.\n\n\"That we were able to do $35 million in what is a very sluggish marketplace was very impressive,\" said Jeffrey Goldstein, Warner Bros.' distribution chief. \"We all know that moviegoing begets moviegoing and right now it's a dip in the content overall.\"\n\nThe film, the third to spiral out of 2013's \"The Conjuring,\" cost only about $15 million to make. More sequels and spinoffs are being developed in what has become for Warner Bros. a steadily profitable horror franchise bent on old-school frights. The \"Annabelle\" offshoot centres on a possessed doll.\n\nLast week's top film, the poorly received Stephen King adaptation \"The Dark Tower,\" slid dramatically. The Sony Pictures release, starring Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey, toppled nearly 60 per cent on its second weekend with an estimated $7.9 million.\n\nThe week's other new entry, the Open Road animated release \"Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature,\" edged just above \"The Dark Tower\" with $8.9 million. That was well below the 2014 debut of the original, \"The Nut Job,\" which opened with $19.4 million.\n\nBut the solid returns for \"Annabelle: Creation\" did little to counter the box-office slide. Ahead of the weekend, the domestic box office was 11 per cent off the pace of 2016's summer. This weekend was also down considerably from the same timeframe last year, when \"Suicide Squad\" was leading the box office despite brutal reviews.\n\nSome of July's bright spots, however, have continued into August. The summer's top comedy, \"Girls Trip,\" will soon surpass $100 million domestically. The movie, starring Jada Pinkett Smith and Queen Latifah, took in $6.5 million in its fourth week to bring its cumulative total to $97.2 million. It may end up doubling the gross of its closest summer comedy competition: the starrier and pricey \"Baywatch\" ($58.1 million in its entire run).\n\nIn limited release, the A24 crime thriller \"Good Time,\" starring Robert Pattinson, debuted with a robust $34,000 per-screen average on four screens. That was bettered, though, by the $47,000 screen-average of Neon's \"Ingrid Goes West,\" with Aubrey Plaza, on three screens. Both films expand in coming weeks.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theatres according to comScore. Where available, the latest international numbers also are included. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\n1. \"Annabelle: Creation,\" $35 million.\n\n2. \"Dunkirk,\" $11.4 million.\n\n3. \"Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature,\" $8.9 million.\n\n4. \"The Dark Tower,\" $7.9 million.\n\n5. \"The Emoji Movie,\" $6.6 million.\n\n6. \"Girls Trip,\" $6.5 million.\n\n7. \"Spider-Man: Homecoming,\" $6.1 million.\n\n8. \"Kidnap,\" $5.2 million.\n\n9. \"Glass Castle,\" $4.9 million.\n\n10. \"Atomic Blonde,\" $4.6 million.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP", "time": "17:35:00"}

Now, a new film brings the doll back to the big screen, but how does Annabelle: Creation fit into the franchise that introduced her and the offshoot film that made her an icon in her own right? Director David F. Sandberg answers that and other compelling questions about his latest box-office smashing horror hit.\n\nSpoilers Ahead As The Origins Of Annabelle: Creation Are Explored\n\nWhile 2014's Annabelle was a prequel offshoot to The Conjuring, it wasn't really the origin story that horror fans had expected, when they flocked to theaters. Now, as L.A. Times reveals, we are finally getting that story...and then some. Annabelle: Creation introduces us to the very beginning, when the Annabelle doll was manufactured in the early 40s as a part of a limited edition collectors item. Only 100 similar dolls were created.\n\nThe dollmaker, Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia), is shown devoting great care and a love of his craft in creating Annabelle, painstakingly assembling, refining, and painting the doll.\n\nLater, Samuel and his wife, Esther (played by Miranda Otto), suffer a family tragedy, bringing an end to the dollmaker's passion for life and art. It isn't until many years have passed that the couple once again open up their doors and their hearts, but, this time, it's to a group of unsuspecting orphans.\n\nIt doesn't take a leap of the imagination to guess what happens next in Annabelle: Creation. While the doll torments her new house full of defenseless children, one handicapped orphan, Janice (Talitha Bateman) may be the only one capable of stopping Annabelle from spreading her reign of evil.\n\nDavid Sandberg On Indulging His Dark Side For Annabelle: Creation\n\nSpeaking to AZ Central, David Sandberg reveals that he was busy working on Lights Out, when producers approached him with the idea of directing Annabelle: Creation. He says he was reluctant to sign on and expected a sequel that pretty much rehashed the plot of the first film, but, upon reading the script, Sandberg found that this would be more than the average sequel.\n\nIn fact, what most appealed to him about the film is that audiences don't need to see the 2014 film to enjoy Annabelle: Creation. It stands on its own, yet it leads into the events of the first film.\n\nAsked about shooting on a dark, scary set, David dispels our fantasies, as he reveals that the set is as technical and busy as any film set. Sure, the physical set of the house does seem a little foreboding, but with technicians and crew running around, child actors playing between takes, and flashes and lights brightening up the rooms, Sandberg says it's not as dark as one might expect.\n\nMany of Sandberg's horror films use darkness as a tool for creating a frightening atmosphere and he says he'd rather make it too dark than too light. He feels that works to the film's advantage, even when audiences can't make out what's going on.\n\nSandberg takes advantage of daylight as well. In one scene, Janice finds herself under attack, while in the barn in the middle of the afternoon and the Annabelle: Creation director says he was surprised by how well that scene came together.\n\n\"And then when we had our first test screening ... one of the things they said was how much they liked that scary things happened in the day, because scary things usually happen at night. \"", "time": "00:28:00"}

Characters in Annabelle: Creation are maimed, die, and come back to life possessed by demons. There are stakes and consequences and bad things happen, which you can't really say of even the highly regarded Conjuring movies, whose protagonists always seem to just barely escape the clutches of one demonic creature or another. Unfortunately for these characters-though not for audiences-that isn't the case in Annabelle: Creation.\n\nSet in the ever-expanding James Wan-iverse of horror movies-which also includes The Conjuring 1 and 2, the previous Annabelle film, and the upcoming Crooked Man and The Nun -- Annabelle: Creation deftly accomplishes that crucial feat of making you care about almost every character. That includes several extremely adorable orphan girls, their kindly nun-mom, and a sad dollmaker and his wife-then making bad things happen to them.\n\nThe tale begins with the dollmaker, Mr. Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia), whose happy family is torn asunder when his daughter, Annabelle (Samara Lee), dies. Twelve years later he and his wife, Esther (Miranda Otto), invite the orphans (most notably Talitha Bateman as Janice and Lulu Wilson as Linda) to foster with them in the hopes it will liven up the house. In a way, it does, if evil dolls, possessed scarecrows, and a murderous demon count as life.\n\nAnnabelle: Creation's main flaw is that it's actually pretty crucial that viewers understand where it falls within the canon of these connected films, especially regarding the ending, which ties a neat little continuity bow on the whole thing. As its name implies, Annabelle: Creation is the story of the crafting of the Annabelle doll, which first appeared in the opening to The Conjuring and later starred in its own spin-off, Annabelle.\n\nYes, Annabelle: Creation is prequel to a spin-off, and it's also the doll's second origin story, as the first Annabelle movie offered a perfectly fine explanation for her demonic disposition. Creation simply offers a better one, and makes sure to do it in a way that doesn't erase anything that happened in the other films, while simultaneously setting up more Wan-iverse movies with subtle Marvel-esque nods and Easter eggs. It's all pretty impressive.\n\nCreation is director David F. Sandberg's second major feature, after last year's Lights Out, which was based on the short film of the same name that prompted James Wan to give Sandberg a shot at the big leagues. Sandberg continues to develop his style in Creation, including the use of light and darkness-a flickering flashlight under a sheet, shadows as thick as fog, bulbs exploding and hurtling from their sockets-that's quickly becoming his signature.\n\nThis movie has its share of jump scares, enhanced by a shrieking score punctuated by pauses of pregnant silence. But even more effective are its moments of sheer dread, like when a sheeted figure walks purposely toward the camera, its feet gradually pulling the covering underneath until it slips off to reveal-well, no spoilers. Excellent editing and use of foreground and background elements in scenes like that make them white-knucklers.\n\nAnnabelle: Creation does suffer somewhat from the classic horror movie malady, \"why would you go in there?\" syndrome. These poor little orphans, especially Bateman's Janice, are unusually curious, but even the most adventurous little tyke probably wouldn't return to Annabelle's forbidden bedroom so many times-certainly not after after what happens during Janice's first few visits. Creation mines some comedy from this, though, like when the likable Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman), apparently keen to stick to her routine, calmly instructs the girls to head to bed moments after a particularly horrific event. It lends the movie a self-awareness that others in the genre sometimes lack.\n\nCreation also does a fantastic job setting up Chekhov's guns all over the house and surrounding land-props, like the aforementioned scarecrow, a dilapidated dumbwaiter, a motorized indoor chairlift, and a Ring-esque deep, dark well, that re-enter the story at various points in ever more terrifying ways. Toward the climax, it juggles multiple small subplots at the same time, separating, terrorizing, and reuniting its characters as various of these guns go off. By the end, all the movie's early promises have paid off, and you'll be left panting and relieved.\n\nBateman deserves particular mention as Janice, the most lovable orphan and the perspective character for much of the film. Polio-stricken, she hobbles around the house with the help of a brace and a crutch, watching forlornly as the other girls play. The actress shows fantastic range, forming an emotional center that pulses at the dark heart of Annabelle: Creation.\n\nThis type of horror is often predicated on the idea that demons would have no reason to act logically; if their purpose is to chip away at our sanity until they can worm their way into our souls, then spooky hijinks like flicking the lights in a dollhouse on and off or rushing toward someone just to disappear at the last second make perfect sense. But the antagonistic forces in Annabelle: Creation have an endgame beyond making the characters crap their pants, and when everything pops off, it really gets crazy, easily matching both Conjuring movies (and far surpassing the previous Annabelle film) in raw, climactic terror.\n\nAnnabelle: Creation doesn't quite stand on its own, particularly in its ending. But thanks to solid performances from its adult and child actors, skillful directing, truly terrifying moments that go beyond cheap jump scares, and a self-awareness that many scary movies lack, it teeters at the peak of this ever-expanding world of connected horror, asking you only to jump with it down into the dark.\n\nCheck out GameSpot.com/universe and GameSpot Universe on YouTube for more coverage of all things gamers love, that aren't games!", "time": "21:12:00"}

Twelve years later, the two make an arrangement with Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman) to allow girls from a shuttered orphanage to stay at their house as they wait to be adopted. Upon arriving at the Mullins' home, the girls - including best friends Janice (Talitha Bateman) and Linda (Lulu Wilson) - become infatuated with the place, eager to take advantage of its many luxuries.\n\nOn the same floor as the girls' bedrooms is a locked off room that everyone is forbidden to enter. However, one night, Janice receives a mysterious note and is able to walk into the room, encountering a child's doll in a white dress that behaves rather mysteriously. Janice has unknowingly let loose a terrible evil through the house, transforming what should have been a safe sanctuary for her and her friends into a terrible nightmare with no end in sight.\n\nThe doll and Talitha Bateman in Annabelle: Creation\n\nThe fourth film in the Conjuring franchise, Annabelle: Creation is a prequel to 2014's Annabelle and explores the origins of the possessed doll that has been featured in previous installments. Whereas earlier entries in the series drew inspiration from Ed and Lorraine Warren's real-life case files (which include the actual Annabelle Raggedy-Ann doll), this film is an entirely fictional work that gives the filmmakers an opportunity to add to the Conjuring mythos the way they see fit. Producer James Wan brought his Lights Out director David F. Sandberg to call the shots, and it's safe to say this is a pairing that really works. Annabelle: Creation makes for a solid Conjuring prequel, with scares and thrills that make up for any noticeable shortcomings in the script.\n\nSandberg is arguably the true star of Creation, once again demonstrating his eye for crafting engrossing horror sequences that leave the audience on the edge of their seats. When the plot kicks into motion after a standard first act, the Mullins' home becomes something of a terrifying haunted house ride for viewers, where anything can strike at a moment's notice. Sandberg makes excellent use of the Annabelle doll prop, which continues to be one of the most unsettling in the genre. Much like the original Conjuring, Creation doesn't overly rely on jump scares, instead spooking moviegoers mainly with haunting imagery and creepy atmosphere that will linger after the credits have rolled, thanks to the contributions of director of photography Maxime Alexandre. The technical merits of Creation are quite strong.\n\nLulu Wilson in Annabelle: Creation\n\nUnfortunately, the same cannot be said about the script written by Gary Dauberman. Creation contains more than its fair share of well-known horror movie clich\u00e9s that will stand out to anyone with even a passing knowledge of the genre. Classic tropes like questionable character motivations and other plot contrivances will be frustrating for some viewers, especially since they ultimately make the film come across as a standard supernatural thriller, as opposed to being something greater. That said, Dauberman does deserve credit for crafting Creation as a mostly standalone story, balancing it nicely with larger connections to the rest of the Conjuring universe. The film is accessible for newcomers to the property, and thanks to its brisk runtime, it never overstays its welcome.\n\nAnnabelle is an ensemble piece, making it difficult for any performer to truly take charge and carry the film on their shoulders. Bateman and Wilson are the leads among the group of girls, getting a sweet and emotional arc buoyed by their sister-like bond. Neither character is all that fleshed out or memorable in the long run, but they serve the purposes of Creation nicely with convincing turns that sell audiences on the terrors of the situation. LaPagila is also good as Samuel, a tortured and grieving man just trying to get by in life. The script doesn't give the actor a whole lot of material to work with, but he makes the most of it and does what he can. At times, he's a very sympathetic figure, as anyone can relate to his pain.\n\nStephanie Sigman in Annabelle Creation\n\nThe supporting cast members are all fine in their parts, there just likewise isn't much to many of the roles. While the character of Sister Charlotte is periodically undercut by the conveniences of the script, Sigman injects the girls' caretaker with motherly sensibilities and has some touching scenes with the child actors. She definitely has the meatiest secondary part, as several of the orphaned girls are there just to flesh the group out and take part in scary set pieces during the third act, leaving no meaningful impression. Otto is arguably wasted as Esther, being reduced to primarily reciting exposition that adds to the mysteries of the Mullins' house. As is the case with the rest of the actors, Otto doesn't give a bad performance, but she doesn't stand out, either.\n\nIn the end, Annabelle: Creation makes for a fun ride for horror enthusiasts - especially those who have been following the Conjuring franchise from the beginning. Sandberg is clearly in his element, and though the film does follow much of the genre's typical playbook, he throws enough change-ups at the audience to make Creation enjoyable. It doesn't exactly break new ground, but the prequel is a fine addition to the property, indicating there's plenty of life left in the series for future spinoffs and sequels. As we hit the end of the summer movie season, Annabelle is easy to recommend for casual audiences intrigued by marketing and Conjuring die-hards alike.\n\nTrailer\n\nAnnabelle: Creation is now playing in U.S. theaters.

2014 predecessor\n\nThe box office was in need of some good news after a week filled with dismal earnings reports, and Warner Bros./New Line's \"Annabelle: Creation\" was able to provide it with a strong opening Friday that signals a weekend total above analyst projections.\n\nThe $15 million horror prequel is currently on pace to make $36.5 million this weekend after making $15 million on Friday from 3,502 screens. That puts it very close to matching the $37.1 million opening the first \"Annabelle\" made in October 2014 en route to a $256.9 million global haul. Pre-weekend projections had \"Annabelle: Creation\" making $27-30 million this weekend. If more strong results on Saturday can push weekend estimates to $40 million, then the film will have matched the openings put of the \"Conjuring\" films, which \"Annabelle\" is a spin-off of. \"Annabelle: Creation\" currently has a score of 68 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and a B on CinemaScore.\n\nThis also means that WB will take a 1-2 finish at the box office this weekend, as \"Dunkirk\" is taking advantage of weak competition to grab the No. 2 spot with $10.5 million in its fourth weekend. That will push Christopher Nolan's Oscar contender past the $150 million domestic mark and put it close to passing $350 million worldwide.\n\nIn third is Open Road's \"The Nut Job 2,\" which is performing poorly, as industry estimates put it at an $8-9 million opening after making $2.8 million from 4,002 screens on Friday. By comparison, the first \"Nut Job\" opened to a $19.4 million start in January 2014. Columbia/MRC's \"The Dark Tower\" is looking at a hard fall to fourth with $7.3 million in its second weekend, a 63 percent drop from its $19.5 million opening.\n\nCompleting the top 5 is Universal's \"Girls Trip,\" which will make an estimated $6.3 million in its fourth weekend to bring its domestic total to $97 million. That means the Queen Latifah-led comedy will become the first in its genre to pass the $100 million domestic mark this year. The No. 5 spot could be taken over by \"Spider-Man: Homecoming,\" which crossed the $300 million domestic mark on Friday and is currently estimated to make $6.2 million in its opening weekend.\n\nDown the list at No. 8 is Lionsgate's \"The Glass Castle,\" which is estimated to make $5 million from a targeted release of 1,461 screens. The drama based on the memoirs of Jeannette Walls has a 50 percent RT rating and earned $1.65 million on Friday. Finally, Annapurna's \"Detroit\" will drop out of the top 10 in its second weekend, making just $2.8 million and falling 60 percent from its lower-than-expected $7 million opening.", "time": "13:22:00"}

What Sister Charlotte doesn't know is that Samuel, a doll maker, has made a possessed doll who is violently protective of her home and her family.\n\nWhile critics haven't called Annabelle: Creation the best film in the Conjuring series, the film holds a solid 71 percent on the review aggregator site Rottentomatoes.com. While some say the film is a decent horror film without much surprises, others feel that the lack of surprises is the result of a reliance on clich\u00e9s and tired horror tropes.\n\nSee what the critics have to say below.\n\n\"Annabelle: Creation is technically, if not quite thematically, the fourth film in the somewhat vaguely-defined \"Conjuring\" franchise. What is impressive about these films is that they rely on some of the oldest tropes in the genre but execute them with a generally high level of craft. Annabelle: Creation may not be a fresh take on its material. Still, it's well-staged and delivers exactly what it promises.\" - Rafer Guzm\u00e1n, Newsday\n\n\"Despite the lurking camera and a volume cranked to 20 designed to make us jump, director David F. Sandberg's tactics lead to diminishing returns. In short order, the doll-drums set in. The movie is the latest standalone flick in a chiller series, and fans may appreciate how it works as an origin story and threads together with the earlier Annabelle and a couple of Conjuring movies. Is that enough to make Annabelle: Creation recommendable? Hell no, Dolly!\" - Joe Dziemianowicz, New York Daily News\n\n\"These movies are almost always more effective during the escalation portion of the evening; by the last act, they all turn into The Exorcist on steroids, bombarding the audience with lots of sound, fury, and special effects. Still, Sandberg makes the most of his adopted formula, using it as a good excuse to try out some new techniques, to the point where Annabelle herself becomes almost irrelevant. Certainly, Creation has more fun with a suspiciously mobile scarecrow the girls stumble upon. But will his barnyard shtick sustain the whole spin-off the Conjuring team will inevitably conjure up for him?\" - A.A. Dowd, A.V Club\n\n\"Yet another tiresome film in the formulaic and metastasising devil-doll horror franchise that started with The Conjuring and its sequel The Conjuring 2, notionally inspired by real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. Annabelle: Creation is, heartsinkingly, a prequel to the prequel that was Annabelle (2014), which gave the glassy-eyed Victorian doll from The Conjuring its own backstory...It's the same old jump scares, the same old deafening audio stabs - the same old cliches and dull, lazy secondhand ideas.\" - Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian", "time": "13:51:00"}

Warner Bros. could celebrate not only the month's biggest debut but also having the week's top two films. Christopher Nolan's \"Dunkirk\" followed in second with $11.4 million in its fourth weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.\n\nEven amid an especially weak August, the well-reviewed horror sequel and modestly budgeted \"Annabelle: Creation\" found eager audiences.\n\n\"That we were able to do $35 million in what is a very sluggish marketplace was very impressive,\" said Jeffrey Goldstein, Warner Bros.' distribution chief. \"We all know that moviegoing begets moviegoing and right now it's a dip in the content overall.\"\n\nThe film, the third to spiral out of 2013's \"The Conjuring,\" cost only about $15 million to make. More sequels and spinoffs are being developed in what has become for Warner Bros. a steadily profitable horror franchise bent on old-school frights. The \"Annabelle\" offshoot centres on a possessed doll.\n\nLast week's top film, the poorly received Stephen King adaptation \"The Dark Tower,\" slid dramatically. The Sony Pictures release, starring Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey, toppled nearly 60 per cent on its second weekend with an estimated $7.9 million.\n\nThe week's other new entry, the Open Road animated release \"Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature,\" edged just above \"The Dark Tower\" with $8.9 million. That was well below the 2014 debut of the original, \"The Nut Job,\" which opened with $19.4 million.\n\nBut the solid returns for \"Annabelle: Creation\" did little to counter the box-office slide. Ahead of the weekend, the domestic box office was 11 per cent off the pace of 2016's summer. This weekend was also down considerably from the same timeframe last year, when \"Suicide Squad\" was leading the box office despite brutal reviews.\n\nSome of July's bright spots, however, have continued into August. The summer's top comedy, \"Girls Trip,\" will soon surpass $100 million domestically. The movie, starring Jada Pinkett Smith and Queen Latifah, took in $6.5 million in its fourth week to bring its cumulative total to $97.2 million. It may end up doubling the gross of its closest summer comedy competition: the starrier and pricey \"Baywatch\" ($58.1 million in its entire run).\n\nIn limited release, the A24 crime thriller \"Good Time,\" starring Robert Pattinson, debuted with a robust $34,000 per-screen average on four screens. That was bettered, though, by the $47,000 screen-average of Neon's \"Ingrid Goes West,\" with Aubrey Plaza, on three screens. Both films expand in coming weeks.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theatres according to comScore. Where available, the latest international numbers also are included. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP", "time": "17:26:00"}

Entertainment) (Warner Bros. Entertainment)\n\nWhat is it about dolls that is so scary? Just the sight of a loose doll eyeball or a leg, separated from its corporeal context, can send a shiver down the spine. Dolls are so easily, effectively creepy that the tossed off prologue of \"The Conjuring\" generated a breakout star. Now, the evil porcelain doll Annabelle has a franchise of her own, with \"Annabelle,\" and the latest, \"Annabelle: Creation,\" a prequel of a prequel that director David F. Sandberg ably spins into a satisfyingly spooky origin story.\n\nSandberg made a bit of a sensation last year with his clever horror debut, \"Lights Out,\" and his command of cinematography, lighting, production design and sound makes \"Annabelle: Creation\" a fine heir to the legacy of \"The Conjuring\" and \"The Conjuring 2\" auteur James Wan. Like Wan, Sandberg uses computer generated ghouls and demons sparingly, relying instead on practical in-camera effects like complex camera movements, sound, lighting and focus to hold, direct and re-direct our attention, building suspense and anticipation.\n\nSo where did this creepy doll come from? \"Annabelle\" writer Gary Dauberman offers up a tale that fits like a jigsaw into the extended \"Conjuring\" cinematic universe. She was hand-crafted by a dollmaker, Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia), in the 1940s. Twelve years later, they open their home to group of young orphan girls and their guardian, Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman), hoping to bring some life back after mourning the loss of their young daughter, Annabelle, tragically killed in an accident over a decade earlier. The young women are grateful for their generosity, despite the rambling Victorian's remote location and proliferation of random doll parts.\n\nThe thing about forbidden rooms is that they never stay closed and they're ultimately never worth exploring, and this proves to be true in \"Annabelle: Creation.\" All it takes is some curious wandering, and soon, the glassy-eyed doll is wreaking violent psychological and physical havoc on sweet Janice (Talitha Bateman), who wears a leg brace after a bout with polio.\n\nAll the performances are worthy of note, especially Bateman, who offers up a wonderfully wide-ranging turn; also strong are LaPaglia and Miranda Otto as his bedridden wife, Esther. But the star is easily saucer-eyed 11-year-old Lulu Wilson, who plays the plucky Linda. Wilson is proving to be quite the scream queen, after her memorable turn in last year's \"Ouija: Origin of Evil,\" and she's a fantastically committed actress, who seems in on the joke and wise beyond her years.\n\nIt's simply a treat to watch Sandberg's style on display in \"Annabelle: Creation,\" filled with circling dolly shots that reveal and conceal evil in torturously teasing ways, effective narrative use of practical lighting for dramatic effect, and heart-pounding sound effects and a score of screaming strings. The film relies more on spooky bumps and jumps than overwhelmingly horrific violence or gore (though it definitely does have its moments), and Sandberg nails the tone that is equal parts scary and winking at the ridiculousness of it all.\n\n\"Annabelle: Creation,\" written and directed by men, is a female-centered horror film with a palpable feminist bent. Girls and women aren't sexualized, or presented as objects on screen. They're the subjects: capable heroes, grisly villains, and tragic victims as well. In tangling with this group of feisty girls, Annabelle has become a true horror icon.", "time": "01:26:00"}

His masterfully unnerving 24-track Annabelle: Creation film score offers a potent dimension of eeriness that magnifies the suspenseful discomfort when set against picture.\n\n\"It's always a joy to collaborate with David F. Sandberg; not only is he of course a master filmmaker, but he's also a great musician,\" says Wallfisch about the Annabelle: Creation director. \"His deep understanding of what a score can bring to the table in such a finely nuanced, beautifully crafted piece of cinema as Annabelle: Creation, gave me a lot of freedom to think outside the box.\n\n\"Our only rule was everything in the score had to be acoustic; as the drama is set in the 1950s, everything needed to feel authentic to the time,\" Wallfisch further explained. \"As a supplement to the large orchestra we used on the score, we utilized a whole bunch of dusty toy instruments from the 1950s, with one in particular appearing more than any other - a seemingly innocent sounding Jaymar toy piano. Just the kind of instrument you might catch Annabelle herself playing...\"\n\nFrom New Line Cinema comes \"Annabelle: Creation,\" with David F. Sandberg helming the follow up to 2014's hugely successful \"Annabelle.\" The new film is once again produced by Peter Safran and James Wan, who previously partnered on \"The Conjuring\" movies.\n\nIn \"Annabelle: Creation,\" several years after the tragic death of their little girl, a doll maker and his wife welcome a nun and six girls from a shuttered orphanage into their home. They soon become the target of the doll maker's possessed creation, Annabelle.\n\nSandberg directed from a screenplay by Gary Dauberman, who also wrote \"Annabelle.\" The film stars Stephanie Sigman, Talitha Bateman, Lulu Wilson, Philippa Coulthard, Grace Fulton, Lou Lou Safran, Samara Lee, Tayler Buck, with Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto.

There is a tragic story, a creepy old house, a possessed doll, and children exploring a strange place.\n\nIn the opening scenes of Annabelle: Creation, a doll maker and his wife, portrayed by Miranda Otto and Anthony LaPaglia, lose their only daughter in a horrible accident. After remaining childless for 12 long years, the couple decides to open their enormously creepy old house to a small group of female orphans. The girls are supervised by Sister Charlotte, a nun portrayed by Stephanie Sigman.\n\nTalitha Bateman is perhaps the breakout star of Annabelle: Creation. Even at age 15, Bateman gives a stellar performance as the delicate and polio afflicted orphan Janice. Not as strong as the other girls, it is Talitha Bateman's Janice who first explores the house as the other children play outside.\n\nWhile Annabelle: Creation hardly breaks any new ground in horror, with no new monsters, no new take on demonology or any sort of new creation or innovation at all, it is the archetypical familiarity of Annabelle: Creation that somehow delivers the film's enchanting power.\n\nDirector David F. Sandberg \"embraces that well-trodden ground\" of the horror genre in Annabelle: Creation. C-Net reviewer Jennifer Bisset so beautifully explains with an example.\n\n\"[Sandberg's] heroine, this time [is] one who's not only an orphan but also has polio in one leg. The impairment of her crutch and subtle creaks of her leg brace add another tense layer to the fear she'll make it out OK.\"\n\nAnnabelle: Creation actress Talitha Bateman is archetypical in her role as Janice. C-Net elaborates on how Talitha Bateman stirs memories of other young girls in older movies.\n\n\"In her light blue dress, Janice evokes heroines from other movies. She's Alice in Wonderland as she remains brave and curious despite her circumstances, then Ophelia from \"Pan's Labyrinth\" as she explores the house filled with locked rooms, keys and a doll's house.\"\n\nWhile Annabelle: Creation is a prequel to the original Annabelle and a part of the Conjuring franchise, it is easily a stand alone movie. Creation is not dependent at all on the B-grade original, or any other Conjuring films.\n\nAnnabelle: Creation is not high tech or a special effects dependent movie by any stretch. With a budget of only $15 million dollars according to Variety, this film relies on the same kind of plot building, tension building pressure cooker recipe for terror that great horror movies have relied on for over half a century.\n\nDavid F. Sandberg's Annabelle: Creation with Talitha Bateman, Anthony LaPaglia, and Miranda Otto, has a timeless horror movie quality with no campy gimmicks. Talitha Bateman's classic look, coupled with the antique look of the doll gives an eerily unsettling impression.\n\nAnnabelle: Creation relies heavily on the talents of young Talitha Bateman, who portrays Janice. Anthony O'Connor of Film Ink gives his impression.\n\n\"Director David F. Sandberg (Lights Out) knows how to skillfully stage a spooky sequence, and Janice's nocturnal visits to Annabelle's old bedroom are particularly well-executed.\"\n\nRELATED REPORTS FROM THE INQUISITR\n\n'Annabelle: Creation' Gets 100 Percent Rating One Month Before Release -- How Terrifying Is This Movie?\n\n'Annabelle: Creation' Will Begin The First Horror-Themed Cinematic Universe\n\n'Annabelle: Creation' Trailer Will Scare The Hell Out Of You [Video]\n\nAnnabelle: Creation, with Talitha Bateman, Anthony LaPaglia, and Miranda Otto may well be the best summer horror flick of 2017.", "time": "08:58:00"}

Because there's nothing left on the calendar that's expected to top the opening of the New Line horror title by Labor Day weekend. After giving us the summer's highest grossing movie Wonder Woman, the sleeper Dunkirk, and this weekend's Annabelle: Creation, Warner Bros. will literally be responsible for juicing the box office again on Sept. 8 with New Line's Stephen King feature adaptation It. Many rivals are already expecting that pic to clear at least $50M. Even if Annabelle: Creation opens to $25M, it will still be a solid debut as New Line Cinema only spent $15M before P&A on this doll-goes-bad movie. Previews start Thursday at 7PM. Already Fandango is seeing brisk advance ticket sales for Annabelle: Creation that's outstripping that of Annabelle and last summer's Don't Breathe ($26.4M).\n\nThe first Annabelle was an enormous cash cow with a shoestring production cost of $6.5M and a total global haul of $256.9M, roughly 33% of that coming from U.S./Canada. Annabelle: Creation should ultimately send the Conjuring franchise, currently numbering three pics at $895M, past the $1 billion mark. Annabelle: Creation arrives to cinemas with the Good Housekeeping sign of approval for horror fans -James Wan's producer credit- and that goes a long way at the B.O. David F. Sandberg, who directed last summer's profitable horror hit Lights Out ($149M global B.O., $4.5M production cost), is in the helmer's chair here for Annabelle: Creation. Further proof that Annabelle 2 is really beautiful and not some ugly piece of plastic: She has a great Rotten Tomatoes score of 82% fresh. New Line previewed the prequel to crowds at the Los Angeles Film Festival back in June and showed it off in San Diego on Comic-Con's Wednesday preview night last month.\n\nThe R-rated Annabelle: Creation takes place in the 1950s. A dollmaker (Anthony LaPaglia) and his wife, following the death of their daughter, invite in a Nun and a bunch of orphans. Except the guests can't stay out of the doll's locked room, and of course that's when everything goes sideways.\n\nWarner Bros. will also relish third place with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk which in week 4 is estimated to decline a mere 35% for a No. 3 take of $11.1M. Over the last two days, the British World War II movie has topped the weekday box office and has a running total stateside through 19 days of $138.6M, which is 15% ahead of Nolan's last movie Interstellar. That pic finaled at $188M stateside.\n\nIn second place will be Open Road's sequel The Nutjob 2: Nutty by Nature which will pull in between $12M-$14M at 4,003 venues. For an independent animated feature, the first film, which Open Road also handled, posted a $19.4M opening in January 2014 and legged out a 3.3x to $64.2M domestic. That's very good. Open Road picked up stateside rights to the sequel. Similar to the first movie, Nutjob 2 cost around $40M with Red Rover, Toonbox Entertainment, Gulfstream Pictures, Shanghai Hoongman serving as producers. Cal Brunker (Escape From Planet Earth) directs with a voice cast that includes Will Arnett, Maya Rudolph, Katherine Heigl, Jackie Chan, Isabela Moner, Gabriel Iglesias, Bobby Moynihan, Bobby Cannavale, Peter Stormare, and Jeff Dunham. Previews start at 5PM tomorrow.\n\nAnalysts foresee Sony/Media Rights Capital's fantasy genre-mashup The Dark Tower tumbling by at least 60% in weekend 2 for $7.6M. In its first five days, the Stephen King adaptation has made $23.6M.\n\nLionsgate has its adaptation of Jeannette Walls' New York Times bestselling memoir The Glass Castle which will be platformed through the month, starting off in roughly 1,400 venues, in order to build buzz among adults. The hope here is for a $5M start with a $3k-$4K per theater average. Walls, portrayed by Room Oscar winner Brie Larson, grew up with deeply dysfunctional, yet uniquely vibrant parents, as she journeyed toward acceptance and fulfillment. Her father Rex (Harrelson) was an alcoholic, and her mother Rose Mary (Watts) was a painter. In her memoir, Walls details her calamities which included her father siphoning away the mother's paycheck to the point where the family starved.

Director David F. Sandberg's \"Annabelle: Creation\" leans heavy toward the second category.\n\n\"Annabelle: Creation\" is a prequel to 2014's \"Annabelle,\" which told the story of a demon attached to a really ugly doll. It opens with a brief prologue where a happy young doll maker named Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia) and his wife, Esther (Miranda Otto), lose their young daughter Bee (Samara Lee) in a car accident on the way home from church.\n\nFast-forward 12 years, and Samuel and Esther, still in mourning, have offered to let a group of orphaned young girls stay in their large, creepy rural home. In the interim, some kind of mysterious accident has left Esther bedridden, so only Samuel emerges to welcome Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman) and her girls.\n\nWe watch the story from the perspective of the girls, and primarily through Janice (Talitha Bateman) and her best friend Linda (Lulu Wilson), who are isolated from the other girls because polio has compromised Janice's mobility. Samuel has generously opened his home to the girls, but he comes across as tense and foreboding, sternly warning them to stay out of the locked bedroom that used to belong to Bee.\n\nSo, naturally, that same night Janice enters the room and frees a demon attached to an absurdly hideous-looking doll in a white dress -- Annabelle!\n\nFrom here, the plot unfolds like countless before it: Strange things start happening -- mostly at night -- people make increasingly poor decisions and, as the threat gets more and more dangerous, the principal characters slowly piece together the story of what is causing all the ruckus.\n\nStrangely, even though \"Annabelle: Creation\" is a prequel, the origin story content -- the where-did-Annabelle-come-from bit that you'd think would be the basis for the movie -- is relegated to a late flashback. Then again, asking too many questions in horror movies like this feels beside the point.\n\nFrom the comically evil-looking demon doll that no clear-thinking parent or kid would touch with a 10-foot pole, to the textbook jump scares, to the explain-everything expository flashback just before the third act, there's little if anything in \"Annabelle: Creation\" that horror fans won't have seen before, many, many times over. Horror movies often depend on their characters doing dumb things in order to drive their plots, and the cast of \"Annabelle: Creation\" goes out of their way to do some spectacularly dumb things.\n\nBut even if you can accuse Sandberg's film of being unoriginal and formulaic, at the same time you have to admire how well the director pulls the tension strings along the way, and really has a good time scaring his audience.\n\nFor all its faults -- Sandburg could drop at least 15 minutes off his 109-minute running time -- \"Annabelle: Creation\" is a pretty fun horror movie to watch in a group (and comparably soft for its R-rating). Most of the time, you can see the scares coming a mile away, but Sandberg is still able to build suspense in a way that creates the kind of frights that have you laughing at the same time.\n\n\"Annabelle: Creation\" isn't an original horror movie, but in its best moments, it is a very fun one. Even if you forget the whole thing by the next day, sometimes that's enough.\n\n\"Annabelle: Creation\" is rated R for horror violence and terror; running time: 109 minutes.", "time": "14:03:00"}

"body": "Warning: MAJOR SPOILERS ahead for Annabelle: Creation, Annabelle and The Conjuring\n\n-\n\nAnnabelle: Creation marks the third cinematic outing for the eponymous doll, after being introduced in The Conjuring and then featured in the spin-off Annabelle, and her latest movie reveals new details about Annabelle's demonic and human origins. The prequel film opens in the mid-forties, with a wordless credit sequence depicting the creation of the doll by toymaker Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia). It's the first of a limited edition run by Mullins, and also the last after tragedy strikes the family.\n\nSamuel and his wife Esther (Mirando Otto) have a daughter whom they fondly call Bee (their \"busy bee\"), who is sadly run down by a car and killed in a freak accident near their home. Fast forward 12 years, and the Mullins have opened their home up to six orphan girls and a nun, having never had any more children, and to try and atone for the guilt they feel for causing the demonic possession of the doll.\n\nAfter the death of Bee - whose real name is Annabelle - the parents are left distraught. They want to see their little girl again and pray to anything and everything for the opportunity to be reunited - even to Satan. Well, someone downstairs hears their prayers and pretends to be their daughter in order to find away to stay and pray on innocents souls on Earth. The Ram demon manipulates them both, Esther especially, by using Bee's image to persuade the couple to let it use the doll as an anchor to stay in their world. They agree, but soon realize that the little girl running around their home is not their daughter, and when Esther confronts it she is attacked and has an eye gouged out.\n\nTalitha Bateman as Janice in Annabelle: Creation.\n\nThe Mullins contact the Catholic church in order to exorcize the demon, but realize that it is too powerful to separate from the doll, so instead they lock it in the closet of Bee's room, which is lined with \"the word of God\" - a.k.a. pages from the bible. For 12 years, the demonic doll sits dormant in their home, with the couple becoming more reclusive and Esther not leaving the house after her attack. It's only when the Mullins let the orphans into their home to live that the evil within the Annabelle doll awakens, sensing the young souls entering, and begins targeting the most vulnerable, Janis (Talitha Bateman), a polio-stricken young girl who needs crutches. No thanks to Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman), the other girls and the Mullins, the demon eventually takes Janis' soul and her body becomes possessed by the evil spirit.\n\nBy the end of the film, Sister Charlotte and the girls manage to survive, but the demon Janis who has escaped. The doll is taken by the cops instead as evidence and put in the trunk of their car by the girls, who symbolically slam the lid shut on it. While they find another orphanage, Janis has ended up in another girl, but is now going by the name Annabelle. She becomes the adopted daughter of the Higgins (Kerry O'Malley and Brian Howe), which finally connects the original Annabelle with this prequel. The demonic Janis is the Annabelle Higgins who murders her parents in their family home, next to the house of Mia and John Form (Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton), who coincidentally end up with the Annabelle doll.\n\nAs screenwriter for both Annabelle and Annabelle: Creation, it seems Gary Dauberman has slightly retconned the mythology of the demonic doll from the original film. The implication in Annabelle is that the ritual sacrifice made by Anabelle Higgins (by slitting her throat and letting her blood drip on the doll) caused the Ram demon to enter the doll, but the prequel makes it clear that the Ram demon was always inside of the toy and simply used it as a conduit again after she killed herself. The prequel also contradicts the identity of the seven-year-old ghost seen in Annabelle, said to be Annabelle Higgins, and the backstory of the doll laid out in The Conjuring.\n\nThe Annabelle doll in The Conjuring\n\nThe doll comes into the possession of demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) from two nursing students and their male friend. Like the Mullins, the roommates say they were asked by the ghost Annabelle - who they are told died on the property by a psychic - to be allowed to possess the doll so she could stick around. The nurses' story is actually based on the \"true\" story of Annabelle the doll, which was actually of the Raggedy Ann variety and given to a nursing student by her mother in 1970. After the doll began moving around and leaving parchment notes, she called in a medium who told them the doll was inhabited by the spirit of a dead girl named \"Annabelle Higgins.\"\n\nAnnabelle: Creation has retconned this idea, as we now know that Annabelle Higgins didn't die in that property and that the Ram demon was already using the doll as a conduit. However, the producers could explain away the seven-year-old ghost's appearance in Annabelle and mention in The Conjuring by suggesting that the demon is actually continuing to use the facade of Annabelle Mullins which others have wrongly assumed is Annabelle Higgins.\n\nNow that we know the origins of the doll, it doesn't mean it might not pop again in future instalments of The Conjuring franchise and with the famous demonic nun making a brief appearance in Annabelle: Creation, the sinister doll may return the favour in 2018's The Nun too.\n\nNext: Annabelle: Creation Ending & Post-Credits Scenes Explained Key Release Dates Annabelle: Creation release date: Aug 11, 2017 ShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment ThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!

Warner Bros. could celebrate not only the month's biggest debut but also having the week's top two films. Christopher Nolan's \"Dunkirk\" followed in second with $11.4 million in its fourth weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.\n\nEven amid an especially weak August, the well-reviewed horror sequel and modestly budgeted \"Annabelle: Creation\" found eager audiences.\n\n\"That we were able to do $35 million in what is a very sluggish marketplace was very impressive,\" said Jeffrey Goldstein, Warner Bros.' distribution chief. \"We all know that moviegoing begets moviegoing and right now it's a dip in the content overall.\"\n\nThe film, the third to spiral out of 2013's \"The Conjuring,\" cost only about $15 million to make. More sequels and spinoffs are being developed in what has become for Warner Bros. a steadily profitable horror franchise bent on old-school frights. The \"Annabelle\" offshoot centres on a possessed doll.\n\nLast week's top film, the poorly received Stephen King adaptation \"The Dark Tower,\" slid dramatically. The Sony Pictures release, starring Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey, toppled nearly 60 per cent on its second weekend with an estimated $7.9 million.\n\nThe week's other new entry, the Open Road animated release \"Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature,\" edged just above \"The Dark Tower\" with $8.9 million. That was well below the 2014 debut of the original, \"The Nut Job,\" which opened with $19.4 million.\n\nBut the solid returns for \"Annabelle: Creation\" did little to counter the box-office slide. Ahead of the weekend, the domestic box office was 11 per cent off the pace of 2016's summer. This weekend was also down considerably from the same timeframe last year, when \"Suicide Squad\" was leading the box office despite brutal reviews.\n\nSome of July's bright spots, however, have continued into August. The summer's top comedy, \"Girls Trip,\" will soon surpass $100 million domestically. The movie, starring Jada Pinkett Smith and Queen Latifah, took in $6.5 million in its fourth week to bring its cumulative total to $97.2 million. It may end up doubling the gross of its closest summer comedy competition: the starrier and pricey \"Baywatch\" ($58.1 million in its entire run).\n\nIn limited release, the A24 crime thriller \"Good Time,\" starring Robert Pattinson, debuted with a robust $34,000 per-screen average on four screens. That was bettered, though, by the $47,000 screen-average of Neon's \"Ingrid Goes West,\" with Aubrey Plaza, on three screens. Both films expand in coming weeks.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theatres according to comScore. Where available, the latest international numbers also are included. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP", "time": "17:13:00"}

While the internet is currently bursting with articles about how poorly Hollywood's summer films are performing at the box office - at least when compared to previous years - that doesn't look likely to prevent Annabelle: Creation - the latest spinoff of The Conjuring franchise - from scaring up some serious profit margins before the end of its theatrical run.\n\nCreation will be only the latest Conjuring movie to rule the box office. James Wan's original film raked in a mammoth $318 million worldwide on a budget of only $20 million, while direct sequel The Conjuring 2 earned $320 million on a budget of $40 million. 2014's Annabelle spinoff - to which Creation is a prequel - really brought home the bacon, hauling in $256 million worldwide on the back of a tiny $6.5 million budget. It remains to be seen if Creation will end up in those leagues, but projections have it off to a good start.\n\nRelated: Where Annabelle: Creation Fits in The Conjuring Timeline\n\nAccording to Deadline, Annabelle: Creation is expected to knock Sony's critically panned adaptation of Stephen King's The Dark Tower right off the #1 spot, with an opening weekend take estimated to come in above $30 million. While that's less than Annabelle 2014's $37 million opening, it'll still be enough to double Creation's reported $15 million budget. The conventional wisdom is that a Hollywood film needs to make back at least double its budget to break even, after marketing costs. That means Creation will be nearly in the black after a single weekend.\n\nFor reference, fellow low budget horror flick Don't Breathe opened in August last year to the tune of $26 million, and ended up topping out at $157 million worldwide. While Don't Breathe's budget was a smaller $9.9 million, Creation is also likely to open a few million dollars higher. Needless to say, if Creation tops out at Don't Breathe's level or greater before leaving theaters, the spinoff prequel will be an unqualified financial success for studio Warner Bros.\n\nAnnabelle: Creation is also a critical success, currently sitting at a solid 82 percent fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. Creation's release begins what looks to be a big few weeks for WB when it comes to horror, as their re-adaptation of Stephen King's IT menaces theaters on September 8. Considering the amount of advance buzz surrounding that film, it's hard to imagine it not doing even better at the box office than Annabelle.\n\nMore: James Wan Offers Conjuring 3 & Crooked Man Updates\n\nSource: Deadline\n\nKey Release Dates Annabelle: Creation release date: Aug 11, 2017 ShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment ThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!

The horror film is directed by David F. Sandberg (Lights Out) and premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival in June.

They soon become the target of the doll maker's possessed creation, Annabelle.\n\nIn an interview with ComingSoon.net Sandberg talked about his experience shooting a horror film with child actors. \"It's funny. You hear people say, \"Never work with animals or kids.\" I used to think that that was about kids sucking as actors. But that's not the case, at least not with any of the kids I've worked with. They're all fantastic actors and they're so dedicated. They show up on time. They know all the lines. They're super professional. The only drawback and the real reason not to work with them is the hours. You only get a set amount of hours. Once you reach that time, it's over. The kid's out. When you work with an adult, you keep going with a scene until you're done with it. So that's kind of stressful in working with a child actor.\"\n\nAnnabelle: Creation is rated 14A.", "time": "15:10:00"}

Just the sight of a loose doll eyeball or a leg, separated from its corporeal context, can send a shiver down the spine. Now evil porcelain doll Annabelle has a franchise of her own.\"Annabelle: Creation,\" the follow-up to 2014's \"Annabelle,\" is a prequel that director David F. Sandberg ably spins into a satisfyingly spooky origin story.\n\nSandberg created a bit of a sensation last year with his clever horror debut, \"Lights Out,\" and his command of cinematography, lighting, production design and sound makes \"Annabelle: Creation\" a fine heir to the legacy of \"The Conjuring\" and \"The Conjuring 2\" auteur James Wan. Like Wan, Sandberg uses computer-generated ghouls and demons sparingly, relying instead on complex camera movements, sound, lighting and focus to hold our attention and build suspense.\n\nSo where did this creepy doll come from? \"Annabelle\" writer Gary Dauberman offers up a tale that fits like a jigsaw into the extended \"Conjuring\" cinematic universe. She was created by a dollmaker, Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia), in the 1940s. Twelve years later, he opens his home to group of young orphan girls and their guardian, Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman). He's still healing after the loss of his young daughter, Annabelle, who was tragically killed in an accident more than a decade earlier. The young women are grateful for the dollmaker's generosity, despite the rambling Victorian's remote location.\n\nThe thing about forbidden rooms is that they never stay closed and they're ultimately never worth exploring. This proves to be true in \"Annabelle: Creation.\" All it takes is some curious wandering, for the glassy-eyed doll to begin wreaking violent psychological and physical havoc on the visitors, including sweet Janice (Talitha Bateman), who wears a leg brace after a bout with polio.\n\nAll the performances are worthy of note, especially Bateman, who offers up a wonderfully wide-ranging turn. Also strong are LaPaglia and Miranda Otto as his bedridden wife, Esther. But the star here is easily saucer-eyed 11-year-old Lulu Wilson, who plays the plucky Linda. Wilson is proving to be quite the scream queen. (She was memorable in last year's \"Ouija: Origin of Evil.\") She's a fantastically committed actress who seems to be in on the horror joke and she's wise beyond her years.\n\nIt's simply a treat to watch Sandberg's style on display in \"Annabelle: Creation,\" which is filled with circling dolly shots that reveal and conceal evil in torturously teasing ways. The movie also employs practical lighting for dramatic effect, heart-pounding sound effects and a score of screaming strings. It relies more on spooky bumps and jumps than overwhelmingly horrific violence or gore (though it definitely does have its moments), and Sandberg cleverly nails the scary tone while winking at the ridiculousness of it all.\n\n'Annabelle: Creation'\n\nThree stars\n\nout of four stars\n\nRated R; horror violence, terror\n\n1 hour, 49 minutes\n\nOpens wide Friday; some screenings Thursday\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2vTOw8M", "time": "20:30:00"}

Warner Bros. could celebrate not only the month's biggest debut but also having the week's top two films. Christopher Nolan's \"Dunkirk\" followed in second with $11.4 million in its fourth weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.\n\nEven amid an especially weak August, the well-reviewed horror sequel and modestly budgeted \"Annabelle: Creation\" found eager audiences.\n\n\"That we were able to do $35 million in what is a very sluggish marketplace was very impressive,\" said Jeffrey Goldstein, Warner Bros.' distribution chief. \"We all know that moviegoing begets moviegoing and right now it's a dip in the content overall.\"\n\nThe film, the third to spiral out of 2013's \"The Conjuring,\" cost only about $15 million to make. More sequels and spinoffs are being developed in what has become for Warner Bros. a steadily profitable horror franchise bent on old-school frights. The \"Annabelle\" offshoot centers on a possessed doll.\n\nLast week's top film, the poorly received Stephen King adaptation \"The Dark Tower,\" slid dramatically. The Sony Pictures release, starring Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey, toppled nearly 60 percent on its second weekend with an estimated $7.9 million.\n\nThe week's other new entry, the Open Road animated release \"Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature,\" edged just above \"The Dark Tower\" with $8.9 million. That was well below the 2014 debut of the original, \"The Nut Job,\" which opened with $19.4 million.\n\nBut the solid returns for \"Annabelle: Creation\" did little to counter the box-office slide. Ahead of the weekend, the domestic box office was 11 percent off the pace of 2016's summer. This weekend was also down considerably from the same timeframe last year, when \"Suicide Squad\" was leading the box office despite brutal reviews.\n\nSome of July's bright spots, however, have continued into August. The summer's top comedy, \"Girls Trip,\" will soon surpass $100 million domestically. The movie, starring Jada Pinkett Smith and Queen Latifah, took in $6.5 million in its fourth week to bring its cumulative total to $97.2 million. It may end up doubling the gross of its closest summer comedy competition: the starrier and pricey \"Baywatch\" ($58.1 million in its entire run).\n\nIn limited release, the A24 crime thriller \"Good Time,\" starring Robert Pattinson, debuted with a robust $34,000 per-screen average on four screens. That was bettered, though, by the $47,000 screen-average of Neon's \"Ingrid Goes West,\" with Aubrey Plaza, on three screens. Both films expand in coming weeks.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters according to comScore. Where available, the latest international numbers also are included. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP", "time": "16:49:00"}

A dozen years later in the early 1960s, with the missus a miserable bed-ridden recluse, Mullins offers his home as a refuge for six girls from a shuttered orphanage and their nun governess (Stephanie Sigman, \"War on Everybody\").\n\nNaturally -- or there wouldn't be a horror show -- this is not a good idea. The curious kids inadvertently release Annabelle from her metaphysical chains and all too soon all hell breaks loose.\n\nSandberg visually involves the audience, making us near participants in the childish make-believe games these often bored young women play as evil lurks nearby. Of the six, two stand out, both preadolescents: Janice (Talitha Bateman) limps after surviving polio and is now an outsider, but best-friended and protected by the younger Linda (Lulu Wilson). They are mocked by the others, prototypical mean girls.\n\nSandberg photographs everyone so handsomely and the production and costume design are so enchanting, it's as if \"Annabelle: Creation\" were a European auteur's remembrance of days gone by.\n\nThis disconnect between the beautiful and the damned, with screeching horrifying spirits violently appearing to terrorize, maim and kill, makes \"Annabelle: Creation\" so jarring and disturbing. There's a strange years-later coda, one that directly connects to \"Annabelle\" and makes it possible for the three films to be seen consecutively as one ongoing story.", "time": "12:01:00"}

Every week we put together an informal list of box office picks for the upcoming weekend to offer readers a rough estimate of how new releases (and returning holdovers) will perform in theaters.\n\nFor a recap of last week's box office totals, read our box office wrap-up from The Dark Tower's opening weekend, and scroll to the bottom of this post to see how our picks matched up.\n\nFull disclosure: Box office predictions are not an exact science. We acknowledge our picks may not always be correct. For the sake of offering a jumping off point for discussion, here are our picks for the weekend of August 11 - 13, 2017.\n\nThis weekend, Annabelle: Creation opens in 3,502 theaters, The Nut Job 2: Nutty By Nature debuts 4,003 locations, and The Glass Castle plays in 1,461 theaters.\n\n#1 - Annabelle: Creation\n\nComing in first this week should be Annabelle: Creation (read our review), which is the latest installment in the Conjuring cinematic universe. Since the original film debuted in 2013, the franchise has been one of the most reliable performers in the horror genre, with last year's The Conjuring 2 earning $40.4 million in its opening weekend - en route to a $102.4 million domestic total. There's also high interest amongst casual audiences in spinoffs detailing the larger mythology of the world, as the first Annabelle film from 2014 was also a big commercial hit. Despite mostly negative reviews, that film made $37.1 million in its first three days, illustrating the demand for Conjuring-based scares.\n\nAs such, prospects are quite good for Creation, which is seen by many as a marked improvement over its predecessor. That word-of-mouth should give it a nice boost at the box office, especially since it's facing limited competition. It's been a while since a good horror movie hit the marketplace, and with the calendar at the end of summer, most of the high-profile offerings have already had their day at the multiplex. Annabelle: Creation is already off to a strong start based on the Thursday night preview screenings, setting the stage for a fruitful weekend. Projections have it pegged for about $30 million in the first three days.\n\n#2 - Dunkirk\n\nOur pick for second is Dunkirk (read our review), which continues to hold well after a few weeks of playing in theaters. Due to its widespread critical acclaim and its status as a must-see event on the biggest of screens, Christopher Nolan's World War II drama has done excellent business since it opened, totaling $140.5 million domestically as of this writing. It should continue to draw in sizable crowds, even as its figures start to decline a bit.\n\n#3 - The Nut Job 2: Nutty By Nature\n\nComing in third should be The Nut Job 2: Nutty By Nature, the sequel to the 2014 animated movie that brought in $64.2 million domestically during its theatrical run. Obviously, the property does not have the prowess of a studio like Pixar or DreamWorks, but it's managed to do well enough within its target demographic in the past. One hurdle this followup will have to overcome, however, is the fact that it's opening with very limited fan fare, meaning awareness could be an issue as it tries to stand out over some of the more noteworthy holdovers. The early reviews won't be of much help either, as Nut Job 2 is widely panned. Projections have it pegged for $10 million in its first three days, which is well below the original.\n\n#4 - The Dark Tower\n\nLook for last week's champ, The Dark Tower (read our review), to fall the fourth in its second weekend. The long-gestating adaptation of Stephen King's novels emerged victorious in its opening frame, but did so with an uninspiring $19.1 million. It narrowly edged out Dunkirk, and didn't have much traction with casual audiences. Now that the film has been released and the anticipation for it has died down, it looks like it's set to take a massive drop.\n\n#5 - Girls Trip\n\nRounding out the top five should be Girls Trip. The comedy has done very well in its run so far, taking advantage of the positive reviews and audience word-of-mouth. It has a monopoly on the genre for the time being, so it should continue to post high numbers.\n\nLast Week's Recap\n\nOur Picks:\n\nThe Dark Tower Dunkirk Detroit Girls Trip The Emoji Movie\n\nActuals:\n\nThe Dark Tower Dunkirk The Emoji Movie Girls Trip Kidnap\n\nNext Week: Logan Lucky, The Hitman's Bodyguard, and more!\n\nSources: Box Office Mojo (Release Schedule), Box Office (Opening Weekend Projections)\n\nShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment ThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!

From stem to stern it has everything needed to scare an audience, but is incapable of actually doing so. Like many of this year's sequels, there is probably no one person or group responsible for Annabelle: Creation's inadequacies. Like the poor orphan girls at the center of horror producer James Wan's (the Saw series) expanding horror mythology, Annabelle: Creation suffers from the actions of a group of people who have made something because they wanted to with no thought what to do with it once it was here.\n\nIn Annabelle: Creation's case, they are the actions of rural doll maker Sam Mullins and his wife (LaPaglia and Otto in possibly the most thankless roles of their careers) after suffering the loss of their daughter, Annabelle. When a mysterious force they believe to be Annabelle arrives in their farmhouse, they can't resist the urge to accept it, only to discover they've let something monstrous in. And then to compound their foolishness, they agree to give their home over to the Catholic Church to serve as an orphanage for a group of girls who have nowhere else to go and no idea what they're about to walk into.\n\nIn a more existential sense, it's because of the continued success of Wan's Conjuring series (Annabelle: Creation is a prequel to the prequel of the first Conjuring) and Wan's strange preoccupation with evil dolls. [Seriously, look through Wan's filmography for how many of his movies involve evil dolls in some way]. Four films in (and with at least one more Conjuring and another spin-off coming our way) the series has been a spectacular commercial success, which means new content has to be created and now before audience hunger for this new thing wears off and moves on to its next victim. Like the monster in the farmhouse, it must be served up a continuous banquet of the souls of the unwary.\n\nThe mercenary, somewhat cynical nature of Creation's creation is not a bad thing and in some ways a plus. A prequel of a prequel, it is so far removed the original that there is little need to try and force it into a complex mythology (there are attempts to do so anyway, but they are hardly the element which hobbles Annabelle: Creation). It is in many ways a blank canvas for director David Sandberg (Lights Out) to paint whatever he wants on it.\n\nThis can work: Ouija: Origins managed it to great effect (and against considerable odds) last year with very similar source material at hand. The big difference is a willingness to embrace tragedy, which Annabelle: Creation simply lacks. It wants to frighten you, but not scare you, and that lack of commitment ultimately cuts the legs out from under everyone involved.\n\nTucked away amongst the orphan girls are young Linda (Wilson), partly crippled after a bout of polio, and her best friend Janice (Bateman) who have sworn to stick together no matter what they may face. For Janice that means trying to save her friend from being possessed by the demonic spirit living in the farmhouse. Wilson and Bateman are by far the best part about Creation and Sandberg scores brutally effective performances from them, particularly Janice who has to confront situations which would make grown men run in fear. While Linda's experience strongly parallels another Linda from another very famous horror film, Sandberg and Wilson pull it off without feeling like copycats and for a moment offering up the sadness which must be a part of actual dread.\n\nBut Linda and Janice aren't the only ones in the farmhouse, they're surrounded by the rest of the orphanage who also must periodically flee from strange things following them in the dark... only for the lights to inevitably come on. Sandberg has a very clear mastery of the pace and tone horror needs to work. He calmly builds tension with slow reveals of opening doors and moving objects, often happening behind the characters where they can't see it but we can. Nothing engenders edge-of-the-seat thrills like dramatic irony, and the first half of Creation is filled with it.\n\nUnfortunately so is the second half. Rather than building to an escapable climax, Sandberg keeps putting off resolution and putting of resolution, using the same elements over and over which, by minute 75, have worn a bit thin. Worse, they never result in real cost - the characters keep facing almost conflicts which then vanish; most of them are the same at the end of the film as they were at the beginning.\n\nAnnabelle: Creation is a two-hour nothing burger, partly because someone decided the first film did well enough to deserve a sequel and partly through the race to fill that two hours no one seems to have asked why they were doing it. There is a lot of skill on display; everyone involved in this film is most certainly capable of making a fantastic horror film even as a sequel. But this isn't it.", "time": "20:16:00"}

"body": "The box office was in need of some good news after a week filled with dismal earnings reports, and Warner Bros./New Line's \"Annabelle: Creation\" was able to provide it with a strong opening Friday that signals a strong weekend total above analyst projections.\n\nThe $15 million horror prequel is currently on pace to make $36.5 million this weekend after making $15 million on Friday from 3,502 screens. That puts it very close to matching the $37.1 million opening the first \"Annabelle\" made in October 2014 en route to a $256.9 million global haul. Pre-weekend projections had \"Annabelle: Creation\" making $27-30 million this weekend. If more strong results on Saturday can push weekend estimates to $40 million, then the film will have matched the openings put forth by the \"Conjuring\" films, which \"Annabelle\" is a spin-off of. \"Annabelle: Creation\" currently has a score of 68 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and a B on CinemaScore.\n\nAlso Read: 'Annabelle: Creation' Producer James Wan Tells Us What Scares Him Most - And It's Not a Creepy Demon Doll\n\nThis also means that WB will take a 1-2 finish at the box office this weekend, as \"Dunkirk\" is taking advantage of weak competition to take the No. 2 spot with $10.5 million in its fourth weekend. That will push Nolan's Oscar contender past the $150 million domestic mark and put it close to passing $350 million worldwide.\n\nIn third is Open Road's \"The Nut Job 2,\" which is performing poorly as industry estimates put it at an $8-9 million opening after making $2.8 million from 4,002 screens on Friday. By comparison, the first \"Nut Job\" opened to a $19.4 million start in January 2014. Columbia/MRC's \"The Dark Tower\" is looking at a hard fall to fourth with $7.3 million in its second weekend, a 63 percent drop from its $19.5 million opening.\n\nAlso Read: Box Office Bummer: Why Movie Theater Companies Like AMC Just Lost $1.3 Billion\n\nCompleting the top 5 is Universal's \"Girls Trip,\" which will make an estimated $6.3 million in its fourth weekend to bring its domestic total to $97 million. That means the Queen Latifah-led comedy will become the first in its genre to pass the $100 million domestic mark this year. The No. 5 spot could be taken over by \"Spider-Man: Homecoming,\" which crossed the $300 million domestic mark on Friday and is currently estimated to make $6.2 million in its opening weekend.\n\nDown the list at No. 8 is Lionsgate's \"The Glass Castle, which is estimated to make $5 million from a targeted release of 1,461 screens. The drama based on the memoirs of Jeannette Walls has a 50 percent RT rating and earned $1.65 million on Friday. Finally, Annapurna's \"Detroit\" will drop out of the top 10 in its second weekend, making just $2.8 million and falling 60 percent from its lower-than-expected $7 million opening.", "time": "15:39:00"}

starring a demon-possessed doll might as well top the charts.\n\nThat appears to be the case for Warner Bros. and New Line's \"Annabelle: Creation.\" The fourth installment in what has become the \"Conjuring\" extended universe is casting its evil eye on about $25 million this weekend. Some tracking suggests it should earn $30 million. Either way, off a $15 million budget, the horror installment should be quite profitable.\n\nWhile the horror genre routinely beats out expectations, \"Annabelle 2\" looks to come in below the first \"Annabelle\" ($37.1 million); \"The Conjuring\" ($41.9 million); and \"The Conjuring 2\" ($40.4 million). David F. Sandberg directed the sequel about a dollmaker whose creation terrorizes a group of orphan girls. For those invested in the \"Conjuring\" canon, it serves as a prequel to the first \"Annabelle.\" Stephanie Sigman, Talitha Bateman, Anthony LaPaglia, and Miranda Otto star in the pic that critics have generally given a thumbs up to (it currently has an 80% on Rotten Tomatoes).\n\nThe horror sequel should steal the top spot on the domestic charts from the film adaptation of Stephen King's \"The Dark Tower,\" which led last weekend with only $19.2 million. The same could go for Open Road's animated sequel \"The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature,\" which is opening in 4,003 locations. The story of a group of animals who attempt to save their home from being bulldozed and turned into an amusement park, is aiming to make about $15 million. That's slightly below the first \"Nut Job\" movie, which opened to $19.4 million before going on to take in $120.9 million worldwide during its run.\n\nThat leaves Lionsgate's \"The Glass Castle,\" an adaptation of Jeannette Walls' popular 2005 memoir, which is tracking for a soft opening of $5 million, or at the most in the high single digits. The adult drama brings with it the star power of Brie Larson, Naomi Watts, and Woody Harrelson. Larson reunited with \"Short Term 12\" director Destin Daniel Cretton for the project, who helmed the project from a script he penned along with Andrew Lanham and Marti Noxon. The film, which has received mixed reviews, tells the story of Walls' dysfunctional and nomadic family life as a child.\n\nThe Weinstein Company's \"Wind River,\" which performed well at four locations last weekend, will expand to about 45. It's met, in limited release, by a number of fresh films including A24's \"Good Time\" starring Robert Pattinson, Neon's \"Ingrid Goes West,\" and Roadside Attractions' \"The Only Living Boy in New York.\"\n\nAll this during a weekend that could use a serious boost. Last weekend's total domestic gross came in below the opening weekend of just a single film -- \"Suicide Squad\" -- the year prior. As of Sunday, the summer box office was more than 10% behind last year, and the year was dragging by 3%. All eyes are on a few major releases at the end of the year to see if there's a possibility that ticket sales might recover.", "time": "22:05:00"}

"body": "Spooky dolls, a pack of chatty critters, and a family of nomads venture into the box office arena this weekend as the lackluster summer season enters the home stretch. While none of this week's newcomers are in a position to single-handedly make up 2017's 29.6 percent deficit over last year's May-August frame, the latest the Warner Bros./New Line Conjuring spin-off series could spark a jolt of energy across this traditionally slow month for mainstream movies (though last year at this time, Suicide Squad dominated with $133 million), likely scaring off its fellow newcomers -- which could struggle to stake a claim in the top five at all.\n\nSo, how will they fare against each other? Check out EW's Aug. 11-13 box office predictions below.\n\n1. Annabelle: Creation - $40 million\n\nAfter taking in an impressive $4 million from Thursday night previews, the horror spin-off is looking at a potential Conjuring series-best opening in the days ahead, with its preshow gross rocketing past The Conjuring 2's $3.4 million Thursday take (en route to a $40 million launch) on a modest $15 million budget. Given the lack of major horror hits in recent months, genre fans are starved for a thrill -- and judging by reviews (63 percent on Metacritic as of Friday) Annabelle: Creation will deliver.\n\n2. The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature - $13.5 million\n\nMuch like their live-action counterparts, animated comedies haven't made a significant impact in an oversaturated market in the recent past. So far this year, Despicable Me 3, despite notching a series-low total in North America, made $244.6 million, while Cars 3 underperformed with just under $150 million. Most recently, The Emoji Movie has grossed $57 million and counting based on a concept not tied to a pre-existing franchise. Though The Nut Job 2 has a built-in fan base ready to buy tickets, its predecessor didn't exactly light the market on fire back in 2014, pulling in a so-so $64.3 million. With negative reviews piling up (12 percent on Rotten Tomatoes with an average score of 3.8 out of 10), don't expect The Nut Job 2 to blossom beyond its forerunner.\n\n3. Dunkirk - $11 million\n\nChristopher Nolan's WWII epic has coasted through the start of the second half of 2017 with some of the best reviews of the year and heavy Oscar buzz in several above-the-line categories. Its potential to sustain through the awards race ahead is aided greatly by its stellar performance at the box office, dropping between 30 percent and 50 percent (uncharacteristic of a big-budget summer blockbuster) since its $50 million opening weekend. With little in terms of competition in its way this weekend, Dunkirk will stay in that range for another finish in the $10 million to $12 million range.\n\n4. Girls Trip - $6.8 million\n\nOne of the standout hits of an otherwise uneventful summer, Girls Trip (around $90 million as of Thursday) looks to be the first live-action comedy to cross the $100 million mark since Bad Moms traversed a similar track last year, continuing its slow descent down the top five as it aims to shed at least 40 percent in its fourth weekend.\n\n5. The Dark Tower - $6.6 million\n\nThough it topped the weekend box office last week, its $19.1 million debut marks one of the lowest chart-topping grosses in a year filled with big-budget disappointments. While Dark Tower's reported $60 million production costs are far less than other tentpole movies, the film will struggle to recoup that number in North America, as similar films tend to drop substantially -- between 50 percent and 70 percent -- over their sophomore weekends. Its planned worldwide rollout in the weeks ahead should help keep the film afloat, but not by much. With dismal reviews and lukewarm audience reception, expect The Dark Tower to make another $6 million to $8 million through Sunday.\n\nJockeying for positioning outside the top five, Brie Larson fronts an ensemble cast in The Glass Castle, her first big-screen reunion with Short Term 12 director Destin Daniel Cretton. Based on Jeannette Walls' popular 2005 memoir of the same name, the film follows a young woman who recounts family dysfunction among her unorthodox clan. The book has sold more than 3 million copies worldwide, meaning there's a pre-established audience already familiar with the film's source, but critics haven't been kind to the adaptation thus far (it stands at a middling 56 percent on Metacritic), and the film is opening at an estimated 1,500 theaters, a small number for a major release looking to rope in more than those who've read the book. Look for the film to take around $4 million this weekend.\n\nHot off a successful run at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, Robert Pattinson and the Safdie brothers bring their well-received thriller Good Time stateside for a limited run in the days ahead. It should be able to notch a substantial per-screen average from four theaters (via A24) thanks to dazzling reviews and Pattinson's lingering Twilight popularity. The project marks yet another prestigious turn on the specialty scene for the movie star, who also appeared in James Gray's Lost City of Z and David Cronenberg's Maps to the Stars, among others, following his star-making appearances in the Twilight films.\n\nElsewhere, Kate Beckinsale, Pierce Brosnan, and Jeff Bridges team for The Only Living Boy in New York, directed by former Spider-Man filmmaker Marc Webb. The specialty drama should muster up a decent per-theater average in limited release thanks to the mature crowd. Aubrey Plaza and Elizabeth Olsen also partner for the social media stalker flick Ingrid Goes West, debuting on three screens to near universal acclaim from critics.\n\nCheck back with EW on Sunday for our full report when weekend box office estimates roll in.", "time": "19:14:00"}

lowest No. 1 total since a third-week \"Split\" took the top spot with $14 million back in February, and the lowest No. 1 opening since the $13.3 million made by \"Chappie\" in March 2015. That means that the top spot at the box office is wide open, and Warner Bros./New Line's horror film \"Annabelle: Creation\" is looking to take that spot.\n\nIndependent trackers have the \"Annabelle\" prequel making $27-30 million from 3,502 screens this weekend, with WB projecting slightly lower at $25 million. The film is in position to make a solid profit with a production budget of $15 million and a lack of competition in the horror market until the release of \"It,\" another WB release produced by New Line. As Blumhouse has demonstrated, low-budget horror is proving to be a low-risk/high-reward genre that's performing well at the box office, and Warner Bros. will be looking to reap its potential in the coming weeks with this installment in James Wan's \"Conjuring\" franchise and a remake of one of the most famous Stephen King adaptations. The first \"Annabelle,\" which was released in October 2014, made Halloween bucks with a $37.1 million opening against a $6.5 million budget. It went on to gross $84 million domestic and $256.8 million worldwide.\n\nAlso Read: Coen Brothers Series 'The Ballad of Buster Scruggs' Going to Netflix\n\n\"Annabelle: Creation\" follows up on the first \"Annabelle\" by showing the origins of the titular evil doll as it terrorizes a group of orphaned girls who take shelter in the house of the doll's creator. The film is directed by David F. Sandberg from a script by Gary Dauberman, with James Wan and Peter Safran producing.\n\nAlso in wide release this week is Open Road's \"The Nut Job 2,\" which is projecting for a $15-17 million opening from 4,003 screens. Studio projections are set at $12-13 million. The first \"Nut Job\" was panned by critics in 2014 with a 10 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and a score for this sequel has yet to be entered. The film stars Will Arnett, Katherine Heigl, Jackie Chan, and Maya Rudolph. Cal Brunker directed the film and co-wrote it with Bob Barlen and Scott Bindley. Barlen, Harry Linden, and Sunghwan Kim are producers.\n\nFinally, there's Lionsgate's \"The Glass Castle,\" which is getting a targeted release of 1,400 screens and is projecting for an opening of around $5 million. Based on the best-selling memoirs of Jeannette Walls, the film stars Brie Larson as the author as she struggles to form her own life for herself while growing up in poverty with an alcoholic father (Woody Harrelson) and an eccentric mother (Naomi Watts). Destin Daniel Cretton is directing from a script he co-wrote with Andrew Lanham and Marti Noxon. Gil Netter and Ken Kao are producers.", "time": "20:36:00"}

came to inhabit a doll in this prequel to the 2014 hit \"Annabelle.\" Anthony LaPaglia stars. Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nEven if -- especially if -- you're a fan of horror movies, the idea of another \"Annabelle\" film probably scares you.\n\n\"Annabelle,\" the 2014 sequel to \"The Conjuring,\" was a massive disappointment, and not just because \"The Conjuring\" was so good. The sequel was a heavy-handed clunker, scary in places but lazy. Who needs another stab at it, so to speak?\n\nEveryone, evidently. \"Annabelle: Creation,\" a prequel to the events of \"The Conjuring,\" is a surprisingly effective horror film, which is to say it's scary in all the smart ways.\n\nRELATED: 'Annabelle: Creation' director David Sandberg can't get dark enough\n\nThe dumb ones, too -- this is a movie about a possessed doll, after all. That's part of the fun. But director David F. Sandberg, whose short film \"Lights Out\" is terrific, the resulting feature-length version a little less so, is a welcome addition to the \"Conjuring\" stable, adept as he is at stretching out the tension between scares till you're practically sweating, waiting for something horrible to happen to someone.\n\nAnd oh, it does.\n\nThe film begins with what the title suggests -- the literal creation of the doll, in the 1950s. Sam (Anthony LaPaglia), a doll maker, is putting the finishing touches on the first, and presumably only, doll in this particular line. No sooner is he done than his daughter, Bee (Samara Lee) -- real name Annabelle -- leaves him notes for a hide-and-seek game. The thing about a horror movie is that you can't watch an innocent game without a sense of foreboding. But Sam and Bee and wife and mother Esther (Miranda Otto) are happy, romping around in their giant house in the middle of nowhere.\n\nThen tragedy strikes, and we move forward 12 years. A bus pulls in at the home, with Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman) and a group of orphaned girls arriving; they'll be living here now. Sam is quiet and a little surly. Esther is bedridden, hidden behind a curtain in her bedroom. But they open their home to the girls -- except for Bee's room, which is locked and, Sam warns, stays that way.\n\nFor a while, anyway.\n\nMORE: Dear Hollywood: Please stop traumatizing us with scary doll movies\n\nThe youngest girls, Janice (Talitha Bateman), who had polio and walks with a brace and crutch, and Linda (Lulu Wilson), are shunted off by the older girls to the room where Esther made doll clothes. Of course it's tremendously creepy, even in the daylight. (More on that soon.)\n\nThen one night Janice hears a noise and sees the same note under the door Bee once left for her father: \"find me.\" She thinks it's the older girls playing around, so she follows, and winds up, of course, in Bee's room. It's preserved exactly as she left it, down to the dollhouse with working lights. In that house Janice finds a key that leads to a secret room. And in that room?\n\nWhat else? The doll.\n\nIt's eerie enough just sitting there in a rocking chair. But Sandberg, working from Gary Dauberman's script, works the scene perfectly. Is that the doll in the shadows? Where'd she go? It's probably no surprise that the guy who made a movie called \"Lights Out\" is adept at manipulating light and dark for maximum unease. It's certainly enjoyable.\n\nSo now it's on. In the manner of these things, many boxes still must be checked -- there have to be a few jump scares, agonizingly bad decisions must be made, people must die, secrets must be revealed. Check, check, check and check.\n\nMORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest\n\nBut there are also some nice detours from the usual horror-movie path. For instance, there's a scare scene in broad daylight (at least it begins there) -- a studio suggestion, Sandberg says. And the relationship between Janice and Linda goes from sweet to scary to heartbreaking. Risky business putting children front and center in this kind of movie, but Bateman and Wilson are good enough to make it work.\n\nThe ending gets the whole Annabelle mythology back on track (and includes a nod to the real doll, still in the collection of Lorraine Warren and her late husband, Ed, the paranormal investigators on whose work the \"Conjuring\" films are based).\n\n\"Annabelle: Creation\" isn't the equal of \"The Conjuring,\" or even \"The Conjuring 2,\" for that matter. But it's a well-made horror film and a solid addition to the canon.\n\nReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontz@arizonarepublic.com. Facebook: facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

The tale of the creepy, demonically possessed doll kicked off The Conjuring in 2013 when demonologists Ed and Elizabeth Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) seized the doll and safely encased it in a glass case in their occult museum to prevent it from wreaking any more havoc.\n\nAnd while the vintage toy only appeared in the film's opening scenes, it had a big enough impact on moviegoers that Warner Bros. realized the potential of a spinoff film featuring the character, and quickly put into play the spinoff film Annabelle, which was released in 2014. Following the massive box office success of Annabelle globally (it made $256.8 million globally on a $6.5 million budget), the studio got to work on Annabelle: Creation, a prequel that would examine the creation of the doll and how it came to attract demonic spirits.\n\nSet in the 1950s, the film centers on a dollmaker (Anthony LaPaglia) and his wife (Miranda Otto), and how the tragic loss of their young daughter led to intense prayers for to see her again. And while at first their prayers seem to conjure up sightings of their daughter's spirit, they come to realize that its an evil spirit that they eventually trap in their late daughter's room -- an entity that's unleashed when a nun and group of orphaned girls shuttered from their home stay move in with the couple and one of them becomes too curious about what lurks behind a certain door.\n\nAccording to Deadline, Annabelle: Creation opened with Thursday night previews with $4 million in ticket sales at the domestic box office, putting the film on track to make something in the low $30 million range in 3,502 locations this weekend. The tally for Annabelle: Creation makes it the biggest opener in The Conjuring universe so far, ahead of The Conjuring 2 ($3.4 million), The Conjuring ($3.3 million), and Annabelle ($2.1 million).\n\nDespite topping its predecessors in Thursday night previews, Annabelle: Creation is still expected to be the lowest grossing film in its opening frame in the franchise, behind The Conjuring ($41.2 million), The Conjuring 2 ($40.4 million) and Annabelle ($37.1 million). It's still expected to top the box office this weekend, though, ahead of Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature, which is projected to open in second place in the neighborhood of $12 million to $14 million, and Dunkirk, which is expected to finish third with $11 million in domestic ticket sales.\n\nEven in the unlikely scenario that Annabelle: Creation finishes below box office projections, it will hardly be enough to send Warner Bros. into a full-tilt panic. The film has a reported budget of $15 million, which is far below many of its summer movie box office competitors. A $30 million start would obviously double the amount of production costs off the bat, and that's only from domestic locations. The film reportedly grossed $4 million in its first day in foreign locations as well.\n\nNo matter where Annabelle: Creation ends up by the time it ends its theatrical run, it most certainly will be profitable for Warner Bros., and will serve as a valuable example of how big budget movies don't always guarantee big budget success. The studio is clearly onto something with the old-school scares films like Annabelle: Creation conjure up, and they even have more in store with The Conjuring spinoffs The Nun and Crooked Man, which were introduced to audiences in memorable fashion in The Conjuring 2.\n\nNEXT: Where Annabelle: Creation Fits in The Conjuring Movie Timeline\n\nSource: Deadline\n\nKey Release Dates Annabelle: Creation release date: Aug 11, 2017The Nun release date: Jul 13, 2018 ShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment ThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!

As many fans of the horror genre already know, this is rare milestone for horror in particular, although it is powered by the star power of The Conjuring franchise. It also appears that the Annabelle prequel to the other Annabelle has taken shape with extreme audience interest, despite the rising tensions in world events lately.\n\nAs a bit of prerequisite knowledge, Annabelle: Creation is actually a prequel to the first spinoff film, Annabelle. But that goes even deeper because the first Annabelle film was in and of itself a prequel to The Conjuring, which featured the demon possessed doll at the beginning of the movie as a case that Ed and Lorraine Warren worked in the 1970s before they accepted the case with the Perron family.\n\nSo now that we have the basic details for Annabelle: Creation out of the way, let's just take a look at the early numbers coming out of the box office reports, as reported by Box Office Mojo. What is perhaps the most impressive milestone here is how well Annabelle: Creation performed on the Thursday night previews at the box office, which are usually held late so that they can coincide with the Friday opening day box office numbers.\n\n#AnnabelleCreation could give the box office the boost it desperately needs https://t.co/RSXnTCFanL pic.twitter.com/HToZtUnn9B\n\n-- Variety (@Variety) August 12, 2017\n\nDuring the Thursday night previews, Annabelle: Creation scored an estimated $4 million at the box office, which is highly impressive for a horror film. To help put that into perspective, The Dark Tower scored $7.7 million at the box office on its opening day last week, which included all of Friday's total earnings and not just the previews. That means that Annabelle: Creation is on pace to outperform a major Stephen King adaptation that many have considered to be an epic story, or have referred to the King series of books as his magnum opus.", "time": "12:08:00"}

Get the details, and check out the estimated grosses for all of the Top 10 movies below!\n\nAnnabelle: Creation is the fourth film in The Conjuring franchise. The series began in 2013 and was inspired by real-life paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren. Annabelle, a prequel to The Conjuring, was released in 2014. And then The Counjuring 2 came out in 2016. Now Creation is a prequel to Annabelle, and explains the origins of the frightening doll. Annabelle opened in second place with $37.1 million when it came out nearly three years ago. Now Annabelle: Creation is on track to earn nearly the same amount, approximately, $36.7 million.\n\nBut this time, that will be enough to take first place, as the rest of the projected totals for the weekend are downright scary. Dunkirk is hanging on to second place with a mere $10.8 million. The new kids' movie The Nut Job 2 is only expected to score $8.7 million for third. Down more than 60 percent in its second weekend, The Dark Tower is slipping from first place last week to fourth this weekend. Its gross will only be around $7.5 million.", "time": "20:13:00"}

Trackers had pegged the film for an opening of $27-30 million. Instead, \"Creation\" has nearly matched the opening results of the first \"Annabelle,\" which made $37.1 million in 2014.\n\nWhile critics mostly panned the first \"Annabelle\" with a 29 percent rating, critics who saw \"Creation\" at the Los Angeles Film Festival and San Diego Comic-Con were much more positive, giving this prequel a 69 percent RT score. Audiences gave the film a B on CinemaScore, same as its predecessor.\n\nTaking second is another WB film, \"Dunkirk,\" which earned $11.4 million in its fourth weekend. That result puts \"Dunkirk\" past the $150 million domestic mark with $153 million.\n\nIn third is Open Road's \"The Nut Job 2,\" which is performing well below tracker projections with $8.5 million against studio and tracker pre-weekend projections in the mid-teens. Anything less than an A- for an animated film on CinemaScore is considered poor reception, as strong results from underage audiences tend to bump up the grade. But \"Nut Job 2\" only received a B+ on CinemaScore, while receiving an abysmal 11 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nIn fourth is Columbia/MRC's \"The Dark Tower,\" which took a 60 percent hit from its $19.5 million opening to make $7.8 million in its second weekend. Fighting for the last spot in the top five are two holdover titles: \"Girls Trip\" and \"The Emoji Movie,\" which are both estimated to make around $6.5 million this weekend. It's a particularly good result for \"Girls Trip,\" as this week it will become the first comedy to gross $100 million domestically. Also crossing the $100 million mark this week is TriStar/MRC's \"Baby Driver\" after seven weekends in theaters, becoming the first film from director Edgar Wright to do so.\n\nFinishing outside the top 5 in ninth is Lionsgate's \"The Glass Castle,\" which had a targeted release of 1,400 screens and made an estimated $4.87 million. Pre-weekend projection put the adaptation of Jeannette Walls' memoirs at $5-7 million. The film has a 50 percent RT score. Meanwhile, Annapurna's \"Detroit\" fell 59 percent to $2.9 million, bringing its cume to just $13.3 million after ten days in wide release.", "time": "12:52:00"}

But as Hollywood's franchise-making scheme du jour has crept into other genres, it's also proven that you can't guarantee success, as evidenced by Universal's recent Dark Universe-launching clunker \"The Mummy,\" the diminishing returns of Paramount's \"Transformers: The Last Knight\" and Sony's disappointing \"The Dark Tower.\"\n\nYet in Warner Bros. and New Line's \"Conjuring\" films and the spinoff prequel \"Annabelle,\" contemporary horror has made a potent first stab at interconnected universe-building. The first three films in the \"Conjuring\" universe created by filmmaker James Wan have racked up a cumulative $897 million worldwide to date, and the fourth entry in the series, \"Annabelle: Creation,\" opens Friday boasting both a noticeable leap forward in production value and robustly positive reviews.\n\nNot bad for a prequel to a spinoff about an evil doll. Chucky, who slashed his way through six \"Child's Play\" movies and has a seventh on the way, would be proud.\n\nSet in a gothic 1950s farmhouse far removed from the 1970s-era supernatural sleuthing of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, whose case files inspired \"The Conjuring,\" \"Annabelle: Creation\" crafts a vivid tale of how Annabelle the doll came to be before she wound up in the Warrens' supernatural collection.\n\nThe mystery involves a grieving doll maker, Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia), and his wife, Esther (Miranda Otto), who welcome six orphaned girls and their guardian, Sister Charlotte (\"Miss Bala\"'s Stephanie Sigman), to share their cavernous two-story homestead.\n\nUnfortunately, as young polio-stricken Janice (Talitha Bateman) discovers while navigating shadowy hallways, forbidden rooms and other bumps in the night in her new digs -- they're not alone.\n\nAnd, of course, there are Easter eggs planted throughout the film alluding to past and future films in the growing \"Conjuring\" universe.\n\nA relatively budget-conscious sleeper success like \"The Conjuring\" may not have seemed a natural choice to spawn a cinematic multiverse, but Wan's studio bosses are already so confident that they've announced more standalones to come -- \"The Nun,\" due in 2018 from director Corin Hardy, and \"The Crooked Man\" -- not to mention a third \"Conjuring\" film.\n\nIt was while making 2013's \"The Conjuring\" that Wan -- who had the successful \"Saw\" series and budding franchise-starter, \"Insidious,\" under his belt -- saw the potential in expanding the world by zeroing in on the Warrens' collection of spooky relics. The same year, coincidentally, Warner Bros. launched its interconnected DC Extended Universe with \"Batman v. Superman\" precursor \"Man of Steel.\"\n\n\"It was something that came up pretty organically,\" Wan said from the set of \"Aquaman,\" the sixth installment in the DCEU and the horror veteran's first venture into the world of big-budget superhero blockbusters. Immersed in the world of \"The Conjuring\" while designing the museum of haunted artifacts collected by the Warrens, he wondered: Were there more stories to be told in these objects?\n\nThe first spinoff, \"Annabelle,\" was shot on a $5-million budget in 25 days, directed by longtime Wan cinematographer John R. Leonetti from a script by Gary Dauberman. Set in the decade prior to \"The Conjuring,\" it imagined a Manson-era backstory to the real Annabelle doll that still resides under glass in the Warrens' Connecticut museum with a warning: \"Positively do not open.\"\n\nCritics weren't impressed, but audiences flocked to the multiplex, and \"Annabelle\" ended up with a $256 million global take. After steering Universal's high-profile \"Furious 7,\" the seventh installment in Hollywood's arguably most adaptive blockbuster franchise, Wan returned to his horror roots to direct \"The Conjuring 2,\" which grossed $320 million and stoked fan interest in the burgeoning universe.\n\nCharging ahead on an \"Annabelle\" prequel that would explore the origin of the demonically possessed doll -- this time with a bigger budget, more shooting days, and a more expansive story -- producers Wan and Peter Safran hired director David F. Sandberg, the Swede who'd shown a sure hand transforming his own no-budget viral short film into \"Lights Out,\" a nerve-fraying debut feature that scored more than $148 million worldwide on a limited budget for Wan's Atomic Monster production shingle.\n\nWith a script by \"Annabelle\" scribe Dauberman that gave the titular doll an origin story grounded in themes of family, loss, and tragic desperation, Sandberg underwent a casting search for the ensemble of multi-generational actresses who would carry \"Annabelle: Creation.\"\n\n\"We were very open -- we auditioned all sorts of nationalities and we weren't set on characters having to be [certain] ages,\" Sandberg recalled on a recent day in Franklin Village, near where he and \"Lights Out\" collaborator and wife Lotte Losten now live.\n\nHe found his lead in 15-year-old Bateman -- her brother, the actor Gabriel Bateman, coincidentally starred in \"Lights Out\" -- who brings preternatural depth to the object of Annabelle's sinister intentions. Her 11-year-old costar Lulu Wilson had experience acting in an unexpectedly classy horror prequel thanks to \"Ouija: Origin of Evil,\" and makes the most of a meaty role as Linda, Janice's BFF, who has a particularly harrowing experience with a creaky dumbwaiter. Most important, the film's ensemble breathes life into the relationships and themes that help \"Annabelle: Creation\" deliver more than clever set pieces and jump scares.\n\nWan's guiding influence in cinematic universe-building? Taking more cues from the small screen than the Marvel blueprint. \"I actually equate cinematic universes more to long-form TV storytelling -- I've always said that the 'Conjuring' universe in some ways plays like a classic 'monster of the week' episodic, like 'X-Files' or 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer,' a serial with an overarching storyline that ties back to the main characters,\" he said.\n\n\"Annabelle: Creation\" also embraces a classical filmmaking style, maximized by shooting on custom-built sets that allowed Sandberg and cinematographer Maxime Alexandre to move freely and stage sequences with invention.\n\n\"It gets boring when you shoot just standard coverage, the same thing over and over,\" said Sandberg, who had a sprawling multistory interior built on the Warner Bros. lot. \"I also wanted the movie to be beautiful, because I feel that horror movies can still look beautiful -- it doesn't mean they're less scary.\"\n\nTo shoot the film's exterior scenes, including a memorably chilling daylight sequence involving a wheelchair, a barn and demonic possession, Sandberg's crew took over the Big Sky Movie Ranch in Simi Valley -- which is why sharp-eyed viewers might recognize the Mullins' home from HBO's \"Westworld.\" \"That's the house where [Evan Rachel Wood's character] Dolores lives,\" Sandberg said with a smile. \"But it looks very different in our movie.\"\n\n\"Annabelle: Creation\" was a giant leap for a relative newcomer like Sandberg, who grew up weaned on VHS horror classics like \"Nightmare on Elm Street,\" \"Fright Night,\" \"Evil Dead\" and, yes, \"Child's Play.\" But like Wan, Sandberg is the latest indie horror director to make the jump to superhero filmmaking: Earlier this year he landed at the helm of New Line's \"Shazam,\" based on the DC Comics character, which he's prepping while developing \"Lights Out 2.\"\n\n\"Horror is really difficult to pull off, as evidenced by the really bad horror that's out there,\" he said, laughing. \"So if you can do that, because it's both technical and tonal, then it helps taking on anything else -- and usually the budgets [in horror] are a lot lower, so you have to be inventive.\"\n\nWan, who's more than halfway through filming on his Jason Momoa-led \"Aquaman,\" agrees that the tools cultivated in indie horror -- learning to play your audience for scares and nervous laughs while managing typically minuscule budgets -- makes fertile training ground for studio blockbuster gigs.\n\n\"I think [studios] are looking beyond the fact that we might not be experienced in action and visual effects, but they can see that what we care about are characters and storytelling, and that's what it comes down to,\" he said. \"It's not a bad trend for us genre filmmakers -- we're no longer [looked] down at, as much as it used to be. More power to indie horror film directors!\"\n\nWith a foot in two cinematic universes and some of horror's most profitable franchises to his name, Wan might be one of the most qualified experts in Hollywood to expound on the secret to weaving interconnecting movie mythologies.\n\n\"At the end of the day you've got to make sure you have interesting characters and an interesting story to tell. Because you might have this amazing, grand, master scheme of a plan -- but if you tell a story that no one really cares about,\" he said with a laugh, \"it's kind of pointless.\"\n\njen.yamato@latimes.com\n\n@jenyamato\n\nALSO:\n\n'Annabelle: Creation' expected to rise amid deathly August box office\n\nLA Film Festival program continues to expand with 'The Beguiled' and 'Annabelle: Creation'", "time": "10:03:00"}

and this time around moviegoers will be taken through her origins, from her first home in a little girl's room to her first possession of a soul.\n\nThe prequel - the next chapter in James Wan's Conjuring universe - picks up several years after the tragic death of the Mullins' (Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto) little girl, Bee.\n\nStill bereaved, the dollmaker and his wife have decided to welcome a nun (Stephanie Sigman) and six girls from a shuttered orphanage into their home, only for their guests to become the target of their possessed creation: Annabelle.\n\nFor director David F Sandberg, taking the reins was a no brainer.\n\n\"I was already a big fan of The Conjuring,\" explains the Swedish star, hot on the heels of his successful directorial debut with 2016 hit Lights Out. \"It felt like a classic that stood out from a lot of other modern horror movies.\n\n\"I remember I was really intrigued by that world and excited to do my own sort of classic take within the genre.\"\n\nAnd he certainly has. Garnering rave reviews and praise from critics, Sandberg and the team explain why, when it comes to upping the scare factor, the devil really is in the details...\n\nCreating the scares\n\nTo create a big studio horror that's sure to have its audience head-in-hands, Sandberg knows only too well not to rely on just jump scares.\n\n\"You build towards them, because I think then it feels more earned than if you just have a big noise out of nowhere that makes people jump just because it's unexpected,\" reasons the filmmaker, 36.\n\n\"The trick is to have people expect something to happen and still sort of scare them - like, 'Hey look over here' and then... So it can be a challenge sometimes, and you have to sort of mess with the timing and the rhythm.\n\n\"And often you have to let there be silence in the movie,\" he counsels. \"So you're not leading people along with the soundtrack and so forth.\"\n\nThe dreaded doll\n\nOne figure that didn't have to pitch for gasps was Annabelle, with her ominous reputation causing quite a stir on set. \"David has got a very good relationship with the doll, but I don't and I am fine with it,\" declares former Bond girl, Sigman. \"I was very creeped out and freaked out by the doll.\"\n\n\"I don't like the doll,\" Otto, 49, agrees. \"I wanted it to be taken out of the room when we were rehearsing; I find it really creepy and sinister.\"\n\nIn fact, Sigman requested a Catholic priest bless the set and the prop Annabelle dolls, much as they did before cameras rolled on The Conjuring 2 and the most recent production, The Nun.\n\n\"I asked for it because I had to touch the doll,\" admits Sigman, 30. \"I didn't want to, but I had to because of the scenes I have with her. [I felt] a little bit more protected.\"\n\n\"I didn't even know that until recently!\" chimes Brisbane-born Otto, confessing she was fascinated with dolls as a child. \"[But] nothing untoward happened when we were shooting...\"\n\nMagic in the making\n\nWith an esteemed team of actors in the mix, at least, Sandberg was able to put much of his effort into working with the title 'character'.\n\n\"Being a doll, Annabelle doesn't move and we didn't want to use her in that way; you run the risk of her seeming silly,\" he justifies. \"So it was a fun challenge to come up with different scares around that limitation.\n\n\"It's usually scarier to not show things than to show them,\" he adds, \"because the imagination will often be even better than any expensive rubber suit or CGI character.\"\n\nFor her third incarnation Annabelle was re-jigged by special effect giants, Amalgamated Dynamics Inc (ADI).\n\n\"They made a new version of the Annabelle doll, which was slightly tweaked from the earlier ones,\" Sandberg divulges. \"Even James thought that the first Annabelle was almost a little too creepy in her appearance for this story, and he was right.\"\n\nHe explains: \"I mean, what dad would make that doll for his child? So, ADI adjusted her so she looks a little less scary in certain situations, but in the right light, as scary as ever.\"", "time": "11:11:00"}

When it happens, we are often expected to accept the loss as a part of life and believe in time as the healing factor.\n\nIn Annabelle: Creation, married couple Samuel and Esther Mullins (played by Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto respectively) decide to welcome six young orphan girls into their home as a way to cope with the grief of losing their own child.\n\nAll should be well, right? Not in this movie. After the forgettable Annabelle movie released in 2014, somehow it was decided that our good friend Annabelle, the haunted porcelain doll and break-out star from producer James Wan's own The Conjuring film series, deserves another origin story. If you don't remember anything about her, Annabelle likes to lurk in the dark and can scarily harm unsuspecting victims without actually lifting a finger. She's classy that way.\n\nThis time, Annabelle ramps up her jerk factor by terrorising the living daylight out of orphans, particularly polio-stricken Janice (Talitha Bateman). It begins with a note that written in red crayon that says \"Find me\" and then all hell breaks loose. Annabelle makes her presence felt by making sudden appearances anywhere from under a bed to at the dinner table. She makes slow creeping footsteps sounds. The worst is when she takes on the form of another child to ask for help.\n\nThe sense of dread is definitely overwhelming in this new Annabelle movie. Though she appears to only be moving in the background or underneath a blanket, it's all enough to send shivers down your spine. Director David Sandberg of Lights Out fame makes good use of the dark empty spaces in the movie for all kinds of unsuspecting entities to pop. The best part is, there are more creepy surprises in stores as Annabelle has friends in different shapes and forms to play along with her. Moral of the story - don't trust any items in this movie.\n\nSure, some things may be baffling about Annabelle: Creation. The orphans seem to ignore one too many warning signs about the house they live. Just like characters in other The Conjuring movies, everybody is okay to sleep alone after a night of terror and without any form of divine protection. Talk about optimism. I also feel that the movie didn't actually need to show an actual demon-looking being to scare its viewers because it just takes away the mystery. Nothing is scarier than the unseen.\n\nThat being said, it's still worth going along this rollercoaster ride of a horror movie just to see Janice's best friend Linda (played by a very gutsy Lulu Wilson who was previously the creepy kid in Ouija: Origin of Evil) take matters into her own hand. If you really hate Annabelle, then you'd want to cheer for Linda to get rid of that creepy doll once and for all. Will she succeed? Be a doll and catch the show.\n\nI also like how, during an unsettling moment where Linda is stuck in a closet with Annabelle staring at her, she deals with it by turning the doll's head into another direction.

The latest installment is technically a prequel of a prequel; however, Annabelle: Creation is superior to its predecessor in every way, and sets a new bar for The Conjuring franchise.\n\nThe story jumps back to an era around the 1930-40s, where doll maker Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia) and his wife Esther (Miranda Otto) live happily on their ranch property with their daughter, \"Bee\" (Samara Lee). That happiness is shattered the day that Bee is killed in a horrible accident; the Mullins stay closed off from the world, mired in their grief, until twelve years pass and they see an opportunity to fill their home again.\n\nThat opportunity comes in the form of a wayward band of orphan girls, who take up residence at the Mullins' house. One young girl named Janice (Talitha Bateman), who is crippled from polio, finds herself isolated and lonely - until she starts to get unexplained visits from an supernatural presence in the house. At first Janice is curious - but that curiosity costs her dearly, as the mysterious presence soon leads her to a secret room in the Mullins' house, where Janice finds a creepy, custom-made doll seemingly imprisoned. As soon as the doll is set loose from that room all hell begins to break loose, as the Mullins, the orphans, and even the kindly chaperon nun, Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman), all start getting terrorized by the demon that lives inside the Annabelle doll.\n\nDirector David F. Sandberg made a splash in the horror genre with last year's Lights Out, and Annabelle: Creation shows that he is definitely a talent worth watching. Sandberg doesn't reinvent the wheel with this prequel-sequel installment of an established franchise; instead, he simply makes a creatively rich and well-executed horror film that does its job effectively and well, creating frightening levels of tension that never let up. There are a lot of moments in Annabelle: Creation that will make viewers cover their eyes or jump out of their seats, with almost zero drag or lulls between scares.\n\nSandberg's blocking and visual concepts are sharp and on point, while the camerawork by Maxime Alexandre (High Tension, Hills Have Eyes) plays with audience perspective and expectations in some fun ways. Where Annabelle: Creation loses a few points, however, is in the story by Gary Dauberman (IT). On the one hand, Dauberman creates a strong standalone prequel story; however, Annabelle Creation's narrative obligations to the rest of The Conjuring universe require certain connective elements getting shoehorned in. A final ending twist attempts to maintain franchise continuity, but instead comes off as a cheesy and thin contrivance, meant to keep everything in synch.\n\nThe cast of young actresses do a good job of selling the scares, and creating characters worth worrying about. The big standout is Lulu Wilsion, who already gave a breakout performance in another horror franchise prequel, Ouija: Origin of Evil. Wilson takes over the lead character reigns partway through the film, giving it a shot of dynamic energy that makes the final half even more tense and scarily enjoyable than the first. Veteran character actors like Anthony LaPaglia (Without A Trace) and Miranda Otto (24: Legacy) create pitch-perfect ambiguous adult characters, who keep you guessing about their intentions throughout the story.\n\nIn the end, Annabelle: Creation is a pleasant surprise to find, this far into the Conjuring franchise. It's definitely worth a trip to the theater, and even lends credit to the idea that expanding The Conjuring franchise into more spinoff chapters will be as worthwhile for viewers, as it is for the studio.\n\n*Note: Be sure to stay until the very end of the credits, as there are two credits scenes for you to enjoy.\n\nAnnabelle: Creation is now in theaters. It is 1 hour and 49 minutes long, and is Rated R for horror violence and terror.\n\nBest Horror Movie Remakes Gallery Start Gallery Back to Article\n\nBest Horror Movie Remakes Gallery\n\nImage -\n\nby Kofi Outlaw | August 11, 2017", "time": "19:51:00"}

and this time around moviegoers will be taken through her origins, from her first home in a little girl's room to her first possession of a soul.\n\nThe prequel - the next chapter in James Wan's Conjuring universe - picks up several years after the tragic death of the Mullins' (Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto) little girl, Bee.\n\nStill bereaved, the dollmaker and his wife have decided to welcome a nun (Stephanie Sigman) and six girls from a shuttered orphanage into their home, only for their guests to become the target of their possessed creation: Annabelle.\n\nFor director David F Sandberg, taking the reins was a no brainer.\n\n\"I was already a big fan of The Conjuring,\" explains the Swedish star, hot on the heels of his successful directorial debut with 2016 hit Lights Out. \"It felt like a classic that stood out from a lot of other modern horror movies.\n\n\"I remember I was really intrigued by that world and excited to do my own sort of classic take within the genre.\"\n\nAnd he certainly has. Garnering rave reviews and praise from critics, Sandberg and the team explain why, when it comes to upping the scare factor, the devil really is in the details...\n\nCreating the scares\n\nTo create a big studio horror that's sure to have its audience head-in-hands, Sandberg knows only too well not to rely on just jump scares.\n\n\"You build towards them, because I think then it feels more earned than if you just have a big noise out of nowhere that makes people jump just because it's unexpected,\" reasons the filmmaker, 36.\n\n\"The trick is to have people expect something to happen and still sort of scare them - like, 'Hey look over here' and then... So it can be a challenge sometimes, and you have to sort of mess with the timing and the rhythm.\n\n\"And often you have to let there be silence in the movie,\" he counsels. \"So you're not leading people along with the soundtrack and so forth.\"\n\nThe dreaded doll\n\nOne figure that didn't have to pitch for gasps was Annabelle, with her ominous reputation causing quite a stir on set. \"David has got a very good relationship with the doll, but I don't and I am fine with it,\" declares former Bond girl, Sigman. \"I was very creeped out and freaked out by the doll.\"\n\n\"I don't like the doll,\" Otto, 49, agrees. \"I wanted it to be taken out of the room when we were rehearsing; I find it really creepy and sinister.\"\n\nIn fact, Sigman requested a Catholic priest bless the set and the prop Annabelle dolls, much as they did before cameras rolled on The Conjuring 2 and the most recent production, The Nun.\n\n\"I asked for it because I had to touch the doll,\" admits Sigman, 30. \"I didn't want to, but I had to because of the scenes I have with her. [I felt] a little bit more protected.\"\n\n\"I didn't even know that until recently!\" chimes Brisbane-born Otto, confessing she was fascinated with dolls as a child. \"[But] nothing untoward happened when we were shooting...\"\n\nMagic in the making\n\nWith an esteemed team of actors in the mix, at least, Sandberg was able to put much of his effort into working with the title 'character'.\n\n\"Being a doll, Annabelle doesn't move and we didn't want to use her in that way; you run the risk of her seeming silly,\" he justifies. \"So it was a fun challenge to come up with different scares around that limitation.\n\n\"It's usually scarier to not show things than to show them,\" he adds, \"because the imagination will often be even better than any expensive rubber suit or CGI character.\"\n\nFor her third incarnation Annabelle was re-jigged by special effect giants, Amalgamated Dynamics Inc (ADI).\n\n\"They made a new version of the Annabelle doll, which was slightly tweaked from the earlier ones,\" Sandberg divulges. \"Even James thought that the first Annabelle was almost a little too creepy in her appearance for this story, and he was right.\"\n\nHe explains: \"I mean, what dad would make that doll for his child? So, ADI adjusted her so she looks a little less scary in certain situations, but in the right light, as scary as ever.\"", "time": "08:51:00"}

It has a decent portion of visceral scares, but otherwise depends too much on predictable horror movie tricks.\n\nFor those keeping score: \"Annabelle: Creation'' is a prequel to \"Annabelle'' (2014), which was a spinoff of the two-film horror series that began with \"The Conjuring'' in 2013. Other spinoffs and sequels are in the works, and the whole blooming enterprise has become known as the \"Conjuring Universe.''\n\n\"Annabelle: Creation'' begins with the accidental death in the 1940s of the beloved young daughter of a doll-maker (Anthony LaPaglia) and his wife (Miranda Otto). Fast forward, and a busload of orphans -- six girls, under the charge of a goody-goody nun (Stephanie Sigman) -- are being dropped off at the bereaved couple's spacious country house, where the doll-maker has offered them refuge.\n\nThe youngsters, who seem remarkably well-scrubbed and cheerful for orphans, are delighted with their new digs, even if: 1) they are forbidden to enter the mysterious locked room, wherein resides a creepy doll, and 2) they must tread lightly so as not to disturb the now bed-ridden mother of the dead girl.\n\nYou may be guessing they've entered a classic haunted house, or house of horrors, and you are correct. You are also right if you're guessing that glimpses of the deceased daughter will figure prominently in what follows.\n\nThe focus is on the two youngest orphans, Janice (Talitha Bateman) and Linda (Lulu Wilson), great pals who have sworn to stick together no matter what. Spunky Janice is a polio victim, and you may be sure that she will drop her brace at crucial moments. She's the first to enter the locked room, after which there is heck to pay, horror-movie style.\n\nAn amusing note: The house happens to have one of those mechanical chairs that moves on a track up and down stairs, perfect for Janice. The chair figures in one of the movie's more intriguing sequences. The film also has a bit of fun with a scarecrow.\n\nThe director is David F. Sandberg, who made a better horror picture in 2016 called \"Lights Out.'' Give him credit for accomplishing as much as he has in \"Annabelle: Creation'' while working under the constraints of a sequel (either the second or fourth picture; see above).\n\nThere are \"gotcha'' jolts that definitely got me, but for each of those, there must be a half-dozen scares telegraphed in very large letters. I think \"Annabelle: Creation'' is suffering from sequelitis.", "time": "05:51:00"}

Gemma Dunn finds out why it's one of the most terrifying films of the year\n\nIt's been three years since horror fans were first introduced to Annabelle, and with a reputation to uphold, the demonic doll is now back to wreak devastation on more unsuspecting victims.\n\nContinuing her rule in Annabelle: Creation, after a chilling cameo in The Conjuring and a starring role in her own film, the infamous 'toy' has not let up - and this time around movie-goers will be taken through her origins, from her first home in a little girl's room to her first possession of a little girl's soul.\n\nThe prequel - the next chapter in James Wan's Conjuring universe - picks up several years after the tragic death of the Mullins' (helmed by Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto) little girl, Bee.\n\nThe dollmaker and his wife have decided to welcome a nun (Stephanie Sigman) and six girls from a shuttered orphanage into their home, only for their guests to become the target of their possessed creation: Annabelle.\n\nFor director David F Sandberg (36), taking the reins was a no-brainer.\n\n\"I was already a big fan of The Conjuring,\" explains the Swedish star, hot on the heels of his successful directorial debut with 2016 hit Lights Out. \"It felt like a classic that stood out from a lot of other modern horror movies.\n\n\"I remember I was really intrigued by that world and excited to do my own sort of classic take within the genre.\"\n\nAnd he certainly has. Garnering rave reviews and praise from critics, Sandberg and the team explain why, when it comes to upping the scare factor, the devil really is in the detail.\n\nCREATING THE SCARES\n\nTo create a big studio horror that's sure to have its audience head-in-hands, Sandberg knows only too well not to rely on just jump scares.\n\n\"You build towards them, because I think then it feels more earned than if you just have a big noise out of nowhere that makes people jump just because it's unexpected,\" reasons the filmmaker.\n\n\"The trick is to have people expect something to happen and still sort of scare them - like, 'Hey look over here' and then ... So it can be a challenge sometimes, and you have to sort of mess with the timing and the rhythm.\n\n\"And often you have to let there be silence in the movie,\" he counsels. \"So you're not leading people along with the soundtrack and so forth.\"\n\nTHE DREADED DOLL\n\nOne figure that didn't have to pitch for gasps was Annabelle (left), with her ominous reputation causing quite a stir on set.\n\n\"David has got a very good relationship with the doll, but I don't and I am fine with it,\" declares former Bond girl, Sigman. \"I was very creeped out and freaked out by the doll.\"\n\n\"I don't like the doll,\" Otto, (49), agrees. \"I wanted it to be taken out of the room when we were rehearsing; I find it really creepy and sinister.\"\n\nIn fact, Sigman requested a Catholic priest bless the set and the prop Annabelle dolls, much as they did before cameras rolled on The Conjuring 2 and the most recent production, The Nun.\n\n\"I asked for it because I had to touch the doll,\" confesses Sigman, (30). \"I didn't want to, but I had to because of the scenes I have with her. (I felt) a little bit more protected.\"\n\n\"I didn't even know that until recently,\" chimes Brisbane-born Otto, confessing she was fascinated with dolls as a child. \"(But) nothing untoward happened when we were shooting ...\"\n\nIN THE MAKING\n\nWith an esteemed team of actors in the mix, at least, Sandberg was able to put much of his effort into working with the title 'character'.\n\n\"Being a doll, Annabelle doesn't move and we didn't want to use her in that way; you run the risk of her seeming silly,\" he justifies. \"So it was a fun challenge to come up with different scares around that limitation.\n\n\"(Though) it's usually scarier to not show things than to show them,\" he adds. \"Because the imagination will often be even better than any expensive rubber suit or CGI character.\"\n\nFor her third incarnation Annabelle was re-jigged by special effect giants, Amalgamated Dynamics Inc (ADI).\n\n\"They made a new version of the Annabelle doll, which was slightly tweaked from the earlier ones,\" Sandberg divulges. \"Even James thought that the first Annabelle was almost a little too creepy in her appearance for this story, and he was right.\"\n\nHe adds: \"I mean, what dad would make that doll for his child? So, ADI adjusted her so she looks a little less scary in certain situations, but in the right light, as scary as ever.\"\n\nSETTING THE SCENE\n\nShot primarily on a soundstage in Warner Bros Studios, the possibilities were endless when it came to creating the Mullins' house - a two-storey design in the American Gothic farmhouse style inspired, in part, by production designer Jennifer Spence's tour of LA's Heritage Square Museum.\n\n\"When I first read the script and saw it was a period piece, I was super excited,\" recalls Spence, who also worked with Sandberg on Lights Out.\n\n\"I loved the idea of not having the things we're so used to, like cell phones,\" she says of the action, which for the most part takes place in the mid-to-late Fifties.\n\n\"There's no way to call 911 right in your hand. No computers, nothing ... just simpler times.\n\n\"I think that provides a scarier atmosphere in some ways, because we have so many options to get help now, whereas if you were on a farm in the middle of nowhere in the Fifties, and the one phone doesn't work, there's nothing much you can do.\"\n\nOLD VERSUS NEW\n\nSimilarly, Wan was thrilled with the classic period look created by Sandberg, for the very reason that it takes the film outside of the traditional horror seen in contemporary cinema.\n\n\"I think that's been the key to keeping this universe feeling fresh and unique,\" he elaborates. \"Each of these standalone movies has a very different flavour, yet they're all connected.\"\n\n\"These films are a great example of why we love to go to the movies,\" Sandberg concurs.\n\n\"It's a safe, shared environment where we can experience such a great range of emotions, from fear to excitement and more.\n\n\"And in this case, we get to find out how another piece of this 'Conjuring' and 'Annabelle' world is tied together and maybe even get a hint at what's to come.\n\n\"There's certainly more movies in this universe coming up, now we have The Nun coming next year,\" he teases. \"I'm sure there's more to tell ...\"", "time": "08:36:00"}

In telling that story, Annabelle: Creation further intertwines the various monsters and story elements that began with The Conjuring, but even the most dedicated might be confused on some of the details.\n\nWith Annabelle: Creation now in theaters, fans are discussing the various secrets and Conjuring connections that the film reveals - and we're here to help explain it in full.\n\nHere are Annabelle: Creation's Ending and Conjuring Franchise Connections Explained. Be warned: There will be MAJOR SPOILERS that follow below!\n\nPreviousSlide 1/3Next How Annabelle: Creation Continues The Story\n\nOne obvious problem with Annabelle: Creation's entire existence as a film, is that the first Annabelle already told the story of how the doll became possessed by an evil spirit:\n\nIn the first film, Pete and Sharon Higgins are asleep in their Santa Monica home in 1969, when they are brutally murdered by their daughter Annabelle and her boyfriend, who are members of a satanic cult. When the assailants attempted to murder the Higgins' neighbors, John and Mia, the man is killed, while Annabelle slit her own throat, spilling blood on Mia's antique doll, and thereby manifesting the evil spirit within it.\n\nHowever, in Annabelle: Creation we get a different origin story: doll maker Samuel Mullins created the iconic doll, just before he and his wife Esther lose their daughter \"Bee\" (short for \"Annabelle,\" it's later revealed) in a tragic accident. The Mullins turn to their faith, asking whatever force in the universe to bring them back their daughter; what they get is a ghostly apparition, which eventually reveals itself to be a horrific demon, masquerading as the little girl.\n\nWe soon learn that demon is using the doll as a conduit, in order to possess an actual human being, and therefore gain full entry into our world. Unfortunately for young, crippled orphan girl Janice, the demon chooses her, and ultimately is successful in possessing her body. By the end of the film, Janice has escaped the Mullins' house leaving bodies in her wake - off into the world to wreak more havoc and bloodshed.\n\nPreviousSlide 2/3Next The Connection\n\nOn paper, it seems like Annabelle and Annabelle: Creation tell conflicting stories. In order to bridge that gap, the filmmakers come up with an epilogue that will either pleasantly surprise fans, or have them feeling like the franchise jumps the shark with its attempt to weave Conjuring universe connections.\n\nThe Connection: In the epilogue to Annabelle: Creation, we find the possessed Janice now masquerading as Annabelle in name, fully cured of her disabilities. She turns up in a California orphanage, where she is adopted by none other than... Pete and Sharon Higgins!\n\nOnce that revealing connection is made, we take a floating trip through the Higgins' home, where we see photos of Demon Janice/Annabelle growing over the years, her blond hair turning black, and her pretty features eroding into the gaunt face of the murderous Annabelle Higgins that eventually returns to kill her parents. In fact, the movie ends by taking us back to Santa Monica in 1969, where we see the Higgins die in much more gruesome details, before neighbors John and Mia come to investigate, thereby starting the cycle of events in the first film.\n\nWhat It Means: Where some fans will have problems with this connection between Annabelle 1 & 2 is:\n\nThe idea that \"Janice\" becomes \"Annabelle Higgins.\" After all, there's no real explanation for why the demon in Janice's body would keep that name - especially when it's something that the other survivors of the Mullins' house could track that name. The idea that Annabelle Higgins/Demon Janice's mortal life would end in the home of a family who just so happened to own the exact doll the demon had once been trapped in.\n\nIt's a totally contrived plot device, meant to allow room for the Annabelle demon doll to essentially have two origins. However, to be fair, Annabelle: Creation's horrific demon entity being the source of the doll's unnatural power is much more fitting than it being the soul of a crazy satanic girl from Santa Monica.\n\nPreviousSlide 3/3Other Conjuring Connections\n\nThe other big connection to the larger Conjuring universe that Annabelle: Creation establishes is the presence of the infamous Nun from The Conjuring 2.\n\nYou can click HERE for the full explanation of The Nun's presence in Annabelle: Creation - or read below for the summarized version.\n\nDark History\n\nThe demonic Nun appears indirectly early on, when the kindly Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman) is moving her orphan girls into the Mullins' house. Sister Charlotte keeps a photo of her best friends from the convent where she trained, and Mr. Mullins notices something strange about that photo: When tilted away from the light, a dark shadow behind the happy nuns in the picture reveals the chalky white face of the demonic nun, lurking close by.\n\nHonor Among Demons\n\nThe second time the Nun appears, it's direct contact: After being fully crippled by the Annabelle demon, young Janice is sitting in the yard of the Mullins' house, confined to a wheel chair. Suddenly, The Nun appears behind Janice and wheels her into a nearby barn, where the Annabelle demon finally possesses Janice, in full body and soul.\n\nPost-Credits\n\nIn a Marvel-style post-credits scene, we are taken to the basement of what looks like an old cathedral, lit by a row of candles on either wall. The candles are snuffed out, row by row, and from the darkness, comes The Nun, floating into view. This is a \"button scene\" moment, to tease The Nun spinoff film that's coming next summer.\n\nStart Slideshow Back to Article Slide of\n\nby Kofi Outlaw | August 11, 2017\n\nrelated stories New 'Terminator' to Explain Why the Robot Looks Like Arnold Schwarzenegger Terminator Annabelle: Creation's Ending and Conjuring Franchise Connections Explained Annabelle 'Annabelle: Creation' Brings The Terror Annabelle Bruce Campbell 10 Best Demonic Horror Movies by Chris Killian August 11, 2017 The Conjuring 'Annabelle: Creation' Post-Credits Scene Offers a Look at [SPOILER] by Patrick Cavanaugh August 10, 2017 Annabelle 'Annabelle: Creation' Director Reveals One of his Favorite Scares in the Movie by Patrick Cavanaugh August 10, 2017 It (2017) Pennywise Masks From 'IT' Remake to be Sold This Halloween by Patrick Cavanaugh August 10, 2017 Terminator Arnold Schwarzenegger Confirms He's Shooting 'Terminator 6' Next Year by Charlie Ridgely August 10, 2017 an american werewolf in london Max Landis Reportedly Halfway Done With 'American Werewolf in London' Remake by Patrick Cavanaugh August 9, 2017 Open Water 3 Cage Dive Exclusive: Watch a Gory New Clip From 'Open Water 3: Cage Dive' by Kofi Outlaw August 9, 2017 The Conjuring 'The Conjuring' Director Hints We Might Have to Wait a While for 'The Conjuring 3' by Patrick Cavanaugh August 9, 2017 James Bond James Bond 25 Possible Title and Villain Revealed by John Connor Coulston August 9, 2017 Beyonce Beyonce in Talks for Major Role in Live-Action 'Lion King' by Hunter Miller August 9, 2017 Netflix 63 Disney Movies to Watch Before Disney Leaves Netflix by Libby Birk August 9, 2017 The Hunger Games More 'Twilight' and 'Hunger Games' Films Possibly on the Way by Charlie Ridgely August 9, 2017 Stephen King First Image From Stephen King's 'Gerald's Game' Adaptation Debuts by Patrick Cavanaugh August 8, 2017 Friday the 13th Documentary About 'Friday the 13th' Icon Kane Hodder Gets Trailer by Patrick Cavanaugh August 8, 2017 Jessica simpson Jessica Simpson Shares Throwback 'Dukes of Hazzard' Photo by John Connor Coulston August 8, 2017 It (2017) Step Inside The Iconic House From Stephen King's 'It' in Los Angeles by Patrick Cavanaugh August 8, 2017 Friday the 13th Teaser Trailer for 1998 'Freddy Vs.

This news may trigger a moment's disbelief -- even before the Cabbage Patch Kids, was there really that much demand for something that looks like the love child of Pippi Longstocking and Baby Jane? -- followed by a shudder at the havoc likely being wreaked by the 99 other Annabelles, each of which might well be the star of her own grisly spinoff.\n\nIt's not the least plausible idea, given the global popularity of \"The Conjuring\" (in which Annabelle first reared her wooden head) and its various follow-ups, as well as the endlessly self-perpetuating \"cinematic universe\" mentality that governs studio movie production these days. Still, after 2014's cheaply effective \"Annabelle\" and now this creaky but superior origin story, it's probably best if the filmmakers lay the whole hell-puppet mythology to rest -- for a while, at least. As these movies demonstrate ad nauseam, Annabelle doesn't like to stay on her shelf for too long.\n\nWritten by returning \"Annabelle\" screenwriter Gary Dauberman, the new film opens with the doll being lovingly assembled and painted by Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia), a toymaker who lives with his wife, Esther (Miranda Otto), and their young daughter, Bee (Samara Lee), in a large clapboard house in a remote stretch of Southern California desert. Creation swiftly begets destruction: In a shock scene that feels imported from an altogether cruder movie, tragedy strikes, leaving Samuel and Esther stricken with grief.\n\nTwelve years later, the couple open their doors to six orphan girls and their caretaker, Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman), who are initially thrilled to have such an enormous, lavishly appointed new home to call their own. It's a choice that immediately distinguishes the movie from \"Annabelle,\" with its middle-class L.A. milieu, and establishes a sense of continuity with \"The Conjuring\" and \"The Conjuring 2,\" both of which told stories subtly rooted in economic despair, about young women in ramshackle homes that quickly came to feel like prisons.\n\nThe girl experiencing most of the haunting here is Janice (the effortlessly sympathetic Talitha Bateman), who is unsurprisingly the most vulnerable and alienated orphan of the group, having been stricken with polio. Forced to wear a leg brace and later confined to a wheelchair, Janice seeks comfort amid the forbidden relics of Bee's old bedroom: an enormous dollhouse, a puppet theater and, of course, the dreaded Annabelle herself. The doll is often shown seated in near-total darkness, with just enough ominous backlighting to illuminate those creepy pigtails and that dead, malevolent stare.\n\nUnlike Chucky or, say, the clown doll in \"Poltergeist,\" Annabelle is never seen moving of her own accord; as someone helpfully explains at one point, she is Satan's conduit rather than his walking, talking handmaiden. (Either way, she's not exactly an ideal houseguest.) That she remains inanimate and immobilized may seem a restriction at first, but it's one that the Swedish-born director David F. Sandberg, fresh off his solid debut with last year's horror-thriller \"Lights Out,\" succeeds in turning ingeniously to his advantage.\n\nThe result may not be much more than an exercise in craft, a skillful demonstration of all the games you can play with long takes, moving cameras, blurred focus and cavernous pools of darkness. But craft is hard to overrate these days, and Sandberg's technique, far from feeling assaultive or bludgeoning, has the effect of heightening your concentration. When you find yourself anxiously scanning every background for suspicious activity, or wondering how a house full of people can suddenly seem so ominously quiet and emptied-out, you know the filmmaker knows what he's doing.\n\nA richer script might have allowed Sandberg to engage more meaningfully with his characters -- who, apart from the Mullinses (played with quiet gravity by Australian actors LaPaglia and Otto) and Janice's plucky friend Linda (Lulu Wilson), are a fairly nondescript bunch. The older girls roll their eyes at the younger ones and giggle knowingly about boys, but the movie isn't especially interested in the competitive dynamics or deeper anxieties of female adolescence. Nor, despite Sigman's fervent Sister Charlotte and a few half-heartedly wielded crucifixes, does it evince much of the spiritual interest or rigor that might nudge it anywhere near the grand tradition of classic demonic-possession movies like \"The Exorcist.\"\n\nIn the end, \"Annabelle: Creation\" seems most invested in mechanics and minutiae: It's fascinated by the squirm-inducing possibilities of a malfunctioning dumbwaiter, or a none-too-reliable chair lift that Janice has to use to get up and down the stairs. It's keen too on making sure the events of this prequel and the original \"Annabelle\" snap together as neatly as possible -- too neatly, perhaps. By the end, you are reminded that the franchise model is seldom an ideal fit for the horror genre, not least because of the unavoidable suggestion that Satan is operating on some sort of yearly installment plan.\n\nIt has become common, under these circumstances, to instruct the audience to stay past the closing credits, but this is one case where I might actually advise the opposite. Some things are scarier when you can't see them coming, sequels included.\n\n------------\n\n'Annabelle: Creation'\n\nRating: R, for horror violence and terror\n\nRunning time: 1 hour, 49 minutes\n\nPlaying: In general release\n\njustin.chang@latimes.com | Twitter: @JustinCChang", "time": "19:36:00"}

Two grief-stricken parents invite a ragtag group of orphans and their nun into their haunted home to be terrorized by a possessed doll. The why is harder to pin down in this unintentionally campy horror.\n\nDirected by David F. Sandberg, Annabelle: Creation is a jumpy, Exorcist-inspired second prequel (the first, simply Annabelle, was helmed by John R. Leonetti) in an ever-expanding The Conjuring franchise. The movie, which banks on the popularity of the rest of the series rather than concern itself with details such as motive, doesn't add up to much. Annabelle: Creation is a series of slowly opened doors and close-ups of a truly ugly doll whose makeup must have been done in the dark by a deranged artist similarly possessed.\n\nDolls are perfect fodder for horror because their lifeless bodies are blank canvases for fears and anxieties - it's the imagination of the audience that does all the work. For Freud, a man who devoted his life and work to charting the origin of these fears and anxieties, \"the 'uncanny' is that class of the terrifying which leads back to something long known to us, once very familiar.\" In other words, the sunken eyes of a doll can send a chill up the spine not because they look strange or foreign, but because there is something faintly recognizable in their blank stare. The Annabelle series lazily trades on the uncanny, hoping to rouse familiar fears without explaining why.\n\nThe film, set in the dusty 1950s for no apparent reason other than to justify it as a pre-prequel, stars Stephanie Sigman (Spectre) as the God-fearing nun Sister Charlotte, with Lulu Wilson and Talitha Bateman. The doe-eyed best friends are two of the six orphans of the St. Eustache Home for Girls looking for forever homes. These good Catholic girls are taken in by the Mullins - a doll-making couple whose daughter Annabelle died in an accident 12 years prior. Miranda Otto (The Lord of the Rings, Homeland) and Anthony LaPaglia (Joe from the 1990s cult classic Empire Records) play the unwittingly sadistic parents who invite the wards into their demonic funhouse. Mrs. Mullins has a chic Phantom of the Opera aesthetic that adds a little panache to the movie's drab setting, if not the terror it intended.\n\nThe first film's screenwriter, Gary Dauberman, returned for Annabelle: Creation, though he didn't do anyone a favour. The script is full of mawkish dialogue weakly delivered by the film's child actors. The cast's standout kid is Bateman who gets the most screen time and uses it as well as she can. Horror movies have always loved the terror of young girls (and orphans), and Bateman plays the quivering-lipped innocent with aplomb.\n\nHowever, Sandberg does nothing to update his horror film from some of the genre's more damaging stereotypes. Bateman's character Janice has recently been disabled by a polio outbreak and it's her physical weakness, the movie suggests, that makes her the doll's first target. Sandberg's film faithfully hews to Hollywood's old tropes about disability as a \"burden\" to the able-bodied and as weakness to be preyed on. Sandberg's last film, Lights Out, also took aim at disability by concluding that depression can be rooted out - through the act of suicide. It seems it's not just Annabelle: Creation that is stuck in the 1950s.", "time": "04:18:00"}

Ed and Lorraine Warren, based on the real-life paranormal investigators, helped them seal away the doll's evil, then locked it in a cabinet in their home. Now we have not just an Annabelle spin-off film, but also Annabelle: Creation, a prequel to that spin-off. And according to GameSpot's Annabelle: Creation review, it's pretty good.\n\nBetween The Conjuring 1 and 2, the Annabelle films, and the upcoming The Nun and The Crooked Man, we've got a new connected film universe with director and producer James Wan pulling the strings. Annabelle: Creation is out today in theaters, and to fully enjoy it, it's important to know how they all fit together.\n\nAt the center are the Warrens, played by the excellent Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. The characters work with the Catholic church to assist families whose homes have been invaded by demons. These invasions range from Poltergeist-like household phenomena--such as lights flicking on and off, or strange noises--to, in extreme cases, full-on demonic possession. That's what we saw in The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2, as the Warrens helped families in the US and England, at great personal cost to their own health and sanity.\n\nBut while the Warrens star in the Conjuring movies, the Wan-iverse has expanded beyond Wilson and Farmiga's characters.\n\nThe story of Annabelle\n\nThe first spin-off, 2014's Annabelle, offered an origin story of sorts for the titular doll. Annabelle had previously appeared only in a few brief scenes in The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2, mostly locked in a display case. The Annabelle spin-off showed that the doll became a conduit for evil forces after a satanic cultist died while holding it in her arms, her blood dripping into its creepy eye socket.\n\nIn the films' canon, Annabelle itself isn't really the possessed. The Warrens explain that it's simply a conduit for demons, who use it to manipulate and terrorize their victims.\n\nAnnabelle: Creation, which might be the only good prequel to a spin-off ever made, goes back even further in the doll's history and shows its true origin.\n\nThe Annabelle doll was created by a dollmaker named Mr. Mullin. In the movie's opening scene, he crafts the first Annabelle doll and numbers it 1 out of 100, which explains why the doll's been referred to as a rare collector's item in the films.\n\nShortly after he creates the Annabelle doll, Mullins' young daughter dies tragically. Without spoiling anything in the new Annabelle movie, let it suffice to say she doesn't stay gone for long. Annabelle: Creation's ending ties a nice little bow on, providing a clear connection between both Annabelle movies.\n\nThe Nun and The Crooked Man\n\nThe Conjuring 3 is in the works, although we know little about it at this point. Before we rejoin the Warrens for another ghost-hunt, we'll learn more about The Nun, who first appeared in The Conjuring 2 and has a neat cameo in Annabelle: Creation.\n\nThe Nun terrorized Vera Farmiga's character, Lorraine Warren, throughout The Conjuring 2. Lorraine seemed to be particularly affected by the habit-wearing demon, implying she might have some personal connection with it. To add fuel to that, the actress's sister, Taissa Farmiga, is starring in the spin-off. And in Annabelle: Creation, Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman) and Mr. Mullins see the Nun briefly appear in an old photo, though they don't seem to quite grasp what they're glimpsing.\n\nSo it seems The Nun may have concrete connections with other characters in the Wan-iverse. The spin-off is currently in post-production, James Wan recently told Entertainment Weekly, and The Nun's release date is currently set for 2018.\n\nAfter that, it's on to The Crooked Man, another ghoul who first appeared in The Conjuring 2. The Crooked Man is based on a children's rhyme:\n\n\"There was a crooked man, and he walked a crooked mile / He found a crooked sixpence upon a crooked stile / He bought a crooked cat, which caught a crooked mouse / And they all lived together in a little crooked house.\"\n\nIn The Conjuring 2, the Crooked Man leapt from a child's zoetrope to scare the crap out of an English family. He even impersonated a dog, implying that he can twist his weird body into various shapes.\n\nThe Crooked Man's release date isn't set yet, as the film is still in its early stages. But Wan told EW that he thinks the fourth Conjuring spin-off will be \"somewhat of that dark fairytale, and more whimsical, subgenre.\"\n\n\"What we want to do, with The Conjuring universe, is we want each of our little offshoots to have a very different flavor...I love the idea that, within the Conjuring universe, each of our little movies all have their own flavor, so that way they don't feel like they're the same films,\" Wan said.\n\nHaving launched not just the Conjuring universe, but the Saw and Insidious franchises as well, Wan is officially a master of modern horror. Needless to say, fans are looking forward to whatever comes next in the Wan-iverse.", "time": "19:51:00"}

Trackers had pegged the film for an opening of $27-30 million. Instead, \"Creation\" has nearly matched the opening results of the first \"Annabelle,\" which made $37.1 million in 2014.\n\nWhile critics mostly panned the first \"Annabelle\" with a 29 percent rating, critics who saw \"Creation\" at the Los Angeles Film Festival and San Diego Comic-Con were much more positive, giving this prequel a 69 percent RT score. Audiences gave the film a B on CinemaScore, same as its predecessor.\n\nTaking second is another WB film, \"Dunkirk,\" which earned $11.4 million in its fourth weekend. That result puts \"Dunkirk\" past the $150 million domestic mark with $153 million.\n\nIn third is Open Road's \"The Nut Job 2,\" which is performing well below tracker projections with $8.5 million against studio and tracker pre-weekend projections in the mid-teens. Anything less than an A- for an animated film on CinemaScore is considered poor reception, as strong results from underage audiences tend to bump up the grade. But \"Nut Job 2\" only received a B+ on CinemaScore, while receiving an abysmal 11 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nIn fourth is Columbia/MRC's \"The Dark Tower,\" which took a 60 percent hit from its $19.5 million opening to make $7.7 million in its second weekend. Fighting for the last spot in the top five are two holdover titles: \"Girls Trip\" and \"The Emoji Movie,\" which are both estimated to make around $6.5 million this weekend. It's a particularly good result for \"Girls Trip,\" as this week it will become the first comedy to gross $100 million domestically.", "time": "14:58:00"}

Young men can be relied upon to turn out for scary movies, but instead of hoping they'll drag dates along, studios have gotten more proactive in developing relatable characters for women rather than relegating them to the pure-victim status of \"scream queens.\" This feminine outreach is quite apparent in \"Annabelle: Creation.\"\n\nDemon-possessed doll Annabelle first appeared in the 2013 horror film \"The Conjuring,\" then got her own titular spinoff film a year later. To \"flesh out\" an origin story -- one blessedly free of \"this really happened, we swear!\" nonsense -- the prequel \"Annabelle: Creation\" backs up a dozen years to the mid-1950s (and a dozen years before that for its prologue). Having \"nowhere else to go,\" six orphan girls accompany Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman of \"Narcos\") to a remote, rambling farmhouse. Their hosts: retired dollmaker Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia) and his invalid wife, Esther (Miranda Otto), who lost their daughter in a tragic accident and have been haunted, figuratively or literally, ever since.\n\nWhen leg-braced Little Orphan Janice (Talitha Bateman) discovers big ol' creepy doll Annabelle, the human girl unleashes a supernatural horror the Mullinses have attempted to bless away and board up. Screenwriter Gary Dauberman (\"Annabelle\") seems afraid to commit to the Mullinses being a few sandwiches short of a picnic, lest the grieving parents come off as unsympathetic. This choice makes the premise absurdly contrived: We're never convinced that it makes any sense to have kept the Annabelle doll intact on their property, much less that they would take on a gaggle of orphan girls while showing little if any parental pull toward them.\n\nImpractical psychology aside, Dauberman gives talented Swedish-born horror director David F. Sandberg (\"Lights Out\") a highly practical playground for chills and spills: the tinkling bell of largely unseen Esther; malfunctioning household equipment like a dumbwaiter and a chair lift; a vinyl record of \"You Are My Sunshine;\" a conspicuously large well; a barn with a scarecrow; and more deep, dark shadows than you can shake a failing flashlight at. The farmhouse proves to be Sandberg's wheelhouse, and he's skilled enough to make something intermittently gripping of the haunted-house boilerplate.\n\nUnsettlingly lively dolls have been a horror staple dating back at least as far as \"Twilight Zone\" episodes like \"The After Hours,\" \"The Dummy\" and \"Living Doll.\" Indeed, \"Annabelle: Creation\" gets good mileage from its throwback feel: the period setting and an emphasis on girls' games, from hide-and-seek to the slumber-party standard of ghost stories by flashlight under a sheet. In and of themselves, the trappings of \"The Conjuring\" series (joint-crunching contortions, say, evil-spirit peekaboo, and an unsubtle cross motif) have gotten awfully old, and even after a patient buildup, they wear out their welcome ahead of schedule.

The movie introduced us to the demon hunting Warrens and their chamber of horrors, the most of horrific of those being a creepy doll known as Annabelle. Despite having hardly any screen time, she's what most audience members remember most vividly. It was inevitable then that she would get her own film. Sadly, Annabelle was a disappointment, falling into all the horror cliches without much originality. Now though Wan has brought in David F Sandberg, who directed last year's brilliant Light's Out as the story travels even further back in time.\n\nThe Mullin family are God-fearing gentle folks who live a nice peaceful life together out in the sticks. Patriarch Samuel (Anthony LaPaglia) makes a living as a doll-maker, something his daughter Bee (Samara Lee) loves. The happiness is cut short however, when Bee is tragically killed. Cut to twelve years later and the clearly changed Mullins open their house to a young nun and her orphan wards. Janice (Talitha Bateman), one of the youngest of the group, has been stricken with polio, and whilst the other girls go off exploring their new environment, she is trapped indoors. She begins to explore the house and soon realises that the Mullins are hiding a deadly secret and a familiar faced doll is connected to it. Can Janice and her friends survive?\n\nAnnabelle: Creation is vastly superior to Annabelle, the story making more sense and better fitting into the Conjuring universe. However, it is so much like a Conjuring film that lines get blurred; the film relies on a lot of the conventions within Conjuring 1 and 2. The most distracting element is that one of our main orphans is named Janice, a name that is just too similar to Janet, the terrorised tween in The Conjuring 2. It's a constant reminder of the other film, and when coupled with the usual drawn-out scare sequences, feels a little too much like a hybrid of The Conjuring and its sequel. Also, in a bid to remind audiences about this new cinematic universe there is at least one cameo from the other films (which obviously comes later in the story). These feel a little cheap and, as they add nothing to the narrative, could easily have been left out.\n\nRelated: Annabelle review\n\nAnother niggle is the run-time. It's not very often that a horror film that is longer than around 90 minutes actually needs the extra time, and this is a perfect example. Clocking in at just under two hours there's a very slow and measured pace to the story which drags in places. We also don't need to see every girl terrorised by something ghastly, just leave it as the main characters.\n\nWhat David F Sandberg does well though, is a scare sequence, and Creation has plenty of them. Pretty much the entire middle third is one continuous string of nightmarish visuals. They're not quite on the same level as his work on Light's Out, but are effective all the same. He manages to capture that 'in the middle of the night terror' that children experience perfectly, and several moments are bound to pop into your head late at night and scare you all over again.\n\nThe young cast are great, this is a film that focuses way more on the kids than the adults. Linda (Lulu Wilson) is rather kick-ass as she faces her fears in order to try and save her best friend. She definitely has all the makings of a future final girl. Wilson was last seen playing Doris in Ouija: Origin of Evil, and whilst it's a little odd seeing her on the other side of demonic possession, she once more proves that she's a young star to keep an eye on.\n\nThe timid will spend more of the movie looking at the palms of their hands than at the actual film, whilst the hardy will enjoy how deftly the scares are set-up. The ending is clever and pleasing to those invested in this cinematic universe; it is seemingly a fitting ending of the story of the demonic doll, unless we get a prequel to the prequel's prequel...\n\nAlthough a little bloated and too concerned with linking into The Conjuring universe, Annabelle: Creation is a massive step-up from Annabelle. With great performances by the young cast, and some excellent scare sequences, Creation has more than enough to keep you up at night.", "time": "08:35:00"}

Variety reports the film brought in $4 million in its debut night. Those numbers indicate the film is well on its way to a strong opening weekend among a landscape of less than impressive films.\n\nThe late summer slump has made Hollywood a bit nervous as most the country prepares to go back to school. While the fall is still going to be bringing big flicks such as \"Thor: Ragnarok\" movie goers have been dropping off as we move towards September. The demon possessed doll could bring a much-needed spark to theaters this weekend.\n\nConsidering Warner Bros. spent jut $15 million in order to bring \"Annabelle\" to life, the $4 million in one day has to be good news for the studio. At the same time, there has been a bit of a dropoff when compared to opening weekends of other movies in the series.\n\nThe original \"Annabelle\" opened with $37.1 million while \"#The Conjuring\" had $41.9 million and \"The Conjuring 2\" brought in a little over $40.4 million. The prequel might simply be suffering from \"Annabelle\" fatigue. It could also be that there aren't any big name actors in this flick such as Patrick Wilson, who has made appearances in several of the films in the series. \"Creation\" looks plenty spooky and has been getting decent reviews, but doesn't have a big name actor in order to draw in people who aren't already hooked on the franchise.\n\nWhile \"Annabelle: Creation\" is having a strong, if not improbable opening, there appears to be enough strength behind the series to continue making more. While filiming \"Aquaman\" the man most known for helping to make this horror franchise so popular, James Wan talked about the work he's doing.\n\nAccording to Entertainment Weekly, Wan told the publication, \"When we were starting out, when we made the first Conjuring, we always kind of quietly, jokingly, among ourselves, felt that the world of the Warrens, and all the interesting artifacts they have in their haunted room, could have their own stories and therefore spawn movies.\"\n\nNow the producer and director is indeed working on \"The Conjuring 3\" as well as yet another spinoff called \"The Crooked Man.\" Just when those finally hit theaters likely depends on just how well \"Annabelle: Creation\" does in theaters.", "time": "22:00:00"}

Other spinoffs and sequels are in the works, and the whole blooming enterprise has become known as the \"Conjuring Universe.\"\n\n\"Annabelle: Creation\" begins with the accidental death in the 1940s of the beloved young daughter of a doll-maker (Anthony LaPaglia) and his wife (Miranda Otto). Fast forward, and a busload of orphans -- six girls, under the charge of a goody-goody nun (Stephanie Sigman) -- are being dropped off at the bereaved couple's spacious country house, where the doll-maker has offered them refuge.\n\nThe youngsters, who seem remarkably well-scrubbed and cheerful for orphans, are delighted with their new digs, even if: 1) they are forbidden to enter the mysterious locked room, wherein resides a creepy doll, and 2) they must tread lightly so as not to disturb the now bed-ridden mother of the dead girl.\n\nYou may be guessing they've entered a classic haunted house, or house of horrors, and you are correct. You are also right if you're guessing that glimpses of the deceased daughter will figure prominently in what follows.\n\nThe focus is on the two youngest orphans, Janice (Talitha Bateman) and Linda (Lulu Wilson), great pals who have sworn to stick together no matter what. Spunky Janice is a polio victim, and you may be sure that she will drop her brace at crucial moments. She's the first to enter the locked room, after which there is heck to pay, horror-movie style.\n\nAn amusing note: The house happens to have one of those mechanical chairs that moves on a track up and down stairs, perfect for Janice. The chair figures in one of the movie's more intriguing sequences. The film also has a bit of fun with a scarecrow.\n\nThe director is David F. Sandberg, who made a better horror picture in 2016 called \"Lights Out.\" Give him credit for accomplishing as much as he has in \"Annabelle: Creation\" while working under the constraints of a sequel (either the second or fourth picture; see above).\n\nThere are \"gotcha\" jolts that definitely got me, but for each of those, there must be a half-dozen scares telegraphed in very large letters. I think \"Annabelle: Creation\" is suffering from sequelitis.\n\nHorror. With Talitha Bateman, Lulu Wilson, Anthony LaPaglia, Miranda Otto, Stephanie Sigman. Directed by David F. Sandberg. Rated R. 109 minutes.", "time": "21:01:00"}

Ed and Lorraine Warren, based on the real-life paranormal investigators, helped them seal away the doll's evil, then locked it in a cabinet in their home. Now we have not just an Annabelle spin-off film, but also Annabelle: Creation, a prequel to that spin-off. And according to GameSpot's Annabelle: Creation review, it's pretty good.\n\nBetween The Conjuring 1 and 2, the Annabelle films, and the upcoming The Nun and The Crooked Man, we've got a new connected film universe with director and producer James Wan pulling the strings. Annabelle: Creation is out today in theaters, and to fully enjoy it, it's important to know how they all fit together.\n\nAt the center are the Warrens, played by the excellent Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. The characters work with the Catholic church to assist families whose homes have been invaded by demons. These invasions range from Poltergeist-like household phenomena-such as lights flicking on and off, or strange noises-to, in extreme cases, full-on demonic possession. That's what we saw in The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2, as the Warrens helped families in the US and England, at great personal cost to their own health and sanity.\n\nBut while the Warrens star in the Conjuring movies, the Wan-iverse has expanded beyond Wilson and Farmiga's characters.\n\nThe first spin-off, 2014's Annabelle, offered an origin story of sorts for the titular doll. Annabelle had previously appeared only in a few brief scenes in The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2, mostly locked in a display case. The Annabelle spin-off showed that the doll became a conduit for evil forces after a satanic cultist died while holding it in her arms, her blood dripping into its creepy eye socket.\n\nIn the films' canon, Annabelle itself isn't really the possessed. The Warrens explain that it's simply a conduit for demons, who use it to manipulate and terrorize their victims.\n\nAnnabelle: Creation, which might be the only good prequel to a spin-off ever made, goes back even further in the doll's history and shows its true origin.\n\nThe Annabelle doll was created by a dollmaker named Mr. Mullin. In the movie's opening scene, he crafts the first Annabelle doll and numbers it 1 out of 100, which explains why the doll's been referred to as a rare collector's item in the films.\n\nShortly after he creates the Annabelle doll, Mullins' young daughter dies tragically. Without spoiling anything in the new Annabelle movie, let it suffice to say she doesn't stay gone for long. Annabelle: Creation's ending ties a nice little bow on, providing a clear connection between both Annabelle movies.\n\nThe Conjuring 3 is in the works, although we know little about it at this point. Before we rejoin the Warrens for another ghost-hunt, we'll learn more about The Nun, who first appeared in The Conjuring 2 and has a neat cameo in Annabelle: Creation.\n\nThe Nun terrorized Vera Farmiga's character, Lorraine Warren, throughout The Conjuring 2. Lorraine seemed to be particularly affected by the habit-wearing demon, implying she might have some personal connection with it. To add fuel to that, the actress's sister, Taissa Farmiga, is starring in the spin-off. And in Annabelle: Creation, Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman) and Mr. Mullins see the Nun briefly appear in an old photo, though they don't seem to quite grasp what they're glimpsing.\n\nSo it seems The Nun may have concrete connections with other characters in the Wan-iverse. The spin-off is currently in post-production, James Wan recently told Entertainment Weekly, and The Nun's release date is currently set for 2018.\n\nAfter that, it's on to The Crooked Man, another ghoul who first appeared in The Conjuring 2. The Crooked Man is based on a children's rhyme:\n\n\"There was a crooked man, and he walked a crooked mile / He found a crooked sixpence upon a crooked stile / He bought a crooked cat, which caught a crooked mouse / And they all lived together in a little crooked house.\"\n\nIn The Conjuring 2, the Crooked Man leapt from a child's zoetrope to scare the crap out of an English family. He even impersonated a dog, implying that he can twist his weird body into various shapes.\n\nThe Crooked Man's release date isn't set yet, as the film is still in its early stages. But Wan told EW that he thinks the fourth Conjuring spin-off will be \"somewhat of that dark fairytale, and more whimsical, subgenre.\"\n\n\"What we want to do, with The Conjuring universe, is we want each of our little offshoots to have a very different flavor...I love the idea that, within the Conjuring universe, each of our little movies all have their own flavor, so that way they don't feel like they're the same films,\" Wan said.\n\nHaving launched not just the Conjuring universe, but the Saw and Insidious franchises as well, Wan is officially a master of modern horror. Needless to say, fans are looking forward to whatever comes next in the Wan-iverse.", "time": "21:50:00"}

As such spinoffs are released to expand upon that world, though it has been met with mixed results. For one thing, Annabelle: while a commercial success, the spinoff was a critical disappointment. But studios are more concerned with the former, so of course, we're going to get a continuation of that poorly received spinoff.\n\nBut here is the surprising thing about Annabelle: Creation, it's actually pretty good. Lights Out director David F. Sandberg's latest effort uses all the traditional horror tropes that deliver plenty of chills and thrills. But because it uses all those familiar elements, it all suffers from the same pitfalls. Still, it is a prequel spinoff that gets the job done, and really, that's all you could ask for. Check out my full review below.\n\nSamuel (Anthony LaPaglia) and Esther (Miranda Otto) Mullins are a seemingly happy family. Together with their daughter, Bee (Samara Lee), they attend church and have a unique way of playing hide-and-seek that involves using slips of paper. But their happiness is ripped away when their daughter dies in a freak accident. 12 years later, they open their home to a nun Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman) and a group of orphan girls. Janice (Talitha Bateman), one of the orphans who suffers from polio, begins to hear and see the spirit that lurks within the shadows of the house.\n\nIn typical horror movie fashion, Samuel explains the house rules and tells which rooms the girls can and cannot enter. And of course, these rules are broken. Because it wouldn't be much of a horror film if anyone followed the rules. But Janice has a very good reason to break the rules because the spirit is slipping pieces of paper through the door and is leading her to Bee's room, which is one of the rooms that Samuel prohibited anyone from entering. And of course, because the spirit cannot break free on its own, it gets the curious young girl to help break the chains. From there, Annabelle: Creation follows the horror playbook using all the typical tropes we are accustomed to seeing in any horror film.\n\nBut that really isn't so bad. Here all the delightful frights are set up long in advance. Sandberg lays out the pieces early on knowing that they will serve a greater purpose in the end. There's the dumbwaiter that \"mysteriously\" opens on its own, there's the stairlift that only works when a person is buckled in, and the record player that cannot play. But Sandberg intertwines all of that with the horror favorites like creaky floors, the staring into the complete darkness, the soulless Annabelle doll with the dead eyes, and the long silent pauses. So when we see that dumbwaiter or that chairlift again, we would have probably have forgotten about it because we were so busy being scared earlier on in the film.\n\nIt's not as though we haven't seen all of these before. Clearly, Sandberg knows what works and how to get someone to jump out of their seat. But by the time we are getting to the end of Annabelle: Creation, it all becomes a practice in stupidity. Characters are making remarkably bad decisions. Again, it's just another common trope in these horror films. No one believes in the young girl, they don't escape from their living nightmare when they have a chance, the religious family reaches out to a great evil rather than God. Again, it's a been there done that scenario.\n\nStill, even though Annabelle: Creation doesn't offer anything fresh or new, it can still scare the hell out of you with patience and panache. That lurking darkness you can't just help but peer into. You look into it, knowing that something will pop out, but the evil presence just waits until you drop your guard, and with the help of creepy sounds and frightfully swelling music, it scares the bejesus out of you. Then there's the look of the soulless dolls with the dead eyes, and a scarecrow that you know will come back and haunt you.\n\nSo while it may be a bit predictable at times, Annabelle: Creation is very much a frightfully fun movie. But don't expect it to be one that effectively traumatizes you.", "time": "18:37:00"}

The sequel was a heavy-handed clunker, scary in places but lazy. Who needs another stab at it, so to speak?\n\nEveryone, evidently. \"Annabelle: Creation,\" a prequel to the events of \"The Conjuring,\" is a surprisingly effective horror film, which is to say it's scary in all the smart ways.\n\nThe dumb ones, too -- this is a movie about a possessed doll, after all. That's part of the fun. But director David F. Sandberg, whose short film \"Lights Out\" is terrific (the resulting feature-length version a little less so), is a welcome addition to the \"Conjuring\" stable, adept as he is at stretching out the tension between scares till you're practically sweating, waiting for something horrible to happen to someone.\n\nAnd oh, it does.\n\nThe film begins with what the title suggests: the literal creation of the doll, in the 1950s. Sam (Anthony LaPaglia),\ufffc a doll maker, is putting the finishing touches on the first, and presumably only, doll in this particular line.\n\nNo sooner is he done than his daughter, Bee (Samara Lee)\ufffc -- real name Annabelle -- leaves him notes for a hide-and-seek game. The thing about a horror movie is that you can't watch an innocent game without a sense of foreboding. But Sam and Bee and wife and mother Esther (Miranda Otto)\ufffc are happy, romping around in their giant house in the middle of nowhere.\n\nThen tragedy strikes, and we move forward 12\ufffc years. A bus pulls in at the home, with Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman)\ufffc and a group of orphaned girls arriving; they'll be living here now. Sam is quiet and a little surly. Esther is bedridden, hidden behind a curtain in her bedroom. But they open their home to the girls -- except for Bee's room, which is locked and, Sam warns, stays that way.\n\nFor a while, anyway.\n\nThe youngest girls, Janice (Talitha Bateman),\ufffc who had polio and walks with a brace and crutch, and Linda (Lulu Wilson),\ufffc are shunted off by the older girls to the room where Esther made doll clothes. Of course it's tremendously creepy, even in the daylight. (More on that soon.)\n\nThen one night Janice hears a noise and sees the same note under the door Bee once left for her father: \"Find me.\" She thinks it's the older girls playing around, so she follows, and winds up, of course, in Bee's room. It's preserved exactly as she left it, down to the dollhouse with working lights. In that house Janice finds a key that leads to a secret room. And in that room?\n\nWhat else? The doll.\n\nIt's eerie enough just sitting there in a rocking chair. But Sandberg, working from Gary Dauberman's\ufffc script, works the scene perfectly. Is that the doll in the shadows? Where'd she go? It's probably no surprise that the guy who made a movie called \"Lights Out\" is adept at manipulating light and dark for maximum unease. It's certainly enjoyable.\n\nSo now it's on. In the manner of these things, many boxes still must be checked -- there have to be a few jump scares, agonizingly bad decisions must be made, people must die, secrets must be revealed. Check, check, check and check.\n\nBut there are also some nice detours from the usual horror-movie path. For instance, there's a scare scene in broad daylight (at least it begins there) -- a studio suggestion, Sandberg says. And the relationship between Janice and Linda goes from sweet to scary to heartbreaking. Risky business putting children front and center in this kind of movie, but Bateman and Wilson are good enough to make it work.\n\nThe ending gets the whole Annabelle mythology back on track (and includes a nod to the real doll, still in the collection of Lorraine Warren\ufffc and her late husband, Ed,\ufffc the paranormal investigators on whose work the \"Conjuring\" films are based).\n\n\"Annabelle: Creation\" isn't the equal of \"The Conjuring,\" or even \"The Conjuring 2,\"\ufffc for that matter. But it's a well-made horror film and a solid addition to the canon.\n\nBill Goodykoontz, USA TODAY Network\n\n\u2605\u26051/2\n\nNew Line Cinema presents a film directed by David F.

Increasingly dismal returns make the winners, like Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, Wonder Woman, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, stand out, but the numbers have been far from consistent. Enter Annabelle: Creation, David F. Sandberg's Conjuring spinoff, to save the weekend.\n\nThe $15 million doll horror flick made back its budget completely on Friday night, and is poised to take the weekend with a projected take of around $36.5 million, per The Wrap. Helped along by nearly unanimously positive reviews, the movie is close to matching its predecessor Annabelle's $37.1 million opening in October 2014, and if it manages to scare up a few more ticket sales it could open nearer the two Conjuring films, which were each around $40 million.\n\nThis is great news for Warner Bros., which will take both top spots this weekend as Dunkirk continues its great run with another $10.5 million in its fourth weekend in theaters. The studio already won the summer earlier last month when Wonder Woman's gross topped that of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, and it has been breaking records ever since -- becoming the top-grossing female-led movie ever made, and achieving the elusive $400 million mark domestically, putting it in league with such films as The Dark Knight and The Avengers. (The Koch brothers should be pleased.)\n\nIn third and fourth place so far are The Nut Job and The Dark Tower, both of which suffer from bad reviews and bad box office reception. Rounding out the top five is Girls Trip, which, in its fourth weekend, could make around $6.3 million, bringing its domestic total to $97 million -- making it the first studio comedy to break the $100 million mark this year.", "time": "15:48:00"}

The prequel to 2014's \"Annabelle\" is conjuring up a $36 million domestic debut.\n\nAccording to estimates, Warner Bros.' supernatural horror will easily win its opening weekend after taking in $15 million from 3,502 locations on Friday, including Thursday night previews. Talitha Bateman, Lulu Wilson, Stephanie Sigman, Miranda Otto, and Anthony LaPaglia star in the origin story behind the killer, antique doll from director David F. Sandberg.\n\nAlso in the double digits for WB, \"Dunkirk\" continues to steamroll its blockbuster competition in second place. Despite being in its fourth frame, Christopher Nolan's World War II drama is expected to add just under $11 million to its total after making just over $3 million from 3,762 screens on Friday. That number is also expected to officially put \"Dunkirk\" over the $150 million marker domestically with $153 million.\n\nNew entry \"Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature\" also managed to snag a spot in the top 3, despite only pulling off an $8 million heist. The sequel to 2014's \"The Nut Job\" scored just shy of $3 million from 4,003 screens on Friday. Will Arnett, Maya Rudolph, Brendan Frasier, Katherine Heigl, Liam Neeson, and Jackie Chan lend their voices for the Open Road animation.\n\nElsewhere, last week's winner \"The Dark Tower\" falls from No. 1 to No. 4. It seems the negative word of mouth/press has halted Sony's Stephen King adaptation in its second frame. After making just over $2 million from 3,451 locales on Friday, \"The Dark Tower\" is only expected to make $7.5 million this time around.\n\nLast but certainly not least, \"Girls Trip\" is still going strong.

The one exception to this rule seems to be the skin-crawling chillers set in James Wan's Conjuring universe.\n\nThose films, which follow the exploits of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, led to a spinoff revolving around a devilish doll, Annabelle (2014), and now a prequel Annabelle: Creation. And while the Conjuring films are based on the true case files of the Warrens, the Annabelle films are rooted firmly in the imagination of screenwriter Gary Dauberman.\n\nSet decades before the first Annabelle, Annabelle: Creation opens on the idyllic Mullins family - a doll-maker (Anthony LaPaglia), his wife (Miranda Otto) and their young daughter Bee (Samara Lee) - who are living peacefully in the countryside.\n\nTragedy strikes when Bee dies unexpectedly and the narrative fast forwards 12 years when we see a busload of orphan girls and a nun (Stephanie Sigman) taking up residence at the bereaved couple's country house.\n\nHanding the prequel reins to director David F. Sandberg - who helmed last year's spooky breakout Lights Out - works remarkably well because he's able to take this simple premise and carefully build a feeling of dread and suspense.\n\nThe girls are given a few rules - don't enter Bee's old bedroom and be careful not to disturb Mrs. Mullins, who is now mysteriously bed-ridden. So naturally one of them - Janice (Talitha Bateman), who has to wear a leg brace because of polio - decides to enter the room.\n\nSandberg pans through the sprawling house giving the audience an idea of the layout including all the secret crawl spaces and the shed outside with a freakish scarecrow. We know all the places the girls can run.\n\nAfter Janice enters the locked bedroom she begins to see a ghostly version of Bee and that creepy doll we all know (and don't really love) beckons from inside a closet lined with pages from the Bible.\n\nHer pal Linda (Lulu Wilson), who has sworn they must be adopted together, seems smart enough to realize that maybe she should stay out of the room, but the moment Janice opens the door you know someone's soul is in trouble.\n\nThis is a horror, so the lights go kerflooey, a mechanical chair that Janice uses to go up and down the stairs is gonna, um, give her problems, there will be some frights courtesy of that scarecrow ( 'memba him?) and that eerie Annabelle doll isn't going to go quietly into the night.\n\nIf there's a moral to this horror fable, it's: when someone tells you to stay out of a room, you stay out of a room.\n\nWe won't spoil how the demon toy becomes possessed, but by stranding the girls at the couple's spacious country house Sandberg manages to squeeze out more than a few jolts armed only with an isolated setting, a doll and some mood lighting.\n\nBonus points go to the clever tie-in to the original Annabelle as well as a subtle nod to the next Conjuring spinoff - The Nun.", "time": "19:34:00"}

Don't be fooled, she's just a regular Malibu Stacy with a stupid, cheap hat. She still embodies all the awful stereotypes she did before!\n\nSmithers: But she's got a new hat!\n\nBetter Tagline: \"We're gonna keep making these until you people stop paying to see them.\"\n\nNot So Brief Plot Synopsis: Twelve years after the tragic death of their daughter, dollmaker Samuel (Anthony LaPaglia) and Esther (Miranda Otto) Mullins have opened their rural California home to six orphan girls. Shortly thereafter, Janice (Talitha Bateman) - one of the younger girls who also happens to be hobbled by polio - gains access to the dead little girl's bedroom, finding the old doll her father made for her and apparently awakening a spirit that may or may not have benign intentions (take a wild guess).\n\n\"Critical\" Analysis: Annabelle: Creation is the prequel to Annabelle, itself a prequel to The Conjuring; a prequel to the prequel, in other words. And even though we literally see the malevolent doll being constructed in this movie, these films have been lucrative enough that there's little doubt producer James Wan and company could make an infinite series of these, going back to the planting of the tree the doll is eventually carved from and showing how it [throws dart] grew on a cursed Paiute burial ground.\n\nThe events herein take place in 1957, 12 years before Annabelle. Period horror is always helpful for eliminating things like smartphones and explaining why nobody breaks windows trying to escape a demon (people were more respectful back then). Construction was also sturdier, which explains why no one else in the house wakes up when two pre-adolescents are shrieking their heads off in the dead of night.\n\nAlso, before the events of the film, the Mullins called in an exorcist at one point to deal with the damned doll. You might assume the Catholic Church would've been more diligent in its screening of possible orphanage sites. Then again, worrying about the safety of children has never been its strong suit.\n\nThat's not to say Annabelle: Creation is a failure, by any means. There are some effective scares and director David F. Sandberg (Lights Out) at least takes a stab at building dread in the first act. And if we have a hard time accepting why the girls keep returning to the property after multiple instances of telekinesis, demon fu and ambulatory scarecrows, Sandberg and writer Gary Dauberman (who also wrote Annabelle) at least ratchet up the unease by making the protagonist disabled, a rarity in horror movies.\n\n(The fact that it's set in the '50s means Gary Busey can't even give you a cool motorcycle/wheelchair hybrid.)\n\nBut here's the thing: Dolls aren't inherently scary (hot take: neither are clowns). They are (occasionally crude) representations of us, but any incidental unease is a result of the uncanny valley, as most dolls aren't meant to be accurate depictions of humankind. That's why horror movies involving a ventriloquist's dummy or clown toy are effective, because they give that otherwise ordinary object a shove into the sinister. However, all that goes out the window when the doll in question is deliberately crafted to be as disturbing as possible.\n\nThis is ultimately what makes LaPaglia's character the true villain of the Annabelle movies. Samuel Mullins's evident hatred for his only daughter, whose birth probably held him back from his celebrity dreams of big-city dollmaking, led him to fashion a moppet so hideous it attracted malign spirits and sent the poor girl into such despair she saw no choice but to throw herself in front of an oncoming car. It's the only explanation for why anybody would keep that f*cking thing around.\n\nThe movies of the Conjuring series present something of a conundrum. They're fairly well made, in general (the Wan-less Annabelle being distinctly inferior), creating suspenseful atmosphere and securing better than average talent for the proceedings (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga for the original movies, LaPaglia and Otto this time around). On the other hand, the \"mythology\" is either abject bullshit (the Warrens were notorious frauds) or whatever other elements Wan and company decide to cram in there. Crooked Man? Sure. Creepy nun? Why the hell not (she's even getting her own movie next year)?\n\nAnd in the end, these movies are just...wearying. One dimly lit jump scare follows another until we're raising our hands not to hide our eyes but to check our watches. Annabelle: Creation is still scarier than most, but it's time to come up with some new tricks.", "time": "08:51:00"}

Find out how they will do in this week's edition of The Bottom Line!\n\nThe Dark Tower managed to top the box office despite overwhelmingly mediocre reviews. It took in $19.2 million, which is not great for a film that's supposed to launch a whole series of movies and TV shows. It just narrowly beat Dunkirk, which dropped to number two with $17.2 million. The Emoji Movie continues to take a poop emoji on the box office by taking third place with $12.1 million. Girls Trip took fourth with $11.5 million, and finally Kidnap somehow managed to crack the top five with $10.1 million.\n\nOutside of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the DC Extended Universe, it seems the only studio-driven film universe that is achieving any real measure of success is, surprisingly, the Conjuring universe. Both Conjuring films are great and did well at the box office, and Annabelle, the spinoff of the first film, also did good business despite terrible reviews. Other films like The Conjuring 3, a Crooked Man film, and a Creepy Nun movie are all in the works, but now we have the sequel to that first spinoff - or rather, the prequel.\n\nBut the studio seems to have learned from its mistakes with the first film. David F. Sandberg was hired to direct this one after last summer's Lights Out turned out to be a hit (that movie was also produced by James Wan, director of the Conjuring films and my most-trusted name in horror right now). And the reviews have mostly been pretty solid this time around, so that's always a plus.\n\nAnd, in the incredibly specific subgenre of \"well-received prequels to terrible horror films featuring child actress Lulu Wilson as a potentially possessed kid,\" Annabelle: Creation marks the second entry after last year's Ouija: Origin of Evil (sidenote: that movie is dope). I predict this takes number one at the box office, since horror is always a draw and I have no reason to doubt the Conjuringverse yet.\n\nThe reunion of Short Term 12 director Destin Daniel Crettin and star Brie Larson should be something to get pretty excited about, but based on reviews (and its melodramatic trailer), The Glass Castle falls short. It does have a great cast that includes Larson, Woody Harrelson and Naomi Watts, but I doubt audiences are going to flock to this movie. I am going to predict that it opens in fourth place.\n\nNo. Just no. Listen, if you're planning on going to see The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature, more power to you. But I would wager good money that not a single person reading this website has any plans to do so, and I'd also guess that most of you didn't know it was a thing. To those people who didn't know, man do I wish I could be in your shoes. Will this movie do well? I don't know, do kids still like The Nut Job? Did they ever? Who knows man, kids like The Emoji Movie. What can you do? I'll say it doesn't crack the top five.", "time": "21:02:00"}

"body": "Despite a frightfully dry August at the box office, Warner Bros. managed to come out on top with two films leading the weekend numbers.\n\nHorror flick \"Annabelle: Creation,\" which cost about $15 million, came in above expectations, bringing in an estimated $35 million in its first weekend in the U.S. and Canada, above studio expectations of $25 million to $30 million and analysts' expectations of $25 million.\n\n\"We're absolutely thrilled and elated that audiences really embraced Annabelle,\" said Jeff Goldstein, the studio's distribution chief. \"She is just one horrible doll.\"\n\nDirected by David F. Sandberg, the film, about a possessed doll that terrorizes families, is a prequel to 2014's \"Annabelle\" -- which opened to $37.1 million and was itself a prequel to 2013's \"The Conjuring,\" directed by James Wan and based loosely on the stories of real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. With another strong opening and improved reviews (the film received a 68% \"fresh\" on Rotten Tomatoes and a B-rating on CinemaScore), audiences can expect more spinoffs from this franchise in the near future.\n\n\"You're gonna see more,\" Goldstein said. \"And you'll have many more opportunities to be frightened.\"\n\nChristopher Nolan's \"Dunkirk,\" now in its fourth week of release, is maintaining the No. 2 spot on the box office charts after being bumped down from first with last week's release of \"The Dark Tower.\" The World War II drama brought in $11.4 million this week, for a cumulative total of $153.7 million domestically. Its 33% decline from last weekend was among the smallest in the top 10.\n\nNewcomer \"The Nut Job 2: Nutty By Nature\" cracked the top three, bringing in $8.9 million in its first weekend, under analysts' expectations of $12 million to $15 million. Open Road's PG-rated animated comedy is a follow-up to the 2014 success featuring chattering squirrels. The $40-million sequel features the voices of Will Arnett, Katherine Heigl and Maya Rudolph.\n\nThe first \"Nut Job\" opened with $19 million on its way to $64 million domestically, making it Open Road's highest-grossing film. Open Road, launched in 2011 by theater chains Regal Entertainment and AMC Entertainment, recently was acquired by Tang Media Partners, a Los Angeles-based company with backers including China's Tencent Holdings.\n\nWhile Warner Bros. is occupying the top two spots this week, Sony is maintaining the fourth and fifth spots with \"The Dark Tower\" and \"The Emoji Movie,\" respectively.\n\n\"The Dark Tower\" was bumped to fourth place in its second week, bringing in $7.8 million for a cumulative total of $34.3 million in the U.S. and Canada. The film experienced a 59% decline from last weekend, the highest among the films in the top 10. The picture, based on an eight-part Stephen King fantasy series, stars Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey.\n\nComputer-generated comedy \"The Emoji Movie,\" brought in $6.6 million for a cumulative total of $63.6 million. The film, about an app-filled world where emojis wait to be used in humans' text messages, is now in its third week.\n\nLionsgate's drama \"The Glass Castle\" brought in $4.9 million in its first weekend in theaters, debuting at No. 9 on the box office charts. Based on the New York Times bestseller by Jeannette Walls, the film's ensemble cast includes Brie Larson, Woody Harrelson, Naomi Watts and Max Greenfield. Directed by Destin Daniel Cretton (who directed Larson in 2013's indie \"Short Term 12\"), the film earned a so-so 50% \"fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nNext week's wide releases are Lionsgate's action-comedy \"The Hitman's Bodyguard\" starring Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson and \"Logan Lucky,\" Bleecker Street's heist comedy directed by Steven Soderbergh and starring Channing Tatum and Daniel Craig. IFC's Sundance film festival award-winner \"Crown Heights\" starring Lakeith Stanfield opens in limited release.\n\nsonaiya.kelley@latimes.com\n\nfollow me on twitter @sonaiyak\n\nALSO\n\nReview: Hello, dolly!

With the sequel, Annabelle: Creation, arriving this weekend, we thought you'd enjoy the allegedly true story behind the scary doll.\n\nIf there's anyone who knows Annabelle isn't as innocent as she looks, it's Lorraine Warren. A self-described \"trance medium,\" Warren first encountered the doll immortalized in The Conjuring and its new follow-up, Annabelle, in the 1970s. That's when Warren -- whose paranormal-related casework with her late husband, Ed, inspired the horror franchise -- met a pair of nursing students and their friend, who claimed they'd been terrorized by the child's toy. The trio said the doll moved around their apartment (think: an evil Elf on the Shelf), leaving behind cryptic notes -- and occasionally scratch marks.\n\nAs depicted in the opening scene of The Conjuring, the young people told the Warrens a psychic had warned that their doll was possessed by the spirit of a deceased 7-year-old girl named Annabelle Higgins. The Warrens concluded something different: Namely, that the doll was possessed by a demonic spirit.\n\nOn the occasion of the release of Annabelle, which spins off the tale in a new direction, we contacted Warren, now 87, via her occult museum in Monroe, Conn. We asked about the doll's big-screen close-up, whether any childish plaything is above suspicion, and why she and Annabelle are still together, albeit separated by glass.\n\nIn the movies, Annabelle is a menacing-looking porcelain figure. But in real life, Annabelle, which is housed to this day at your museum, is a simple Raggedy Ann rag doll. What was your initial reaction to seeing Hollywood's version?\n\nI thought the doll was absolutely creepy and frightening. [The Conjuring director] James Wan explained to me that he felt there might be push back from the company that holds the trademark for the original Raggedy Ann. Then he went on to explain that he just has an affinity to frightening-looking dolls, so he came up with what now is [the movie version of] Annabelle.\n\nI think it was a good choice to use the scary doll, as a Raggedy Ann doll is much too innocent-looking. Plus, young children would then be afraid to play with their Raggedy Anns!\n\nAt the museum, Annabelle is stored in a glass case bearing a sign that reads, \"Warning, Positively Do Not Open.\" If the doll's a potential danger, why keep her with you at all?\n\nIt would be quite careless on my part to get rid of it. As explained in The Conjuring, getting rid of the doll would only get rid of the vessel, not the evil that resides within the doll.\n\nAt least as it sits, we know where it resides. It isn't out into the world causing harm to others. We have a Catholic priest who performs a binding prayer around the doll which acts as a blockade. The evil can't penetrate the holy prayers that bind it. Think of it as similar to an electric dog fence -- keeping the dog within set boundaries.\n\nJust between you, me, and the entire world, didn't any of the actors or crew from either The Conjuring or Annabelle crack open the case for a first-hand peek?\n\nHeavens, no! We allow no one to touch or handle the doll. Because by touching it, a person's aura may mingle with the aura of that evil force within the doll, and cause great harm to the person.\n\nPatrick Wilson [who played Ed Warren in The Conjuring] came to the museum, and was shown around by my son-in-law, Tony Spera. He said that Patrick seemed to believe the danger associated with Annabelle.\n\nVera Farmiga [who played Lorraine Warren in The Conjuring] opted to stay in the house, in the living room with me. She stated to me that she wanted to focus on me, so as to be able to give a true representation of me to the role she was playing.\n\nHas your experience with Annabelle made you wary of all dolls, or only the creepy ones?\n\nNo, not at all. But remember that I am psychic. I can discern if an object or toy has any negative vibrations or evil associated with it. But, no, I am not suspicious of toys in general.\n\nWatch: Producer James Wan on the Annabelle doll:\n\nRead more from Yahoo Movies:\n\nJennifer Lawrence's happy home goes to hell in startling first 'mother!' trailerGeorge A.

"body": "Still, it's another down weekend at the box office as 'The Nut Job 2' misses and holdovers like 'Dark Tower' and 'Detroit' continue to flail.\n\nMoviegoers like playing with dolls -- or at least menacing ones.\n\nWarner Bros./New Line's R-rated prequel Annabelle: Creation conjured up a pleasing $35 million from 3,502 theaters in its domestic box-office debut, more than enough to scare off the competition even as it came in somewhat behind the previous three films in the successful Conjuring horror franchise.\n\nAnd overall, it was another sluggish weekend at the North American box office, with revenue down more than 30 percent from the same frame last year as new animated offering The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature did muted business and holdovers including The Dark Tower and Detroit continued to struggle.\n\nDirected by David F. Sandberg, Annabelle: Creation follows a doll maker and his wife who, after losing their little girl, welcome a nun and several girls from a shuttered orphanage into their home. But they soon become the target of the doll maker's possessed creation, Annabelle. Females made up the majority of the audinece (52 percent), while a full 46 percent of ticket buyers were under the age of 25.\n\n\"We would have been happy to hit $30 million considering the sluggish marketplace,\" says Warners domestic distribution president Jeff Goldstein.\n\nAnnabelle: Creation is also impressing overseas, where it took in $35 million from 39 markets for an early foreign total of $36.7 million and global total of $71.7 million. It is doing big business, including South Korea ($6.6 million), where the box office doesn't seem affected by the ongoing war of words between North Korea and the Trump administration.\n\nThe horror pic marks another summer win for Warners after Wonder Woman and Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, which remained a formidable force in its fourth weekend, placing No. 2 with $11.4 million and crossing the $150 million mark in North America, no small accomplishment for a World War II drama relying on an older audience. Overseas, Dunkirk earned another $14.5 million for a foreign tally of $210 million and $363.6 million worldwide.\n\nNut Job 2 rolled out in theaters just days after Tang Media announced it is acquiring Open Road from AMC Entertainment and Regal Entertainment. The sequel, directed by Cal Brunker, follows a group of animals trying to stop their serene park from being turned into an amusement venture. The voice cast features Will Arnett, Maya Rudolph, Jackie Chan and Katherine Heigl.\n\nSony's The Dark Tower fell from No. 1 to No. 4 in its second outing with $7.9 million for a disappointing 10-day domestic total of $34.3 million.\n\nUniversal's Girls Trip, one of the most successful live-action comedies in recent times, rounded out the top five with $6.5 million for a domestic total of $97.2 million. The R-rated comedy -- which has earned $8.4 million overseas for a worldwide tally of $105.6 million -- is all but assured of soon crossing the $100 million mark in North America, just as Edgar Wright's Baby Driver did over the weekend in a victory for Sony.\n\nOutside of the top five, Lionsgate's adaptation of Jeannette Walls' best-selling memoir about her harrowing childhood, The Glass Castle, placed No. 9, according to early estimates.\n\nThe drama opened in far fewer theaters than its rivals, or 1,461 locations, grossing an estimated $4.9 million. Brie Larson, who reunites with her Short Term 12 director Destin Daniel Cretton, plays Walls in the film while Woody Harrelson plays Walls' alcoholic father Rex. Naomi Watts plays Walls' mother. Glass Castle, earning an A- CinemaScore, skewed heavily female (80 percent).\n\nDirector Kathryn Bigelow and Annapurna Pictures' Detroit tumbled 58 percent in its second weekend to $3 million for a domestic total of $13.4 million and coming in No. 13.\n\nAl Gore's climate documentary An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power is likewise having trouble finding its footing. The doc, from Paramount and Participant Media, earned $800,000 as it expanded into a total of 556 theaters over the weekend for domestic cume of $2.3 million to date.\n\nThe big headline at the specialty box office was director/writer Matt Spicer's Ingrid Goes West, which opened to $141,216 from three theaters for a screen average of $47,072, the best of the weekend. From Neon, the dramedy stars Aubrey Plaza as an obsessive young woman who moves to Los Angeles to pursue a social \"media\" influencer. Elizabeth Olsen and Billy Magnussen also star.\n\nThe Weinstein Co.'s Wind River posted a strong location average of $14,268 as it moved into 45 theaters in its sophomore outing for an early domestic total of $870,285.", "time": "12:52:00"}

But we're living now in the age of the expanded universe, when franchises don't follow a single forward path, instead stretching outward in multiple directions like the gnarled branches of the spooky tree on the film's poster. The latest extension of the brand is Annabelle: Creation, a prequel to the spin-off they already made about that unholy plaything with the pigtails, pallid complexion, and unnervingly large peepers. Earning its shared-universe keep, the film finds a way not just to tie itself back to the two movies that spawned it, but also to plant a small seed for one of two other spin-offs on the way by randomly alluding to that spectral nun from The Conjuring 2. Will these ghastly attractions be forming some kind of Avengers-style supergroup? The Boo Crew, perhaps?\n\nHonestly, all that interconnected mythology is easy to ignore. What matters is that Annabelle: Creation, much more than its immediate predecessor, adheres to the bump-in-the-dark horror fundamentals that made The Conjuring such a good time and a gold mine. Connecting all of these ghosties and ghoulies to each other ultimately proves a secondary concern. Creation would rather stand hairs on end and send popcorn flying -- and it does both better than any movie in this multi-part series since Wan set the whole thing in motion with a petrifying clap from the darkness.\n\nThere's a seemingly innocuous spin on hide-and-seek here, too. It's a game doll-maker Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia) and his wife, Esther (Miranda Otto), play with their young daughter, until a freak accident cruelly takes her from them. Twelve years later, the bereaved parents open their home -- a giant house on a hill, surrounded on all sides by golden acres of farmland -- to a nun (Miss Bala's Stephanie Sigman) and six orphan girls ranging in age from maybe 8 to 17. When Janice (Talitha Bateman), who's mostly lost the use of her legs to polio, comes across a familiar doll squirreled away behind a locked door, the usual paranormal parlor tricks begin in earnest.\n\nIt's hard to say why someone thought Annabelle required an additional origin story, given that the last film pretty sufficiently explained how she went from merely creepy (and inanimate) to actively malevolent. (Somehow not clarified here is why this Mullins fellow would ever make a doll that looked so damn hideous in the first one. Giving kids the willies can't be good for business.) But Creation, set in a quiet and picturesque stretch of 1950s America, is a much more elegant affair than the cheap, mean, sporadically nerve-wracking Annabelle. The approach this time is closer in spirit to Wan's, down to an early scene that lays out the layout of the house's ground floor through one single shot, following the girls through the property to acclimate us to the space.\n\nBehind the camera this time is David F. Sandberg, who made last summer's inventive (if problematic) horror sleeper Lights Out. Slow playing the impending danger during the atmospheric opening stretch, Sandberg sets up his scares far in advance, introducing elements and tools that will come in diabolically handy later: a rope-operated elevator that hangs over a pit of darkness; a stair lift that looks like it could crap out at any time, especially an inopportune one; the bell that Esther, now confined almost entirely to her bed, uses to summon assistance. He's got a good eye for a haunting image -- like one involving two teenage girls under a sheet with flashlights -- and a better sense of timing, knowing just how to work an audience's nerves by prolonging the pocket of deathly silence before a jolt, until it's impossible to guess exactly when that pasty hand will come shooting out of the shadows.\n\nLike the Conjuring films, Annabelle: Creation is a symphony of cheap tricks; its scares are strictly of the funhouse variety, not the keep-you-up-for-days kind, but they're executed with precision and panache. Sandberg stays on model, adhering to the franchise's mandatory Catholic framework, though that stuff feels more perfunctory than it does in Wan's earnestly religious films -- here, it mostly just justifies scenes like the one that nightmarishly twists back some fingers holding a crucifix. These movies are almost always more effective during the escalation portion of the evening; by the last act, they all turn into The Exorcist on steroids, bombarding the audience with lots of sound, fury, and special effects. Still, Sandberg makes the most of his adopted formula, using it as a good excuse to try out some new techniques, to the point where Annabelle herself becomes almost irrelevant.

Jump-scares are plentiful and are invariably preceded by long, suspenseful silence as an onscreen victim peers nervously into the unknown, breathing heavily as we anxiously await the inevitable explosion of sound and blood-curdling imagery.\n\nThis is, of course, one of the most common horror mechanics there is, but common is only bad if it's done badly. Annabelle: Creation isn't groundbreaking or cutting-edge in the slightest, but it uses old-school techniques and top-notch sound design incredibly well, delivering a no-frills, all-chills horror experience that feels far more worthy of its association with The Conjuring than its 2014 predecessor, Annabelle.\n\nThe new film takes place before the events of Annabelle, following the origins of the creepy doll from the title. In the '40s, a tragic car accident takes the life of Bee (Samara Lee), the young daughter of dollmaker Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia) and his wife, Esther (Miranda Otto). Twelve years later, the Mullins open the doors of their ornate family farmhouse to a nun, Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman), and a group of orphan girls. Samuel -- now a distant paranoiac -- welcomes the girls to make themselves at home but strictly forbids them from entering Bee's old room. Naturally, his edict tickles the curiosity of one of the girls, Janice (Talitha Bateman), who investigates the room and unleashes a demonic force, embodied by the doll, that targets her for a reason known only known by Samuel and his now bedridden, disfigured wife.\n\nAgain, the premise is nothing new, but all of the film's elements are executed well and work in concert to create a palpable sense of dread and helplessness. The design of the house itself is perhaps the film's greatest boon: it's creepy in the way your great-grandma's house is creepy, replete with dark corners, dusky hallways, and child-sized nooks and crannies for the girls to cower in, most notably a creaky dumbwaiter and a stairlift with Janice's name on it. The atmosphere is so thick you can almost smell the sour musk, and while the house may appear somewhat quaint in the daylight hours, at night it becomes a veritable devil's playhouse.\n\nOffsetting all of the film's wickedness is Bateman who, despite her character's naivete, is so sweet and likable you can't help but hope Janice makes it out of the wretched house in one piece. Playing her best friend, Linda, is Lulu Wilson, who exudes just as much innocence and has nice chemistry with Bateman, establishing the film's stakes far better than the narrative's religious overtones do. The rest of the cast members do their fair share in selling the terror of Annabelle's wrath, but it's Bateman and Wilson who make us genuinely hope for their well-being. Surprisingly, it's the older actors who are the least compelling, conveying fear in a glazed-over, hollow kind of way when their younger counterparts go for a more primal approach.\n\nIn director David F. Sandberg's 2016 offering, Lights Out, he demonstrated a firm grasp on the art of the jump-scare, and in Annabelle: Creation, he cements himself as one of the best doing it today. All of his scares are telegraphed; when Janice sits on the turtle-slow chairlift in an attempt to escape Annabelle, you just know something horrible is about to happen. But Sandberg always manages to jolt you when you least expect it, cleverly subverting expectations with feints and false-alarms that stretch out the suspense to unbearable lengths. Once we let our guard down, even if only for a moment, that's when he hits us with the proverbial \"BOO!\"\n\nNot enough can be said about the film's sound design, which is so detailed that it creates a 3-D effect that's enveloping and immersive without the need for any goofy 3-D glasses. It's an assault on the ears from all angles, and whenever Annabelle pops up out of nowhere, the accompanying \"boom\" is so concussive it'll just about knock you out of your seat. Sandberg's imagery is equally powerful, evoking a sense of claustrophobia in tight spaces and a sense of eerie mystery in the more open environments.\n\nAs cinematically rock-solid as Annabelle: Creation is, the movie isn't without its weaknesses, particularly in the logic department. It's expected that we should suspend our disbelief for a movie about a doll come to life, but an ongoing distraction throughout is a matter of sound and proximity. The girls scream and wail as Annabelle chases and terrorizes them around the house, often smashing pieces of furniture to pieces, and yet no one seems to hear any the commotion, even when they're in the next room. This happens on several occasions and becomes incredibly frustrating. It's true that some of the joy and humor of horror movies stems from the stupidity of the onscreen victims, but this movie takes it a little too far.", "time": "15:00:00"}

The original spinoff was another financial success for the James Wan-masterminded horror saga but savaged by critics for its threadbare plot and empty scares. Creation ups the ante with David F. Sandberg going further into the past of the most disturbing toy this side of Chucky to deliver a cracking Friday-night horror movie that scares while tackling the effects of broken families - as well as playing wonderfully into the rest of the series.\n\nThe film is heavy on new mythology for Annabelle, connections to The Conjuring films and setting up next spinoff The Nun. Let's explore what that ending and those Marvel-esque stingers mean.\n\nAnnabelle's Origins Explained (This Page) How The Ending Connects To The Original Annabelle The Mid-Credits Scene Explained - Annabelle Finally Moves The Post-Credits Scene Explained - The Nun Is Coming Annabelle's Origins Explained\n\nBefore Creation, all we knew about Annabelle was that she was an antique doll possessed by a devilish spirit known as the Ram. The specifics of either history was rather vague, but now, while we still have questions regarding the being itself, we know how the creepy toy was created and how it first became linked with possession.\n\nIn the opening of the prequel, we learn that \"Annabelle\" is one of an exclusive run of dolls by the Mullins Toy Company, a small outfit ran by Samuel Mullins in the 1940s that were all the rage in his urban community. It's implied in the film that the soon-to-be-evil doll was given number 1 of 100, but that Mullins didn't make any more of the set due to a personal tragedy, making her truly one-of-a-kind.\n\nThat personal tragedy was the death of his daughter. Nicknamed Bee - which we later learn that is actually short for Annabelle providing the true origin of the doll's name - she was hit by a car on the way back from church. The Mullins family spiraled into depression but then found solace in what they believed to be Bee's ghost. She haunted their house in a docile manner, convincing the grieving parents to allow her to reside in the doll.\n\nUpon doing that, however, they quickly learn it wasn't Bee at all, but a demon wanting to find a physical form. The doll served as a first step, but now it wants to take on a living being - Esther Mullins. It attacks the mother when alone, but she's saved by her husband and the doll is locked away in a bible-wallpapered and holy water-bathed cupboard.\n\nAll seemed well until they opened their house to an orphanage (one that already has links to some dark occult magic, although we'll get to that in a bit) - in the movie itself, set in 1957, the spirit manipulates the unsuspecting girls into freeing it, allowing the Ram to possess polio sufferer Janice. After a lot of scary set-pieces wherein the spirit attempts to claim more souls, Janice escapes and gets herself adopted by the Higgins family, changing her name in a rather sadistic turn to, what else Annabelle. At this point, the spirit is seemingly gone from the doll, which is taken away by police.\n\nThe movie ends 12 years later in 1969 when Annabelle, now grown, kills her adoptive parents, bringing us right to the start of the first movie and the doll's return. Which raises an awful lot of questions...\n\nPage 2: How The Ending Connects To The Original Annabelle\n\n\" 1 2 3 4\"\n\nKey Release Dates The Nun release date: Jul 13, 2018 ShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment ThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!

There's a wide margin between the horror sequel and Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, which will take the second spot with $11.4 million, pushing the war epic across $150 million stateside. And yet, like The Dark Tower, I would expect Annabelle: Creation to drop considerably next weekend, while Dunkirk will likely stay relatively close to the top.\n\nThe Dark Tower is holding in the fourth spot after a 59% drop at the box office, coming in with $7.8 million, pushing this empty Stephen King adaptation across the $30 million mark off of a $60 million budget. This is perhaps even worse news than it might appear. Unlike, say, The Mummy or the latest Transformers movie, The Dark Tower will not be saved by foreign distribution -- it has made around $9 million in total overseas. Like both of those movies, however, it's got a lot more than just the possibility of a single sequel riding on its box office performance. There's a whole damn TV series that's supposedly going to broaden the scope and world of this fiasco, and there's been little talk thus far about how this movie's poor showing weights on these plans. If the creators of this film go ahead with any of these plans, it would constitute one of the most wanton and unwise gambles in the movie or TV industry that I've seen in a long while.\n\nStill, it's not like The Dark Tower is the only movie in trouble in the top five. The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature, a mundane sequel to an intolerable movie, will place in third this weekend with $8.9 million. That would give the animated sequel the distinctly dubious honor of having the worst opening for a film opening in over 4,000 theaters ever. Not surprisingly, the last movie to hold that honor was The Emoji Movie, which was able to pull out a victory over Malcolm D. Lee's Girls Trip to land in the fifth spot with $6.5 million, whereas Lee's film made its graceful exit from the top five to arrive in sixth place.\n\nLike Annabelle: Creation, Girls Trip was budgeted at less than $20 million, made back its budget and marketing costs, and turned an enviable profit for its studio (Universal) relatively quickly, and it's still got the home video market to look forward to in the near future. In contrast, no amount of home video enthusiasm will be able to save The Dark Tower, a movie that offends fans of the source material and fans of the moviegoing experience equally. Mind you, The Dark Tower was made on a budget that would encapsulate the cost of making Girls Trip, Annabelle Creation, Get Out, and Split with some $12 million to spare before marketing. Just in terms of domestic gross, those four movies will make close to $500 million cumulatively by the end of 2017, while The Dark Tower will likely still be far from simply breaking even.", "time": "16:53:00"}

Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto play the Mullins, a married couple who are tormented by the demon. Neither is a fan of slasher films, which thankfully Annabelle is not (although the film \"gets dark and monster crazy,\" according to our FANDOM review).\n\nBoth Otto and Stephanie Sigman -- who plays Sister Charlotte -- physically retreat into their seats when watching horror. The young stars, however, love to be scared.\n\nTalitha Bateman, who plays Janice, boasted, \"I love horror movies. I've been watching them since I was little.\" (Note: the talented young actress is just 15).\n\nLulu Wilson, who at age eleven has already starred in three horror films (Deliver Us From Evil, Ouija: Origin of Evil, and as Linda in Annabelle: Creation), is a genre pro. \"I don't really get scared,\" the pre-teen stated.\n\nHowever, Wilson did find the Annabelle doll scary, especially the scene where she had to shoot under the stairs in the Mullins' home.\n\n\"It was just me and Annabelle. It was really creepy,\" Wilson admitted. \"The moment they called 'cut' I bolted out of there.\"\n\nFor LaPaglia, the most terrifying scene was when his character confronts the demon with a crucifix. But the scare came in an unexpected way.\n\n\"There was no evil entity to act [opposite] to. My fear was 'is this going to be too much. How big can you go with this?' As it turned out, I did it and then I fell on the floor, and I split my pants,\" the veteran actor explained with a laugh.\"So that was the most terrifying thing about the whole thing, as I had no seat in my pants anymore.\"", "time": "21:22:00"}

Namely, \"How did the creepy doll from The Conjuring come into being?\"\n\nAfter watching the film, it seems as if the producers and Warner Bros. stockholders were really asking, \"How can we keep making money off The Conjuring without having to waste our time thinking of a decent story or images that don't come from better horror movies like The Exorcist?\"\n\nIn her second movie on her own, Annabelle: Creation, \"Annabelle\" manages to imitate the pacing, the Catholic overtones and the tone of the first movie but replaces all the chills with unintentional laughter.\n\nIt might have helped if screenwriter Gary Dauberman (the mind who gave us the first installment) could create people who were as interesting as the demon-possessed doll. Worse, he and director David F. Sandberg (Lights Out) commit the cardinal sin of making viewers wait for Annabelle's creepy gaze back at the camera.\n\nThere's little need for an origin story when you've already seen the final product. We already know she's a conduit for Satan and his legions, so Dauberman has an uphill climb to figure out how to get them inside the ceramic figurine. Like his protagonist Janice (Talitha Bateman), he seems to be taking an elevator to get around when he should be exerting himself to come up with something besides jump scares that don't really frighten.\n\nAt least Janice has an excuse for having to get assistance up and down stairs. She needs a crutch and a leg brace after contracting polio a few years before. She and a small group of other girls have moved in with a morose couple named Sam and Esther Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto). From the movie's opening frames, we learn that Sam makes limited-edition dolls that sell well enough for him and his wife to live in a home spacious enough to house orphans.\n\nIt doesn't take any imagination to figure out why Sam broods and Esther doesn't bother to greet the girls at all. The two lost their 7-year-old daughter, Bee (Samara Lee), a dozen years before.\n\nBecause the secret's not really a secret, there's no surprise when a Bible starts flipping its pages or when the figures in a photograph mysteriously appear or disappear. It helps that the film is set in the 1940s or '50s, but we in the present are still aware of PhotoShop. As Sister Charlotte, the nun supposedly running the orphanage, Stephanie Sigman seems curiously oblivious to all the visual clutter. It's as if she needs better corrective lenses instead of deeper faith.\n\nThe Conjuring's director James Wan is credited as a producer on this one, and it often seems as Annabelle: Creation is synched to Wan's stopwatch. Sandberg slavishly follows all of Wan's story beats and revelations, but is unable to come up with the shocks to go with them. The deafening score by Benjamin Wallfisch continually reminds viewers this is supposed to be a horror movie, but the rest of the film hasn't bothered to produce any images that match the roar of the music.\n\nActually, the look of the film is part of the problem. Unlike Sister Charlotte and the orphans, we figure out the place is trouble because the house has peeling paint on the outer walls.

By that measure, director David F. Sandberg is an alchemist of the first order, taking the base -- even leaden -- components of horror and whipping them into a shivery chiffon of dread.\n\nThe Swedish filmmaker did it with his debut feature, \"Lights Out,\" which milked a deceptively simple, yet sublimely spooky premise -- the boogeyman only appears when the lights go out, and vanishes as soon they're back on -- for all it was worth. And he has done it again -- with even cheesier material -- taking the cliche-filled pantry of the Devil-doll prequel \"Annabelle: Creation\" and turning out a dish that, while pulled together from the familiar components of the ghost story, is uncommonly, nerve-wrackingly satisfying.\n\nThe recipe Sandberg uses is one we've seen before, mixing bits and pieces from a screenplay by Gary Dauberman (who also wrote the much less effective \"Annabelle,\" a 2014 spinoff from the universe of \"The Conjuring\"). The 1950s-set tale, which centers on orphans living in a remote, sprawling house, complete with balky electricity, a drafty dumbwaiter and an abundance of secret crawl spaces, also features: a locked room; a dead child; a well; a reclusive invalid who wears a \"Phantom of the Opera\"-style half-mask; and, for crying out loud, a nightmarish scarecrow.\n\nOh, yes: The house's proprietor is a retired dollmaker, whose magnum opus is the titular, demented-looking poppet -- one you wouldn't expect to see on any sane person's bookshelf, let alone in the toy aisle.\n\nTwelve years after losing their daughter, known as Bee (Samara Lee), in a car accident -- shown in a startlingly abrupt prologue -- Sam and Esther Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto) open their home to six orphaned girls and a nun (Stephanie Sigman). The youngest of the girls are sisters Linda (Lulu Wilson) and Janice (Talitha Bateman), the latter of whom walks with a leg brace and crutch as the result of polio. Sandberg makes good use of her limited mobility, as you might expect.\n\nIn short order, Janice begins to see spooky apparitions. And the aforementioned doll -- which she discovers in a locked room lined with pages from the Bible -- just won't stay put.\n\nNone of this is new, and in lesser hands it would easily become tedious. But Sandberg knows how to ratchet up suspense, composing shots filled with beautiful shadows, in whose corners there always seems to be lurking something scary: a ghostly little girl; a doll that looks like the spawn of Howdy Doody and Bette Davis in \"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\"; and something far more sinister.\n\n\"The Conjuring\" is a good movie. Its sequel, not so much. \"Annabelle,\" which took a small part of those films' world -- a prop, really -- and expanded on it, was an uninspired first crack at injecting some life into the trope of the demon doll. It didn't work.\n\nOn paper, \"Annabelle: Creation\" shouldn't work either. But to be fair, what horror movie doesn't sound stupid when you talk about it? Horror works -- or it doesn't -- in the flickering, moving images of the screen, not the page.\n\nSandberg knows that. His artistry, for that's what it is, is like that of the dollmaker Sam Mullins: to take inert material and create a living, breathing thing.\n\n\"Annabelle: Creation\" -- 3 stars\n\nMPAA rating: R (for violence and terror)\n\nRunning time: 1:39\n\nOpens: Friday\n\nRELATED:\n\nStephen King's 'The Dark Tower' review: A TV pilot that belongs in a 'Middling-World'\n\n'Brigsby Bear' review: Kyle Mooney plays a childlike adult in dark tale", "time": "12:32:00"}

Creation\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\n\nNow playing\n\nOn a recent library whim, I picked up an anthology of contemporary horror stories -- nominees for the annual Bram Stoker Award for short fiction, I think it was. It was a very nice surprise, actually. Fans of the genre will be happy to hear that innovative and sophisticated horror is alive and well in that old-fashioned analog medium we call books.\n\nAnnabelle: Creation, the latest installment in The Conjuring horror series, plays like a pleasant little short story, and by pleasant I mean eerie, disturbing, and occasionally gory. Technically a prequel to a spinoff, the movie tells the origin story of Annabelle, the demonically haunted doll that's been causing bloody mischief for several decades around America.\n\nThe Annabelle saga is all \"based on a true story\" so far as that goes, with everything drawn from the real-life X-files of paranormal investors Ed and Lorraine Warren, subjects of the original 2013 film, The Conjuring. This element of truthiness always seems to enhance these kinds of scary stories, so while you can certainly find plenty of evidence online debunking the whole thing, I don't recommend it. It's against the spirit of the thing, as it were.\n\nOn with the wickedness: Annabelle, we learn, was made by Sam Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia), a California craftsman who lost his little girl in a car accident. In their grief, Sam and his wife, Esther (Miranda Otto), open their household to demonic forces by praying for the return of their daughter -- by any means necessary.\n\nFast-forward twelve years. Sam and Esther take in a group of six orphaned girls from the local Catholic church, shepherded by Christendom's most beautiful nun, Sister Charlotte (Mexican-American actress Stephanie Sigman). Among the sweet little moppets in the giant farmhouse is young Janice (Talitha Bateman), hobbled by polio and cursed with an unfortunate predilection for exploring forbidden rooms.\n\nIt's a cool little setup for a scary story, and director David Sandberg (Lights Out) adheres to old-fashioned horror film strategies for heightening the tension and drama. Word is that Sandberg modeled the film after two horror classics: Stanley Kubrick's ultimate haunted house story, The Shining, and the 1963 psychological horror film The Haunting.\n\nFor the most part, Sandberg eschews the cheap jump scares that plague this genre, and instead opts for clever camera work and strategic image compositions. The spooky stuff is often in the corner of the frame, and Sandberg never lingers too long on the gore or demonic apparitions. Less is always more with this style of horror.\n\nThe polio thing is an inspired touch. When the demonic forces start to menace poor little Janice (\"They always prey on the weak,\" Sister Charlotte says), she can't run the other way. She has to limp away, slowly. You know that nightmare when the monster is chasing you, but you're stuck in slow motion? Yeah, welcome to Janice's world.\n\nThe movie unravels a bit at the end, as the demands of the script start jerking the characters around -- quite literally, in some instances. The slow burn of the first half gives way to frantic exposition and action as the filmmakers try desperately to distract the audience from the rapidly proliferating plot holes. Is the demon haunting the doll? Is the doll the little dead girl? Is the little dead girl the demon? I was also mightily confused by the references to an ancient cabal of severe Romanian nuns, until I read that the next film in the series is called -- yes, that's right -- The Nun.\n\nAnnabelle: Creation is a perfectly adequate scary movie, the kind that's fun to see in a theater packed with helpful audiences yelling advice at the screen. But dedicated connoisseurs of the horror genre may find themselves bored. Frankly, scary nuns and creepy dolls are pretty vanilla. If you're in the market for some really twisted horror, go find one of those contemporary short stories anthologies at your neighborhood bookstore or library.", "time": "21:13:00"}

Few are aghast to learn the back story of the homicidal circus clown, or appalled to discover the benign suburban origins of the notorious criminal mastermind. When a horror movie gets around to supplying the requisite information about its villain's provenance or pedigree -- when sometime toward the end of the second act our hero heads to the local library to consult newspaper back issues on microfiche or rings up the neighbourhood historian for an edifying monologue on small-town lore -- it's simply to satisfy the obligations of the narrative form, not to quench some thirst for macabre biography.\n\nThere's a reason our nightmares tend to remain cryptic and indeterminate. Backstory isn't scary.\n\nThe children's doll, meanwhile, has a rather strong claim to our dread: see Freud on the uncanny. This may account for the appeal of Annabelle, the grinning, dead-eyed plaything that has proven the most improbably popular inanimate object in horror since Child Play's diabolical Chucky. A minor player in James Wan's The Conjuring, where she was introduced only briefly but made an indelible impression, Annabelle was accorded top billing in a horror feature of her own in 2014, when it became apparent perhaps that Wan's particular brand of low-budget ghost story could be enormously profitable in perpetuity. Now the spin-off has yielded a sequel, or rather prequel, and in any case this malevolent ligneous moppet of merely negligible interest is back once again.\n\nDid the world truly need to learn more about whence an evil doll came?\n\nAnnabelle's previous screen adventure was an origin story that told of how the nefarious doll came to be. Or, anyway, one supposed as much: the film began with a ritual Manson-like murder in the late 1960s and it seemed reasonable to presume that the atrocity somehow bred the evil. But Annabelle: Creation, as its title inauspiciously suggests, whisks us back a quarter of a decade earlier, revealing through a wearisome combination of expository episodes, mid-film flashbacks, and ill-timed soliloquies precisely how, why and by whom the much-feared toy was fashioned, as well as the complicated circumstances by which it came to want to murder people -- though even then only sort of. Hauntings, possessions and curses of various kind abound. It's explained at a brisk and near-constant clip and yet I'm still not quite clear on what it means or has to do with anything.\n\nThe action concerns a beguiled coterie of adolescent orphans who descend upon the home of a certain Samuel and Esther Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto), where, for reasons hardly worth recounting, a vague demonic presence lurks within the body of a Raggedy Ann. This is of course our Annabelle, and the young orphans are of course terrorized by her -- though as Annabelle seems capable of opening and closing doors, controlling the environment at will, and manifesting in a wide variety of more mobile and powerful forms, why she elects to remain inside a not especially useful doll and while away her time spooking people instead of killing them continues to be a mystery. At one point, she transforms into a full-grown ambulatory nun and at another becomes a sentient scarecrow. She can hurl adults through the air without touching them and unscrew lightbulbs with her mind. Why bother as Annabelle at all?\n\nOf course a horror movie is under no obligation to rationalize its fancies. Given a choice between having an evil scarecrow in your film and not having one, you had damn well better throw one in, whether or not the internal logic of the universe accommodates its appearance. I maintain it is no coincidence that Annabelle: Creation is at its most luridly entertaining when it feels freest to indulge its sinister whims: when dragging half a reanimated corpse up a dumbwaiter shaft, for instance, or when tormenting a defenceless little girl (crippled by polio, naturally) stuck on an electric stairlift. The director, David F. Sandberg, has a great deal of fun establishing several Rube-Goldberg devices around his haunted house in the first act and putting them to outrageous use by the end of the third.\n\nThese pleasures, as you might expect, do not have very much at all to do with Annabelle -- even less with her Creation. And indeed Sandberg often seems an artist bored by his own material, resigned to doodling in the margins. The underlying tension between duty and invention poses two questions. The first is why a perfectly self-contained and relatively intriguing horror movie about a haunted all-girls orphanage has been needlessly burdened with a name brand and all the franchise baggage that attends it. (Does the prequel to a spin-off really promise to be more lucrative than an original film?) The second is whether anybody is interested in the origin story Annabelle: Creation professes to reveal. Did the world truly need to learn more about whence an evil doll came? Did any audience demand this history? We should have kept things cryptic and indeterminate. Backstory isn't scary.", "time": "18:14:00"}

"Verdict: A step up, but prequel confirms this porcelain doll's limited range\n\nCHUCKY, the ventriloquist's dummy Fats, Poltergeist's maniacal clown ... creepy dolls are a horror staple.\n\nHollow-eyed Annabelle, who first froze audiences with her malevolent gaze in James Wan's surprise 2013 hit The Conjuring, is the latest addition to the demonic fold.\n\nWhile the porcelain-and-pigtailed creation served her purpose well enough in the original film, as a ghost hunter's trophy, the jury is currently still out as to whether she has what it takes to carry an entire film.\n\nThe antique star made a somewhat shaky debut as a leading lady in the eponymously-titled 2014 film Annabelle, an opportunistic spin-off that played well at the box office despite overwhelmingly negative reviews.\n\nLights Out director David F. Sandberg elicits a stronger performance in Annabelle: Creation, which as the title suggests is an origin story (or prequel to the original prequel if one is talking chronologically).\n\nRELATED: Anthony LaPaglia's ghostly tale\n\nHe is nevertheless constrained by her limited range.\n\nThe film opens at an isolated farmhouse where a taciturn toymaker (Anthony LaPaglia) is putting the finishing touches on a handcrafted, limited edition doll.\n\nA handwritten note is slipped under the door by his beloved young daughter inviting him to play hide and seek.\n\nNot long afterwards, she is killed in freak car accident.\n\nThe story then flashes forward 12 years. A busload of orphaned girls winds its way across dusty plains to the now-dilapidated house which, after an extended grieving period, the toymaker and his wife (Miranda Otto) hope to once again fill with children's laughter.\n\nBut even as the girls unpack, strange goings-on begin to occur.\n\nCrippled by polio, Janice (Talitha Bateman) is most sensitive to the supernatural presence.\n\nOn her first night at the new house, she is somehow drawn to the dead daughter's bedroom, unlocking the closet to which the Annabelle doll has long been banished.\n\nFrom that point, all hell literally breaks loose.\n\nAnnabelle: Creation is a workmanlike horror film that skilfully builds narrative tension and offers horror fans some genuine, well-developed scares.\n\nBut Sandberg is unable to transcend a stale and rather pedestrian storyline that lacks any kind of spiritual or psychological subtext.\n\nAnnabelle: Creation ultimately confirms Wan's reputation as one of the modern masters of suspense.\n\nThe co-creator of the Saw franchise has an uncanny knack for reworking classic horror tropes in a manner that makes them seem fresh and vital.", "time": "02:01:00"}

Creation (Warner Bros. Pictures) scared up an impressive $35 million in first place from 3,502 theaters, an average of $10,006 per location. Receiving a B CinemaScore from audiences, the film opened just slightly below the $37.1 million debut of the first Annabelle in 2014. Overseas, Annabelle: Creation also took in $35 million from 6,935 screens in 39 markets. The international total is now $36.7 million and worldwide total is $71.7 million. Directed by David F. Sandberg, Annabelle: Creation stars Stephanie Sigman, Talitha Bateman, Lulu Wilson, Philippa Coulthard, Grace Fulton, Lou Lou Safran, Samara Lee, Tayler Buck, with Anthony LaPaglia, and Miranda Otto. The film cost just $15 million to make.\n\nRemaining in second place, Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk (Warner Bros. Pictures) added $11.4 million its fourth weekend and has earned a total of $153.7 million in North America. Overseas, the film earned $14.5 million from 6,785 screens in 62 markets, and has now reached $210 million. The global total is at $363.6 million for the film, which cost $100 million to make. Dunkirk has yet to open in markets like Italy (Aug. 31), China (Sept. 1), and Japan (Sept. 9). Dunkirk stars Fionn Whitehead, Tom Glynn-Carney, Jack Lowden, Harry Styles, Aneurin Barnard, James D'Arcy, Barry Keoghan, Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy, Mark Rylance, and Tom Hardy.\n\nDespite taking third place, Open Road Films sequel The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature grossed just $8.9 million from 4,003 theaters, an average of $2,232 per theater. That's the worst opening ever for a film in more than 4,000 theaters. It's also well behind the first film's $19.4 million opening ($25.7 million if you count the four-day holiday) in January of 2014. Directed by Cal Brunker, the sequel received a B+ CinemaScore and is voiced by Will Arnett, Maya Rudolph, Jackie Chan, Katherine Heigl, and more.\n\nAfter topping the box office last weekend, Columbia Pictures and MRC's The Dark Tower dropped to fourth place with $7.9 million, for a two-week total of $34.3 million. Made for $60 million, the Nikolaj Arcel-directed Stephen King adaptation stars Idris Elba, Matthew McConaughey, Tom Taylor, Claudia Kim, Fran Kranz, Abbey Lee, and Jackie Earle Haley.\n\nRounding out the top five was Sony Pictures Animation's The Emoji Movie, which earned $6.6 million and has earned $63.6 million after three weeks. Directed by Tony Leondis, The Emoji Movie features the voices of T.J. Miller, James Corden, Anna Faris, Maya Rudolph, Steven Wright, Jennifer Coolidge, Jake T. Austin, Christina Aguilera, Sofia Vergara and Sir Patrick Stewart. It cost $50 million to make.\n\nLionsgate also opened The Glass Castle in 1,461 theaters, where the adaptation grossed $4.9 million in ninth place. The film stars Brie Larson, Woody Harrelson, and Naomi Watts. And A24's Good Time, starring Robert Pattinson, brought in $137,625 from four theaters, an average of $34,406.", "time": "16:42:00"}

2014's 'Conjuring'-spinoff 'Annabelle'CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCreepy dolls, spooky kids and haunted houses have taken over the horror genre. What was once a playground for masked psychos cutting up oversexed teenagers in new and inventive ways has become a collection of long, darkened hallways with something going bump at the far end of them. Horror has become domesticated. It's enough to make you wonder: where have all the slashers gone?\n\n\"Annabelle: Creation\" falls in line with the modern horror wave. It's the fourth film in \"The Conjuring\" series -- and the second spinoff to focus on Annabelle, a freaky-looking doll that looks like the Victorian-era cousin of \"Child's Play's\" Chucky -- and it has all the elements of a contemporary horror hit, including the creepy doll, the spooky (or spooked out) kids and the house that's too big not to be scary at night.\n\nIf only it were, you know, scarier. \"Annabelle: Creation\" has shrieks and jump scares, but never feels genuinely frightening. Of course a nightmare funhouse doll is going to be disturbing when sitting in the shadows and staring dead at the camera, that's a given. But screenwriter Gary Dauberman and director David F. Sandberg (\"Lights Out\") don't do enough to expand on the history of Annabelle or dive any deeper than the doll's surface-level, inherent creepiness. What you see is what you get.\n\nThe film opens with 1940s dollmaker Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia) putting the finishing touches on his frightmare toy. When his daughter is unexpectedly killed by an oncoming car, Mullins and his wife, Esther (Miranda Otto), go into isolation, but 12 years later they decide to open their home to a handful of orphans and a live-in nun. There's only one rule: Don't go in the daughter's old room. Seems fair enough.\n\nExcept they go in the room, because of course they do. And that's when all the bad stuff starts happening, mostly involving the doll and the dead daughter's spirit. The parents realized there was something up with that insane looking doll, so they banished it forever, never to be seen again, right there in the closet of their daughter's room.\n\nNot by driving to the ocean and tossing it in, burying it out back or even tossing it in the well on their property. Nope. The closet should be fine. They even propped her up in her own rocking chair. How hospitable of them. Imagine their surprise when things begin to go awry.\n\nThe clumsy script has difficulty establishing the rules of what the doll and the daughter can do, so you're never really sure of what the characters are up against. At one point she's powerful enough to possess a character, lift her high into the air and slam her to the ground; at another time she's making verbal demands for a character's soul. What's going on here?\n\nSandberg, for his part, keeps viewers on their toes; he wants them to explore the dark spaces he frames on screen, and he toys with scares, teasing out anti-scares as he keeps the audience off balance. He's like a DJ stretching out the big drop: you know it's coming, you just don't know when. But the surprises are ultimately few, save for just enough gore to push the film to a barely earned R-rating.\n\nThe puppet master here is producer James Wan, the creative force behind the \"Conjuring\" and \"Insidious\" franchises, as well as one of the originators of the \"Saw\" film series. \"Saw\" helped introduce the torture porn subgenre of horror, but Wan has scaled back and made a mint dealing with demonic possession of houses, children and dolls.\n\nIt's where we're at today, as well as for the foreseeable future: there's a new \"Insidious\" movie due out next year, and there are a pair of \"Conjuring\" spinoffs on deck. The slashers, it seems, will have to continue to wait for their turn.\n\nagraham@detroitnews.com\n\n(313) 222-2284\n\n@grahamorama\n\n'Annabelle: Creation'\n\nGRADE: C\n\nRated R for horror violence and terror\n\nRunning time: 109 minutes\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2uvk9BW", "time": "23:24:00"}

Sandberg directed prequel/sequel/spinoff Annabelle: Creation, and the Furious 7 and Aquaman director is just as surprised as audiences that he's built an extended universe.\n\nThe Conjuring memorably brought the spooks and scares to audiences with its old fashioned haunted house sense of style. Most importantly, the creepy Annabelle doll that the Warrens fend against in the film's opening was deemed popular enough to spawn two spinoff films, and thus started an unexpected trend of horror films all within the universe of the original film. Also coming soon are spinoffs based upon the Nun and Crooked Man characters from last year's The Conjuring 2, stretching and bolstering what is already a very profitable franchise even further.\n\nRelated: Annabelle: Creation Has Biggest Thursday Debut For Conjuring Franchise\n\nWith Annabelle: Creation now in theaters, The Hollywood Reporter spoke to Wan and director David F. Sandberg about the process of adhering to the timeline rules and challenges that come with making these seemingly typical period piece horror films have connective tissue. Wan, who directed the two main Conjuring movies and is an executive producer on the spinoffs, compared his role in developing the universe to that of a TV show runner, discussing the intricacy that is needed to develop the overlapping mythology and stories that are being established:\n\n\"If you start approaching it that way, you kinda see where the films can sort of fan out, where the storylines can fan out and become other stuff.\"\n\nJust as important as the story lines in an extended universe is a similar sense of tone within the films, as these films at the very least need to establish a similar visual look to show that they take place under the same horror umbrella. In regards to those similarities, which are very apparent in Annabelle: Creation, Wan speaks to his adoration of old-fashioned horror films from a forgotten era and how they inform the looks of the spinoffs:\n\n\"That is the aesthetic that I feel like I've set up...and I really want to keep that classical sort of old-school storytelling going on with all these films. Those are the kind of horror movies that I really love, and so I want to make sure that all these films within the Conjuring world feel like they came from the same place. I don't want them feeling too disjointed from a visual standpoint.\"\n\nSandberg, the Lights Out director whose film is a huge improvement critically over the previous Annabelle film, has landed himself a job helming a DCEU blockbuster in Shazam! He clarified that while Wan wanted to make sure that the films had some sort of connective tissue, he was also given the reins to make the film he truly wanted:\n\n\"The only sort of mandate...was to put in these little references to the other movies. But otherwise, it was very free.\"\n\nDespite being part of this new Conjuring universe, Annabelle: Creation stands very strong on its own as a standalone horror thrill ride. The film is poised for a big opening weekend, which bodes well for the other spinoffs that are in the pipeline from Wan and company.\n\nMORE: Annabelle: Creation Ending & Post-Credits Scenes Explained\n\nSource: THR\n\nKey Release Dates The Nun release date: Jul 13, 2018 ShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment ThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!

For those obsessed with Stephen King's series of novels about the Gunslinger and the Man in Black, the movie must have played as if it were written and conceived by someone who read the source material while on a melatonin drip. For those who were just looking for a decent action-fantasy flick, the melatonin would likely have been a more entertaining and somewhat cheaper alternative. To see it plummet in such a manner offers a rare and pure dose of schadenfreude.\n\nIndeed, The Dark Tower is currently in fourth place with $$, while the top spot is currently occupied by Annabelle: Creation, the superior sequel to James Wan's middling Annabelle, which came in with $$. The presumed success of David F. Sandberg's sequel -- it's looking at a $38 million weekend -- continues a rather inarguable trend of horror movies with modest budgets embarrassing big-budget productions in terms of money spent vs. money earned at the domestic box office. This was the case with Jordan Peele's revelatory Get Out and M. Night Shyamalan's surprisingly strong Split as well. That all three of these movies are more innovative, memorable, and entertaining than 95% of the big summer movies that have come out thus far is also worth keeping in mind.\n\nThen again, for all I know, Annabelle: Creation will take a hit next weekend with The Hitman's Bodyguard and Steven Soderbergh's sublime Logan Lucky hitting the multiplexes. We will have to see next Friday, but it's likely that Dunkirk will survive whatever comes next weekend. Christopher Nolan's war film is currently holding strong in second place with $$ after weeks of racking up major numbers, suggesting that Nolan could choose a sympathetic portrait of the Khmer Rouge as his next movie and it would still do well.\n\nThankfully, the introduction of The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature has sent The Emoji Movie to the lower half of the top ten, coming in at number three with $$. That would just leave Malcolm D. Lee's Girls Trip, another hit that's grown wildly from a modest budget and smart casting, in the fifth spot with $$.

Get Out and It Follows being some of the recent exceptions to the generally lackluster slashers and found-footage fests that have become the norm. Even more rare is a horror sequel that's still effective, and Annabelle: Creation, being the fourth installment in The Conjuring franchise genuinely is one of those exceptions.\n\nSet as a prequel to the earlier films, the plot isn't exactly deep: it's about a loving family made of of custom doll maker and father Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia), the mother is Esther (Miranda Otto), and young daughter Annabelle \"Bee\" (Samara Lee). They're having a quiet life in the country with Sam being successful selling his dolls, when on the way home from church they get a flat tire and while changing it, Annabelle runs out in front of another car and is killed.\n\nWe jump to twelve years in the future, and Sam and Esther have never really recovered from the loss. Esther is bedridden and hasn't walked about under her own power in years. In an attempt to bring some life into the old farmhouse, Sam invites a group of orphan girls and a nun into the house for it to be used as a group home. Soon a force in the house reaches out to the one of the girls, causing her to investigate and uncover the doll that Sam was working on at the beginning of the film, and Annabelle's spirit has apparently connected itself to the doll and doesn't seem to be interested in houseguests.\n\nIt's not an original plot, the idea of possessed dolls being inhabited by a deceased child has been done any number of times before. What makes Annabelle: Creation atypically effective is director David F. Sandberg, who had previously done very well at the box office and with reviews in last year's Lights Out. He continues to show a deft hand of wasting no time with subtlety -- things are moving in the corners of your eye from the very moment that the girls arrive in their new home. There's not a vast amount of gore or blood, which is not a bad thing -- he saves it for when it'll count most; until then, he keeps the audience on the edge of their seats trying to sort out where things are going to hop out from next. Sandberg sets a simple image of an unused scarecrow leaning against a wall be something the just oozes dread effectively, even when it doesn't do anything but sit there, but you know you aren't going to trust what happens the moment you turn away from it.\n\nOur screening was held at one of the new Dolby Theaters, this particular one at the AMC Metreon in San Francisco, and it has to be said that the screen quality and its ability to project an image with deeper blacks than we've seen on a theater screen before makes for peering into a dark closet feel like one is falling into nothingness. When two pinprick eye-points appear in that blackness, it's far more effective than it really has any right to be. The increased resolution of the image on the Dolby screen actually increases the ISO noise to the level that it actually has the impression of an older film stock (like a film one might have seen in the late '70s or early '80s). This isn't a bad thing, though; it goes right along with the rustic, country setting. For Creation, the Dolby sound system wasn't really featured, though I know I'm now itching to see a sci-fi film on that screen, and soon.\n\nIf horror is your genre, Annabelle: Creation is a solid summer watch. Catch it while the theater still has a good-sized crowd, that way when you gasp -- or perhaps even scream -- you can blame the person behind you.\n\nWarning: The trailer below, while good, also gives away a great deal of the happenings. We would suggest if you're going to go -- hold off on the trailer. Only watch it if you're on the fence and need another nudge.", "time": "20:21:00"}

The new movie, which is also part of the greater Conjuring franchise, ends with a repeat of events in the 2014 original.\n\nI'm going to let that and anything involving the cast or crew of Creation be givens, especially director David F. Sandberg's feature debut, Lights Out, and the much better horror prequel Ouija: Origin of Evil, which also featured child actress Lulu Wilson. I also wanted to limit my recommendations this week to only four horror titles. See eight I did pick below.\n\nPinocchio (1940)\n\nMaybe it's just because I've been watching this Disney classic lately with my kids, but the opening scene of Creation reminded me of Geppetto at the beginning of Pinocchio carving out his prized puppet. Neither creator knows it at the time, but soon enough they will have to deal with their creation being brought to life, taking the place of a child.\n\nThis animated feature is also quite the horror film in various parts. The sequence where Pinocchio's pal Lampwick turns into a donkey is terrifying no matter how old you are. And Stromboli and Monstro the whale are also frightening adversaries. Carlo Collodi's story has inspired true horror movies, but that's always been unnecessary since it's scary enough as is.\n\nThe Bad Seed (1956)\n\nMost of the plot of Creation takes place in 1957, which is 12 years prior to the events of the original Annabelle. That movie owes a lot to Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby, which was released the year before its setting, so it's fitting that the prequel reminds me of this horror movie released the year before its setting.\n\nThe Bad Seed is more horrifying than any movie about ghost children or possessed little girls because there's nothing paranormal at play here. Little Rhoda (Patty McCormack, who was Oscar-nominated for her performance) is just an 8-year-old psychopath who keeps murdering people around her. The ending is disappointing but understandably so for the times.\n\nLampa (1959)\n\nPolanski clearly influenced the original Annabelle, and I wonder if this early short, made while the director was in film school, informed at least the opening of Creation. Again we've got a creator, this time another doll maker, working in his shop. After the man in Lampa leaves, his work also seems to come alive, at least in the form of audible whispers.\n\nThe short is less than eight minutes in length, but it packs in a more chilling experience than Creation does with two hours. Lampa is all about the eerie atmosphere of the doll shop, as Polanski compiles close-up shots of the toys and a cuckoo clock and a light bulb (one of the visuals that Creation brought to mind) and a dangerous electricity box that also seems alive.\n\nThe Haunting (1963)\n\nThe Annabelle movies are almost more haunted house movies than evil doll movies, and the one best true example of the former genre is this classic adaptation of \"The Haunting of Hill House\" produced and directed by Robert Wise. It features no creepy doll or creepy child but does have a large home inhabited by evil.\n\nSandberg has cited two influences on Creation and both are of the haunted location variety. One is The Shining, for its music, and the other is this. \"In terms of references,\" he told Moviefone, \"it was visual -- a big reference was The Haunting, I love the CinemaScope cinematography in that movie.\"\n\n1 2", "time": "16:56:00"}

Pictures\n\n\"Annabelle: Creation\" is a finely-tuned scare machine.\n\nIt's also one of the best communal movie-going experiences of the year, if you're the type who enjoys people screaming and jumping in their seats and dropping popcorn all over the floor -- or you.\n\nThis spinoff film is more than a continuation in \"The Conjuring\" franchise of husband-and-wife paranormal investigator horror films.\n\nThis demon-doll fright is its own entity, and it's the best movie in this series.\n\nDirector David F. Sandberg expands on his \"Lights Out\" film of 2016, employing even more impressive visual and audio magic, with a movie that is so proud of the \"BOO\" scare that it masters its use to an amazing degree.\n\nHow amazing? This is a film that foreshadows nearly every scare that will come later in the movie, and yet it still delivers on those moments because of the skillful execution and a love for the group-scare.\n\nThis communal experience is why many go to the movies, in the dark, with a crowd, to shriek a little bit or laugh at those who d -- or both.\n\nThis second \"Annabelle\" movie, which is actually a prequel to the events that take place in the 2014 film, has a better story, protagonists, cinematography, music and almost everything else.\n\nFrom the beginning moments of this supernatural slay-fest, we learn that this is going to be more than an origin story for an evil doll named Annabelle.\n\nIt has to be about the people involved for us to really care about more than a supposedly inanimate doll with abnormally large eyes.\n\nIn this case, some outstanding young actors play a group of orphaned girls who we can't help but want to protect from harm.\n\nIt's the late 1950s, and a lonely rural couple whose daughter was killed in a horrible accident 12 years earlier open their home to a nun and these girls whose orphanage has closed.\n\nAnthony LaPaglia (\"Without a Trace\") and Miranda Otto (\"The Lord of the Rings\" movies) play the morose couple, with him a beyond-sad dollmaker who must care for his sick wife who hides in a bedroom.\n\nBut the real stars are the youths, whose characters know there's something odd about this place and this couple.\n\nEspecially good is Talitha Bateman, a relative newcomer to films with a big future.\n\nShe plays Janice, a sweet girl with strawberry-blond hair, gentle eyes and legs that often fail her because of lingering effects of polio. She's not helpless because she's a tough little fighter, which makes her our rooting interest.\n\nWe want her to be OK, as well as her best friend Linda, with whom she has a sisterly bond (Lulu Wilson, who last year starred in the \"Ouija\" sequel that was also better than its first film).\n\nBut this house in the middle of nowhere has doors that squeak, floors that creak and the devil's presence.\n\nFrom the first minute, showing off the dollmaker's parts in his workshop -- dismembered and hanging from strings -- the photography of Maxime Alexandre is outstanding and chilling.\n\nHe works with Sandberg to frame what's to come: When we see a chair-lift that will help Janice travel to a second-floor bedroom, we know that chair is going to be part of a major fright, but we're not sure how.\n\nOh, it's a good one. My daughter jumped, shrieked and put her hands over her face, barely making room to see what would happen.\n\nThe beauty of \"Annabelle: Creation\" is that the filmmakers set up these obvious moments with a confidence that we will all react in much the same way to the terror.\n\nIt's all in the execution.\n\nThey do this so well that it's a shame when the conclusion must include a tie-in scene to connect this movie to the first film, which feels flimsy by comparison.\n\nBut \"Annabelle: Creation\" earns its scares in a film that is rated R without any profanity or sexuality.\n\nMy 12-year-old loved it, but the intensity of the scares left her asking if she could keep a light on that night at bedtime.\n\nCast: Talitha Bateman, Lulu Wilson, Anthony LaPaglia, Stephanie Sigman, Miranda Otto\n\nFilmmaker: director David F.

Directed by David F. Sandberg. Opens Friday in GTA theatres. 109 minutes. 14A\n\nThe evil Annabelle doll series is going backwards -- in a couple of ways.\n\nThis sequel to 2014's Annabelle is actually a prequel, taking us back to where it all began, the farmhouse where the doll was first created by a well-intentioned Geppetto of sorts named Samuel Mullins. While not a particularly attractive plaything, its other (unearthly) qualities are rather worse.\n\nTwelve years after the Mullins lose their daughter, Bea, in a roadside accident caused by a wayward lug nut, they open their home to the charges of the defunct St. Eustace Home for Girls -- and so, the doll has some fresh young faces with whom to play. (You've probably guessed already that Annabelle doesn't play nice with others.)\n\nBut while the original Annabelle was a rather decent, well-crafted chiller, this one seems a bit more ham-fisted and less satisfying. A cynic won't wonder if it's a hasty effort to cash in after the first film made an astonishing $250 million.\n\nBut director David F. Sandberg doesn't seem to have the same finesse as John R. Leonetti, who helmed the first one. Sandberg struggles despite a promisingly creepy setting, which includes a spooky house filled with dark spaces, a creaky dumb waiter, an old well and a menacing scarecrow.\n\nSome of the special effects are overdone, however, rendering silly that which ought to be scary -- and Mullins' bedridden wife wears a mask right out of The Phantom of the Opera.\n\nThe few saving graces can be found among the younger cast, including Talitha Bateman, who gets to work her acting chops as Janice, a waif with a leg brace, and Lulu Wilson as her friend, Linda.\n\nBut Anthony LaPaglia, a solid journeyman actor, is far too subdued -- sheepish, even -- in the crucial role of Mullins. Stephanie Sigman is just plain ineffectual as the kids' erstwhile protector, Sister Charlotte.\n\nThe inclusion of young Black actress Tayler Buck among the six orphan girls feels like tokenism. You couldn't give her something to do other than looking frightened?\n\nThe film dovetails well with its predecessor but the script by Gary Dauberman, who penned both films, is thinner and weaker and there isn't the same deftness and polish that raised the goose bumps so effectively the first time around.\n\nAs origin stories go, Annabelle: Creation sure could have used some dolling up.", "time": "12:51:00"}

As horror spin-offs go, Creation is a worthy addition to The Conjuring franchise as we discover the dark and demonic origins of the titular doll.\n\nDavid F. Sandberg was handed the reins to this Annabelle prequel, set during the mid-50s in the household of a bereaved doll-maker who welcomes some orphan girls and their nun guardian into their home, but the director has admitted that there is one moment in the film that he seriously regrets.\n\nThe Lights Out director revealed his mistake during a discussion of the new movie on Reddit, when one viewer called out a scene in which the \"ghost\" of the Mullins' daughter suddenly goes full Evil Dead-cheesy towards the orphan, Janis, who is lured into the demon's presence. The little spirit girl's face turns demonic as it cries \"I want your soul!\" The director is still cringing over it:\n\n\"Yeah, I never quite got that one right and I think of 'I'll swallow your soul' every time I see it. If I could redo it I'd make the makeup creepier and have her not say anything. Or at least whisper the line instead of full on demon voice. We tried so many variations of that voice during post. 'Maybe if we make the voice really overwhelming, that might take away from the cheese?' Nope.\"\n\nSandberg also explained that scene didn't use any CGI, \"that's just makeup and regular Bee's face composited into the window reflection,\" and talked about other moments in the movie too, including one with the young orphan girls in the car at the end. Apparently, a \"cheap jump scare\" was cut out in the final film:\n\n\"We did originally have the scarecrow land on the car after it disappeared. It's in some ads for the film and in the end you can actually still briefly see it on top of the car. It just felt like maybe one too many cheap jump scares. Even I have a limit.\"\n\nAnnabelle: Creation is certainly not short of scares and it's a testament to Sandberg's talents in the horror genre that he was able to, arguably, make the best film in The Conjuring franchise so far. It would certainly be a shame if this film was his first and last offering with more spin-off films expected, including The Crooked Man.\n\nHowever, he is working on a sequel to Lights Out, and is next going to be directing the DCEU's Shazam!, so he might be a just a little bit too busy to commit to another installment. He has shown interest in doing a reboot or remake of both A Nightmare on Elm Street and Critters, though, so hopefully he won't be leaving the horror genre anytime soon.\n\nNext: Annabelle: Creation Ending & Post-Credits Scenes Explained Key Release Dates Annabelle: Creation release date: Aug 11, 2017 ShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment ThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!

That's a strong start for the horror flick, which was made for about $15 million.\n\nThe track record for the franchise is strong -- \"Annabelle\" ($37.1 million); \"The Conjuring\" ($41.9 million); and \"The Conjuring 2\" ($40.4 million). David F. Sandberg directed the sequel about a dollmaker whose creation terrorizes a group of orphan girls. For those invested in the \"Conjuring\" canon, it serves as a prequel to the first \"Annabelle.\" Stephanie Sigman, Talitha Bateman, Anthony LaPaglia, and Miranda Otto star in the pic that critics have generally given a thumbs up to (it currently has an 68% on Rotten Tomatoes).\n\nThe same studio's \"Dunkirk\" continues to show strong during its fourth weekend, as it holds onto second place. One of the lone bright spots in a generally dismal summer for the box office, Christopher Nolan's World War II epic should make an additional $11.4 million this weekend, pushing its domestic total past the $150 million mark.\n\nMeanwhile, Lionsgate's new release \"The Glass Castle\" is pulling in $4.9 million from 1,461 locations. Those are meager earnings, but also a low theater count. The adaptation of Jeannette Walls' hugely-popular 2005 memoir mostly appealed to women, who made up 80% of the audience. Audiences have been generally receptive, earning the movie an A- CinemaScore, while critics are more mixed (50% of RottenTomatoes). Brie Larson reunited with \"Short Term 12\" director Destin Daniel Cretton for the project, which also stars Naomi Watts and Woody Harrelson.", "time": "14:46:00"}

30 years in the acting game, Anthony LaPaglia realized he was missing something on his resum\u00e9. \"I had never done a horror film and actually never thought about doing one,\" says the L.A.-based Australian at a downtown L.A. hotel suite.\n\nHis CV changed when the 58-year-old was offered a co-starring part in Annabelle: Creation, which is the prequel to 2014's Annabelle and the fourth film in The Conjuring series.\n\nIn the supernatural thriller, LaPaglia plays the Annabelle dollmaker who, along with his wife (Miranda Otto), tries to recover from the sudden death of their daughter. Eventually, they attempt to cope by allowing a nun to transform their home into an orphanage. Unfortunately, the new occupants soon become prey for the possessed Annabelle. \"It turned out that I really liked the script because it wasn't all about blood and guts and people getting hacked to death,\" the actor notes.\n\nMeeting Annabelle: Creation director David F. Sandberg was another motivating factor. Sandberg first got Hollywood's attention with his Lights Out short and then the feature length version of the horror trip last year. Most critics were impressed by the film, which earned an impressive $148.9 million US at the world-wide box office. \"When I met David I really liked him, and when I saw his 2 1/2 minute version of Lights Out I thought it was incredible, so I knew stylistically he would elevate Annabelle: Creation,\" LaPaglia says. \"I had been doing TV for a really long time, and the studios hadn't been knocking down my door to do a film, so I thought this would be a great opportunity.\"\n\nHe also liked the acting challenge of portraying a potential diversion in the narrative. \"The thing that I thought I could pull off was this feeling that he's somehow involved and that he might be the bad guy, and he keeps floating back and forth between the good guy and the other guy,\" LaPaglia says.\n\nThe part's logistical degree of difficulty kept him involved, too, since Sandberg filmed most of the production out of order, \"so my performance is like a jigsaw puzzle where you have to remember where you are each time, and that's difficult when you get older because you forget.\"\n\nWorking opposite a youthful cast, including co-headliners Talitha Bateman, 15, and Lulu Wilson, 11, proved to be a less complicated assignment for a few reasons. \"I have worked with kids before, and I have a 14-year-old daughter, so that part of it was pretty easy for me,\" LaPaglia says. \"But I also made the decision that I was not going to interact with them off-camera. I wanted them to maintain that feeling of, 'Who is this guy?'\"\n\nBorn in Adelaide, the journeyman actor has always kept a low profile. He managed small parts on Aussie shows and in films during the 1980s and moved to L.A. in the early 1990s where he continued to split his efforts between the big and small screens.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2009 he made his mark portraying FBI agent Jack Malone on the series Without a Trace, and showing up on Frasier as Daphne's boozy brother Simon, which earned him an Emmy. \"When I started in the business, they had those medium-range movies that I might fit into but now it's either really small or those $150 million movies where I don't always fit,\" says LaPaglia. \"And to my own detriment, I don't always have a good pulse on pop culture of the moment and never have.\"\n\nNext up are two limited-run shows. LaPaglia plays Montreal mob boss Vito Rizzuto in the mini-series Bad Blood airing in the fall on City and FX. He also co-stars in the Aussie show Sunshine. In it, the actor plays the coach of a Sudanese-Australian basketball phenom being investigated by the police. \"Sometimes, I do something for the quality of the project and sometimes I do it for the pay cheque because I have a mortgage to pay,\" LaPaglia says. \"One thing I've always prided myself in is that I have a realistic view of where I stand in the business.\"", "time": "18:14:00"}

That puts the film well on track for between $25 and $30 million box office projections, a welcome opening for the movie, which cost only $15 million to make. (via Variety)\n\nAnnabelle: Creation follows dollmaker Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia) and his wife Esther (Miranda Otto), who, 12 years after the death of their daughter, open up their home to Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman) and a few of her charges from a recently-closed orphanage. However, the girls are soon terrorized by the demon doll containing the soul of the dollmaker's lost daughter.\n\nThe movie's predecessor, 2014's Annabelle, was made on a smaller $6.5 million budget, but that film was able to scare up $37.1 million in its opening weekend on its way to a $256.8 million worldwide gross. (via Box Office Mojo) However, Annabelle hit theaters in October, a month that is much friendlier to horror films, and was not being released into a summer box office that is already down 11 percent from last year. Annabelle: Creation does enjoy much better reviews (69 percent compared to 29 percent on Rotten Tomatoes), though, which could help to give it a stronger hold than the initial film had.\n\nThis weekend will also see the release of The Nut Job 2: Nutty By Nature, along with a limited release for Brie Larson's drama The Glass Castle. The Nut Job 2 is likely to take in between $12 and $14 million, in a stiff competition with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk for second place, while The Glass Castle should bring in around $5 million from 1,400 theaters. Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen's thriller Wind River will also expand to 45 locations after performing well in just four theaters last weekend.\n\nWhile this weekend could provide a win for the struggling summer box office, it will likely be another nail in the coffin of Stephen King's The Dark Tower, which is projected to fall more than 60 percent after a disappointing first weekend. While we wait to see who comes out on top this week, see what went wrong with The Dark Tower.", "time": "12:51:00"}

Based on the (well deserved) success of that film, a year later the demonic doll with the apple cheeks and pigtails became the main attraction in the anemic spin-off, Annabelle. The main stage didn't serve her well. There just wasn't enough 'there' there to carry her own film. It was nothing more than a quick cash-in to scare up a few bucks while the goosebumps from The Conjuring were still fresh. So, naturally, she's now been given a sequel. But none of this will seem new to horror fans. Their genre has never known the phrase \"Enough is enough.\"\n\nAnnabelle: Creation isn't a terrible film. Not exactly. The set-up is promising, and it offers some decent early jump scares. But eventually the thinness of the material becomes overwhelmingly obvious. Directed by David F. Sandberg (Lights Out) and apparently edited by no one, the film is a bloated grab bag of chiller clich\u00e9s that throws everything at the proverbial wall where nothing really sticks. There's possessed children with cracking, snapping double joints. There's an old dark house with creaky doors, bumps in the night, and closets one shouldn't go into, especially after being warned against doing exactly that. There's old record players that mysteriously start playing scratchy old-time tunes seemingly of their own accord. And there's maniacal looking dolls.\n\nWith a cast that includes Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto, there was at least some hope that Annabelle: Creation might be a cut above 'meh.' But, faultless though they are, they're as trapped as the gaggle of helpless pint-sized victims in the film. The two actors play a married couple who, in the film's opening stretch, lose their daughter in a tragic accident. Cut to twelve years later, and they've turned their sprawling farm house into an orphanage, which they hope will act as a balm for their loss. Needless to say, it doesn't. At least, we do find out where Annabelle came from, though. LaPaglia is the dollmaker who created her.\n\nWhen a group of young orphan girls moves in to the grieving couple's home (although Otto largely hides in bed with a Phantom of the Opera-style faceplate for reasons later explained), the past comes alive. A demonic presence starts haunting them with night time shocks and blink-fast appearances. The movie, though, can't seem to decide whether the haunting should be done by the couple's dead daughter, or Annabelle, or a random scarecrow that pops up for no reason besides...hell, it's just another clich\u00e9 to throw at the wall. The scares aren't especially clever or well-choreographed. Instead of artfully engineered frights, Sandberg goes for cackling sadism. In addition to the death of the couple's young daughter at the beginning, the evil forces in the film focus their supernatural crosshairs on the one girl with a Polio leg brace (Talitha Bateman).\n\nNone of this adds up to much besides a few arbitrary funhouse gotcha moments. And whatever logic there is in the film is muddled by a postscript that raises more questions than it answers. Then again, maybe that's the point of this series.

He locates her in no time. But if you go searching for an original idea in this tiresome thriller about a soul-sucking demon doll, you won't find one.\n\nScary-movie Clich\u00e9s cluster quickly: the staircase chair lift, the disfigured recluse, the locked door. They're all tucked into the sprawling house in the middle of nowhere.\n\nThat's where Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman) and six orphan girls aged \"Let's play with dolls\" to \"Let's talk about boys\" end up. They're taken in by a dollmaker (Anthony LaPaglia, wooden) and his wife (Miranda Otto, one-note), who lost their daughter in a fatal mishap 12 years earlier.\n\nJanice (Talitha Bateman, who goes from vulnerable to vile) -- the girl with sad eyes and a leg brace -- discovers a creepy doll with a gaunt face, oversized eyes and the uncanny ability to move and shape-shift. Being occupied by a dark spirit -- as this toy is -- will do that.\n\nHalle Berry can't rescue 'Kidnap' -- movie review\n\nDespite the lurking camera and a volume cranked to 20 designed to make us jump, director David F. Sandberg's tactics lead to diminishing returns. In short order, the doll-drums set in.\n\nThe movie is the latest standalone flick in a chiller series, and fans may appreciate how it works as an origin story and threads together with the earlier \"Annabelle\" and a couple of \"Conjuring\" movies.\n\nIs that enough to make \"Annabelle: Creation\" recommendable? Hell no, Dolly!\n\nTags: movie reviews anthony lapaglia stephanie sigman Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "time": "13:51:00"}

By that measure, director David F. Sandberg is an alchemist of the first order, taking the base -- even leaden -- components of horror and whipping them into a shivery chiffon of dread.\n\nThe Swedish filmmaker did it with his debut feature, \"Lights Out,\" which milked a deceptively simple, yet sublimely spooky premise -- the boogeyman only appears when the lights go out, and vanishes as soon they're back on -- for all it was worth. And he has done it again -- with even cheesier material -- taking the cliche-filled pantry of the Devil-doll prequel \"Annabelle: Creation\" and turning out a dish that, while pulled together from the familiar components of the ghost story, is uncommonly, nerve-wrackingly satisfying.\n\nThe recipe Sandberg uses is one we've seen before, mixing bits and pieces from a screenplay by Gary Dauberman (who also wrote the much less effective \"Annabelle,\" a 2014 spinoff from the universe of \"The Conjuring\"). The 1950s-set tale, which centers on orphans living in a remote, sprawling house, complete with balky electricity, a drafty dumbwaiter and an abundance of secret crawl spaces, also features: a locked room; a dead child; a well; a reclusive invalid who wears a \"Phantom of the Opera\"-style half-mask; and, for crying out loud, a nightmarish scarecrow.\n\nOh, yes: The house's proprietor is a retired dollmaker, whose magnum opus is the titular, demented-looking poppet -- one you wouldn't expect to see on any sane person's bookshelf, let alone in the toy aisle.\n\nTwelve years after losing their daughter, known as Bee (Samara Lee), in a car accident -- shown in a startlingly abrupt prologue -- Sam and Esther Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto) open their home to six orphaned girls and a nun (Stephanie Sigman). The youngest of the girls are sisters Linda (Lulu Wilson) and Janice (Talitha Bateman), the latter of whom walks with a leg brace and crutch as the result of polio. Sandberg makes good use of her limited mobility, as you might expect.\n\nIn short order, Janice begins to see spooky apparitions. And the aforementioned doll -- which she discovers in a locked room lined with pages from the Bible -- just won't stay put.\n\nNone of this is new, and in lesser hands it would easily become tedious. But Sandberg knows how to ratchet up suspense, composing shots filled with beautiful shadows, in whose corners there always seems to be lurking something scary: a ghostly little girl; a doll that looks like the spawn of Howdy Doody and Bette Davis in \"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\"; and something far more sinister.\n\n\"The Conjuring\" is a good movie. Its sequel, not so much. \"Annabelle,\" which took a small part of those films' world -- a prop, really -- and expanded on it, was an uninspired first crack at injecting some life into the trope of the demon doll. It didn't work.\n\nOn paper, \"Annabelle: Creation\" shouldn't work either. But to be fair, what horror movie doesn't sound stupid when you talk about it? Horror works -- or it doesn't -- in the flickering, moving images of the screen, not the page.\n\nSandberg knows that. His artistry, for that's what it is, is like that of the dollmaker Sam Mullins: to take inert material and create a living, breathing thing.", "time": "14:17:00"}

Ignoring ones that have been in the cinema for a while, like \"Dunkirk\" and \"Girls Trip\", this article will take a look at a few options debuting this weekend.\n\nThe first \"Annabelle\" was terrible, no two ways about it. It was an obvious cash-in that attempted to lure fans of the \"The Conjuring\" into theaters who wanted a similar experience. What they ended up receiving was a watered down and scare free horror-movie that was poorly acted.\n\n\"Annabelle: Creation\" is an improvement in every way and a decent enough time waster.\n\nThe jump in quality is nowhere near as impressive as seen in the \"Ouija\" franchise, but this is a smarter and creepier horror movie than the first. Rather than going for cheap jump scares, \"Annabelle: Creation\" focuses on creating a tense and uncomfortable atmosphere, which it manages to hold until the end.\n\nLike \"Annabelle\", the first \"#The Nut Job\" was also a terrible movie and not worth anyone's time. Unlike the previous entry, \"The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature\" is not an improvement in any shape or form. This still feels like a direct to DVD project that somehow got released in theaters. It is a better option than \"The Emoji Movie\" but there are much better children movies in cinemas.\n\nSometimes it takes more than a fantastic cast to make a great movie.\n\n\"#The Glass Castle\" is filled with recognizable faces who are giving it their all; unfortunately, they are stuck in a sentimental mess of a movie that lacks the grit and determination to give this harrowing story its due.\n\nThe plot is about a family, specifically a mother and father, who jump from house to house as they are on the run from debtors and do not want to work. These are by no means good parents and are willing to put their children in harm's way just so they can live life their way, but \"The Glass Castle\" is too scared to portray them as dangerous. Instead, it tries to be uplifting and inspirational and ends up falling flat on its face.\n\nFinally, we are getting to the genuinely good movies. \"Ingrid Goes West\" is an indie project about an Instagram stalker who decides to go to LA to try and get in with the focus of her obsession. Aubrey Plaza and Elizabeth Olsen are both fantastic, with the former delivering a truly unhinged and funny performance.\n\n\"Ingrid Goes West\" is not going to be for everyone but those looking for a quirky black comedy should look no further.\n\n\"Good Time\" will go down as exhibit A that Robert Pattison is actually a fantastic actor. A pitch black dark comedy about a bumbling idiot and the heist he tries to pull off, \"Good Time\" is unsettling and visually stunning.", "time": "07:22:00"}

in his chair in the corner of a sun-infused West Hollywood hotel suite, pausing when asked to explain what could have got him killed growing up in Adelaide, South Australia.\n\n\"I guess the statute of limitations has run out,\" he says sheepishly. \"But it came from doing stupid things as a kid of 13 or 14, like stealing cars, taking them for joyrides and getting into trouble. There's a huge kind of junkie adrenaline rush with doing something like that and thinking you might not make it out, and then the relief that you feel when you get out of it alive\n\n\"I think going to a horror movie gets the adrenaline levels going,\" he adds, referring to his latest role in Annabelle: Creation. \"Kids today aren't out there in the world as much so they are looking for it in the safe, controlled environment of a movie theatre.\"\n\nLaPaglia, 58, has been largely under the commercial radar since his seven-year stint in the hit TV drama Without a Trace ended in 2009. Revered on Broadway for shows such as A View from a Bridge, he also found acclaim in the Australian films Lantana and Balibo but more recently had focused on smaller, independent films as well as the three-time Logie-nominated Australian TV series, The Code.\n\nNow he's back in a high-profile studio film and not embarrassed to admit he's enjoying the perks. \"I haven't done a junket in a nice hotel room with room service in years,\" he says playfully, as a hamburger and fries is wheeled into the room by a hotel waiter. \"I was in that system a lot more in my 30s and didn't realise I missed it until I walked on the set of this movie and went, 'oh, this is how they do it!' I felt like I could breathe and take time to develop a character and do more than one take, so I enjoyed the slowed-down pace of it all.\"\n\nAnnabelle: Creation, the follow-up to 2014's hugely successful Annabelle, takes place several years after the tragic death of a little girl, when her still-grieving parents, a dollmaker and his wife (LaPaglia and fellow Australian Miranda Otto), invite a nun and a handful of girls from a shuttered orphanage into their home. The new arrivals quickly discover a secret in the late girl's bedroom and become the target of the dollmaker's possessed creation, Annabelle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What I liked about this script was that it wasn't a slasher story, which I'm not into at all,\" LaPaglia says bluntly. \"I liked that it was more old-school and stuff would jump out at you from nowhere. I also knew he'd be an interesting character to play,\" he adds, \"because you could perceive this guy as someone who has brought this evil into the home and is part of the problem but you could also believe he has nothing to do with what's happening in the house beyond creating the doll.\"\n\nYou will now receive updates from Entertainment Newsletter Entertainment Newsletter\n\nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy .\n\nFor an actor who has 60 movie credits and 40 television credits to his name, it's surprising this is his first encounter with the horror genre. \"I have been in some movies that have been considered horror movies, but not intentionally,\" he deadpans.\n\n\"I've had an interesting last 10 years where I've been transitioning in all kinds of ways professionally - with getting older and adjusting to where that puts me professionally - to personally,\" he says, referring to his 2015 split with his wife of 17 years, actress Gia Carides.\n\nTheir daughter, 14-year-old Bridget, was \"not interested in what I do,\" her father says with a wry smile, \"until I told her I was doing this movie. She just lost it. She said 'that's the coolest thing you have ever done in you entire life'.\"\n\nAnnabelle: Creation is now screening.", "time": "09:01:00"}

Annabelle: Creation, the latest film in The Conjuring universe, is making its debut in theaters this weekend, and by all indications, it looks to be a huge moneymaker like the three stories before it.\n\nTelling the origins story of a demonically-possessed vintage doll, Annabelle: Creation's \"main character\" was introduced in The Conjuring; the film's opening scenes told how real-life demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) came into possession of the malevolent plaything and eventually encased it in glass in their occult museum.\n\nAnd while the scenes with the creepy doll (based on a real-life incident) merely kicked off The Conjuring before the film moved on to its main narrative, the impact of the twisted toy story was impactful enough for The Conjuring director Wan and Warner Bros. to produce the spinoff film. Annabelle made an astonishing $256.8 million globally against a $6.5 million budget, throwing the door wide open for a follow-up story, which in this case is framed as a prequel.\n\nSince all roads from The Conjuring, its hit sequel The Conjuring 2, Annabelle, and Annabelle: Creation lead back to Ed and Lorraine Warren, it shouldn't come as a huge surprise that Wan had more of an all-encompassing name for the first film in the cinematic universe - The Warren Files. In an interview with THR, Wan says:\n\n\"Very early on, I wanted to call the Conjuring films The Warren Files. And so that was going to be a more encompassing sort of umbrella name for this whole world. We didn't end up going with that title, obviously, but I guess that spirit has always sort of lingered around.\"\n\nRelated: James Wan Offers Conjuring 3 and Crooked Man Movie Updates\n\nWhile Wan didn't explain exactly why he ended up going with The Conjuring over The Warren Files, it was likely a decision made to better hint at the film's underlying horror; the final title definitely suggests a scarier film.\n\nUltimately, The Conjuring, as box office numbers proved (globally it scared up $318 million in ticket sales against a $20 million budget), did quite fine with its replacement title, and Annabelle and The Conjuring 2 effectively solidified the foundation that has come to be known as The Conjuring Universe with similarly told tales that all originate from Ed and Lorraine Warren's case files.\n\nAs well as planned spinoffs for characters like The Nun and The Crooked Man on the way, The Conjuring 3 is in development, which will bring viewers back to the Warren files for what is sure to be another frightening look into the couple's remarkable encounters.\n\nNEXT: Annabelle: Creation Ending & Post-Credits Scenes Explained\n\nSource: THR\n\nKey Release Dates Annabelle: Creation release date: Aug 11, 2017The Nun release date: Jul 13, 2018 ShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment ThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!

And when previous movies in this shared \"Conjuring\"/\"Annabelle\" universe have made blockbuster amounts of money back, there's no sign of them slowing down.\n\nThis entry, from \"Lights Out\" director David Sandberg, reminds you of Corman's stable in another way. It's kind of crap - not just made for cheap, but with corners cut in the script, acting and most other elements.\n\nThe story and script are both pretty ham fisted, and while you can't really expect Oscar-worthy work from kids in their pre-teens, especially in this genre, even Australian vets Miranda Otto and Anthony LaPaglia are sleepily phoning it in.\n\nThey play The Mullins couple, a kindly dollmaker and his wife who live in a remote country house in the 1950s, lose their daughter in an accident and become reclusive, cut off from the world and apparently each other. For some reason the plot doesn't explain very well, they decide to take in a group of girls and their caretaker, Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman) from a local orphanage.\n\nThe girls think the big house and grounds are like a holiday, but the youngest two, Janice (Talitha Bateman) and Linda (Lulu Wilson) soon start to hear things that go bump in the night.\n\nMr Mullins has gruffly forbade them to enter his dead daughter's room, but further investigation there under the cover of darkness reveals a secret room behind the wall that contains the doll we saw in the original.\n\nTo talk about why it's hidden away would be to reveal too much of the story, but suffice it to say the Mullins' came to believe the spirit of their daughter was with them in the house, except that by the time it was too late they realised Annabelle was actually home to something far darker.\n\nThe plotting is a constant exercise in set-up-scary-set-piece-later-on with the scarecrow out in the barn and the creaky electric chairlift Janice needs to use to get up the stairs, and even though you might jump in your seat a few times, little of what goes on is a real surprise.\n\nThe design of the interior of the house is the best aspect of the movie, belonging in far better material that the script that serves it here, but as you sit there saying a line an instant before a character does and waiting for LaPaglia or Otto to show up (and show some life) you just can't get past the flaws.\n\nRelated Items:Annabelle 2, annabelle creation, film reviews Recommended for you Interview : Talitha Bateman, star of Annabelle: Creation Interview : David F.

Sandberg's Annabelle: Creation proves that history does, in fact, repeat itself - and not by following in John R. Leonetti's footsteps (director of Annabelle). Sandberg takes a page out of Ouija: Origin Of Evil's playbook, going the period route to recalibrate via prequel beginnings. Warner Brothers trusted their up-and-coming horror workhorse to salvage Annabelle's name, much like how Mike Flannagan made Ouija relevant again. In every sense of the phrase, Annabelle Creation is 2017's Ouija: The Original Of Evil. Noticeably improved upon, wicked in haunts and smart to cast little Lulu Wilson (child actor from Ouija: Origin Of Evil). It ain't October yet, but who says you can't squeeze a few screams in before summer dries up?\n\nAnnabelle's origin takes us to the Mullins residence, circa 1950. Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia), a retired toymaker, offers his roomy estate to a Catholic orphanage with no other options. Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman) arrives with her bus full of homeless girls, who immediately take to their new arrangement. Mr. Mullins issues two cardinal rules - don't enter a locked room upstairs and don't enter his wife's room (Miranda Otto as Esther). Sounds simple? Not for Janice (Talitha Bateman), who, despite a Polio-afflicted limp, finds herself led to the forbidden room by someone - or something. Linda (Lulu Wilson) accompanies her best friend one night, but senses danger almost immediately. The Mullins residence hides a dark secret, and it's about to be released once again.\n\nWhat's that Mr. Mullins? Don't go near the ominous, dead-eyed doll? Oh, it's far too late for that. All these girls can do is pray (and run and scream a lot).\n\nAnnabelle: Creation is essentially Red Flags: The Movie, but that doesn't mean Sandberg fails to conjure horrific interactions. The man who illuminated jump scares in Lights Out once again lurks in the shadows, striking fear deeper than a wooden relic whose head twists back and forth. Children habitually exhibit false confidence, and challenge evil forces without even knowing. A burlap scarecrow, cob-webbed crawlspace, bed blankets - all used to elevate anxiety.\n\nThose who've seen Annabelle understand she isn't a living entity (or very intimidating). That role is filled by the horned, slender beast who ties itself to Annabelle's totem, meaning horror comes from all the \"paranormal\" winds whipping around the Mullins house. Demonic eyes pierce blackened rooms, camouflaging a tar-colored creature as it telepathically breaks a man's fingers. Slammed doors echo and the ghost of \"Bee\" Mullins walks free. A particularly squirmy gag involves Linda, a pop-cannon fake gun and an \"empty\" hallway (my favorite). All things you might find walking around a Halloween attraction, transitioned gleefully to screen.\n\nStory itself plays a lesser role when clutching audiences. Annabelle's origin is a sad, unfortunate curse on the Mullins family - Bee getting hit by a car - and even worse, the demon's beckoning comes out of grief. Parents who just want to see their little girl again, and the evil force that manipulates loss. Twelve years later the wound is still fresh, yet all seems forgiven.\n\nSister Charlotte's orphans arrive because Samuel assumes an undead tormentor has vanished (uh?) - but, like, that's not something you maybe mention in passing? No one wakes up as Janice explores each night? Innocent children sleep in a house where someone has just died (not of natural causes)? Every moment of Annabelle: Creation screams \"GET OUT NOW,\" only to be written off as juvenile imaginations. Characters hang around way too long and make the most horror-fitting decisions, even if period aesthetics do ease our frustration (50s country isolation, nowhere to go).\n\nWe already know Lulu Wilson can play possessed (Ouija: Origin Of Evil), and now we know she can battle against nightmares as well. She's the eventual protagonist, smart enough to realize something is very, horribly wrong. Other orphans played by Philippa Coulthard and Grace Fulton are merely terror fuel, while Stephanie Sigman relies on the grace of God to protect her flock. Anthony LaPaglia mutters, Miranda Otto plays a broken mother and Talitha Bateman hobbles into all the wrong doorways - genre arcs stuck on repeat.\n\nWilson, a pint-sized demon hunter, is as courageous as she is horror-bait. Why she would ever rely on a rickety pulley system for escape is a head-shake moment, and why she'd hoist herself right back up after immediate failure is even more thoughtless - but it works. Her descent highlights gore and her rise grows tenser with each rope tug. Sandberg knows what's scary - as derivative as it may be - and Wilson is a mini delight when scampering away from danger. Her concerned eyes and child's intuition are made for Hollywood, even when just sitting on a porch chair, starring off at cloudy nothingness.\n\nLooking for a fun night out at the movies, horror fans? Annabelle: Creation is no lifeless dummy. Plotting may run a bit thin and coincidental, but David F. Sandberg whips up bone-chilling scares and hefty doses of peek-through-your-fingers imagery. What other movie this year has a sinister devil drop from the shadows like Spider-Man right after breaking a lightbulb in front of its victim's face? An electric chill, revelling in doom and gloom (and representative of Sandberg's promise to terrify). It's no game-changer, but Annabelle redone this is not. It's Lights Out lite, with heavy influences of Ouija: Origins Of Evil and a shoehorned cameo that will surely lead into The Nun (Conjuring Cinematic Universe). Carve your expectations accordingly.", "time": "22:19:00"}

Conjuring\" has led to spin-offs and sequels based on the experiences of real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. But what actually \"happened\" and what was invented for the movies? Here's a rundown of where real accounts and Hollywood screenwriting meet in \"The Conjuring\" and \"Annabelle\" movies.\n\n\"The Conjuring\" is based on a real reported haunting\n\nThe first film in the \"Conjuring\"-verse is mostly an actual, reported event, if you believe in that sort of thing. As demonstrated with photos during the end credits of the movie, the Perron family really did exist, and reported they were being attacked by some kind of entity. The Warrens did, in fact, investigate. Both Lorraine Warren and the Perron family signed off on the movie as well.\n\nThe Warrens really do have that museum of creepy things\n\nThe Warrens began their research in 1952 and decided to open the museum in the early 1980s, after their collection of haunted objects began to accumulate. The Warren Occult Museum is housed in the basement of the Warrens' actual home in Monroe, Connecticut, and is full of haunted artifacts and images taken from their cases. It's home to an organ that plays itself, a mirror that is said to summon spirits and a coffin owned by a \"modern vampire.\" To keep the evil at bay, a local priest comes once a month to bless everything on display.\n\nAnnabelle is a real doll\n\nThe opening portion of \"The Conjuring\" deals with Annabelle, a doll possessed by a demon. The story about two nurses who wound up with a haunted doll is a real case the Warrens dealt with. Ed and Lorraine really did take the doll back with them to their museum and keep it in a glass case.\n\nThat's not what Annabelle looks like\n\nAmong the liberties taken with bringing the Annabelle story to the screen, though, is changing the doll itself. The eerie American Girl porcelain look isn't like the doll from the real case -- instead, it was a big Raggedy Ann doll with red yarn hair and button eyes.\n\nThe exorcism in \"The Conjuring\" never happened\n\nAlthough a lot of the elements of the haunting of the Perron are claimed to have happened by the people involved, the movie's climactic possession and exorcism by Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) isn't among them. In reality, Lorraine Warren has said her husband would never have tried to perform an exorcism since he wasn't a priest.\n\nBut Andrea Perron, one of the Perron children who was 11 at the time of the events in the movie, said she did see her mother Carolyn (played by Lily Taylor in the movie) possessed at one point. Andrea said she secretly watched a seance during the haunting and saw her mother speak a language she didn't recognize in a different voice, before her chair levitated and Carolyn was thrown across the room.\n\n\"Annabelle\" is not the true backstory of the doll\n\nThe first spinoff of \"The Conjuring,\" \"Annabelle,\" serves as an origin story for the creepy doll. But none of the stuff that happens to Mia (Annabelle Wallis) and John Gordon (Ward Horton) has any documentation in reality -- it was all created for the movie. The Warrens' case with Annabelle starts in the hobby shop seen at the end of the film, where the doll was purchased by the mother of one of the nurses.\n\nAnnabelle might have a real victim, though\n\nIt wasn't in any of the movies, but Annabelle might have a real victim. After it was in the Warren museum, though, it might have inflicted its evil on someone. According to the Warrens, a man came to the museum and banged on Annabelle's case, mocking the doll until Ed Warren threw him out. Lorraine Warren claims the man's girlfriend told him the pair were laughing about the doll afterward while riding away on his motorcycle -- until he mysteriously lost control and crashed into a tree.\n\nAlso Read: 'Annabelle: Creation' Review: Horror's Bad Doll Gets a Sinister-Stuffed Origin Story\n\n\"The Amityville Horror\" is also based on a Warren case\n\nMentioned in \"The Conjuring 2\" is another haunting the Warrens worked on in Amityville, New York. In that case, the Lutz family was haunted after moving into the home in which Ronnie DeFeo Jr. shot and killed six members of his family the year before. Bits of the story of the haunting are part of the story of \"The Conjuring 2,\" and the case went on to inspire all of the movies in the various \"Amityville Horror\" franchises. (The Lutzes' story is now known to be a hoax.)\n\nIt was also a hoax\n\nThe Amityville haunting story has been widely debunked. Ronnie DeFeo's lawyer, William Weber, admitted the story was a hoax he and George Lutz dreamed up. Weber had hoped to use the haunting to get his client a new trial, and the Lutzes profited from the story's widespread notoriety and fame.\n\n\"The Conjuring 2\" is based on another real haunting\n\nThe Enfield Haunting is one of the most famous and best-documented supposed hauntings ever, and a lot of what's seen in \"The Conjuring 2\" is part of the record of what's actually supposed to have happened. For one thing, the recording of Janet Hodgson allegedly speaking in the voice of Bill Wilkins does exist in some form, as do images that allegedly show the children levitating. Police responding to calls from the family say they did see furniture move on its own, just like in the movie.\n\nBut there's controversy surrounding it, too\n\nThe Hodgsons really did get caught faking evidence of the Enfield Haunting. Janet Hodgson said she faked a very small amount of the evidence in the case, claiming it was because so many people were investigating and sometimes spooky things wouldn't happen on cue. And according to at least one investigator on the case, the Warrens' involvement was much less than in the movie -- supposedly they showed up \"uninvited\" and stayed only one day.\n\n\"The Crooked Man\" is a real English nursery rhyme\n\nAnd it's distinctly less sinister than in \"The Conjuring 2.\" It was first recorded in the 1840s. The monster seen in the movie was actually just a manifestation of the demon antagonist Valak used to attack and scare the Hodgson family. But the Crooked Man is getting his own movie spinoff, and so is Valak, so expect some new backstory for \"The Crooked Man\" likely not based in any real hauntings or cases.\n\nThe Demon Nun Valak is a \"real\" demon\n\nThe demonic nun that's a major antagonist in \"The Conjuring 2\" is mostly an invention of director James Wan based on a conversation he had with Lorraine Warren about \"a spectral entity that has haunted her in her house.\" Valak, though, the demon it's named as being in the movie, is based in demonic lore and mentioned in several books on demons from the 14th and 15th Century. More of that will probably come up in the spinoff movie about the demon, \"The Nun.\"\n\n\"Annabelle: Creation\" is another Hollywood addition to the mythos\n\nSince the movie \"Annabelle\" is a Hollywood creation and not the actual, true backstory of the real-life doll in the Warren museum, the same is true of \"Annabelle: Creation.\" The second movie is another prequel to \"The Conjuring\" that goes back even further in the doll's life, to track where it first came from, but it's pretty far removed from the Warrens' cases at this point.", "time": "00:24:00"}

to shake off the late-summer doldrums. \"Annabelle: Creation,\" the latest installment in the \"Conjuring\" cinematic universe, opened to $4 million in Thursday pre-shows. Box office sages predict that the horror film will pull in roughly $25 million this weekend.\n\nThat's makes the film a shrewd bet for Warner Bros. and New Line, which spent an economical $15 million to put a frightening spin on children's toys. It is, however, a significant drop-off from other films in the series. The first \"Annabelle\" kicked off to $37.1 million, while \"The Conjuring\" and \"The Conjuring 2\" premiered to $41.9 million and $40.4 million, respectively.\n\nDavid F. Sandberg directed the prequel about a dollmaker whose creation terrorizes a group of orphan girls. The cast includes Stephanie Sigman, Talitha Bateman, Anthony LaPaglia, and Miranda Otto. Reviews have generally been favorable, which should help the latest \"Annabelle\" push last weekend's winner, Stephen King's \"The Dark Tower,\" out of its first place perch.\n\nIts main competition for the box office crown should come from Open Road's animated sequel \"The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature,\" which is opening in 4,003 locations. The story of a group of animals who attempt to save their home from being bulldozed and turned into an amusement park, is aiming to make about $15 million. That's slightly below the first \"Nut Job\" movie, which opened to $19.4 million before going on to take in $120.9 million worldwide during its run. Earlier this week, Open Road announced that it was being sold to Tang Media Partners for an undisclosed price. It was previously owned by AMC and Regal, the country's two biggest theater chains. Its credits include \"Spotlight\" and \"Nightcrawler.\"\n\nLionsgate's \"The Glass Castle,\" an adaptation of Jeannette Walls' popular 2005 memoir, will also try to connect with audiences this weekend. It's tracking for a soft opening of $5 million. The drama reunites Brie Larson with \"Short Term 12\" director Destin Daniel Cretton. It's based on Jeannette Walls' memoir of her dysfunctional childhood.\n\nIt's been a brutal summer for Hollywood. Though films such as \"Wonder Woman\" and \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" have scored with audiences, flops such as \"King Arthur\" and \"Transformers: The Last Knight\" have dragged down ticket sales. Revenues this summer are down 10% year-over-year. Perhaps \"Annabelle: Creation\" can close some of the gap.", "time": "14:20:00"}

It's unnecessary to prep for the sneakily effective \"Annabelle: Creation\" by first biting your nails through James Wan's retro fright-fest \"The Conjuring\" (2013), then massaging your temples over John R. Leonetti's abysmal \"Annabelle\" (2014).\n\nThough \"Creation\" marks the third on-screen appearance of everyone's favorite demonically possessed doll, the movie is actually something of a prequel to a prequel, taking place a decade before the previous installment. Could we call it a proquelogue? Probably. Should we? Merriam-Webster says probably not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNevertheless, the film affixes yet another horrific history to its wicked, wooden adversary (the eye-roller of a tagline reads \"You don't know the real story,\" as if that's the viewer's fault at this point), positing that the doll originally belonged to the daughter of a kindly toymaker (Anthony LaPaglia) and his wife (Miranda Otto), who reside in a remote California farmhouse.\n\nLocked away in the wake of the girl's tragic death, the doll re-emerges 12 years later, just after the still grief-stricken couple take in six girls from a Catholic orphanage, along with their devout guardian (Stephanie Sigman). Two young'uns in particular -- fearful Janice (Talitha Bateman), whose battle with polio has left her in a leg brace, and the sunny Linda (Lulu Wilson), whose naivete keeps her isolated from the older girls -- find themselves drawn toward the daughter's bedroom, where a demonic presence lies in wait, with violent intent.\n\nGet The Weekender in your inbox: The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond.

So credit returning \"Annabelle\" writer Gary Dauberman and newly drafted director David F. Sandberg (\"Lights Out\") with delivering what's instead a tense and terrifying genre workout, the kind of old-school chiller that starts slow, patiently turning the screws and introducing a\u2009surplus of creepy set pieces (a\u2009creaky dumbwaiter here, a covered well there) before making potent use of each in a brutal, blood-curdling crescendo of a third act. Sandberg, an impish\u2009traditionalist inspired in equal measure by William Castle (\"House on Haunted Hill\") and John Carpenter (\"Halloween\"), casts his camera deep into shadows that seem to swell with the horrors they hide. Here, he forces uncertain audiences to lean into the dark, sometimes (but, crucially, not always) springing a nasty surprise on them once there.\n\n\"Creation\" owes much to last year's \"Ouija: Origin of Evil,\" another better-than-expected prequel to a soulless studio cash-in: a period setting, a central trio of strong women, demonic possession, similar jump-scares, even the same lead actress (Wilson, whose matter-of-fact moxie here makes for an appealing inversion of her \"Ouija\" role). But then again, \"Origin of Evil\" borrowed enough from Sandberg's original \"Lights Out\" short that it's tempting to conclude any turnabout is fair play. And if some light deja vu is the price horror fans must pay for a mainstream offering this spine-tingling, most will still come away feeling spooked and satisfied.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\n\nANNABELLE: CREATION\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDirected by David F.

Sandberg to discuss Annabelle: Creation. And the climactic end scene was a point of conversation that needed some analysis. If you haven't had a chance to see the movie just yet, you might want to save this cool reveal for a later date, as there will be SPOILERS ahead.\n\nAnnabelle 2 is racking up some great reviews. And the ending helps push this one home as a great recent horror outing that definitely outshines the first Conjuring spin-off. At the heart of this wicked tale is a killer doll known only as Annabelle. While the original outing plodded along, meandering and wasting time, Annabelle Creation is a relentless scare fest. The 109 minute runtime has some excellent jump scares. But the ending truly delivers the goods.\n\nIn this scene, Linda, played by Lulu Wilson, is trying to escape Talitha Bateman's possessed character Jancie by using the house's old dumbwaiter. This results in Linda landing in the basement. The drop has disoriented her. And it takes the girl a second to realize that the top part of Esther Mullins' dead body is lying in front of her. A beat passes, and the corpse jolts to life crawling towards our hero like some kind of inhuman abomination. Linda only escapes at the last second. It's a scene that's guaranteed to shave at least three years off your life. Bloody Disgusting chatted with Sandberg about this particular scene, and this is what he divulged.\n\n\"When we were putting the movie together in the edit I was like, it needs something extra here. I was sort of joking with Michel, the editor, that maybe they just find half of Mrs. Mullins and she was like 'Yeah!' Instead of laughing it was 'Okay, let's do that,' so that was a late addition and we had that scene we shot later on with her crawling on the floor.\"\n\nSeeing as how this moment came late in the game, it was assumed that the scene was achieved through a digital assist with some well placed CGI. But it absolutely wasn't. Sandberg claims there was no digital effects at all in the hair-raising moment. He goes onto explain.\n\n\"I got to work with an amputee. That wasn't CGI. I asked, 'Can we find someone without legs?' which freaked everyone at the office out. But we found this woman without legs who was totally up for it and so into it and she kind of looks like Miranda [Otto]. We had some blood and hair and stuff to her face to cover it up a little bit, but yeah. That's one of those weird things I've always wanted to do... work with amputee people in horror movies because they can do cool things.\"\n\nAnd thus, one of the great scares of summer was born. Once again, The Conjuring universe waited until the last moment to add possibly its best scene, a scenerio shared by the addition of the Nun in Conjuring 2. Annabelle: Creation is currently playing in theaters. And it looks poised to beat last week's box office winner The Dark Tower with its hand tied firmly behind its back. Go tonight. Get scared.", "time": "20:16:00"}

It is also, once again, showcasing the demented doll currently safeguarded at Ed and Lorraine Warren's Occult Museum in Monroe (CT), Annabelle.\n\nIf early reviews are any indication -- it's currently sitting on Rotten Tomatoes with an 82% -- Annabelle: Creation is going to be a far superior sequel compared to that of it's predecessor Annabelle, which earned a paltry 29% score in 2014.\n\nSeeing as how very few things excite more than a good new horror movie (keyword: good), PopCulture.com decided to go through the vast scary movie collection to compile the 10 Best Demonic Horror Movies!\n\nObviously this excludes horror movies with elements such as ghosts, monsters, slashers, etc, instead focusing solely on movies where evil entities take control over innocent human beings. Take our No. 3 pick, for example: The Evil Dead, the B-cult classic directed by Sam Raimi.\n\nWhile the sequels were far campier than their predecessor, the original was a terrifying exercise in low-budget horror, and like all of the movies on this list, dealt with demonic possession thanks to an ancient book called the Necronomicon, said to be \"inked in human blood and bound by human flesh.\" Note to self - NEVER read out of a book inked in human blood.\n\nThe Evil Dead was made in 1981 on a shoestring budget of $350,000 and would go on to earn over $2.5-million at the box office, all the while earning the praise of horror icon Stephen King and inspiring future filmmakers like the Coen brothers.\n\nThe role of Ash turned Bruce Campbell into a B-Movie Icon and The Evil Dead launched a franchise that included two sequels, a reboot, and a television show.\n\nSo what's your favorite horror movie dealing with demonic possession? Think it made the top spot? Watch the video above to find out and make sure you check out Annabelle: Creation in theaters now!\n\nby Chris Killian | August 11, 2017", "time": "14:14:00"}

We also value stories that honor our intelligence, that believe we might have an attention span longer than a hummingbird's. There is a certain modern fetishization of slowness, borne out of the same impulse that is certain steel-cut oats taste better and tells us every couple years that we really should write more letters. Slowness equals intelligence, and few genres bear the weight of that assumption more than horror.\n\nAnnabelle: Creation is one hour and 49 minutes long. That's just over ten minutes shy of the run time of The Exorcist, another film that deals with demons and holy water and children in peril. That's not as unfair of a comparison as it may sound: director David F. Sandberg, of last year's Lights Out, possesses technical skills that are nothing to sniff at, and this mid-century period piece feels richly detailed and lovingly filmed. The dusty old country house where the majority of the film's action takes place feels like as much of a real, time-worn place as it does a soon-to-be terror trap. But whereas Exorcist director William Friedkin never stopped building a holistic, inescapable sense of dread whether or not someone's head was twisting around backward, Annabelle: Creation's countless sequences of foreboding silence -- hands reaching for doorknobs, our heroines shuddering in the dark, waiting for their demonic tormentor to attack -- offer nothing to really latch on to, no larger reason to care that's not purely technical. It's proof that slower doesn't always mean better in horror.\n\nNot having seen the original Annabelle shouldn't affect your appreciation of this origin story. The film opens with a lovely, only subtly disturbing wordless sequence in which artisan Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia) assembles the titular doll in his workshop. Shortly afterward, in a few quick strokes we meet his happy family unit: wife Esther (Miranda Otto) and daughter Bee (Samara Lee). All of it is lost, though, when Bee is hit by a car and dies. Fast forward 12 years, when we learn that the tragic Mullinses have opened their doors to a small group of girls from an orphanage. During a tour of the house, the new guests are given strict instructions never to enter a certain bedroom of a certain little dead girl. Of course, kindhearted polio survivor Janice (Talitha Bateman) is overcome by curiosity and goes in anyway, and soon meets the totally normal, definitely harmless doll that lives there.\n\nA caveat: While this is not my first review of a horror movie, it's the first where I feel it's relevant to bring up my inability to be frightened by the vast majority of ostensibly scary films. (It's more of a disadvantage than you'd think!) This doesn't affect my enjoyment of films that are a campy good time (Wish Upon) or have something political or social at work under the hood (Get Out), but for films like Annabelle: Creation, whose sole purpose is to give you the spooks, it's sounding a dog whistle I just can't hear.\n\nTaking that into consideration, I found Sandberg's most successful scary flourishes to be the ones that utilized the uncanny scale of the titular doll. Seeing her rise up, out-of-focus, behind Janice's back was one of the better chills, as well as a jump scare in a darkened space under some stairs that is just kinetically unexpected enough to knock the wind out of you. The cast is mostly anchored by child actors, and the two young leads are both fantastic horror surrogates, especially the plucky Linda (Lulu Wilson) who has a great sequence with a toy bazooka that is both funny and nightmarish.\n\nBut once the actual demons take over, this scare-deaf critic could no longer take any of it seriously, and the film's multiple threads of different girls getting scared in different rooms in the house started to feel rhythmically unfocused -- to the degree that I was checking my watch even as a principle character was crucified to the wall in gory detail. There's nothing cheap about the rest of Annabelle: Creation, so this scattered finale felt like a letdown. But again, your mileage may vary; one person's haunted doll horror is another person's clown horror is another person's creeping specter of postnuclear toxic masculinity horror. At least haunted dolls aren't real!", "time": "14:23:00"}

Conversely, Father Robert warns, it can lead them into the sordid world of the occult, even opening them to demonic possession.\n\nFather Robert is not exaggerating. A priest for more than ten years and an experienced exorcist, he knows firsthand the unintended consequences when children or adults open the door to demonic activity. \"Oftentimes,\" he says, \"[demon possession] begins because kids get curious after reading Harry Potter.\" He explains that kids want the unusual powers that they see depicted on the screen.\n\nOne former Satanist whom Father Robert knew personally, a man who has turned away from his past life and embraced the Catholic faith, had begun his descent into Satanism at the age of nine or ten, when he began playing a game called \"Bloody Mary.\" From that simple beginning, he gradually became involved with others who were Satanists.\n\nAn important part of Father Robert's ministry is training other priests at the Vatican's official Exorcism Institute in America. From across the country and around the world, Catholic priests come to the Institute to learn the secrets of this ancient rite, so that they too can exorcize demons and evil spirits. The nature of the work that Father Robert and the Institute are involved in is so hazardous that he has requested that the Register not publish his full name or reveal his location.\n\nI had the opportunity to meet and talk with Father Robert at a recent media preview of New Line Cinema's latest horror production, \"Annabelle: Creation\", which opens nationwide on August 11. Directed by David F. Sandberg (director of the short film \"Lights Out\"), \"Annabelle: Creation\" is actually a prequel to the highly successful 2014 release of \"Annabelle\" - which is itself a prequel to the 2013 cult favorite \"The Conjuring\" and the more recent \"Conjuring 2\" (2016). Father Robert had seen them all, and he agreed that \"Annabelle: Creation\" was largely faithful to the Catholic Church's teachings with regard to possession and exorcism.\n\nBy Invitation Only: Satan Only Goes Where He Is Invited\n\nFather Robert explained that the devil will only go where he is invited. He talked of two cases he knew of personally in which two young women, not realizing the gravity of their request, had invited \"any spiritual being\" to help them. The consequence was that they exhibited symptoms of demon possession and required an exorcism.\n\nThe writers of the film, Father Robert noted, had done their homework - they understood that the demon could only enter the home of dollmaker Samuel Mullins and his wife Esther if it was invited. In \"Annabelle: Creation\", Esther and Samuel Mullins are mourning the loss of their beloved daughter Bee. Miranda Otto, who portrays the mother Esther in the film, explained,\n\nLike most parents, they are devastated. But unlike most, they decided that they would do anything to have her back....absolutely anything at all. Basically, they prayed, calling out to any kind of power that would allow them to see her or feel her presence in any way. But by doing so, they evoked certain spirits that are not the kind you would welcome into your home.\n\nTwelve years after the tragic accident, the grieving parents seek comfort by opening their home to Sister Charlotte and several girls from an orphanage that has been closed. When one of the girls peers into the closet and sees the possessed doll, Annabelle, the doll sets her sights on the girls and unleashes a storm of terror.\n\nFather Robert and I agreed that \"Annabelle: Creation\" was, for the most part, faithful to the Catholic understanding of exorcism. There were, however, a few scenes which caused us both to raise an eyebrow:\n\nA Sister heard confession? - Most particularly, there was a scene in which Sister Charlotte, played by the talented Stephanie Sigman, listens to the confession of one of her young charges. Granted, there were differences from a regular confession: The Sister and the young girl sat back-to-back, not in a confessional. But the concept of confession was renewed when Sister Charlotte said, \"Well, for your penance....\" Particularly during the time period of the film, Father Robert considered it highly unlikely that a Sister would ever put herself in the position of appearing to perform a sacramental function that requires a priest.\n\nSister Charlotte wore a contemporary religious habit. - Based upon the clothing styles, classic automobiles, and the Victorian farmhouse, it would seem that \"Annabelle: Creation\" is set in the early 20th century. However, Sister Charlotte wears what appears a contemporary religious habit - with a knee-length skirt and a simple headpiece which exposed her hair. When I asked director David Sandberg and actress Stephanie Sigman (Sister Charlotte) about that during our interview, both seemed surprised, explaining that they had looked at photos of nuns in different habits and had chosen a simple costume which would make it easier to act the role.\n\nDisposal of the possessed object - In \"Annabelle: Creation\", two priests come to the home to bless the doll Annabelle and to sprinkle it with holy water before it is sealed away in a Scripture-lined closet. Good as far as it goes, Father Robert thought, but he was adamant that an exorcist would never leave the possessed object there intact, to be found by someone in the future. \"You would take the curse off the object,\" he explained. \"You could burn it or take it apart; but it would be decommissioned somehow.\"\n\nAs an example of a possessed object, Father Robert described a crucifix that hangs in his office which was burned from the bottom during an exorcism, the fire consuming the corpus and leaving only the arms of the crucified Christ. \"It had a plastic corpus on it,\" he explained. \"The cross itself was blessed. It was put in the room with a woman who practiced Brujer\u00eda witchcraft in Mexico. In the middle of the night, the cross caught fire. I decommissioned it. I would never permit anyone else to get near it, because it could be used in the future for something wrong.\"\n\nThe scarecrow scene, and the Tasmanian devil - A scene in which a scarecrow was possessed by the evil spirit and moved from its original position seemed unlikely, according to Father Robert. Similarly, he was unconvinced when the demon began to grow and assumed a physical likeness of what he called a \"Tasmanian devil.\"\n\nOnly by invitation! - In one scene, a child becomes possessed when she finds herself in the presence of a demon that manifests itself as a little girl. Father Robert rejected the idea that an evil spirit could inhabit the body of a child who happened to be in its presence - since, as he explained earlier, an evil spirit will only enter a person if he is invited.\n\nFather Robert listed five signs which may indicate that a person is suffering spiritual attack:\n\n1.Hidden knowledge. If a person has knowledge which he or she should not have, such as private information which is known by only a few people, that may signal demonic possession.\n\n2.Languages. A possessed person may be able to speak in an unfamiliar language which he or she would not normally know.\n\n3.Superhuman strength. Father Robert reported one case in which a young girl who was 5'4\" tall and weighed perhaps 110 pounds was able to throw a number of big guys off of her, preventing them from holding her down during the exorcism ritual.\n\n4.Extreme aversion to the sacred. A person who is possessed may be unable to look at a crucifix, or to touch a rosary which has been blessed. Father Robert knew of one woman who couldn't be in the presence of a cross of St. Benedict, or to be in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament.\n\n5.Levitation. Father Robert had personal knowledge of a case in Louisiana, in which a person was seated in a chair and, powered by the evil spirit, was able to levitate with the chair and proceed down the hall.\n\n\"Annabelle: Creation\" opens in theaters across America on August 11. Despite the small inconsistencies which Father Robert noticed, the film is respectful of faith. The film does an effective job of building tension, and there are repeated \"frights\"; but it is not really gory and depends on spiritual and psychological effects rather than blood. It's likely to enjoy wide distribution among fans of the horror genre. Rated \"R\", it seems unsuitable for small children; but others can attend, confident that their faith will not be challenged.", "time": "17:05:00"}

That would be toymaker Sam Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia) who lives in a remote rural home with his wife Esther (Miranda Otto) and their daughter Bee (Samara Lee), before a tragedy befalls the trio.\n\nTwelve years after said tragedy, a whole orphanage of girls moves into the rambling Mullins house, now rendered creepy by the spirit of the departed but paranormally busy Bee. If the girls occasionally get the willies, their guardian Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman) must put them straight: \"We've got nowhere else to go.\"\n\nIt's not long before the doll shows up, tucked away in a mysterious closet lined with pages from the Bible. It seems to have particular designs on the most physically vulnerable of the girls, Janice (Talitha Bateman), who's mostly lost the use of her legs to polio. It's Janice's best friend Linda (Lulu Wilson) who is obliged to rise to the defence of the girls as the malevolent doll-demon in the house gathers strength.\n\nDirector David F. Sandberg, who helmed last year's sleeper-thriller Lights Out, demonstrates his ability to ping the nerves with one sequence after another, rising to two significant crescendoes of terror, one of which involves an entity that puts the \"scare\" in scarecrow.\n\nApart from the unintentional shocks of anachronistic dialogue (memo to screenwriter Gary Dauberman: in the 1950s, no one was \"freaked out\"), the film's biggest problem is that just about every scene is constructed to terrify on various different gradients of fear, with no real breathing room between shocks.\n\nAlso -- and this is an issue with the entire Conjuring franchise -- the absence of humour makes the tone a little more dour than it needs to be.\n\nThat said, the child actors are very good, the spooky-old-house production design is top-notch, and the cinematography is often excellent: a night scene in which Lina tries to throw Annabelle down a well is downright painterly.\n\nIf there are no laughs to be had here, one is consoled by a brief moment of unexpected gothic beauty among the relentless scares.", "time": "06:22:00"}

The murderous dolls were meant for one another, and could crank out some adorably creepy Snaps and Instas.\n\nEven better, maybe if the two found each other they could find fulfillment that their waning movie careers are no longer delivering.\n\nThe prequel \"Annabelle: Creation\" marks the American Girl On Crack's full-on descent into \"Child's Play\"-style redundancy. An offshoot of \"The Conjuring\" films, the hybrid franchise now cranks out a new movie just about every year. Previous movies, which claimed to be based on real events, were hit-and-miss but stirred up just enough shocking frights to remain naggingly freaky.\n\nThe new movie turns \"doll\" to \"dull.\"\n\nDirector David F. Sandberg takes on the task to tell Annabelle's origin story, but saves the specifics for a throwaway expository sequence late in the film. Sandberg isn't much interested in explaining how exactly a demon manages to possess a doll, instead focusing on plopping Annabelle into scenes in jump cuts, accompanied by shrill, eardrum-popping violin shrieks.\n\nHer prey is a squad of preteen orphans holed up in a country mansion with a doltish nun (Stephanie Sigman) and vacant-eyed married couple (Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto) who tell the girls there is one room -- Annabelle's -- that they aren't allowed to enter.\n\nNo matter how loudly you shout \"Don't go in there!\" they won't listen.\n\nOnce the advice is disobeyed and Annabelle comes out to play, the adults and half the children ignore the ghostly body slams suffered by the protagonists, annoyingly insisting on remaining in the house as things get progressively worse.\n\nWhat exactly Annabelle is trying to accomplish is never clear. So you have clueless, unmotivated humans pitted against a clueless, unmotivated ghost demon. It's a boring, irritating combination, and the attempts at shock usually come off as unintentionally funny rather than freaky.\n\nChucky, only you can save Annabelle from further embarrassing and degrading herself.

million in preshows, while 2013's \"The Conjuring\" earned $3.3 million and its 2016 sequel earned $3.4 million.\n\nThe first \"Annabelle,\" which was released in October 2014, made Halloween bucks with a $37.1 million opening against a $6.5 million budget. It went on to gross $84 million domestic and $256.8 million worldwide.\n\nThe sequel was tracking for an opening weekend of $27 million to $30 million, although Warner Bros. and New Line estimated lower at $25 million. \"Creation\" was produced for approximately $15 million. Its Rotten Tomatoes score is at 69 percent.\n\n\"Annabelle: Creation\" follows up on the first \"Annabelle\" by showing the origins of the titular evil doll as it terrorizes a group of orphaned girls who take shelter in the house of the doll's creator. The film is directed by David F.

The biographical drama is expected to gross around $5 million this weekend.\n\nThe film stars Brie Larson as the author as she struggles to form her own life for herself while growing up in poverty with an alcoholic father (Woody Harrelson) and an eccentric mother (Naomi Watts). Destin Daniel Cretton is directing from a script he co-wrote with Andrew Lanham and Marti Noxon.

Nothing makes Americans forget about a looming missile crisis like a demonically possessed children's toy.\n\nWith cable news chyrons blaring the latest in the war of words between Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump, \"Annabelle: Creation\" is shaping up to be a much more potent force than initially anticipated. The Warner Bros. and New Line horror film is on track to bring in as much as $38 million this weekend from 3,502 locations, according to Friday afternoon projections. Some rival studios even think it has a chance of hitting $40 million. No matter where it lands, the opening weekend will be a nice return on the film's $15 million production budget. It's also a much bigger debut than the $25 million launch that many were predicting the film would enjoy.\n\n\"Annabelle: Creation\" is the newest entry in the \"Conjuring\" cinematic universe. The first \"Annabelle\" kicked off to $37.1 million, while \"The Conjuring\" and \"The Conjuring 2\" premiered to $41.9 million and $40.4 million, respectively.\n\nDavid F. Sandberg directed the prequel, starring Stephanie Sigman, Talitha Bateman, Anthony LaPaglia, and Miranda Otto, about a dollmaker whose creation terrorizes a group of orphans. Reviews have been favorable, which may be helping the pic break through in a bigger way than expected.\n\nWith \"Annabelle: Creation\" dominating ticket sales, last weekend's box office champ, \"The Dark Tower,\" will likely slide to fourth place with $7.6 million. That should push the fantasy epic's domestic total to roughly $33 million.\n\nChristopher Nolan's \"Dunkirk\" is locked in a tight race for second place with another major new release, \"The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature.\" Both films should pull in roughly $10 million. The \"Nut Job\" follow-up is produced by Open Road Studios and is rolling out in more than 4,000 locations. It centers on a group of animals who attempt to save their home from being bulldozed and turned into an amusement park. The first film opened to $19.4 million and went on to gross $120.9 million worldwide. The \"Nut Job\" sequel could pick up steam on Saturday, which is traditionally a popular day for families to go to the theater.\n\n\"Dunkirk,\" a World War II drama that has been rapturously received, will end the weekend with more than $150 million in domestic ticket sales.\n\nThe only other wide release is Lionsgate's \"The Glass Castle,\" an adaptation of Jeannette Walls' 2005 memoir. The drama reunites Brie Larson with her \"Short Term 12\" director Destin Daniel Cretton. It should make $5 million during its inaugural weekend.", "time": "23:26:00"}

Superhero films such as Christopher Nolan's \"Batman Begins\" and Sam Raimi's \"Spider-Man\" reveal the motivating forces behind the mask, teaching us that we fall so we may learn to pick ourselves up, or that with great power comes great responsibility.\n\nBut what about the origins of supervillains? Better yet, what about creepy supervillain dolls? What drove Satan to want to possess a doll? If, for some reason, you've actually asked yourself that question, then you might have to look further than \"Annabelle: Creation,\" David F. Sandberg's prequel to \"Annabelle\" (2014), because this film's only interesting answer is -- in a deep, devilish voice -- for \"your soul.\"\n\nSituated in the universe of \"The Conjuring\" series, \"Annabelle: Creation\" backtracks 12 years before the events of \"Annabelle.\" Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman) and six orphaned young girls, including Janice (Talitha Bateman) and Linda (Lulu Wilson), are displaced to the Mullins family's large estate at the grace of Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia) -- a retired dollmaker and father -- and a bedridden and handicapped Esther Mullins (Miranda Otto). From there, director Sandberg exercises the usual tropes of the horror genre, to expected but effective results.\n\nThe dark is never a safe place -- things inexplicably move on their own, and the familiar, innocent images of adolescence represented in dolls are corrupted when the lights go out. It's a familiar concept, but these tropes are at least efficiently used for creative scares. Cinematographer Maxime Alexandre is well-versed in the horror genre (\"The Hills Have Eyes,\" \"Silent Hill: Revelation,\" \"Mirrors\"), and he smoothly and patiently guides the camera through the creaking dark corridors of the Mullins house, deliberately framing shots to show and conceal precisely what's necessary to build suspense. When Alexander locks onto a single perspective, one can only uselessly beg for the camera to turn around or check the other corner.\n\nSound designer William R. Dean (\"The Hunger Games,\" \"The Revenant,\" \"Skyfall\") should also be lauded for the unsettling sound production he develops for the film. Every creak of the house, turning knob and slammed door is emboldened to poignant and chilling effect.\n\nAnd the spaces the characters inhabit are equally crucial to maintaining a constant ominous feeling. Thanks to production designer Jennifer Spence (the \"Insidious\" and \"Paranormal Activity\" franchises), the Mullins house is the perfect visual exposition for the fate of all its inhabitants. The house is built with many architectural motifs of a cathedral, as if the Mullins were always trying to protect themselves from some unholy presence. As soon as one of the girls forebodingly comments, \"We're gonna need a map to find our way around,\" it's obvious that everyone is probably screwed.\n\nBut beyond the technical achievements of the film, what you see is what you get. Although the film's tagline claims that \"you don't know the real story,\" in a way, anyone remotely familiar with the horror genre -- or really any movie with biblical demons -- probably does. The conflicts and resolutions (or lack thereof) are all the same. Several images of the film are explicitly reminiscent of \"The Exorcist\" (1973) and \"The Woman in Black\" (2012).\n\nExplanation of Annabelle's origin is blandly sprinkled throughout the film. The audience can see Samuel Mullins' meticulous process of creating the fateful Annabelle doll but later on is given a fairly anticlimactic reason as to why the doll is possessed by the demon in the first place.\n\nWith this film serving as another addition to universe of \"The Conjuring,\" it's difficult to discern whether screenwriter Gary Dauberman and the producers of the series are really concerned with anything other than moving the franchise forward from point A to point B, with no foreseeable endgame in mind.", "time": "14:43:00"}

Sandberg, late of the solid Lights Out and currently slated to helm that Shazam movie Warner Bros still claims to be making). And let him take a Mulligan on the whole \"origin of Annabelle\" concept - so this is the prequel to the prequel (ugh!) to The Conjuring, but it's largely free to do its own thing.\n\nSet 12 years prior to the first Annabelle, the story follows a group of children (and one nun) from an overfull girls' orphanage who move into the isolated rural home of a former toymaker and his bedridden wife. You will be unsurprised to learn that the house is the middle of nowhere, riddled with secret passages, hidden compartments, creepy mood-lighting and features no less than TWO separate rooms that no one is supposed to ever, under any circumstances, go into. They go in them anyway - which is how they discover the locked-away Annabelle doll and set a bunch of nasty haunted-house business in motion.\n\nThere isn't really a \"deal\" with the doll itself, which is why you have to assume this is tricky material. Annabelle is \"iconic\" because, despite being an incidental subplot in The Conjuring, she was the main \"monster\" from that movie you could put in advertising materials that weren't a spoiler. The basic idea is that there's a powerful demon (of the literally-from-Hell variety) \"attached\" to the doll, so instead of being a Chucky-esque \"killer toy\" Annabelle is basically a prop whose presence excuses demonic happenings in the general vicinity of wherever it happens to be. We're eventually told how/why said demon came to be connected to the doll, but the \"origin\" in this case is how it got itself into circulation in the wider world.\n\nIt's a standard setup, yes, but the conceit of making most of the main characters young girls does make a lot of the \"why would you do that!?\" stuff that needs to happen for the plot to commence more easy to forgive because, well... KIDS. The film understands that its real job is packing as haunted-house/scary-ghoul set pieces into about 90 minutes as it can while keeping the characters exactly compelling enough so that we don't want to see them get killed and zigging when we expect it to zag. It also has the foresight to pull some plot and character-turns I didn't see coming; including a doozy that arrives at the midpoint and neatly divides the story into two halves based on which of the characters we're following around as the \"main\" one. And while some of the gags are pretty typical, they're also pretty well executed: How many movies can still make a \"spooky scarecrow\" or \"old dark well\" bit work in 2017?\n\nIt avoids it pretty deftly for a lot longer than you'd think. But eventually, there IS the inevitable point where it makes NO sense for them to stay in the house but they do anyway because Act 3 needs to happen. So even though this is much better haunting movies tend to slip up, it's still disappointing to see when things had been going so well. There's also a small but none the less grating scene that only exists to clumsily remind us that there's a whole other Conjuring spin-off separate from this coming up next that's awkward as hell.\n\nIf you're a fan of scary movies, sure - you never know how long the wait will be until the next one of these (in theaters) is actually good.", "time": "17:10:00"}

That is extremely important for me when I play a character.\" Sigman assured that Sister Charlotte is not the usual stereotypical nuns we have watched onscreen. \"There are layers to her. Her first priority is to protect the children because she is their mother. She brings hope. She brings compassion. And, of course, she brings on the screams.\" Sigman went on to describe the scares she encountered on the Warner Bros. lot where most of the film was shot. \"You know, it was surreal. Obviously we are on set playing characters, but there were certain scenarios, without giving anything away, that caused quite a frenzy. There were moments where I genuinely forgot I was playing a character. That's how scary some of the scenes were,\" said Sigman.\n\nIn \"Annabelle: Creation,\" several years after the tragic death of their little girl, a doll maker and his wife welcome a nun and six girls from a shuttered orphanage into their home. They soon become the target of the doll maker's possessed creation, Annabelle. The new film is once again produced by Peter Safran and James Wan of \"The Conjuring\" movies. The movie will take audiences around the world to the very origin of Annabelle in \"Annabelle: Creation,\" which is set to his theaters on August 11th. \"This movie truly delivers the scares and we hope movie goers enjoy the film as much as we enjoyed making it,\" concluded Sigman.", "time": "11:48:00"}

Wan, as fans know, is the architect of The Conjuring Universe, which has creatively tied the first two Conjuring films together with the possessed doll spinoffs Annabelle and Annabelle: Creation, as well as the upcoming horror thriller The Nun.\n\nBased on the case files of real-life demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren, Wan has demonstrated through the first four films in the saga that a shared cinematic universe can be built not only through subtle tie-ins from one film to the next, but by creating a similar atmosphere that all comes from the same place.\n\nThe titular character in The Nun was introduced in The Conjuring 2 as a demonic spirit that manifests itself and terrorizes Lorraine (Vera Farmiga). Much in the same way the side character of Annabelle frightened audiences and merited its spinoff films, The Nun has done the same for the ghastly apparition, which briefly appears in Annabelle: Creation. Her own tale is set for July 2018 release.\n\nWan, who is writing and producing The Nun - but not directing due to his previous commitment at the helm of Aquaman - tells THR that should The Nun merit a sequel, he already has an idea sketched out that ties it into the wider world. He says:\n\n\"I do know where potentially, if The Nun works out, where The Nun 2 could lead to. and how that ties back to Lorraine's story that we've set up with the first two Conjurings and make it all come all full circle.\"\n\nRelated: The Conjuring Was Originally Called The Warren Files\n\nIn all likelihood, a sequel to The Nun will happen. With Wan's attachment (he describes the film as cross between the religious mystery thriller The Name of the Rose and The Conjuring), viewers will easily get the type of scares and haunting atmosphere that he's helped deliver in The Conjuring and Annabelle films; and he's certainly employed the right talent (Demian Birchir and Taissa Farmiga are among the cast members) to ensure a quality production.\n\nOn top of the that, the films in The Conjuring Universe have had relatively low budgets (from as little as $6.5 million for Annabelle and topping out at $40 million for The Conjuring 2), so the threshold to get solid returns should be easily achievable to justify another film. With Annabelle: Creation virtually guaranteed to be a hit with a projected $36 million box office this weekend against a $15 million budget - and another Conjuring 2 spinoff movie on the way with The Crooked Man, as well as The Conjuring 3 - there should be more than enough momentum for Wan to complete his vision with a sequel to The Nun.\n\nNEXT: The Conjuring Director Explains How He Accidentally Built A Shared Universe\n\nSource: THR\n\nKey Release Dates Annabelle: Creation release date: Aug 11, 2017The Nun release date: Jul 13, 2018 ShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment ThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!

The success of this film shouldn't have been too much of a surprise though. After all, the film was directed by James Wan: The man responsible for Saw (the good one), Dead Silence, and Insidious. The man obviously knows his horror.\n\nThe Conjuring led way to an excellent sequel, and has spawned its own connected universe. First up was 2014's Annabelle, based on the intensely creepy doll from The Conjuring. Sequel Annabelle: Creation is in theaters now, and doing quite well critically [read our review here]. Up next is The Nun from the Conjuring 2, followed by a visit from the (I swear it was claymation, but it actually was a real guy) Crooked Man.\n\nWas a \"Shared Universe\" always in the cards for the Aquaman director? Apparently so, albeit in slightly different form. The Hollywood Reporter recently say down with James Wan, and Annabelle: Creation director David F. Sandberg (Lights Out, Shazam). During the interview, Wan revealed his initial plans for the Warren cases: \"Very early on, I wanted to call the Conjuring films The Warren Files, and so that was going to be a more encompassing sort of umbrella name for this whole world. We didn't end up going with that title, obviously, but I guess that spirit has always sort of lingered around.\"\n\nHe also revealed that he likes to view his role in this burgeoning shared universe as a TV show runner. His way of managing the over-arching narrative, and plan ahead. \"If you start approaching it that way, you kinda see where the films can sort of fan out, where the storylines can fan out and become other stuff\", said the director.\n\nJames Wan also made clear that he wants the movies to share a similar style in order to develop a sense of cohesiveness. Something he began with The Conjuring: \"That is the aesthetic that I feel like I've set up...and I really want to keep that classical sort of old-school storytelling going on with all these films. Those are the kind of horror movies that I really love, and so I want to make sure that all these films within the Conjuring world feel like they came from the same place. I don't want them feeling too disjointed from a visual standpoint.\n\nSandberg had this to say about working under Wan's expanding umbrella of horror films: \"The only sort of mandate...was to put in these little references to the other movies. But otherwise, it was very free.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Wan seemingly ruled out the possibility of him taking on directing duties on The Conjuring 3, stating that: \"I just don't think it's realistic with my schedule. I'm going to be on Aquaman for a year-and-a-half. I just don't see that as a reality.\"", "time": "10:52:00"}

Should this trend continue, we could very well see one of Annabelle's ancestors causing catastrophic delays in the building of the pyramids.\n\nFor now, though, we're in the 1940s as a doll maker and his wife (Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto) suffer the loss of their beloved daughter. A dozen years later, he's a shuffling shell and she's a disfigured recluse; so they open their rambling California farmhouse to a young nun and a clutch of orphaned girls. Wake up, Annabelle, your victims are here! Might I suggest you begin with the little one with the leg brace?\n\nAnd so she does, terrorizing the youngsters in cheekily effective scenes while their host hovers ineffectually on the fringes and his wife cowers behind her bed curtains. Gary Dauberman's script is lamentably light on mythological details (can the demon survive indefinitely outside the doll, or does it have a curfew?), but its vacuousness allows the director, David F. Sandberg, to string together jolts any way he pleases.\n\nAs with last year's \"Lights Out,\" he proves a master of the flash-scare, a nifty choreographer of precipitous timing and striptease visuals. But he's also adroit with more leisurely horrors, like the snap-crackle-pop of the murderous shade flexing for the kill, or the slow animation of a sacklike scarecrow into a toothy obscenity.\n\nIn this kind of horror movie, no one ever seems to hear you scream.", "time": "20:14:00"}

It starts with toymaker Sam (Anthony LaPaglia) and his wife Esther (Miranda Otto) contentedly raising their 12-year-old daughter Bee (Samara Lee) in an American Gothic farmhouse miles from anywhere. He tinkers with his dolls; they play hide-and-seek; Bee prances into the road and gets taken out by a speeding car.", "time": "13:40:00"}

"https://relevantmagazine.com/article/possession-theology-and-the-real-horror-of-annabelle-creation/", "body": "If movies were baseball, the horror genre would be the Albuquerque Isotopes. Just a stop along the journeyman's highway of actors, writers and directors who hope to get to big budget or serious work. Horror movies are cheap to make and sell well with the teenage audience, so movie studios love them. But you'll notice that there's nary a trophy handed out during awards season to flicks about killer clowns to murderous chainsaw wielding madmen.\n\nOf course, there are exceptions. Get Out shocked audiences with a mix of horror and comedy, and shocked Hollywood with a $252 million box office. The Shining, Psycho, Alien, The Ring and Cabin in the Woods are all essential viewing for movie fans (who don't mind trembling under a blanket on the couch).\n\nIt's time to add another title to the \"must watch\" list. On paper, Annabelle: Creation doesn't look like much. It's a prequel to the 2014 horror flick Annabelle and is the fourth in The Conjuring film franchise. Aside from Miranda Otto (Lord of the Rings) and Anthony LaPaglia (Frasier, Without a Trace), these are mostly up-and-coming actors. All the details smell like a straight to Redbox B-movie.\n\nBut somehow, everything comes together and Annabelle: Creation adds up to much, much more than the sum of it's parts. This is only director David F. Sandberg's second feature (after Lights Out, a 2016 horror flick), but it's easy to understand why he's rumored to helm the upcoming Shazam movie in the DC Universe.\n\nAnnabelle: Creation is art. Beautifully shot and acted, it doesn't feel like the typical rush job produced as quickly as possible so that the checks will cash and everyone can get onto some real work. Simply put, this may take it's place in the annals of pop culture as one of the most memorable movies of the decade.\n\nControversial theology, to be sure, and one that many (likely most) believers will object to. But none the less, this is a story about the Bible, faith and the forces of evil.\n\nThe movie is (very) loosely based on an alleged true story of Lorraine Warren, a grandmother who bought a Raggedy Anne doll for her granddaughter in 1970. Lorraine claims the doll levitated and tried to strangle members of the family. A Catholic priest drove the doll to a local museum to be kept behind glass (a very odd move, if you think something is possessed by an evil spirit) and claimed the doll kept tying to take over the car, and he had to throw holy water on it. Local lore has passed down stories of people who have tried to break past barriers to touch the doll, and later died in auto accidents.\n\nWhile these may seem like nothing more than tall tales, there's no doubt that demons show up in the New Testament. In Mark 5:11-20, Jesus casts demons into pigs. Of course, the pigs did not levitate and try to strangle anyone like the allegedly demonic Raggedy Ann, but there's no doubt that the vast majority of Christians acknowledge some form of demonic activity in the world.\n\nAnnabelle: Creation is first and foremost a piece of entertainment. But with a Certified Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a projected #1 spot at the box office, this means that demons will have their moment in the pop culture conversation.\n\nAccording to Father Robert (who does not want to use his full identity by his real name), a Catholic Priest trained in exorcism, Covens and worship of demonic forces are on the rise in the United States, but church leaders don't know how to respond.\n\nHe says that if church leaders encounter the occult, they rarely know how to handle it. \"Our religious leaders rarely if ever talk about it because for the most part it was never discussed in the seminary,\" he says. \"However, Jesus talks about it. Therefore, they exist.\"\n\nTHE RISE OF THE OCCULT IN AMERICA\n\nFather Robert believes that demons can and do interact with our world, when they are invited in.\n\n\"An infestation of demons in a location means that something invited them in. An infestation can be one or many demons depending on the type of spell, or prayer that drew them in.\" he shares. \"Possession means that the person no longer has control over his or her physical operation. Often times, the person will lose a certain amount if not all of their consciousness when the demon or demons take over. To drive a demon from a residence is much easier than to drive a demon from a human being.\"\n\nIt's a view that other camps within Christian theology are skeptical of, at best. \"Darkness breeds darkness just like light breeds light,\" says Sean Palmer, Teaching Pastor at Ecclesia Houston and host of the Not So Black & White podcast. \"The Psalms teach us that deep calls to deep and human nature is consistent in that we become more of what we consume. Is it possible for a doll to be possessed by demons? I don't know. It is possible for people to become nurtured by evil.\"\n\nIt's impossible to summarize what the Protestant wing of Christianity thinks of demons. Some segments of the charismatic movement put a heavy emphasis on spiritual warfare, and others, almost none at all.\n\nAt the extreme end of \"no spiritual warfare\" would be leaders like controversial author Rob Bell, who seems to make claims in his new book What Is the Bible that the idea of Satan did not enter Judaism until the Babylonian exile. By default, no Satan, no demons.\n\nThe Reformed tradition believes Satan and demons are at work in the world, but not in a horror movie kind of way where a doll strangles people.\n\n\"Demons are not Omnipresent and have limited power since all power in heaven and earth has been given to Jesus,\" says Bob Bouwer of Faith Church in Dyer, IN. \"The record of scripture only has demons entering people or animals, specifically pigs. A Christian can not be demon possessed. A believer can be demon oppressed from the outside if they dabble with the demonic. All of us are under the constant, everyday, temptations put before us by sin or Satan and his host. I also do not believe in 'territorial' demons.\"\n\nThe Orthadox tradition is much more skeptical of the idea of demonic activity on earth. \"Would Satan possess a doll? Sounds like a waste of time,\" says Professor Eric Young of Olivet Nazarene University. \"He's not concerned with cursing inanimate objects. He concerns himself with people. In short, we sin when we participate with Satan and his plans. Cursed things are not cursed because Satan inhabits them. They are cursed because God has abandoned them.\"\n\nWhether or not Christians believe in demons, an increasing number of Americans do. There's not much hard data on the subject, but one study cited in The New York Times called Wicca the fastest growing religion in America, which states \"Many Wiccans practice some form of magic or witchcraft, which they say is a way of affecting one's destiny, but which many outsiders see as evil. The Wiccan pentacle, a five-pointed star inside a circle, is often confused with symbols of Satanism.\"\n\nAnnabelle: Creation is a well crafted film that tells a story the vast majority of Christians will find to be highly controversial.\n\nWhether or not you believe in demonic activity on earth, it's worth noting that Annabelle is the rare for anything coming out of Hollywood to have a message that's this strongly in favor of the Bible, prayer and turning to God in times of desperation.", "time": "13:23:00"}

"body": "The weekend's two other new nationwide offerings are the animated sequel 'The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature' and the drama 'The Glass Castle,' adapted from Jeannette Walls' acclaimed memoir.\n\nNew Line Cinema's origin horror film Annabelle: Creation shouldn't have much trouble topping the North American box office this weekend, although overall it looks like another slow session as the dog days of August wear on.\n\nThe latest installment in the successful horror franchise is tracking to open in the $25 million-$30 million range from more than 3,400 theaters. While that's a lower start than the previous three movies, it would still be a solid launch considering the general malaise that has resulted in summer box-office revenue running behind last year by as much as 10 percent.\n\nAnnabelle: Creation, directed by David F. Sandberg, revolves around a doll maker who invites a nun and a group of girls who have been evicted from an orphanage to stay with him and his wife. However, his possessed doll named Annabelle quickly sets her sights on the visitors. Stephanie Sigman, Talitha Bateman, Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto star in the film, which sports a strong 81 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nElsewhere, days after Open Road Films announced its sale to Tang Media, the indie studio will release The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature in roughly 4,300 theaters. The animated sequel, about a group of animals trying to stop their serene park from being turned into an amusement venture, looks likely to take in around $15 million. (The first film debuted to $19.4 million in January 2014.) The voice cast includes Will Arnett, Maya Rudolph, Jackie Chan and Katherine Heigl, with Cal Brunker directing.\n\nThe weekend's third new nationwide offering, The Glass Castle, will roll out in far fewer theaters (less than 1,500 locations). From Lionsgate, the drama is adapted from former gossip columnist and author Jeannette Walls' best-selling 2005 memoir about her harrowing childhood. Brie Larson plays Walls in the film, which was directed by Destin Daniel Cretton. Naomi Watts, Woody Harrelson and Sarah Snook also star. Glass Castle is projected to open in the $5 million range.\n\nAt the specialty box office, Al Gore's climate change documentary An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power, from Paramount and Participant Media, and The Weinstein Co.'s Wind River will continue to add theaters.", "time": "11:40:00"}

Warner Bros. could celebrate not only the month's biggest debut but also having the week's top two films. Christopher Nolan's \"Dunkirk\" followed in second with $11.4 million in its fourth weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.\n\nEven amid an especially weak August, the well-reviewed horror sequel and modestly budgeted \"Annabelle: Creation\" found eager audiences.\n\n\"That we were able to do $35 million in what is a very sluggish marketplace was very impressive,\" said Jeffrey Goldstein, Warner Bros.' distribution chief. \"We all know that moviegoing begets moviegoing and right now it's a dip in the content overall.\"\n\nThe film, the third to spiral out of 2013's \"The Conjuring,\" cost only about $15 million to make.

The Sony Pictures release, starring Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey, toppled nearly 60 per cent on its second weekend with an estimated $7.9 million.\n\nThe week's other new entry, the Open Road animated release \"Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature,\" edged just above \"The Dark Tower\" with $8.9 million. That was well below the 2014 debut of the original, \"The Nut Job,\" which opened with $19.4 million.\n\nBut the solid returns for \"Annabelle: Creation\" did little to counter the box-office slide. Ahead of the weekend, the domestic box office was 11 per cent off the pace of 2016's summer. This weekend was also down considerably from the same timeframe last year, when \"Suicide Squad\" was leading the box office despite brutal reviews.\n\nSome of July's bright spots, however, have continued into August. The summer's top comedy, \"Girls Trip,\" will soon surpass $100 million domestically. The movie, starring Jada Pinkett Smith and Queen Latifah, took in $6.5 million in its fourth week to bring its cumulative total to $97.2 million. It may end up doubling the gross of its closest summer comedy competition: the starrier and pricey \"Baywatch\" ($58.1 million in its entire run).\n\nIn limited release, the A24 crime thriller \"Good Time,\" starring Robert Pattinson, debuted with a robust $34,000 per-screen average on four screens. That was bettered, though, by the $47,000 screen-average of Neon's \"Ingrid Goes West,\" with Aubrey Plaza, on three screens. Both films expand in coming weeks.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theatres according to comScore.

Warner Bros. could celebrate not only the month's biggest debut but also having the week's top two films. Christopher Nolan's \"Dunkirk\" followed in second with $11.4 million in its fourth weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.\n\nEven amid an especially weak August, the well-reviewed horror sequel and modestly budgeted \"Annabelle: Creation\" found eager audiences.\n\n\"That we were able to do $35 million in what is a very sluggish marketplace was very impressive,\" said Jeffrey Goldstein, Warner Bros.' distribution chief. \"We all know that moviegoing begets moviegoing and right now it's a dip in the content overall.\"\n\nThe film, the third to spiral out of 2013's \"The Conjuring,\" cost only about $15 million to make. More sequels and spinoffs are being developed in what has become for Warner Bros. a steadily profitable horror franchise bent on old-school frights. The \"Annabelle\" offshoot centres on a possessed doll.\n\nLast week's top film, the poorly received Stephen King adaptation \"The Dark Tower,\" slid dramatically. The Sony Pictures release, starring Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey, toppled nearly 60 per cent on its second weekend with an estimated $7.9 million.\n\nThe week's other new entry, the Open Road animated release \"Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature,\" edged just above \"The Dark Tower\" with $8.9 million. That was well below the 2014 debut of the original, \"The Nut Job,\" which opened with $19.4 million.\n\nBut the solid returns for \"Annabelle: Creation\" did little to counter the box-office slide. Ahead of the weekend, the domestic box office was 11 per cent off the pace of 2016's summer. This weekend was also down considerably from the same timeframe last year, when \"Suicide Squad\" was leading the box office despite brutal reviews.\n\nSome of July's bright spots, however, have continued into August. The summer's top comedy, \"Girls Trip,\" will soon surpass $100 million domestically. The movie, starring Jada Pinkett Smith and Queen Latifah, took in $6.5 million in its fourth week to bring its cumulative total to $97.2 million. It may end up doubling the gross of its closest summer comedy competition: the starrier and pricey \"Baywatch\" ($58.1 million in its entire run).\n\nIn limited release, the A24 crime thriller \"Good Time,\" starring Robert Pattinson, debuted with a robust $34,000 per-screen average on four screens. That was bettered, though, by the $47,000 screen-average of Neon's \"Ingrid Goes West,\" with Aubrey Plaza, on three screens. Both films expand in coming weeks.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theatres according to comScore.

able to save the summer -- which, after this weekend, will only fall farther behind last year's pace -- but it is doing its part to frighten audiences into theaters.\n\nThe latest from New Line and Warner Bros, which serves as the fourth installment in what has become the \"Conjuring\" extended universe, is casting its evil eye on $35 million from 3,502 locations. That's a strong start for the horror flick, which was made for about $15 million.\n\nThe track record for the franchise is strong -- \"Annabelle\" ($37.1 million); \"The Conjuring\" ($41.9 million); and \"The Conjuring 2\" ($40.4 million). David F. Sandberg directed the sequel about a dollmaker whose creation terrorizes a group of orphan girls. For those invested in the \"Conjuring\" canon, it serves as a prequel to the first \"Annabelle.\" Stephanie Sigman, Talitha Bateman, Anthony LaPaglia, and Miranda Otto star in the pic that critics have generally given a thumbs up to (it currently has an 68% on Rotten Tomatoes).\n\n\"Annabelle is scary as hell,\" said Jeff Goldstein, distribution chief at Warner Bros. \"And it's exciting to see how broadly audiences enjoyed it,\" he said, adding, \"I think our marketing team did a fabulous job.\"\n\nThe same studio's \"Dunkirk\" continues to show strong during its fourth weekend, as it holds onto second place. One of the lone bright spots in a generally dismal summer for the box office, Christopher Nolan's World War II epic should make an additional $11.4 million this weekend, pushing its domestic total past the $150 million mark.\n\nWhile it should land in the top three, Open Road's sequel \"Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature\" appears to be a miss. From 4,003 locations, the animated adventure should earn $8.9 million. That's less than half of the first \"Nut Job\" movie, which opened to $19.4 million before going on to take in $120.9 million worldwide during its run. The sequel's story centers around a group of animals who attempt to save their home from being bulldozed and turned into an amusement park.\n\nAfter \"Nut Job 2\" is Sony's \"Dark Tower\" which underperformed during its opening weekend, and continues to slide. With $7.9 million from 3,451 locations, the movie looks to slip 59% from its first frame. The same studio's \"Emoji Movie\" is rounding out the top five with $6.6 million from 3,219 theaters, just ahead of Universal's \"Girls Trip\" which is closing in on the $100 million milestone. That landmark was just met by Sony's \"Baby Driver,\" which took in $1.5 million this weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, Lionsgate's new release \"The Glass Castle\" is pulling in $4.9 million from 1,461 locations. Those are meager earnings, but also a low theater count. The adaptation of Jeannette Walls' hugely-popular 2005 memoir mostly appealed to women, who made up 80% of the audience. Audiences have been generally receptive, earning the movie an A- CinemaScore, while critics are more mixed (50% of RottenTomatoes). Brie Larson reunited with \"Short Term 12\" director Destin Daniel Cretton for the project, which also stars Naomi Watts and Woody Harrelson.\n\nIn limited release, Paramount's \"An Inconvenient Sequel\" added 376 theaters this weekend for a total of 556 where it's expected to make $800,000. TWC expanded Taylor Sheridan's \"Wind River\" to 45 locations, where it is earning $642,067 -- the studio plans to continue the film's expansion to between 600 and 700 locations next weekend. Neon's \"Ingrid Goes West,\" starring Aubrey Plaza and Elizabeth Olsen, should make $141,216 from just three locations. And A24's Robert Pattinson-starrer \"Good Time\" is opening in four theaters to $137,625.\n\nThis time last year, \"Suicide Squad\" suffered a steep second weekend drop to $43.5 million. But that is still more than this weekend's winner. And while Disney's \"Pete's Dragon\" faltered, Sony's \"Sausage Party\" surprised with $34.3 million, or about the same as \"Annabelle: Creation\" this year. That is to say, the box office continues to slip behind, and the summer of hell is only getting hotter.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "timeCrawl": "17:56:00", "sim": 0.6823529601097107, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 13, "date": "2017-08-13", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 19}], "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8949790", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "id": 8, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters", "id": 9, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "id": 253, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation", "id": 574, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "id": 575, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "id": 576, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}], "page": 1, "pages": 200, "totalResults": 200}}}

(Variety.com) - \"Annabelle: Creation\" may not be able to save the summer -- which, after this weekend, will only fall farther behind last year's pace -- but it is doing its part to frighten audiences into theaters.\n\nThe latest from New Line and Warner Bros, which serves as the fourth installment in what has become the \"Conjuring\" extended universe, is casting its evil eye on $35 million from 3,502 locations. That's a strong start for the horror flick, which was made for about $15 million.\n\nThe track record for the franchise is strong -- \"Annabelle\" ($37.1 million); \"The Conjuring\" ($41.9 million); and \"The Conjuring 2\" ($40.4 million). David F. Sandberg directed the sequel about a dollmaker whose creation terrorizes a group of orphan girls. For those invested in the \"Conjuring\" canon, it serves as a prequel to the first \"Annabelle.\" Stephanie Sigman, Talitha Bateman, Anthony LaPaglia, and Miranda Otto star in the pic that critics have generally given a thumbs up to (it currently has an 68% on Rotten Tomatoes).\n\n\"Annabelle is scary as hell,\" said Jeff Goldstein, distribution chief at Warner Bros. \"And it's exciting to see how broadly audiences enjoyed it,\" he said, adding, \"I think our marketing team did a fabulous job.\"\n\nThe same studio's \"Dunkirk\" continues to show strong during its fourth weekend, as it holds onto second place. One of the lone bright spots in a generally dismal summer for the box office, Christopher Nolan's World War II epic should make an additional $11.4 million this weekend, pushing its domestic total past the $150 million mark.\n\nWhile it should land in the top three, Open Road's sequel \"Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature\" appears to be a miss. From 4,003 locations, the animated adventure should earn $8.9 million. That's less than half of the first \"Nut Job\" movie, which opened to $19.4 million before going on to take in $120.9 million worldwide during its run. The sequel's story centers around a group of animals who attempt to save their home from being bulldozed and turned into an amusement park.\n\nAfter \"Nut Job 2\" is Sony's \"Dark Tower\" which underperformed during its opening weekend, and continues to slide. With $7.9 million from 3,451 locations, the movie looks to slip 59% from its first frame. The same studio's \"Emoji Movie\" is rounding out the top five with $6.6 million from 3,219 theaters, just ahead of Universal's \"Girls Trip\" which is closing in on the $100 million milestone. That landmark was just met by Sony's \"Baby Driver,\" which took in $1.5 million this weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, Lionsgate's new release \"The Glass Castle\" is pulling in $4.9 million from 1,461 locations. Those are meager earnings, but also a low theater count. The adaptation of Jeannette Walls' hugely-popular 2005 memoir mostly appealed to women, who made up 80% of the audience. Audiences have been generally receptive, earning the movie an A- CinemaScore, while critics are more mixed (50% of RottenTomatoes). Brie Larson reunited with \"Short Term 12\" director Destin Daniel Cretton for the project, which also stars Naomi Watts and Woody Harrelson.\n\nIn limited release, Paramount's \"An Inconvenient Sequel\" added 376 theaters this weekend for a total of 556 where it's expected to make $800,000. TWC expanded Taylor Sheridan's \"Wind River\" to 45 locations, where it is earning $642,067 -- the studio plans to continue the film's expansion to between 600 and 700 locations next weekend. Neon's \"Ingrid Goes West,\" starring Aubrey Plaza and Elizabeth Olsen, should make $141,216 from just three locations. And A24's Robert Pattinson-starrer \"Good Time\" is opening in four theaters to $137,625.\n\nThis time last year, \"Suicide Squad\" suffered a steep second weekend drop to $43.5 million. But that is still more than this weekend's winner. And while Disney's \"Pete's Dragon\" faltered, Sony's \"Sausage Party\" surprised with $34.3 million, or about the same as \"Annabelle: Creation\" this year. That is to say, the box office continues to slip behind, and the summer of hell is only getting hotter.", "timeCrawl": "18:06:00", "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8950659", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "id": 8, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters", "id": 9, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "id": 253, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation", "id": 574, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "id": 575, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "id": 576, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "id": 948, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}], "page": 1, "pages": 201, "totalResults": 201}}}

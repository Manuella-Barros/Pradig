That was a really tough semi-final, so I'm just glad to have got through it.\n\n\"That was really strong, it could easily have been a final.\n\n\"I was boxed in a bit, but I knew not to panic.

I didn't want to waste too much energy.\n\nMuir in action during her 1500m semi-final (Getty)\n\n\"But the likes of Semenya and Dibaba were behind me and they are very strong sprinters, so I thought I wanted to keep out of harm's way and have a bit up my sleeve in case people came rolling past.\"\n\nIn the end Muir crossed the line 0.16secs ahead of South African Semenya.\n\nKipyegon said: \"I know Muir is there, Semenya is there, so everybody can win the race.\n\n\"The cheering for Muir also gives me some motivation to do what I have to do.\"\n\nMuir's team-mate Laura Weightman joined her in the final after finishing fourth in the second semi-final in 4:05.63.\n\nLaura Weightman and Muir together after Saturday's race (Getty)\n\nWhile Muir's prospects looked bright, Katarina Johnson-Thompson's were dealt a blow by an awful high jump in the opening morning of the heptathlon.\n\nThe devastated 24-year-old collapsed to the mat, head in hands, after a third failure at 1.86m. It left her with a best clearance of just 1.80m from arguably her strongest event, a full 18 centimetres off her personal best and a difference of 233 points.\n\nShe returned in the evening to throw 12.47m in the shot put, her weakest event, and, more significantly, then clock a mightily-impressive 22.86 in the 200m.\n\nRead more Gatlin silences his critics with gold: 'I blocked out the boos'\n\nThat run took her from 13th place to fourth, her total of 3,838 points 67 off third-placed Yorgelis Rodriguez.\n\nIt was a fine way to finish a tough day, which had started well with a 13.33 clocking in the 100m hurdles, the second fastest time of her career. But there remains ground to make up.\n\nGermany's Carolin Schafer led on 4,036, ahead of Olympic champion and gold medal favourite Nafissatou Thiam of Belgium on 4,014.\n\nJohnson-Thompson was a star-struck 19-year-old at the 2012 Olympics but, after being dubbed Jessica Ennis-Hill's natural heir for so long, is now expected to deliver medals on the big stage.\n\nJohnson-Thompson struck a dejected figure after her high jump session (Getty)\n\nBut Saturday's high jump failure left the Liverpool athlete with an awful sense of deja vu, having seen her medal hopes at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing ended by three no-jumps in the long jump and her Olympic dreams last year crushed by poor throws, a sixth-placed finish reducing her to tears.\n\nSince returning from Brazil she has made drastic changes, splitting with her long-term coach Mike Holmes and leaving her home city of Liverpool to switch to a training base in Montpellier.\n\nReece Prescod was the only Briton to reach the 100m final, the 21-year-old coming home seventh in 10.17.\n\nPA\n\nMore about: World Athletics Championships Laura Muir Katarina Johnson-Thompson Reuse content", "eventUri": "eng-3338350",

Laura Muir got her London 2017 campaign off to a sensible start and kept alive her hopes of winning a medal in both the 1500m and 5,000m.\n\nFuelled by the instant porridge pots she carries everywhere Muir jogged over the line to finish fourth in her 1500m heat in 4min 08.97sec.\n\n\"I just wanted to get through it and save as much energy as I could,\" she said. \"I stayed out of harms way, so it's job done. It's great to get started because it feels like it's been a long time coming.\"\n\nMuir, right, took the lead with two laps to go and looked strong down the home straight, as did the fast finishing Sifan Hassan of Holland.\n\nThe Scotswoman's audacious double attempt could see her running five races over 10 days. She will contest the 1500m semi-final on Saturday in a bid to make Monday's final. There will then be just 72 hours before the heats of the 5,000m begin but Muir and her coach, Andy Young, have a meticulously planned recovery regime involving ice baths, compression socks and physiotherapy sessions.\n\nThe first heat was won by world record holder Genzebe Dibaba in 4:02.67. The Ethiopian edged Caster Semenya, who jogged over the line apparently with plenty more in hand.\n\nThe Olympic 800m champion Semenya surprised many by deciding to run over the longer distance as she has never broken four minutes but her easy qualification marked her out as a serious title contender. Debate continues to rage over the participation in these championships of Semenya, who has the condition hyperandrogenism, which causes naturally occurring but unusually high levels of testosterone in women.\n\nA study into hyperandrogenism commissioned by the IAAF and published last month reopened the debate on the issue and Semenya could be forced to undergo hormone replacement therapy if she wants to compete at future championships.\n\nDibaba has had to weather her own controversy, too, after her former coach, Jama Aden, was arrested by Spanish police when vials of EPO were found in the hotel he was staying at in Spain last year. Both women overtook Jess Judd down the home straight after the Britain bravely took the race out. Judd managed to hold onto the final qualifying spot, crossing the line in a personal best of 4:03.73.\n\nAnother Briton Laura Weightman, who is coached by Steve Cram, also qualified for the semi-final, finishing fifth in her heat in 4:03.50.

I'm really excited to be in the semi tomorrow.\"\n\nMuir received a rapturous response from the home crowd and teased them with the prospect she might produce a burst down the last straight before doing the sensible thing and easing down over the closing metres.\n\nThe Scot is getting used to the massive spike in interest over the past few months but is under no illusion that the hard work starts tonight.\n\n\"Women's 1,500m running is probably the best it's ever been and it's great to be running against these girls,\" she said. \"I'm just chuffed to be in the semi and hoping it goes well for a final on Monday.\"\n\nHopes that Muir can get among the medals remain high but Scots have already tasted medals joy, with the now retired Lee McConnell and current GB team captain Eilidh Doyle receiving retrospective medals after being part of the 4x400 metres relay teams edged off podiums by the disgraced Russians.\n\nMcConnell was part of the GB quartets at Berlin 2009 and Daegu 2011 who received belated bronze medals, with Doyle upgraded to silver for her role at Moscow 2013.\n\nMuir, meanwhile, will be joined by team-mates Laura Weightman, Sarah McDonald and Jessica Judd.\n\nJudd finished sixth in the first heat, which was won by champion Dibaba, in a personal best of 4:03.73.\n\nWeightman secured a fourth place in the third and final heat, running 4:03.50.\n\nMcDonald scraped through as a fastest loser after\n\nfinishing ninth, with a personal best of 4:05.48, in the third heat.\n\nJudd said: \"It was amazing, it was so, so good and to get a personal best was fantastic. And the crowd - I've never heard a cheer like that, ever. That really was the highlight of my year.\n\n\"The race was stacked and I was ranked tenth fastest going in, so I thought 'my goodness, this is going to be hard'.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Scotland's Nick

star-struck 19-year-old at the 2012 Olympics but, after being dubbed Jessica Ennis-Hill's natural heir for so long, is now expected to deliver medals on the big stage.\n\nBut Saturday's high jump failure left the Liverpool athlete with an awful sense of deja vu, having seen her medal hopes at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing ended by three no-jumps in the long jump and her Olympic dreams last year crushed by poor throws, a sixth-placed finish reducing her to tears.\n\nSince returning from Brazil she has made drastic changes, splitting with her long-term coach Mike Holmes and

One name that was new to the distance at a major tournament, but not the big track stage, was Caster Semenya. The South African was forced to run close to a personal best in her debut -- 4 minutes, 2.84 seconds -- in a fast heat that saw her toward the back of the pack for the first half of the race.\n\nSemenya's signature event is 800 meters and she plans to double up here even though athletes usually prefer to race their favored events first. Simpson questioned whether her rival could make an impact at the longer distance.\n\n\"When you run a one-off 1,500 meters, you can feel really confident and good, but they add up as you go through the rounds,\" Simpson said. \"So, if you don't have a lot of experience with that, it can be a bigger challenge than we know. We'll see how she handles it.\"\n\nThe field for the event is extremely strong, with world-record holder Genzebe Dibaba and Sifan Hassan, the fastest woman this year, among those through to the next round.\n\n\"If you look at the field, there's no head-on favorite,\" said Simpson, who finished second behind Hassan and was joined by teammates Kate Grace and Sara Vaughn in advancing to the next stage. \"Maybe Hassan on paper is the person with the highest credentials for 2017, and a lot of experience. Anything can happen.\n\n\"We have seen it before, when you think you can pick the top three and it gets jumbled up. I often do well under those circumstances so don't count me out.\"\n\nGreat Britain's Laura Muir was also optimistic and pleased to get through without any mishaps in Simpson's heat, which was slow but potentially dangerous because of bunching. Three other Britons also made it through, but Jessica Judd seemed to enjoy it the most -- recording a personal-best 4:03.73 to finish sixth in her heat after leading most of the way on debut.\n\n\"I've never heard a cheer like that,\" she said afterward. \"That is the highlight of my year, my life. ... I didn't expect to go off that hard. I normally go off my breathing, how I'm feeling, and I couldn't even hear it, so I thought I've just got to keep going.\"\n\nThe 1,500 semifinals take place Saturday, while the final is Monday.", "eventUri": "eng-3338350", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Simpson, Semenya, Muir advance to set up talent-rich 1,500 semis", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-05", "id": "15471000", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3338350", "time": "00:01:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "id": "233", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "id": "247", "location": {"label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "id": "86522", "location": {"label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304422"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304566"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athlete", "label": {"eng": "Athlete"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "308238"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310872"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500_metres", "label": {"eng": "1500 metres"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "325525"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/800_metres", "label": {"eng": "800 metres"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "358956"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caster_Semenya", "label": {"eng": "Caster Semenya"}, "type": "person", "id": "379256"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world_records_in_athletics", "label": {"eng": "List of world records in athletics"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "394893"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_World_Championships_in_Athletics", "label": {"eng": "2015 World Championships in Athletics"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "399432"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Simpson", "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Simpson"}, "type": "person", "id": "415653"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genzebe_Dibaba", "label": {"eng": "Genzebe Dibaba"}, "type": "person", "id": "460357"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Judd", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Judd"}, "type": "person", "id": "796497"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpsons_(department_store)", "label": {"eng": "Simpsons (department store)"}, "type": "org", "id": "812114"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_Britons", "label": {"eng": "Celtic Britons"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1272812"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Muir", "label": {"eng": "Laura Muir"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1290551"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sifan_Hassan", "label": {"eng": "Sifan Hassan"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1366578"}], "url": "http://www.espn.com/athletics/story/_/id/20250759", "timeCrawl": "00:01:00", "image": "http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0804%2Fr240044_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "location": {"label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "dateTime": "2017-08-05T00:01:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.5647059082984924}

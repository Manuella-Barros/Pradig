{"id": 223739334, "title": "Canada now &#8216;the outlier&#8217; in NATO on defence spending: U.S. ambassador", "text": "The United States\u2019 ambassador to Canada, David Cohen, says Canada is becoming \u201cthe outlier\u201d in NATO following a bipartisan letter from 23 American senators calling on Ottawa to meet the two per cent of GDP defence spending target. \u201cAt the end of 2024, the way projections are looking, Canada will be the only country in NATO that is not spending at least two per cent of its GDP on defence and does not have a plan to get there,\u201d Cohen said in an interview with The West Block host Mercedes Stephenson. \u201cCanada has moved within NATO from being a bit of an outlier to being the outlier in the entire alliance.\u201d In Canada\u2019s recent defence policy update, Defence Minister Bill Blair outlined plans for nearly $8 billion in spending for the Canadian Armed Forces over the next five years. However, this would only bring Canada\u2019s defence spending to 1.76 per cent of GDP. \u201cWe know that Canada needs to invest in other capabilities that are not yet included in this year\u2019s budget but are inevitably part of the investments that we\u2019re going to have to make,\u201d Blair said Thursday following the release of the letter. \u201cIt\u2019s important those investments are made well, it\u2019s important that we do the research to find out what exactly are the requirements of our armed forces.\u201d On Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau echoed the need to do more to ensure Canada\u2019s Arctic, \u201cNATO\u2019s western and northern flank,\u201d is protected. He called recent announcements on fighter jets and NORAD modernization \u201cwell received\u201d by the Americans. Blair pointed to exploring new purchases like submarines and air defence systems, both strategic priorities linked to improving continental defence as polar ice melts and Canada\u2019s northern coast faces pressure from Russian and Chinese vessels. Blair says once research around what is available on the market and associated costs is complete, he will bring spending plans to cabinet for approval. In the meantime, Cohen says the U.S. takes a more holistic look at Canada\u2019s defence commitments beyond just the NATO target, but feels more still needs to be done. \u201cWe look at their responsiveness, in particular in continental defence, on the Arctic and on NORAD modernization. We look at what they are doing in Ukraine. We look at what they\u2019ve done in their enhanced presence in Lithuania. We look at what they\u2019re doing in the Indo-Pacific,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThat does not mean that Canada is off the hook after the defence policy update. And I don\u2019t think Canada thinks it should be off the hook.\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has more recently expressed interest in greater involvement in the Indo-Pacific security partnership between the U.S., United Kingdom and Australia, known as AUKUS \u2014 something he dismissed when it was first announced. This alliance formed in 2021 to push back against increasing Chinese influence in the region. Trudeau at the time described AUKUS as \u201ca deal for nuclear submarines, which Canada is not currently or any time soon in the market for.\u201d Last month that alliance signalled it is open to admitting more partner nations. Canada is not currently eligible for the first pillar of this work, as it revolves around nuclear submarines \u2013 a military asset Canada does not have. However, Cohen says there could be a place for Canada in the second pillar that focuses on sharing military technology. \u201cCanada argues, and I think they are accurate in arguing, that they have technology expertise \u2014 developing technology, engineers, (and) scientists that are doing work that would be a value to the to the AUKUS partnership as part of pillar two,\u201d Cohen said. With the States taking a broader look at Canada\u2019s defence commitments that Cohen mentioned earlier, he says Canada\u2019s return to being seen as a reliable international partner is in progress. \u201cAll of that makes Canada a more credible international partner in all of these defence spaces, including AUKUS,\u201d Cohen said.", "summary": "U.S. Ambassador to Canada David Cohen says  Canada has become an outlier in NATO on defence spending, but Ottawa is rebuilding the nation's reputation as a reliable partner.", "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10522956/david-cohen-nato-canada-us/", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023050316050-6452bdb361b89ab282f50167jpeg-2.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:30:47", "author": "David Baxter", "authors": ["David Baxter"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": 0.131}

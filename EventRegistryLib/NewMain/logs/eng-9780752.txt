What better time is there to get sucked back into this twisted K-drama than Christmas?!\n\nEven though that means the return is still a few months away -- here's what to watch this month while you wait -- creator and director Hwang Dong-hyuk has promised that \"Squid Game\" season 2 will be 'worth the wait' (via Tudum).\n\nIf that news has you excited, you'll be pleased to know that we've got more \"Squid Game\" to look forward to, as Netflix has already confirmed that season 3 (which will be the show's last outing) is on the cards. And in even better news, we won't have to wait another three years to watch it, as \"Squid Game\" season 3 is coming to Netflix at some point in 2025!\n\nAll this news was confirmed in a short trailer which plays out like a track meet gone wrong. In the clip, some runners take off from their marks, but they're overtaken by a number of folk sporting the classic \"Squid Game\" green tracksuits.\n\nContestants start tumbling to the ground as more panicked runners leave them for dead... and then we're passed over to the Front Man, who asks if we want to play again. Check it out below:\n\nAlong with the announcement, Netflix shared a new image from the series (seen above), and revealed that Dong-hyuk has penned a letter (shared on X/Twitter) revealing just how excited he is to be revisiting his world.\n\n\"It's been almost three years since Season 1 was met with incredible response around the world and many unimaginable events took place. I am beyond excited to be writing this letter to announce the date for Season 2 and share the news of Season 3, the final season. On the first day we began shooting Season 2, I remember thinking, \"Wow, I can't believe I'm back in the world of Squid Game.\" It almost felt surreal. I wonder how it will feel for you to be back in Squid Game after three years, as well.\"\n\n\"I am thrilled to see the seed that was planted in creating a new \"Squid Game\" grow and bear fruit through the end of this story. We;ll do our best to make sure we bring you yet another thrill ride. I hope you're excited for what's to come. Thank you, always, and see you soon, everyone\", he added.\n\nWe've had precious little info about the new season thus far, but along with this update, we've also got a \"Squid Game\" season 2 synopsis to work with, and it sounds like our winner Gi-hun (\"The Acolyte\" star Lee Jung-jae) is about to be put through the wringer all over again.\n\nIt reads: \"Three years after winning Squid Game, Player 456 remains determined to find the people behind the game and put an end to their vicious sport. Using this fortune to fund his search, Seong Gi-hun starts with the most obvious of places: look for the main in a sharp suit playing ddakji in the subway. But when his efforts finally yield results, the path toward taking down the organization proves to be deadlier than he imagined: to end the game, he needs to re-enter it.\"\n\nIn addition to starring Lee Jung-jae, the series also features the return of the villainous Front Man (Lee Byung-hun) and Recruiter (Gong Yoo), and detective Hwang Jun-ho (Wi Ha-jun).\n\nAnd given the fate of everyone else who entered the last Squid Game, it should come as no surprise that the new series boasts a number of new stars, including Yim Si-wan, Kang Ha-neul, Park Gyu-young, Park Sung-hoon, Jo Yu-ri, Yang Dong-geun, Kang Ae-sim, Lee David, Lee Jin-suk, Choi Seung-hyun, Roh Jae-won and Won Ji-an.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Netflix hasn't revealed any info about who these stars will play, though given some of the subplots from season 1, I'd wager there's going to be some heart-wrenching stuff weaved into Gi-hun's quest in \"Squid Game\" season 2.", "source": {"uri": "tomsguide.com", "dataType":

He joins 455 other desperate players at a secret location, all under constant surveillance by masked guards in pink jumpsuits, with the games run by the mysterious Front Man.

After Netflix revealed the long-awaited premiere date for Season 2 of the Korean drama, the streamer also announced that the third and final season will premiere sometime in 2025. Squid Game premiered in 2021 and followed 456 people who receive mysterious invitations to participate in rounds of children's games for a cash prize that will change their lives. However, if they lose, they die.\n\nThe series captivated the world when it debuted and became Netflix's most-watched series in just a few weeks. While discussions for a second season started up not long after the premiere, it took Netflix a year to confirm that Squid Game Season 2 was on the way. Even though it's taken over three years for Season 2 to finally premiere on Netflix come December, Season 3 will not take nearly as long.\n\nIn a letter shared by Netflix, writer, director, and executive producer Hwang Dong-hyuk wrote, \"It's been almost three years since Season 1 was met with incredible response around the world and many unimaginable events took place. I am beyond excited to be writing this letter to announce the date for Season 2 and share the news of Season 3, the final season. On the first day we began shooting Season 2, I remember thinking, 'Wow, I can't believe I'm back in the world of Squid Game.' It almost felt surreal. I wonder how it will feel for you to be back in Squid Game after three years, as well. Seong Gi-hun who vowed revenge at the end of Season 1 returns and joins the game again. Will he succeed in getting his revenge?\"\n\n\"Front Man doesn't seem to be an easy opponent this time either,\" Dong-hyuk continued. \"The fierce clash between their two worlds will continue into the series finale with Season 3, which will be brought to you next year. I am thrilled to see the seed that was planted in creating a new Squid Game grow and bear fruit through the end of this story. We'll do our best to make sure we bring you yet another thrill ride. I hope you're excited for what's to come. Thank you, always, and see you soon, everyone.\"\n\nAs for details surrounding the final season, that will likely be on hold until after Season 2 drops, again given any story set ups and casting changes. A premiere date may also not come until after Season 2, but the wait will surely be worth it. It also gives fans the time to say goodbye to Squid Game and prepare for any more intense games that may be on the way.\n\nThe third and final season of Squid Game is still a bit far away, but the second season will be here on Dec. 26, and after waiting for three years, the wait will be worth it. In the meantime, the first season of Squid Game, along with reality show spinoff Squid Game: The Challenge, are streaming on Netflix. Now would be a great time to refresh your memory on Squid Game before the final two seasons are here, because they will be premiering before you know it.", "source": {"uri": "popculture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebrity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwang_Dong-hyuk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hwang Dong-hyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Korean drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian_(season_2)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian (season 2)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...?_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "What If...?

The second season will premiere on 26 December 2024.\n\nBut that's not all - the streaming giant also revealed that the third and final season will arrive in 2025. This will bring the gripping tale to a close.\n\nSquid Game took the world by storm when it premiered in mid-September 2021, according to Daily Mail.\n\nThe first season quickly became Netflix's biggest show ever. It racked up over 1.65 billion viewing hours in the first 28 days.\n\nMore than 100 million Netflix accounts watched it, solidifying its place in television history with a record-breaking achievement.\n\nThe show even inspired a reality competition series, Squid Game: The Challenge.\n\nNetflix marked the announcement with an Olympics-themed teaser, according to Deadline.\n\nThe trailer begins with a seemingly ordinary track and field race.\n\nAs the starter pistol fires, competitors sprint down the track.\n\nSuddenly, familiar green jumpsuit-wearing contestants from Squid Game overtake them.\n\nChaos ensues as some fall to the ground while others keep running. The trailer ends with the enigmatic Front Man, portrayed by Lee Byung-hun, asking, \"It's been three years. Do you want to play again?\"\n\nThe release date for Season 2 then appears, igniting excitement among fans.\n\nSquid Game follows a deadly contest where 456 individuals, all in desperate financial straits, compete in children's games with lethal twists.\n\nThe prize? A life-changing sum of money. Season 1 centred on Seong Gi-hun, a divorced gambling addict played by Lee Jung-jae.\n\nGi-hun emerges as the victor but remains deeply traumatised by the horrifying events.\n\nHe vows to find and stop those running the game.\n\n\"Seong Gi-hun, who vowed revenge at the end of Season 1, returns and joins the game again,\" teased series creator Hwang Dong-hyuk.\n\n\"Will he succeed in getting his revenge? Front Man doesn't seem to be an easy opponent this time either.\n\nThe fierce clash between their two worlds will continue into the series finale with Season 3 of Squid Game, which will be brought to you next year.\"\n\nLee Jung-jae will reprise his role as Gi-hun, alongside Lee Byung-hun as Front Man, Gong Yoo as The Recruiter, and Wi Ha-joon as Detective Hwang Jun-ho.\n\nJun-ho's fate was left uncertain after being shot by his brother, Front Man, and falling off a cliff in Season 1.\n\nThe announcement hints at his survival, adding more intrigue to the upcoming seasons, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nIn a heartfelt letter to fans, Hwang Dong-hyuk expressed his excitement and gratitude.\n\n\"It's been almost three years since Season 1 was met with an incredible response around the world and many unimaginable events took place,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I am beyond excited to announce the date for Season 2 and share the news of Season 3, the final season.\"\n\nReflecting on the journey, he added, \"On the first day we began shooting Season 2, I remember thinking, 'Wow, I can't believe I'm back in the world of Squid Game.'\n\nIt almost felt surreal. I wonder how it will feel for you to be back in Squid Game after three years, as well.\"\n\nThe creator promised fans another thrilling experience.\n\n\"I am thrilled to see the seed that was planted in creating a new Squid Game grow and bear fruit through the end of this story.\n\nWe'll do our best to bring you yet another thrill ride.\"\n\nWith Season 2 just around the corner and the promise of a dramatic finale in Season 3, \"Squid Game\" continues to captivate audiences worldwide.\n\nAs Hwang Dong-hyuk concluded, \"I hope you're excited for what's to come.

Using this fortune to fund his search, Gi-hun starts with the most obvious of places: look for the man in a sharp suit playing ddakji in the subway. But when his efforts finally yield results, the path toward taking down the organization proves to be deadlier than he imagined: to end the game, he needs to re-enter it.\n\nDirector Hwang Dong-hyuk, who made history at the 74th Primetime Emmys becoming the first Asian to win Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series, once again helms the series as director, writer, and producer.

We also won't have to wait as long for Season 3 which is slated for a 2025 release. Season 3 will be the final season. Here's the trailer:\n\nThe official Season 2 description reads:\n\n\"Three years after winning Squid Game, Player 456 remains determined to find the people behind the game and put an end to their vicious sport. Using this fortune to fund his search, Gi-hun starts with the most obvious of places: look for the man in a sharp suit playing ddakji in the subway. But when his efforts finally yield results, the path toward taking down the organization proves to be deadlier than he imagined: to end the game, he needs to re-enter it.\"\n\nIn a statement from director, writer and executive producer of Squid Game, Hwang Dong-hyuk, he writes:\n\nIt's been almost three years since Season 1 was met with incredible response around the world and many unimaginable events took place. I am beyond excited to be writing this letter to announce the date for Season 2 and share the news of Season 3, the final season.\n\nOn the first day we began shooting Season 2, I remember thinking, \"Wow, I can't believe I'm back in the world of Squid Game.\" It almost felt surreal. I wonder how it will feel for you to be back in Squid Game after three years, as well.\n\nSeong Gi-hun who vowed revenge at the end of Season 1 returns and joins the game again. Will he succeed in getting his revenge? Front Man doesn't seem to be an easy opponent this time either. The fierce clash between their two worlds will continue into the series finale with Season 3, which will be brought to you next year.\n\nI am thrilled to see the seed that was planted in creating a new Squid Game grow and bear fruit through the end of this story.\n\nWe'll do our best to make sure we bring you yet another thrill ride. I hope you're excited for what's to come. Thank you, always, and see you soon, everyone.\n\nI enjoyed Season 1 of Squid Game (though I'm not sure enjoyed is the right word for something so utterly bleak) but I did have a few problems with it, especially the later episodes and the surprise twist at the end. Still, I'm excited for a new season and happy that we don't have too much longer to wait.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Witcher (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_Kai", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cobra Kai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Korean language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwang_Dong-hyuk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hwang Dong-hyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_finale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Series finale"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Word_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Word Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby_Showers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby Showers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66aacaa0263e20bfd887dd11/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780752", "eventUri": "eng-9780752", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-26", "textStart": 327, "textEnd": 340}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

It will follow the hero as he abandons his plans to go to the United States. Instead, he begins a chase with an important motive.\n\nIf you remember in season one [SPOILER ALERT], Seong Gi-hun was buried in debt when he received an invitation to the games. After winning the game in spectacular fashion, he is determined to make those responsible for the dark and deadly competition pay for their atrocities.\n\nLee Jung-jae obviously returns as Seong Gi-hun and is joined by the Lee Byung-hun who plays Front Man, the game's leader, Wi Ha-jun, who plays Hwang Jun-ho, a detective who sneaks into the game in search of his brother and Gong Yoo, who plays the Recruiter, who initially invited Gi-hun to play the game.\n\nNew players includes Yim Si-wan, Kang Ha-Neul, Park Sung-hoon and Yang Dong-geun as well as Park Gyu-young, Jo Yu-ri, Kang Ae-sim, Lee David, Lee Jin-uk, Choi Seung-hyun, Roh Jae-won and Won Ji-an.\n\nSeason 3 is understood to have been filmed back-to-back with Season 2, allowing Netflix to launch it in 2025, a much smaller wait for fans than the three years between the first two seasons.\n\nThe series is produced by Firstman Studio with Kim Ji-yeon also exec producing.\n\n\"It's been almost three years since Season 1 was met with incredible response around the world and many unimaginable events took place,\" Hwang Dong-hyuk wrote in a letter (see below). \"On the first day we began shooting Season 2, I remember thinking 'Wow, I can't believe I'm back in the world of Squid Game'.

Those are the only words spoken in the teaser trailer for Squid Game season 2, but the trailer still includes two really important bits of information: the launch date, which is a very festive December 26, 2024, and the fact that Squid Game season 3 is also happening and coming in 2025.\n\nHere's what we know so far about the return of one of the best Netflix shows.\n\nDirector Hwang Dong-hyuk says that Squid Game season 2 will be \"worth the wait\". Season 2 will pick up after Gi-hun's jaw-dropping decisions in the season 1 finale, with player 456 determined to discover who's behind the vicious games and bring an end to their \"sport\".\n\nAccording to the official synopsis: \"Gi-hun starts with the most obvious of places: look for the man in a sharp suit playing ddakji in the subway. But when his efforts finally yield results, the path toward taking down the organization proves to be deadlier than he imagined: to end the game, he needs to re-enter it.\"\n\nThe second season of Squid Game will feature many familiar faces. Netflix says that Lee Jung-jae, Lee Byung-hun, Gong Yoo, and Wi Ha-jun are back, and there will be plenty of \"colorful new characters\" too: Newcomers Yim Si-wan, Kang Ha-neul, Park Gyu-young, Park Sung-hoon, Jo Yu-ri, Yang Dong-geun, Kang Ae-sim, Lee David, Lee Jin-uk, Choi Seung-hyun, Roh Jae-won, and Won Ji-an.\n\nAs before, the award-winning Hwang Dong-hyuk writes and executive produces as well as directs. And he promises that this second season will be \"even more joyful to the global audience\".\n\nNetflix and Hwang Dong-hyuk can't really say much about Squid Game season 3 because they don't want to spoil the story of season 2, which will most likely have a shocking finale or cliffhanger to set the scene for the third instalment. However, Hwang is \"beyond excited\" and says that \"the fierce clash between [Gi-hun and Front Man's] two worlds will continue into the series finale with season 3, which will be brought to you next year\".", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carrie_marshall@techradar.com", "name": "Carrie Marshall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_Playlist", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hospital Playlist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwang_Dong-hyuk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hwang Dong-hyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ddakji", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ddakji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo_Yu-ri", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jo Yu-ri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Gyu-young", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Park Gyu-young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.O.P", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.O.P"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi_Ha-joon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wi Ha-joon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Sung-hoon_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Park Sung-hoon (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Dong-geun", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yang Dong-geun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Im_Si-wan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Im Si-wan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kang_Ha-neul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kang Ha-neul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Byung-hun", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Byung-hun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_David", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee David"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gong_Yoo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gong Yoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby_Showers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby Showers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cZHe6TADw5STdDmESztCY9-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780752", "eventUri": "eng-9780752", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

There have been rumors for a long time that the series filmed the second and third seasons back to back to reduce the time in between. Based on these announcements, this could very well be accurate.\n\nIn a statement shared via social media, creator Hwang Dong-hyuk had the following to say about the big announcement:\n\n\"It's been almost three years since Season 1 was met with incredible response around the world and many unimaginable events took place ... On the first day we began shooting Season 2, I remember thinking 'Wow, I can't believe I'm back in the world of Squid Game'. It almost felt surreal. I wonder how it will feel for you to be back in Squid Game after three years as well.\n\n\"Seong Gi-hun who vowed revenge at the end of Season 1 returns and joins the game again. Will he succeed in getting his revenge? Front Man doesn't seem to be an easy opponent this time either.

I am thrilled to see that the seed that was planted in creating a new Squid Game grow and bear fruit through the end of this story. We'll do our best to make sure we bring you yet another thrill ride.\"\n\nOf course, even though season 3 will be the end here, we have a hard time envisioning that it is the end for the franchise globally. There is a ton to consider here! The show may have international adaptations, and there is also the reality show Squid Game: The Challenge at the same time.\n\nBe sure to share right now in the attached comments!

Series creator Hwang Dong-hyuk is excited about the show's continuation with Squid Game season 2 and its eventual conclusion. Squid Game season 2 will introduce new players and games as Gi-hun seeks to take down the operation.\n\nSquid Game is set to end with season 3, Netflix confirms. Three years since the South Korean series blew up and became a global hit on the streaming platform, all eyes are on the continuation of Seong Gi-hun's (Lee Jung-jae) story after winning in the Squid Game season 1 finale. Set for a December 2024 release, season 2 will not only see the return of familiar faces but will also introduce new players partaking in the underground operation. While it's still uncertain what lies ahead for its sophomore year, Netflix went ahead and confirmed the show's fate beyond season 2.\n\nAlongside confirmation of its December 2024 return, a new Netflix video announcement about the show also confirms that Squid Game season 3 will release in 2025 and wrap up the series. Watch the clip below:\n\nAside from the video, Squid Game creator Hwang Dong-hyuk also commented on the decision to end the series with a fan letter (via Variety). He shares that he is excited for season 2, but also looking forward to its overall ending, saying:\n\n\"I am thrilled to see the seed that was planted in creating a new Squid Game grow and bear fruit through the end of this story.\"\n\nWhy Netflix Is Ending Squid Game With Season 3 Having 2 Additional Seasons Of Squid Game Is Already A Treat Close\n\nInspired by South Korea's penchant for game shows, Squid Game started with 456 players vying for the prize. Initially, they seemed to play harmless, traditional children's games, only to realize that each one had a deadly twist. The show garnered worldwide acclaim, but its road to getting on the platform wasn't easy. The project was years in the making, and originally, Hwang only planned for the show to have one season. This was despite the cliffhanger ending of season 1, where Gi-Hun turns around and decides to seek revenge on those who run the operation.\n\nOnce his story is done, it is difficult to keep Squid Game going beyond season 3, especially if Gi-hun succeeds in exposing the illegal competition.\n\nConsidering how big it got and the obvious narrative opening for a sequel, Netflix decided on doing Squid Game season 2. The new year will tackle Gi-hun's plan to take down the deadly operation. The sophomore year is also confirmed to introduce new kinds of games, as well as fresh players. It's unclear how Gi-hun fits into this aspect of the narrative at this point, but it's expected that he will once again be involved. Once his story is done, it is difficult to keep Squid Game going beyond season 3, especially if Gi-hun succeeds in exposing the illegal competition.\n\nUltimately, it's best that Netflix follows Hwang's current vision for Squid Game. Forcing an extension risks watering down what is arguably one of the most creative TV shows in the last few years. It's better for the show to have a proper ending, rather than stretching it up to its breaking point.\n\nSource: Netflix, Variety\n\nSquid Game 4.0 TV-MAAdventureDramaAction Where to WatchSeasonAllSeason 1 streamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\n*Availability in US\n\nIn Squid Game, a mysterious invitation to join a competition is sent to people at risk who are in dire need of money. Four hundred fifty-six participants from all walks of life are locked into a secret location where they play games to win 45.6 billion won. Games are selected from traditional Korean children's games, such as Red Light and Green Light, but the consequence of losing is death. To survive, competitors must choose their alliances carefully - but the further they go in the competition, the more likely betrayal will rear its ugly head.\n\nCast Wi Ha-joon , Anupam Tripathi , Oh Yeong-su , Heo Sung-tae , Park Hae-soo , Jung Ho-yeon , Lee Jung-jae , Kim Joo-ryoung Release Date September 17, 2021 Seasons 1 Streaming Service(s) Netflix Writers Hwang Dong-hyuk", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwang_Dong-hyuk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hwang Dong-hyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Squid_Game_characters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of Squid Game characters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Lucas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Game show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Yeong-su_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O Yeong-su (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Joo-ryoung", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Joo-ryoung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heo_Sung-tae", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heo Sung-tae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anupam_Tripathi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anupam Tripathi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HoYeon_Jung", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HoYeon Jung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi_Ha-joon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wi Ha-joon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Hae-soo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Park Hae-soo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Korean language"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/front-man-in-squid-game-season-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780752", "eventUri": "eng-9780752", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-09-", "textStart": 4180, "textEnd": 4192}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Now, its second season finally has a release date, and its third (and final) was given a release window as well.\n\nToday, the team behind Squid Game announced via a teaser trailer that the show's second season will premiere on Netflix on December 26. The trailer also revealed that the series has been renewed for a third and final season, which is slated to premiere in 2025.\n\nThe season's official description reads: \"Three years after winning Squid Game, Player 456 remains determined to find the people behind the game and put an end to their vicious sport. Using this fortune to fund his search, Gi-hun starts with the most obvious of places: look for the man in a sharp suit playing ddakji in the subway. But when his efforts finally yield results, the path toward taking down the organization proves to be deadlier than he imagined: to end the game, he needs to re-enter it.\"\n\nThe announcement also came alongside a message from the show's creator, Hwang Dong-hyuk, posted on X/Twitter. \"On the first day we began shooting Season 2, I remember thinking, 'Wow, I can't believe I'm back in the world of Squid Game,' \" he wrote. \"It almost felt surreal. I wonder how it will feel for you to be back in Squid Game after three years, as well.\"\n\nSquid Game's second season was initially confirmed in 2021, although it was not given a release window. Last year, lead actor Lee Jung-jae called Season 2 \"bigger in scale\" and said it would take longer to complete. While not much else is known about what might take place in Season 2, its cast was revealed last year, hinting at the possible return of a character whose fate was left uncertain.\n\nAmelia Zollner is a freelance writer at IGN who loves all things indie and Nintendo.

Season 1 of Squid Game was a major success, winning multiple Emmy Awards and breaking viewing records. Fans can hope for an official release date and possibly a trailer for Squid Game Season 2 to drop soon.\n\nOne of the biggest Netflix shows of all time, which has Season 2 on the way, just got a mysterious tease. The official Netflix X account posted a billboard with a square, triangle, and circle on it, the same symbols seen on the masks worn by workers in Squid Game who wear them to maintain anonymity. Everything that Netflix does is calculated; the official account wouldn't post this without it meaning something, and it most likely means news for Squid Game Season 2, possibly an official release date and maybe even the first trailer, could be coming sooner rather than later. Squid Game Season 1 is far and away the most viewed non-English series in Netflix history, with more than 2.2 billion hours viewed. For reference, the number two series, Money Heist, has just over 700 million hours viewed, 1/3 of Squid Game Season 1.\n\nThe first season of Squid Games won six Emmy Awards, with both Lee Jung-jae and Lee Yoo-mi winning for Best Lead Actor and Best Guest Actress, respectively, and the series also claiming gold for Best Directing, Production Design, Stunt Performance, and even Visual Effects. The series received eight other nominations, but bringing home 6/14 is still an impressive total to hang a hat on. Squid Game Season 1 was beloved by critics and audiences upon release, registering an impressive score of 95% from the former and a slightly-lower but still impressive rating of 84% from the latter on Rotten Tomatoes. The series was such a success for Netflix it even spawned a reality spin-off, Squid Game: The Challenge, which also performed exceedingly well for the streamer.\n\nWhat Kind of 'Squid Game' Season 2 New Could Be Coming Soon?\n\nThe most likely answer as to what this mysterious post could be teasing is an official release date, which will almost certainly accompany either a short teaser trailer, or a batch of images showcasing the first look at Squid Game Season 2. After the success of the first season of Squid Game, Netflix is surely ready to get Season 2 out as quickly as possible without skipping any crucial marketing phases. The earlier the first trailer drops, the closer we'll be to the series' return, and Netflix wouldn't have posted that caption-less photo if Squid Game Season 2 news wasn't closer than we think.\n\nSquid Game Season 2 will premiere this December, but has not yet nailed down an official release date. Check out the ominous post above, stay tuned to Collider for future updates, and stream the first season of Squid Game exclusively on Netflix.\n\nSquid Game\n\n010\n\nTV-MA\n\nAdventure\n\nDrama\n\nAction\n\nHundreds of cash-strapped players accept a strange invitation to compete in children's games.

Do you want to play again?\"\n\nThe release date is then confirmed as Thursday 26th December - but that's not all. In even further exciting news, it's also revealed that the final season of Squid Game will be coming out in 2025.\n\nYou can watch the date announcement video for yourself below.\n\nIt's been a long time coming for fans of the dystopian drama series, which rose to worldwide acclaim after its release in 2021.\n\nThe series certainly became part of the cultural zeitgeist, spawning many a Halloween costume, social media trend and of course, a reality spin-off series involving real-life contestants.\n\nBut nothing quite beats the original, and it's set to be a series all about revenge as we follow Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), aka player 456, as he sets out on a mission to find the people behind the revered games in a bid to put an end to them.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe official synopsis for season 2 reads: \"Three years after winning Squid Game, Player 456 remains determined to find the people behind the game and put an end to their vicious sport.

The confirmed new cast members include Si-wan, Kang Ha-neul, Park Gyu-young, Lee Jin-uk, Park Sung-hoon, Yang Dong-geun, Kang Ae-sim, Lee David, Choi Seung-hyun, Roh Jae-won, Jo Yu-ri, and Won Ji-an.\n\nOf course, director Hwang Dong-hyuk is back at the series helm once again after achieving major success with season 1 and making awards history at the Emmys after becoming the first Asian person to win Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series.\n\nNews of the final season will surely also come as a surprise to fans, as nothing of the sort has been confirmed until now, but Dong-hyuk revealed the news in a letter to fans.\n\nIn the letter, the series writer, director and executive producer wrote: \"On the first day we began shooting season 2, I remember thinking 'Wow, I can't believe I'm back in the world of Squid Game.' It almost felt surreal. I wonder how it will feel for you to be back in Squid Game after three years, as well.\"\n\nHe went on: \"Seong Gi-hun who vowed revenge at the end of season 1 returns and joins the game again. Will he succeed in getting his revenge? Front Man doesn't seem to be an easy opponent this time either. The fierce clash between their two worlds will continue into the series finale with season 3, which will be brought to you next year.\"\n\nAnd it certainly seems like there's plenty of thrilling twists to come, as Squid Game star Lee Jung-jae revealed exclusively to RadioTimes.com in an interview to promote his recent role in Disney Plus Star Wars series The Acolyte.\n\nHe revealed: \"One thing I felt while reading the script is that there's an even deeper emotion that's discovered within season 2,\" he said. \"And I think the audience will feel like, 'Where is this story going?' because there are so many twists and turns that happen.\"", "source": {"uri": "radiotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "morgan_cormack@radiotimes.com",

The show's success as Netflix's most-watched series showcases appeal of international content.\n\nNetflix has officially announced that the highly anticipated second season of Squid Game will premiere on December 26. In an exciting development for fans, the streaming giant also confirmed that the popular Korean drama has been renewed for a third and final season, set to debut in 2025. The announcement was made through a special video release, which also featured a heartfelt letter from series creator, director, and executive producer Hwang Dong-hyuk. In his letter, Hwang expressed his excitement and gratitude for the show's journey. He wrote, \"I am thrilled to see the seed that was planted in creating a new Squid Game grow and bear fruit through the end of this story.\"\n\nSeason 2 will see the return of Lee Jung-jae as the protagonist, Player 456, alongside Lee Byung-hun, Wi Ha-jun, and Gong Yoo. The cast expansion includes new faces such as Yim Si-wan, Kang Ha-neul, Park Gyu-young, and more, promising to add a new angle with added intrigue to the series. According to the official description, the story picks up three years after Gi-hun's victory in the deadly games. Consumed by a desire to dismantle the sinister organisation behind the games, Gi-hun uses his newfound wealth to hunt down the elusive figure who recruits participants by playing ddakji in the subway. However, as he delves deeper, he discovers that the path to ending the games is fraught with even greater dangers, forcing him to re-enter the lethal competition.\n\nHow Successful Has 'Squid Game' Been?\n\nThe first season of Squid Game centered on a group of 456 participants, all struggling with severe financial difficulties, who are invited to partake in a series of children's games for a substantial cash prize. However, these seemingly innocent games come with a deadly twist: losing a game results in the player's death. The competition is held in a remote, secret location, managed by masked guards under the supervision of a mysterious overseer known as the Front Man.\n\nSquid Game has been a cultural phenomenon, becoming Netflix's most-watched series with record-breaking viewership. The first season garnered 14 Emmy nominations and secured six wins, including Best Director for Hwang Dong-hyuk and Best Actor in a Drama Series for Lee Jung-jae. The show's success has not only highlighted the appeal of international content but also opened the door for more diverse storytelling in mainstream media.\n\nSquid Game returns to Netflix on December 26.

The Netflix Korean drama made waves after its debut in September 2021 and quickly became the streamer's most-watched series. While discussions for a second season started not long after its launch, Netflix didn't actually confirm Season 2 until a year later. The platform has officially revealed that Season 2 of Squid Game will premiere on Dec. 26.\n\nIn January, Netflix teased that Squid Game Season 2 was coming at some point in 2024. While the season will be premiering at basically the end of 2024, it is premiering this year nonetheless, so they weren't wrong. Fans have waited a few years already, so a few more months won't be too bad. While not too much is known about Season 2, the teaser previews that more deadly and intense games are in play.\n\nStarring Lee Jung-jae, Park Hae-soo, Wi Ha-joon, Jung Ho-yeon, O Yeong-su, Heo Sung-tae, Anupam Tripathi, and Kim Joo-ryoung, Squid Game centers around a group of 456 people who accept a mysterious invitation to participate in rounds of children's games for a cash prize. The only kicker is that if you lose, you die. Jung-jae and Ha-joon will be returning for Season 2, along with Gong Yoo and Lee Byung-hun. Season 2 will also include Im Si-wan, Kang Ha-neul, Park Sung-hoo, Yang Dong-geun, and Jo Yu-ri, among others.\n\nNetflix has long been teasing Squid Game Season 2, with the first trailer dropping last summer. The streamer eventually released a first look at Season 2 in February, likely making fans even more anxious for more. While an end-of-the-year release date is not ideal, the fact that it is releasing this year is better than nothing.

That may be because Squid Game goes further than most Korean dramas by forcing viewers to look at a dystopian interpretation of our capitalist society that brings to light issues we can perceive in our modern day-to-day reality.\n\nCreator Hwang Dong-hyuk has shown a clear vision of what he wishes his story to achieve. Hence why, not only are fans waiting three years to witness the continuation of Seong Gi-hun's quest to put an end to the vicious life-or-death games, but there won't be an indefinite number of seasons to reap the most money out of a successful IP. Oftentimes it is better to know when and how to end a story than to perpetuate it because of the buzz it generates.\n\nWith its most recent announcement, Squid Game appears to indicate it does not intend for its narrative to dilly-dally and shed its quality in the process.\n\nSquid Game season 2 arrives on Netflix before the year's end, the day before Christmas, on Dec. 26, 2024. Season 2 sees the return of cast members Lee Jung-jae, Lee Byung-hun, Gong Yoo, and Wi Ha-jun, in addition to welcoming a host of new faces including Yim Si-wan, Kang Ha-neul, Park Gyu-young, Park Sung-hoon, Jo Yu-ri, Yang Dong-geun, Kang Ae-sim, Lee David, Lee Jin-uk, Choi Seung-hyun, Roh Jae-won, and Won Ji-an.\n\nWith the release of the newest teaser trailer, Netflix not only announced Squid Game's highly-anticipated return but also that the massively popular series will be comprised of three seasons only, with the third and final one coming in 2025.\n\nIn a letter announcing the news, director Hwang wrote:\n\n\"Seong Gi-hun who vowed revenge at the end of Season 1 returns and joins the game again. Will he succeed in getting his revenge? Front Man doesn't seem to be an easy opponent this time either.

But it took 12 days for 'Squid Game' to become the most popular Netflix series ever,\" Hwang Dong-hyuk's said in June 2022.\n\nNow, three years since the first season dropped, we officially have a return date-and an update on season three.\n\nIf you've been wondering when Squid Game will return to screens, your patience has finally been rewarded with a date. Squid Game season two will drop on Netflix on Boxing Day 2024. Yep, December 26, 2024. Put it in your calendars!\n\nThree years after winning Squid Game, Player 456 remains determined to find the people behind the game and put an end to their vicious sport.

Wi Ha-jun will also return as Hwang Jun-ho (policeman and brother of the Masked Front Man) is confirmed to have survived after it appeared he was shot by the gamemaker in season one.\n\nGong Yoo will also reprise their role as the Salesman.\n\nMeanwhile, new cast members include Yim Si-wan, Kang Ha-neul, Park Gyu-young, Lee Jin-uk, Park Sung-hoon, Yang Dong-geun, Kang Ae-sim, Lee David, Choi Seung-hyun, Roh Jae-won, Jo Yu-ri, and Won Ji-an rounding out the ensemble cast.\n\nSpoiler alert! Proceed with caution if you haven't seen the first season.\n\nThe last season ended with Seong Gi-hun (played by Lee Jung-jae) winning the game and taking home the hefty pay cheque.\n\nWe also witnessed the devastating deaths of multiple characters including, but not limited to Kang Sae-byeok (number 067 played by Jung Ho-yeon), and Abdul Ali (number 199 played by Anupam Tripathi).\n\nTraumatised and wanting to avenge their deaths somehow, Seong Gi-hun seeks to uncover those behind the violent game and expose them to the world.\n\nAt the end of the series, he dials a number given to another person who had been lured by a recruiter to enter the game -- perhaps the second season will reveal exactly who is on the other end of that call.", "source": {"uri": "elle.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "ELLE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jess_pullar@elle.com.au", "name": "Jess Pullar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwang_Dong-hyuk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hwang Dong-hyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Squid_Game_characters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of Squid Game characters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Korean language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo_Yu-ri", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jo Yu-ri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Won_Ji-an", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Won Ji-an"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Gyu-young", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Park Gyu-young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anupam_Tripathi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anupam Tripathi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HoYeon_Jung", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HoYeon Jung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.O.P", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.O.P"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi_Ha-joon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wi Ha-joon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Sung-hoon_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Park Sung-hoon (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Dong-geun", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yang Dong-geun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Im_Si-wan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Im Si-wan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kang_Ha-neul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kang Ha-neul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Byung-hun", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Byung-hun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_David", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee David"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_cast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ensemble cast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gong_Yoo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gong Yoo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/1633089329744_social.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780752", "eventUri": "eng-9780752", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Source: A still from the series\n\nNetflix has announced the release date of the second season of \"The Squid Game\" series, which became a sensation in 2021. It will premiere on December 26, 2024, shortly before the New Year.\n\nNetflix also showed the trailer for the second season on YouTube. The video is concise but verbose: the fight for the reward will be fierce and not everyone will reach the goal alive.\n\nThe movie company also announced the approximate release date of the third season - 2025. It is supposed to be the final one. Probably, this is the reason why the filming of the series started a long time ago and dragged on for several years.\n\nIn the center of the plot, the main character Song Gi Hoon (Player 456), a loser who has fallen into debt, has to fulfill his mission: to track down and stop the depraved people on the other side of the game. He finds a man who lures him into the subway at the beginning of the first season, as it is the only way to get behind the scenes.\n\nHowever, to do so, he will have to re-enter the deadly game.\n\nIn particular, Netflix published a letter from Squid Game director Hwang Dong-hyuk:\n\n\"It's been almost three years since Season 1 received an incredible response around the world, and many incredible things have happened. I'm very excited to be writing this letter to announce the release date of Season 2 and share the news about Season 3, the final season.\n\nOn the first day, we started filming Season 2, I remember thinking: \"Wow, I can't believe I'm back in the world of The Squid Game. It was almost surreal. I wonder how you will feel when you return to Squid Game in three years.\n\nSong Gi Hoon, who vowed revenge at the end of Season 1, returns and rejoins the game. Will he succeed in taking revenge? The protagonist doesn't seem to be an easy opponent this time around. The fierce clash between their two worlds will continue in the series finale, Season 3, which will be released next year.\n\nI'm very happy to see that the seeds that were sown during the creation of the new Squid Game will germinate and bear fruit by the end of this story.\n\nWe will do our best to provide you with another exciting adventure. I hope you're looking forward to what's next. Thank you very much and see you soon.\"\n\nEarlier, OBOZ.UA wrote that 79-year-old actor Oh Yeon-soo, who played the grandfather gambler number 001 in the TV series Squid Game, was sentenced to 8 months in prison and two years of probation for an incident that occurred in 2017.", "source": {"uri": "eng.obozrevatel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Obozrevatel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian_(season_2)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian (season 2)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...?_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "What If...?

The title is derived from a childhood game with a similar name. The series is set in a dystopian version of South Korea.\n\nThe game that keeps you guessing and tests your ability to outwit fellow participants, your perseverance, and your talent of emerging a survivor from deadly situations is back for a glorious gory second season!\n\n'Squid Game', the South Korean survival drama, became a cultural juggernaut when it premiered on Netflix in September 2021. The streaming giant has announced that the iconic TV series will be back with a bang!\n\nThe second season of 'Squid Game' will start streaming from Netflix on December 26.\n\nThe official Instagram handle of Netflix shared a sneak peek at the second season, and a wry reference to the ongoing Olympics, and wrote, \"The real game begins. SQUID GAME SEASON 2 coming December 26. final season coming in 2025...\". The clip shows a running competition, and one individual is shown to stumble and fall. The post went viral on Instagram and gained over 97K likes.\n\n\"The cast and the crew are truly pouring their hearts and souls into filming the second season,\" executive producer Kim Ji-yeon told Netflix in December last year. \"I hope you stay tuned and root for us!\"\n\nIn the new season, we see Seong Gi-hun aka Player 456, who won the 33rd Squid Game in 2020, embark on a suicidal mission to uncover the mastermind behind the game and take them down.\n\nUsing the fortune he acquired as the prize, Gi-hun at first searches for the man in the suit playing ddakji in the subway. However, he soon discovers that he may have to re-enter the game and gamble with his life again to get to its heart ...\n\nConfirmed to return for Squid Game Season 2 are familiar faces such as Lee Jung-jae, Lee Byung-hun, Gong Yoo, and Wi Ha-jun.\n\nThey will be joined by newcomers Yim Si-wan, Kang Ha-neul, Park Gyu-young, Park Sung-hoon, Jo Yu-ri, Yang Dong-geun, Kang Ae-sim, Lee David, Lee Jin-uk, Choi Seung-hyun, Roh Jae-won, and Won Ji-an, who will bring a vibrant array of new characters to the show.\n\nHelmed by Emmy Award-winning director Hwang Dong-hyuk, 'Squid Game' narrates the story of how 456 people, all facing bankruptcy participate in a suicidal game, in which they gamble with their lives to win a fortune of 45.6 billion won, or perish trying.\n\nThe series title was inspired by a similarly named children's game. The series takes place in a dystopian South Korea.\n\nIn an interview with Variety, Dong-hyuk revealed that the concept for the movie was born from his own financial hardships as well as the deeply embedded class disparities in South Korean society.\n\nThe series premiered on Netflix in September 2021 and became a smash hit. It went on to become the most-watched series on Netflix and amassed more than 1.65 billion viewing hours within the first four weeks of its debut.\n\nThe show has garnered various prestigious awards. O Yeong-su won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film. Lee Jung-Jae and HoYeon Jung both won Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series and Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series, respectively, marking the first time Korean actors have won in these categories.\n\nThe first season earned 14 Primetime Emmy nominations, including one for Outstanding Drama Series, making it the first non-English-language production to be nominated in this category. Lee also made history by winning Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, the first Asian actor to do so for a non-English role.\n\nThe series starts with hundreds of desperate participants, all wearing green jumpsuits, gathering to compete in a survival game for a large cash prize, under the watchful eyes of masked and armed guards. They quickly realize that losing the game means losing their lives.\n\nThe narrative follows characters like Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) as they compete in the Squid Games. Failure to complete the challenges results in deadly consequences. As the plot progresses, Gi-hun forms alliances with his friend Cho Sang-woo (Park Hae-soo), an elderly man named Oh Il-nam (Oh Yeong-su), and a few others to navigate the games.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of thugs led by Jang Deok-su attempts to dominate by killing other contestants. Despite the dangers, Seong Gi-hun makes it to the final round and wins, while the others are brutally eliminated.\n\nThe story, however, doesn't end there. After the death of his friend, a vengeful Gi-hun exits the game zone and receives another invitation, discovering that the creator of the Squid Game is the old man, Oh Il-nam.\n\nFaced with the invitation, Gi-hun decides to return, determined to uncover the game's secrets, and avenge his friends' deaths. Another subplot involves Jun-ho, an undercover cop searching for his missing brother, who discovers an organ trafficking ring involving deceased players.

Here's A Quick Recap Of What Happened In Season 1", "body": "Squid Game is all set to take things to the next level! The makers of the highly-anticipated survival thriller have released a new trailer for the second season along with its release date. Not just that, fans can also get a window into the premiere of its third and final season. Squid Game season 2 is arriving more than three years after the first season, which became a global sensation. The cliffhanger ending of the first part has left fans with high expectations for the upcoming seasons.\n\nThe latest trailer for Squid Game Season 2 reveals players returning to the island as the deadly games resume, with even higher stakes likely to make them more desperate and dangerous than ever. Notably, the menacing Young-hee, also known as The Doll, is set to return and target the players once again. But what can we expect from the second season of Squid Game? Let's delve deeper into the upcoming twists and turns.\n\nWhat Happened At The End Of Squid Game Season 1?\n\nThe show began with hundreds of desperate contestants, clad in green jumpsuits, coming together to compete in a survival game for tempting prize money, all while being watched by masked and armed guards. They soon discovered, however, that the game came with a deadly price.\n\nThroughout the season, the storyline tracks the players including Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), as they strive to win the Squid Games. Those who fail to complete the tasks face lethal consequences. As the drama unfolds, Gi-hun forms a strategic alliance with his friend Cho Sang-woo (Park Hae-soo), an elderly man named Oh Il-nam (Oh Yeong-su) and a few others to navigate the games. Additionally, there is also a group of thugs led by Jang Deok Su, who forcibly try to gain the upper hand with plans to kill other contestants.\n\nAmid all the odds and challenges, Seong Gi Hun eventually makes it to the last round and wins the game, while the others are brutally killed. But the show just doesn't end here. Following his friend's death, a vengeful Seong Gi Hun steps out of the prison-like game zone and receives another invitation, only to find the creator of the Squid Game to be the old man, i.e., Oh II Nam.\n\nWhile contemplating the invitation, he chooses to return to uncover the secrets of the game and seek revenge for his friends' deaths. Meanwhile, another player, Jun-ho, a disguised cop searching for his missing brother, finds himself amid a secret plot where some organs are being trafficked from the deceased players. While he dies trying to find his brother's secret, it is later revealed that the latter is the true masked host. This intriguing subplot is expected to be further explored in the next season.\n\nWhen Does Squid Game 2 Arrive?\n\nWith a lot of unanswered questions, Squid Game Season 2 will arrive on December 26, 2024, with the third and final season to follow sometime in 2025. The plotline for the finale season is yet to be unveiled.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dishya_sharma@news18.com", "name": "Dishya Sharma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "sahas@news18.com", "name": "sahas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Squid_Game_characters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of Squid Game characters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_Playlist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hospital Playlist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...?_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "What If...?

And there's even more to look forward to - a third and final season is in the works, slated for a 2025 premiere.\n\nThe buzz around \"Squid Game\" has never really died down. From Halloween costumes to countless Roblox adaptations, the series left an indelible mark on pop culture. As anticipation builds, the latest trailer has reignited excitement, hinting at darker and more intense challenges ahead for our favorite characters.\n\nSeason two picks up three years after the climactic events of the first season. Player 456, still haunted by his experiences, is on a mission to dismantle the sinister organization behind the deadly games. Armed with his winnings, Gi-hun's search begins in the most unlikely of places - a subway, where a mysterious man in a sharp suit plays ddakji. His quest quickly becomes perilous, as he realizes that to bring down the organization, he must dive back into the deadly competition.\n\nAdding to the anticipation, the show's creator, Hwang Dong-hyuk, shared his thoughts on returning to the \"Squid Game\" universe. In a heartfelt message posted on social media, he reminisced about the first day of shooting for season two. \"It felt surreal to be back in the world of Squid Game,\" he wrote. \"I can only imagine how it will feel for the audience to return after three years.\"\n\nFans have been eagerly awaiting this continuation since the second season was confirmed in 2021. Lead actor Lee Jung-jae teased last year that the new season would be \"bigger in scale\" and hinted at longer production times due to its ambitious scope. Despite the secrecy surrounding the plot, the teaser and casting announcements suggest that familiar faces might return, resolving some of the cliffhangers from the first season.\n\nThe official description for the new season promises a thrilling and dangerous journey for Gi-hun. As he delves deeper into the conspiracy, the stakes are higher than ever. The enigmatic man in the subway is just the beginning of a treacherous path that forces Gi-hun to confront his fears and face new, deadly games.\n\nWith each revelation, the excitement for \"Squid Game\" only grows. The series has become more than just a show; it's a phenomenon that continues to capture the imagination of viewers around the globe. As December approaches, fans are counting down the days, eager to see how the story unfolds.\n\nFew shows have made such a lasting impact. \"Squid Game\" has not only redefined the thriller genre but also sparked conversations about human nature, survival, and morality. The upcoming seasons promise to build on this legacy, delivering the same heart-pounding drama and suspense that made the original season a worldwide sensation.\n\nSo, mark your calendars and prepare for another round of high-stakes drama. \"Squid Game\" is back, and it's ready to take you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions, suspense, and intrigue.

A very interesting date, you might think; sure, people home for the holidays will all be looking for something to watch, but I'm not sure if this show qualifies as feel-good family entertainment. It seems Netflix is being a little canny with this choice, but hey, if David Fincher can make \"The Feel-Bad Movie of Christmas\" for cinemas, can't director Hwang Dong-hyuk do the same for TV?\n\nThe first season of \"Squid Game\" was a massive hit upon its premiere in September of 2021, becoming the service's most-watched show ever, and that popularity has only made the long wait for this second season that much more difficult. Despite this years-long wait, the show (much like Netflix's other original series phenomenon, \"Stranger Things\") has never completely left the public eye; not only did Lee Jung-jae (who plays Seong Gi-hun) make Emmy history by winning Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 2022, but \"Squid Game\" merchandise, tie-in materials, and ancillary activities like the \"Squid Game Experience\" in Los Angeles or the highly controversial reality show spin-off have kept it alive during the years without new episodes.\n\nFortunately, fans won't have too long to wait after the premiere of season 2 for the show's third (and, sadly, final) season to drop as well, as Hwang has also confirmed that season 3 will premiere sometime in 2025.

Netflix also shared that there would be a third and final season arriving in 2025.\n\nAs for where the show will pick back up come December?

In the distance, spectators appeared to watch the challenge go down from the stands.\n\nHowever, to find out whether Gi-hun succeeds in his plot for revenge, viewers will have to wait for the arrival of the series, which will also see Lee Byung-hun, Wi Ha-jun, and Gong Yoo reprising their respective roles as Front Man, detective Hwang Jun Ho and The Salesman.\n\nOne thing's for certain: The mission won't be easy. As creator Hwang Dong-hyuk -- who also wrote, directed and produced the second season -- warned in the release, \"Front Man doesn't seem to be an easy opponent this time either.\"\n\n\"The fierce clash between their two worlds will continue into the series finale with Season 3, which will be brought to you next year,\" he added. \"I am thrilled to see the seed that was planted in a creating a new Squid Game grow and bear fruit through the end of this story.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Squid_Game_characters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of Squid Game characters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ddakji", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ddakji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi_Ha-joon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wi Ha-joon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwang_Dong-hyuk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hwang Dong-hyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Byung-hun", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Byung-hun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gong_Yoo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gong Yoo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby_Showers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby Showers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Holidays_and_Celebration", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Holidays and Celebration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2021/10/106951034-16331079652037_SquidGame_Unit_104_1564.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780752", "eventUri": "eng-9780752", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-26", "textStart": 287, "textEnd": 294}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 311, "textEnd": 318}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The news that we'll be able to stream the South Korean original that was at one point Netflix's most popular show the day after Christmas was but one reveal. We'll also see Season 3 in 2025, and that will be the final season. Some might be sad by that news, but for me as a fan of the show who binged the original with my Netflix subscription, it's a great decision.\n\nWhile most people would probably prefer that their favorite shows continue indefinitely, I'm on the opposite side of the argument. Squid Game is fantastic, and I love that we're getting more episodes, but the fact that it will end after Season 3 is more comforting than not for a couple of reasons.\n\nSquid Game is an entertaining concept, to the point that Netflix made a reality show spinoff where people played the game for money. With that said, we know what the game itself has to offer and its entire premise by the end of a season. The Squid Game ending showed Gi-Hun winning and seemingly seeking to destroy the game so that future desperate people wouldn't fall victim to it.\n\nI'm all for watching Gi-Hun attempt to stop the powers that be from running the game, with the full understanding that his succeeding effectively ends the show. I'd much sooner see the series reach a logical conclusion rather than continue to go on like the Saw franchise, where people just keep repeatedly getting roped in. If it continues with no end in sight, the story begins to feel a bit hokey to me.\n\nHearing that Squid Game is already planned to end in Season 3 and that it'll air in 2025 is good news, in my eyes. While Netflix has a reputation as of late for canceling shows way too soon, I'd like to applaud the streamer here for ending one of its most-popular shows perhaps earlier than audiences would like.\n\nI'd assume that with Season 3 being the final season, the story of Gi-Hun and Squid Game has a beginning, middle, and end. It's totally possible that more spinoffs for the series may come, but now we're able to know that whether he's successful or not. We're not in for multiple seasons in which he's constantly going through the game in an attempt to infiltrate its inner sanctum and destroying it from the inside out. Repeating that formula, as mentioned, is hokey, and it's a formula a show could abuse repeatedly until the concept becomes stale.\n\nWith a definitive three-season run, Squid Game has a chance at a legacy as one of the best Netflix shows of all time. Ultimately, it will be on the next two seasons to deliver and prove this show wasn't just some flash-in-the-pan phenomenon and legitimately stands as one of the best shows with a worldwide appeal.\n\nSquid Game premieres Season 2 on Netflix on December 26th, and Season 3 is coming in 2025. I'm eager to watch it right now, but there are still plenty of upcoming Netflix shows we can all enjoy while we wait for it.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mick_joest@cinemablend.com", "name": "Mick Joest", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby_Showers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby Showers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XprtgAsBeuYEBTeXRvbEFF-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780752", "eventUri": "eng-9780752", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-26", "textStart": 2806, "textEnd": 2819}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Anyway, Squid Game season 2 is finally arriving this Christmas, and the surprise here is that Netflix will be wrapping it all up by 2025.\n\nAfter a bunch-of-nothing announcement earlier this year, Netflix has finally shared with its subscribers a definitive release date for season 2 of the hit series: December 26, the day after Christmas. I'm sure the kids will love this even if they shouldn't.\n\nNetflix will have disappointed you if you were hoping for a trailer now that we're in the back half of 2024, as it always likes to kick marketing off much closer to release dates for some reason, even if many of its shows end up dropping out of nowhere and getting, er, not good viewership numbers.\n\nHowever, we've received confirmation a third season is happening, and the most shocking part is that it'll actually be the show's final set of episodes. Moreover, it's coming in 2025, which might suggest director, writer, and executive producer Hwang Dong-hyuk spent so much time working on season 2 because it was actually two seasons in a trench coat, which is a bit of classic Netflix move. \"Seong Gi-hun who vowed revenge at the end of Season 1 returns and joins the game again. Will he succeed in getting his revenge? Front Man doesn't seem to be an easy opponent this time either. The fierce clash between their two worlds will continue into the series finale with Season 3, which will be brought to you next year,\" he teases.\n\nFor star Lee Jung-jae, Squid Game season 2 may represent a second major hit this year on TV, as The Acolyte, as much as the haters tried to bury it, ended up being one of the most talked-about shows of the summer, and pretty much everyone agrees that the South Korean actor delivered the strongest performance of the bunch. Squid Game's Seong Gi-hun was also a fascinating character to follow and see portrayed by the actor, so I'm at the very least curious about where he might be taken next, considering how the season 1 finale left things hanging.", "source": {"uri": "vg247.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VG247"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian_(season_2)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian (season 2)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwang_Dong-hyuk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hwang Dong-hyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Squid_Game_characters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of Squid Game characters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(season_3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Crown (season 3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_finale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Series finale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby_Showers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby Showers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Squid-Game-season-2-announcement.jpg?width=1200&height=600&fit=crop&enable=upscale&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780752", "eventUri": "eng-9780752", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-05-02", "textStart": 1603, "textEnd": 1608}, {"amb": false, "date": "-12-26", "textStart": 432, "textEnd": 443}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

In the new release date announcement trailer, we see a game that resembles \"Red Light, Green Light\" being run around a stadium track.\n\nStay tuned for more details in the coming months and mark your calendars for the first episode of Squid Game Season 2 on December 26.", "source": {"uri": "lifestyleasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lifestyle Asia HK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwang_Dong-hyuk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hwang Dong-hyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo_Yu-ri", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jo Yu-ri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Gyu-young", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Park Gyu-young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Sung-hoon_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Park Sung-hoon (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Dong-geun", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yang Dong-geun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Im_Si-wan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Im Si-wan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kang_Ha-neul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kang Ha-neul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_David", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lee David"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_finale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Series finale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Won_Ji-an", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Won Ji-an"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ddakji", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ddakji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.O.P", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.O.P"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_(game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statues (game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Korean language"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Word_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Word Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Holidays_and_Celebration", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Holidays and Celebration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://images.lifestyleasia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/01154104/FVEGAG4UcAItmHj.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780752", "eventUri": "eng-9780752", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-26", "textStart": 132, "textEnd": 143, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

However, not much about the new characters has been revealed yet.\n\nImage via Netflix\n\nReturning from the first season are Lee Jung-jae, Lee Byung-hun, Wi Ha-jun, and Gong Yoo.\n\nThe returning cast from Season 1.\n\nImage via Netflix/Dispatch\n\nCast gathering for the first table read of Season 2.\n\nImage via Netflix\n\nAccording to the streaming platform, the second season picks up three years after Player 456, also known as Seong Gi-hun won the deadly competition. He is determined to find the people responsible for the game and put an end to their vicious sport, using the funds he won.\n\n\"Using this fortune to fund his search, Gi-hun starts with the most obvious of places: look for the man in a sharp suit playing ddakji in the subway. But when his efforts finally yield results, the path toward taking down the organisation proves to be deadlier than he imagined: to end the game, he needs to re-enter it,\" the official synopsis for season two reads.\n\nCheck out some teaser images below:\n\nImage via JuHan Noh/Netflix\n\nYep, Gong Yoo is back.\n\nImage via JuHan Noh/Netflix\n\nImage via JuHan Noh/Netflix\n\nImage via JuHan Noh/Netflix\n\nDon't mess with Front Man.\n\nImage via JuHan Noh/Netflix\n\nWith a season three coming our way next year, we can expect Gi-hun's fight to continue into the series finale.\n\nSquid Game director Hwang Dong-hyuk teased what's to come for the upcoming seasons.\n\n\"Seong Gi-hun who vowed revenge at the end of season one returns and joins the game again.

As it turns out, the upcoming third season premiering in 2025 is going to be the final one.\n\nGiven that the Korean drama proved to be one of the biggest streaming hits in history during season 1, it would be easy to argue that it would continue to be renewed for another four or five years. That hasn't happened, and that means that it's time to pose another big question: Why?\n\nWell, a lot of it could come down to a rather simple statement: Some shows just are not meant for an altogether long life. Also, Korean dramas in general do tend to have a clear beginning, middle, and end and don't often last for several years. Ending with the third season helps to ensure that the series never grows stale, and it allows people to know there is a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nSome viewers may love this -- however, we don't necessarily think that the rules for one show are the same for others. Even though ending Squid Game with season 3 feels right, there are still plenty of other shows that could benefit from airing for a good seven or eight years.

Squid Game, which was initially released on the streaming platform in 2021, is still awaiting a second instalment - but it's writer and director Hwang Dong-hyuk has confirmed that season three will be the show's last.\n\nIn a letter announcing the show's end, he wrote: \"Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), who vowed revenge at the end of season one, returns and joins the game again. Will he succeed in getting his revenge? Front Man doesn't seem to be an easy opponent this time either.\n\n\"The fierce clash between their two worlds will continue into the series finale in season three, which will be brought to you next year.\"\n\nHe added that season three would be \"yet another thrill ride\" - and we can't wait. Meanwhile, the show also released a teaser trailer about season two, showing contestants running and falling on a race track as the VoiceOver says: \"It's been three years. Do you want to play again?\"\n\nSpeaking about the trailer, one person posted: \"I'm scared just watching it,\" while another person added: \"We WILL be watching.\"\n\nThe show follows a group of contestants who are invited to play a game with a prize pot of 45.6 billion South Korean won (about \u00a327 million). However, the contestants soon realise that there is more than stake than they ever could have imagined, a losing the game will cost them their lives.\n\nThe second season is set to be released on Netflix on 26 December, while season three will land in 2025 - so stay tuned!\n\nThe show has been such a smash hit that a reality show competition spin-off aired in 2023 - and saw over 400 contestants try their luck at an incredible \u00a33.61 million prize.\n\nLee Jung-jae was the first actor in a non-English-language show to win the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor for his role in the show, and spoke about the historical moment to The Guardian. He said: \"The world is moving closely together. We're seeing an increase in the exchanges between countries, and increased understanding.\n\n\"And we've realised that in art and culture, language needn't be the first priority... Of course I feel pressure, a sense of responsibility. But if I were younger when this had happened I would have thought: 'Wow, I need to work harder and impress people.' But now it's more of a realisation of what Korean culture can achieve. Some great Korean dramas could now make it on to the world stage. That's exciting.\"", "source": {"uri": "hellomagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HELLO!"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwang_Dong-hyuk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hwang Dong-hyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_finale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Series finale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korean_won", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Korean won"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian_(season_2)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian (season 2)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Korean drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Culture of Korea"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/15894ddb170d-netflix-logo.jpg?tx=c_fill,w_1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780752", "eventUri": "eng-9780752", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-26", "textStart": 1463, "textEnd": 1474}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

They threw their bodies into the river and their belongings in after them.'\n\nA man stands by as a fire rages in a livestock market area in al-Fasher, the capital of Sudan's North Darfur state, on September 1, 2023, in the aftermath of bombardment by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF)\n\nPeople walk among scattered objects in the market of El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur, as fighting continues in Sudan between the forces of two rival generals, on April 29, 2023\n\nA boy holds bullet cartridges as clashes between Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the army continue, in Khartoum North, Sudan, May 13, 2023\n\nSudanese Children suffering from malnutrition are treated at an MSF clinic in Metche Camp, Chad, near the Sudanese border, Saturday, April 6, 2024.

Sudan, April 7, 2024\n\nA 15-year-old victim of sexual violence in El Geneina, West Darfur, is seen outside a makeshift shelter in Adre, Chad, August 1, 2023\n\nFor more than a year, Sudan has suffered a war between the army, headed by the country's de facto leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.\n\nThe country 'is experiencing a humanitarian crisis of epic proportions' as a result, with famine threatening and more than 8.7 million people uprooted, according to the UN.\n\nBoth sides have been accused of war crimes, but the RSF is believed to have conducted a programme of ethnic cleansing of non-Arab communities, particularly the ethnic Massalit group, in the west of the country.\n\nDescriptions of the heinous crimes were part of a 186-page HRW report called 'Ethnic Cleansing and Crimes Against Humanity in El-Geneina, West Darfur, Sudan', which painstakingly charts 'an ethnic cleansing campaign against the ethnic Massalit and other non-Arab populations'.\n\nFrom late April until early November of last year, the RSF and allied militias 'conducted a systematic campaign to remove, including by killing, ethnic Massalit residents', according to HRW.\n\nLocal human rights lawyers said they had tracked a pattern where fighters targeted 'prominent members of the Massalit community', including doctors, human rights defenders, local leaders and government officials.\n\nHRW added that the attackers 'methodically destroyed critical civilian infrastructure', primarily in communities consisting of displaced Massalit.\n\nSatellite imagery showed that since June, predominantly Massalit neighbourhoods in El-Geneina have been 'systematically dismantled, many with bulldozers, preventing civilians who fled from returning to their homes', HRW reported.\n\nHRW said the attacks constitute 'ethnic cleansing' as they appeared to be geared towards 'at least having them permanently leave the region'.\n\nThe context of the killings further 'raises the possibility that the RSF and their allies have the intent to destroy in whole or in part the Massalit in at least West Darfur, which would indicate that genocide has been and/or is being committed there', it added.\n\nHRW called for an investigation into genocidal intent, targeted sanctions on those responsible and urged the United Nations to 'widen the existing arms embargo on Darfur to cover all of Sudan'.\n\nYunis Ali Ishag, 60 from Geneina in West Sudan whose leg was amputated after he was

killings in Darfur, says it has 'grounds to believe' that both the paramilitaries and the army are committing 'Rome Statute crimes', which include war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.\n\nAnd in December, the United States said that Sudan's rival forces have both committed war crimes in their brutal conflict, accusing the RSF of ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.\n\nOver half a million Sudanese have fled the violence from Darfur into Chad, according to the latest UN figures.\n\nBy late October, 75 percent of those crossing the border were from El-Geneina, HRW said.\n\nAround 250 miles east of El-Geneina, all eyes are currently on El-Fasher in North Darfur, the only state capital not under RSF control.\n\nThe United States has warned of a disaster of 'epic proportions' if the RSF proceeds with an expected attack, as residents fear the same fate of El-Geneina will befall them.\n\n'As the UN Security Council and governments wake up to the looming disaster in El-Fasher, the large-scale atrocities committed in El-Geneina should be seen as a reminder of the atrocities that could come in the absence of concerted action,' said HRW executive director Tirana Hassan.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He said the RSF had a base nearby and eventually began bombing this area, Mudaris, with heavy guns.\n\n\"We buried all the dead people at night,\" he said, \"one day 186 people, another day 80, another day 50.\"\n\nThe man, who asked not to be named, is now sheltering in neighbouring Chad.\n\nHe told the BBC that armed men raped his wife, using degrading language as they did so: \"They said: 'Now we are your husband, your people have all have been killed. You can be the servants of our wives and clean our houses.'\"\n\nThe HRW report says that RSF fighters and militias used derogatory racial slurs against Massalit and other racial groups, telling them that the land was not theirs and that that it would become \"the land of the Arabs\".\n\nIt says the attacks culminated in a large-scale massacre on 15 June last year, when the RSF and its allies opened fire on a convoy of civilians desperately trying to flee.\n\nA 17-year-old boy described to HRW the killing of 12 children and 5 adults from several families: \"Two RSF forces ... grabb[ed] the children from their parents and, as the parents started screaming, two other RSF forces shot the parents, killing them. Then they piled up the children and shot them. They threw their bodies into the river and their belongings in after them.\"\n\nThe current violence has erupted out of a long history of tensions over resources between non-Arab farming communities, including the Massalit, and Arab pastoralist communities.\n\nThose tensions were harnessed by the former government of Omar al Bashir. It created Arab militias known as the Janjaweed to put down a Massalit rebellion in the 2000s, out of which the RSF was eventually formed. Many of the people who fled Janjaweed attacks 20 years ago found refuge in camps for internally displaced persons in El Geneina.\n\nSudan's civil war has helped reignite the violence. It began as a power struggle between the leaders of the Sudanese army, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary RSF, Gen Hemedti, but has since drawn in other ethnic militias.\n\nGen Hemedti has denied his fighters deliberately attacked civilians.\n\nBut HRW says he is among those with command responsibility over the forces which carried out the atrocities.\n\nThe HRW researchers interviewed more than 220 Sudanese refugees in Chad, Uganda, Kenya, and South Sudan, as well as remotely between June 2023 and April 2024.\n\nThey also reviewed and analysed over 120 photos and videos of the events, satellite imagery, and documents shared by humanitarian organisations to corroborate accounts of the abuses.\n\nThe rights body called for further investigations to find out if there was an intention to eliminate the Massalit community, which would indicate a genocide.\n\nLast June, West Darfur Governor Khamis Abakar was killed hours after accusing RSF of committing genocide. He is the most senior official known to have been killed since the conflict began in April.\n\nThe RSF says it is not involved in what it describes as a \"tribal conflict\" in Darfur.", "source":

The rights group said the assailants committed other major abuses including torture, rape and looting.\n\nHRW said that targeting the Masalit and other non-Arab populations with the aim of at least displacing them permanently from their region amounts to ethnic cleansing. It also said the atrocities, if committed with the intent to destroy in whole or in part the Massalit in at least West Darfur, would indicate that a genocide has also taken place there.\n\nIn one large-scale massacre committed on 15 June, the report said RSF and its allied militants opened fire on a convoy of civilians trying to flee the city, escorted by Massalit fighters.\n\nThe report cited the testimony of a 17-year-old boy describing the killing of 12 children and five adults from several families during the massacre.\n\n\"Two RSF forces ... grabb[ed] the children from their parents and, as the parents started screaming, two other RSF forces shot the parents, killing them. Then they piled up the children and shot them. They threw their bodies into the river and their belongings after them,\" the boy said.\n\nA Massalit local leader, speaking to MEE from a refugee camp in neighbouring Chad, said the atrocities in West Darfur are more brutal in type and scale than those committed in 2004-2005 in Darfur.\n\n\"There is huge evidence that what has happened is an intentional genocide based on our colour and race as Massalit,\" he said.\n\n\"This includes the way of killing, the mutation of corpses, the torture, killing of children, the verbal assaults, among others.\"\n\nThree senior members of the RSF declined to comment when approached by MEE.\n\nHRW has named RSF leader General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemeti, his brother Abdel Raheem Hamdan Dagalo and West Darfur commander Jomaa Barakallah as individuals with command responsibility over the militias that perpetrated the crimes, along with a commander of the Tamazuj armed group and two Arab tribal leaders.\n\nThe report called on the UN and African Union to deploy a new mission to protect vulnerable civilians in Sudan.\n\nIt also called on the UN Security Council to impose sanctions on suspects, including individuals and companies that have violated the arms embargo on Darfur in place since 2004.\n\nThe rights group added that the arms embargo should be extended to cover all of Sudan.\n\nThe RSF has been at war with the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), headed by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, since 15 April last year.\n\nThe hostilities, which began over plans to fold the RSF into the regular military, killed thousands of people, with 10,000-15,000 killed in el-Geneina alone, according to UN experts.\n\nIn June and November, Middle East Eye reported on mass killings by the RSF and allied Arab militias targeting members of the Black African Massalit community in el-Geneina and el-Fasher cities.\n\nAn investigation by the Raoul Wallenberg Centre, which cited MEE's reports on multiple occasions, concluded last month that there is \"clear and convincing evidence\" that the RSF and its allied militias \"have committed and are committing genocide against the Masalit\".\n\nThe RSF has seized all areas of Darfur except for el-Fasher, the state capital of North Darfur, which is controlled by the Sudanese army but currently besieged. An estimated one million civilians are blockaded in the city as Sudanese and international observers have warned of an imminent massacre.\n\n\"As the UN Security Council and governments wake up to the looming disaster in El Fasher, the large-scale atrocities committed in El Geneina should be seen as a reminder of the atrocities that could come in the absence of concerted action,\" said Tirana Hassan, executive director at Human Rights Watch.\n\n\"Governments, the African Union, and the United Nations need to act now to protect civilians.\"\n\nThe International Criminal Court is currently investigating the atrocities in West Darfur. HRW called on state parties to support the investigation.\n\nThe Massalit leader in Chad, who spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons, said he was dismayed by the \"inaction of the international community\" towards the abuses against his community.\n\n\"The ICC should start the procedures to bring the perpetrators to justice and issue an arrest warrant against RSF leaders,\" he told MEE.\n\nSudanese human rights defender Jamal Abdullah Khamis called on activists and journalists to continue documenting the abuses to shed light on the Darfur case.\n\n\"We have to see the killers behind bars in order to begin any steps towards real peace,\" he said.\n\nBefore the war, Hemeti and Burhan were allies. In 2019, they ousted longtime president Omar al-Bashir from power after mass protests against him, then jointly led a military coup against an interim civilian-military government.\n\nThe curent conflict has displaced at least 10.7 million people, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council, the second highest number this century after the Syrian war.\n\nAround 1.7 million of those are in neighbouring countries, particularly Chad and Egypt. HRW said more than half a million refugees from West Darfur, most of them from el-Geneina, have fled to Chad since April.\n\nThe Raoul Wallengerg Center said in its April report that Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, Libya, Chad, the Central African Republic (CAR) and Russia via the actions of the Wagner Group were \"complicit in the genocide\".\n\nMEE has reported on a network of supply lines that

He said the RSF had a base nearby and eventually began bombing this area, Mudaris, with heavy guns.\n\n\"We buried all the dead people at night,\" he said, \"one day 186 people, another day 80, another day 50.\"\n\nThe man, who asked not to be named, is now sheltering in neighbouring Chad.\n\nHe told the BBC that armed men raped his wife, using degrading language as they did so: \"They said: 'Now we are your husband, your people have all have been killed. You can be the servants of our wives and clean our houses.'\"\n\nThe HRW report says that RSF fighters and militias used derogatory racial slurs against Massalit and other racial groups, telling them that the land was not theirs and that that it would become \"the land of the Arabs\".\n\nIt says the attacks culminated in a large-scale massacre on 15 June last year, when the RSF and its allies opened fire on a convoy of civilians desperately trying to flee.\n\nA 17-year-old boy described to HRW the killing of 12 children and 5 adults from several families: \"Two RSF forces ... grabb[ed] the children from their parents and, as the parents started screaming, two other RSF forces shot the parents, killing them. Then they piled up the children and shot them. They threw their bodies into the river and their belongings in after them.\"\n\nThe current violence has erupted out of a long history of tensions over resources between non-Arab farming communities, including the Massalit, and Arab pastoralist communities.\n\nThose tensions were harnessed by the former government of Omar al Bashir. It created Arab militias known as the Janjaweed to put down a Massalit rebellion in the 2000s, out of which the RSF was eventually formed. Many of the people who fled Janjaweed attacks 20 years ago found refuge in camps for internally displaced persons in El Geneina.\n\nSudan's civil war has helped reignite the violence. It began as a power struggle between the leaders of the Sudanese army, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary RSF, Gen Hemedti, but has since drawn in other ethnic militias.\n\nGen Hemedti has denied his fighters deliberately attacked civilians.\n\nBut HRW says he is among those with command responsibility over the forces which carried out the atrocities.\n\nThe HRW researchers interviewed more than 220 Sudanese refugees in Chad, Uganda, Kenya, and South Sudan, as well as remotely between June 2023 and April 2024.\n\nThey also reviewed and analysed over 120 photos and videos of the events, satellite imagery, and documents shared by humanitarian organisations to corroborate accounts of the abuses.\n\nThe rights body called for further investigations to find out if there was an intention to eliminate the Massalit community, which would indicate a genocide.\n\nLast June, West Darfur Governor Khamis Abakar was killed hours after accusing RSF of committing genocide. He is the most senior official known to have been killed since the conflict began in April.\n\nThe RSF says it is not involved in what it describes as a \"tribal conflict\" in Darfur.", "source":

(BSS/AFP) - A series of attacks by Sudanese\n\nparamilitary forces in the western region of Darfur raise the possibility of\n\n\"genocide\" against non-Arab ethnic communities, Human Rights Watch said\n\nThursday.\n\nThe paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), along with allied militias, have\n\nbeen widely accused of ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity and war\n\ncrimes in their war with the regular army, which began in April 2023.\n\nThe war has killed tens of thousands, including up to 15,000 in the West\n\nDarfur town of El-Geneina, according to UN experts.\n\nThe area is the focus of the 186-page HRW report \"'The Massalit Will Not Come\n\nHome': Ethnic Cleansing and Crimes Against Humanity in El-Geneina, West\n\nDarfur, Sudan.\"\n\nIt describes \"an ethnic cleansing campaign against the ethnic Massalit and\n\nother non-Arab populations\".\n\nFrom late April until early November of last year, the RSF and allied\n\nmilitias \"conducted a systematic campaign to remove, including by killing,\n\nethnic Massalit residents\", according to HRW.\n\nThe violence, which included atrocities such as mass torture, rape and\n\nlooting, peaked in mid-June -- when thousands were killed within days -- and\n\nsurged again in November.\n\nLocal human rights lawyers said they had tracked a pattern where fighters\n\ntargeted \"prominent members of the Massalit community\", including doctors,\n\nhuman rights defenders, local leaders and government officials.\n\nHRW added that the attackers \"methodically destroyed critical civilian\n\ninfrastructure\", primarily in communities consisting of displaced Massalit.\n\nSatellite imagery showed that since June, predominantly Massalit\n\nneighbourhoods in El-Geneina have been \"systematically dismantled, many with\n\nbulldozers, preventing civilians who fled from returning to their homes\", HRW\n\nreported.\n\nHRW said the attacks constitute \"ethnic cleansing\" as they appeared to be\n\naimed at \"at least having them permanently leave the region\".\n\nThe context of the killings further \"raises the possibility that the RSF and\n\ntheir allies have the intent to destroy in whole or in part the Massalit in\n\nat least West Darfur, which would indicate that genocide has been and/or is\n\nbeing committed there\", it added.\n\n- 'Large-scale atrocities' -\n\nHRW called for an investigation into genocidal intent, targeted sanctions on\n\nthose responsible and urged the United Nations to \"widen the existing arms\n\nembargo on Darfur to cover all of Sudan\".\n\nThe International Criminal Court, currently investigating ethnic-based\n\nkillings in Darfur, says it has \"grounds to believe\" that both the\n\nparamilitaries and the army are committing \"Rome Statute crimes\", which\n\ninclude war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.\n\nAnd in December, the United States said that Sudan's rival forces have both\n\ncommitted war crimes in their brutal conflict, accusing the RSF of ethnic\n\ncleansing and crimes against humanity.\n\nOver half a million Sudanese have fled the violence from Darfur into Chad,\n\naccording to the latest UN figures.\n\nBy late October, 75 percent of those crossing the border were from El-\n\nGeneina, HRW said.\n\nAround 400 kilometres (250 miles) east of El-Geneina, all eyes are currently\n\non El-Fasher in North Darfur, the only state capital not under RSF control.\n\nThe United States has warned of a disaster of \"epic proportions\" if the RSF\n\nproceeds with an expected attack, as residents fear the same fate of El-\n\nGeneina will befall them.\n\n\"As the UN Security Council and governments wake up to the looming disaster\n\nin El-Fasher, the large-scale atrocities committed in El-Geneina should be\n\nseen as a reminder of the atrocities that could come in the absence of\n\nconcerted action,\" said HRW executive director Tirana Hassan.", "source": {"uri": "bssnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title":

HRW cited an RSF statement from July 2023 in which the militia reiterated its denial that its forces committed any abuses, describing the unrest in West Darfur as a \"purely tribal conflict\" in which the RSF is \"not a party,\" according to the report.\n\nConflict erupted in Sudan last April, when a long-simmering dispute between the army and the RSF exploded into a full-blown civil war. As many as 150,000 people may have been killed since then, according to US estimates, and the violence shows no sign of abating. Millions have fled their homes, leading to what the United Nations describes as the world's biggest displacement crisis.\n\nMany of the killings documented by HRW occurred in June, when violence gripped the city of El Geneina in West Darfur and Masalit forces lost the ability to fight back against RSF attacks. Thousands of people were killed as they fled the city and attempted to reach the border with neighbouring Chad.\n\nThe Human Rights Watch report was based on interviews with a total of 221 people and analysis of videos, photographs and satellite imagery, it said. - Bloomberg", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Support_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapid Support Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramilitary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paramilitary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethnic cleansing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Targeted killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human Rights Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darfur", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darfur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darfur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethnicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darfur_genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darfur genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masalit_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masalit people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janjaweed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Janjaweed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Darfur", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Darfur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Darfur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geneina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chad"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chad"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/8Gt0-dPe6nxyTc7mZ5ipjwkRrF8=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70):focal(1061x445:1071x455)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/4MN3EZ26GGY7TPR5QKUX2ZSWMM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551281", "eventUri": "eng-9551281", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Abuses escalated again in early November. The attackers committed other serious abuses such as torture, rape, and looting. More than half a million refugees from West Darfur have fled to Chad since April 2023. As of late October 2023, 75 percent were from El Geneina.\n\n\"As the UN Security Council and governments wake up to the looming disaster in El Fasher, the large-scale atrocities committed in El Geneina should be seen as a reminder of the atrocities that could come in the absence of concerted action,\" said Tirana Hassan, executive director at Human Rights Watch. \"Governments, the African Union, and the United Nations need to act now to protect civilians.\"\n\nTargeting the Massalit people and other non-Arab communities by committing serious violations against them with the apparent objective of at least having them permanently leave the region constitutes ethnic cleansing. The particular context in which the widespread killings took place also raises the possibility that the RSF and their allies have the intent to destroy in whole or in part the Massalit in at least West Darfur, which would indicate that genocide has been and/or is being committed there.\n\nBetween June 2023 and April 2024, Human Rights Watch interviewed more than 220 people in Chad, Uganda, Kenya, and South Sudan, as well as remotely. Researchers also reviewed and analyzed over 120 photos and videos of the events, satellite imagery, and documents shared by humanitarian organizations to corroborate accounts of grave abuses.\n\nThe violence in El Geneina began nine days after fighting broke out in Khartoum, Sudan's capital city, between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), Sudan's military, and the RSF. On the morning of April 24, the RSF clashed with a Sudanese military convoy travelling through El Geneina. Then the RSF and its allied groups attacked majority Massalit neighborhoods, clashing with predominantly Massalit armed groups defending their communities. Over the following weeks - and even after Massalit armed groups lost control of their neighborhoods - the RSF and allied militias systematically targeted unarmed civilians.\n\nThe violence culminated in a large-scale massacre on June 15, when the RSF and its allies opened fire on a kilometers-long convoy of civilians desperately trying to flee, escorted by Massalit fighters. The RSF and militias pursued, rounded up, and shot men, women, and children who ran through the streets or tried to swim across the fast-flowing Kajja river. Many drowned. Older people and injured people were not spared.\n\nA 17-year-old boy described the killing of 12 children and 5 adults from several families: \"Two RSF forces ... grabb[ed] the children from their parents and, as the parents started screaming, two other RSF forces shot the parents, killing them. Then they piled up the children and shot them. They threw their bodies into the river and their belongings in after them.\"\n\nThat day and in subsequent days, the attacks continued on tens of thousands of civilians who tried to cross into Chad, leaving the countryside strewn with bodies. Videos published at the time show crowds of civilians running for their lives on the road linking El Geneina to Chad.\n\nHuman Rights Watch also documented the killing of Arab residents and the looting of Arab neighborhoods by Massalit forces, and Sudanese Armed Forces' use of explosive weapons in populated areas in ways that caused unnecessary harm to civilians and civilian objects.\n\nThe RSF and allied militias escalated their abuses again in November, targeting Massalit people who had found refuge in the El Geneina suburb of Ardamata, rounding up Massalit men and boys and, according to the UN, killing at least 1,000 people.\n\nDuring the course of these abuses, women and girls were raped and subjected to other forms of sexual violence, and detainees were tortured and otherwise ill-treated. The attackers methodically destroyed critical civilian infrastructure, targeting neighborhoods and sites, including schools, in primarily Massalit displaced communities. They looted on a grand scale; and burned, shelled, and razed neighborhoods to the ground, after emptying them of residents.\n\nThese acts were committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the Massalit and other non-Arab civilian populations of Massalit-majority neighborhoods, and as such also constitute the crimes against humanity of murder, torture, persecution, and forcible transfer of the civilian population, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nThe possibility that genocide has been and/or is being committed in Darfur requires urgent action from all governments and international institutions to protect civilians. They should ensure investigation as to whether the facts demonstrate a specific intent on the part of the RSF leadership and its allies to destroy in whole or in part the Massalit and other non-Arab ethnic communities in West Darfur, that is, to commit genocide. If so, they should act to prevent its further perpetration, and to ensure those responsible for its planning and conduct are brought to justice.\n\nThe global community should support the investigations of the International Criminal Court (ICC), while states party to the court should ensure it has the financial resources needed in its regular budget to carry out its mandate in Darfur and across its docket.\n\nHuman Rights Watch identified the commander of the RSF, Mohammed \"Hemedti\" Hamdan Dagalo, his brother Abdel Raheem Hamdan Dagalo, and the West Darfur RSF commander Joma'a Barakallah as those with command responsibility over the forces that carried out these crimes. Human Rights Watch also named RSF allies, including a commander of the Tamazuj armed group and two Arab tribal leaders, as bearing responsibility for fighters that committed serious crimes.\n\nThe United Nations in coordination with the African Union should urgently deploy a new mission to protect civilians at risk in Sudan. The Security Council should impose targeted sanctions on those responsible for serious crimes in West Darfur, and individuals and companies that have and are violating the arms embargo. It should widen the existing arms embargo on Darfur to cover all of Sudan.\n\n\"The global inaction in the face of atrocities of this magnitude is inexcusable,\" Hassan said. \"Governments should ensure those responsible are held to account, including through targeted sanctions and by stepping up cooperation with the ICC.\"", "source": {"uri": "africa.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Last April, simmering tensions between its military, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) commanded by Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, broke out into street battles in the capital, Khartoum.\n\nFerocious fighting has spread to other parts of the country, especially urban areas and the Darfur region. There the World Food Programme (WFP) warned that people are living off grass and peanut shells and that at least 1.7 million people are experiencing emergency levels of hunger. HRW has called for sanctions over the situation in West Darfur in a new report released on Thursday that alleged that RSF and its allied militias are committing crimes against humanity and widespread war crimes \"in the context of an ethnic cleansing campaign\".\n\nMr Perriolo said that, despite the massive humanitarian crisis, soaring death toll and horrific violence, there had only been a \"brief blip\" in global attention around the anniversary of the conflict last month. Otherwise, interest had died down, with devastating effect.\n\n\"Please bring more attention to Sudan so that we do not lose the momentum of the last few weeks, which is the first we've had in a long time,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of people right now are facing acute famine and other horrific conditions.\n\n\"We need you to be the people that ... start bringing attention to this silent war and silent famine.\"\n\nThe warnings come as HRW called for the United Nations and the African Union to impose sanctions on those held responsible for serious crimes in West Darfur, as it released a damning 218-page report documenting ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity in El Geneina, the state capital.\n\nIn one particularly gruesome incident, a 17-year-old witness described watching RSF forces murder children after killing their parents in front of them.\n\n\"Two RSF forces ... grab[bed] the children from their parents and, as the parents started screaming, two other RSF forces shot the parents, killing them. Then they piled up the children and shot them. They threw their bodies into the river and their belongings in after them,\" he said.\n\nHRW alleged that the RSF, along with their allied mainly Arab militias, were targeting the Masalit people and other non-Arab communities in a wave of attacks, which could indicate that genocide is being committed.\n\nTirana Hassan HRW's executive director said that governments, the African Union, and the United Nations \"need to act now to protect civilians\".\n\nTirana Hassan, Human Rights Watch\n\n\"The global inaction in the face of atrocities of this magnitude is inexcusable,\" She said. \"Governments should ensure those responsible are held to account, including through targeted sanctions and by stepping up cooperation with the ICC [International Criminal Court].\"\n\nSudan was plunged into a devastating conflict last April, when soaring tensions between its military and the RSF erupted into ferocious street battles in the capital, Khartoum, later engulfing other parts of the country, including Darfur.\n\nSince then the RSF have gained control of most of Darfur and are besieging El Fasher, in the north of the region, where some 500,000 civilians had taken refuge.\n\nThe WPF warned last week that there is a serious risk of widespread starvation and death across Darfur, where at least 1.7 million people are experiencing emergency levels of hunger.\n\nLeni Kinzli, the WFP's regional spokesperson, said that the situation in El Fasher, in particular, is \"extremely dire\".\n\nShe received photos of severely malnourished children in a camp for displaced people in Central Darfur, as well as older people \"who have nothing left but skin and bones\".\n\n\"People are resorting to consuming grass and peanut shells,\" she added. \"Recent reports from our partners indicate that 20 children have died in recent weeks of malnutrition in that ... camp.\"\n\nIn West Darfur, HRW said that RSF and militias had killed thousands of people and left hundreds of thousands of refugees as they pursued, rounded up, and shot men, women, and children who ran through the streets or tried to swim across the fast-flowing Kaja River - the report said many drowned. Older people and injured people were not spared.\n\nThe gruesome investigation also details rape, torture and looting by the forces that \"methodically\" burned, shelled, and razed neighbourhoods to the ground.

The 218-page report, published yesterday by HRW, provides additional evidence that the paramilitary RSF and allied militias deliberately targeted non-Arab Masalit people in El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur.\n\n\"The attackers methodically destroyed critical civilian infrastructure, targeting neighbourhoods and sites, including schools, in primarily Masalit displaced communities\", according to the HRW report. \"Committing serious violations against [the Masalit] with the apparent objective of at least having them permanently leave the region constitutes ethnic cleansing.\n\n\"The particular context in which the widespread killings took place also raises the possibility that the RSF and their allies have the intent to destroy in whole or in part the Massalit in at least West Darfur, which would indicate that genocide has been and/or is being committed there.\"\n\nThe situation intensified on June 15 with a large-scale massacre, where RSF forces fired upon a convoy of fleeing civilians, the report states. In November, the violence escalated with additional targeted attacks on the Masalit community in the northeastern Ardamata suburb of El Geneina.\n\nThe report notably details violence perpetrated by the RSF against children. In one instance, a 17-year-old witness told HRW that RSF forces grabbed children from their parents, shot the parents, and then \"piled up the children and shot them\" before throwing their bodies into a river along with their belongings.\n\nHRW called for an International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into the possibility of genocide in El Geneina. RSF commanders, notably Mohammed 'Hemedti' Hamdan Dagalo and his brother Abdel Raheem Hamdan Dagalo, were singled out for bearing command responsibility for these crimes. The report also advocated for the urgent deployment of a mission to safeguard civilians at risk in Sudan.\n\n\"As the UN Security Council and governments wake up to the looming disaster in El Fasher, the large-scale atrocities committed in El Geneina should be seen as a reminder of the atrocities that could come in the absence of concerted action,\" warned HRW Executive Director Tirana Hassan.\n\nEl Geneina violence\n\nViolence erupted in El Geneina between April and November 2023 when the RSF and allied militias conducted a series of attacks targeting predominantly Masalit neighborhoods, killing thousands of civilians and displacing hundreds of thousands of people. These assaults included reports of torture, rape, and looting.\n\nA full picture of the gravity and scale of the RSF attack on West Darfur has gradually become clearer. A months-long telecommunications blackout further hindered the flow of information from El Geneina.\n\nA testimony by a Native Administration leader for Arab tribes in West Darfur, included in the HRW report, describes an instance where, after burying bodies in a mass grave near the Central Reserve Police (CRP) headquarters in El Geneina, an RSF guard exclaimed, \"Don't share this information with Radio Dabanga!\"\n\nMutasim Ali, who co-authored an independent inquiry on potential breaches of the Genocide Convention in Darfur for the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights, acknowledged Dabanga's role in covering the events in the Darfur region in an interview this week. He said that \"Radio Dabanga gained credibility with its original reports, which do not rely on information from other parties, making it a major source of reliable information not only for the Raoul Centre but for everyone searching for news on Sudan\".\n\n*You can read the full report ''The Massalit Will Not Come Home': Ethnic Cleansing and Crimes Against Humanity in El Geneina, West Darfur,

Then the RSF and its allied groups attacked Massalit neighbourhoods, clashing with predominantly Massalit armed groups defending their communities.\n\nOver the following weeks - and even after Massalit armed groups lost control of their neighbourhoods - the RSF and allied militias systematically targeted unarmed civilians, says the report.\n\nThe violence culminated in a massacre on 15 June, when the RSF and its allies opened fire on a convoy of civilians trying to flee.\n\nWitness accounts say the RSF and militias pursued, rounded up and shot men, women and children who ran through the streets or tried to swim across the Kajja River. Many drowned. Older people and injured people were not spared.\n\nA 17 year old boy described the killing of 12 children and five adults from several families: \"Two RSF forces ... grabb[ed] the children from their parents and, as the parents started screaming, two other RSF forces shot the parents, killing them.\"\n\n\"Then they piled up the children and shot them. They threw their bodies into the river and their belongings in after them.\"\n\nOngoing attacks\n\nThe assaults continued on tens of thousands of civilians who tried to cross into Chad, leaving the countryside strewn with bodies. Videos published at the time show crowds of civilians running for their lives on the road linking El Geneina to Chad.\n\nHRW also documented the killing of Arab residents and the looting of Arab neighbourhoods by Massalit forces as well as the SAF's use of explosive weapons in populated areas in ways that caused unnecessary harm to civilians and civilian objects.\n\nThe RSF and allied militias escalated their attacks again in November, targeting Massalit people who had found refuge in the El Geneina suburb of Ardamata, rounding up Massalit men and boys and, according to the UN, killing at least 1,000 people.\n\nWomen and girls were raped and subjected to other forms of sexual violence, the report says.\n\nThe acts were committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the Massalit and other non-Arab civilian populations of Massalit-majority neighbourhoods and include crimes against humanity, HRW said.\n\nAction demanded\n\nThe report requested \"urgent action\" from governing bodies worldwide, including an investigation into the intent of the RSF and allies to commit genocide.\n\n\"If so, they should act to prevent its further perpetration, and to ensure those responsible for its planning and conduct are brought to justice,\" it added.\n\nLast month French President Emmanuel Macron chaired an international conference to address the conflict in Sudan that raised more than \u20ac2 billion in aid.\n\n\"It is a conflict imposed on the people that only produces grief and suffering, provoking one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world,\" Macron said during the conference.\n\n\"It is our duty was to show that we are not forgetting what is going on in Sudan and there are no double standards as the world focuses on other crises.\"\n\nDespite Macron's overtures, HRW says governments are failing to back up their words.\n\n\"The global inaction in the face of atrocities of this magnitude is inexcusable,\" Hassan said.\n\n\"Governments should ensure those responsible are held to account, including through targeted sanctions and by stepping up cooperation with the International Criminal Court.\"", "source":

Otherwise interest had died with a devastating effect.\n\n\"Please being more attention to Sudan, so that we do not lose the momentum of the last few weeks, which is the first we've had in a long time,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of people right now are facing acute famine and other horrific conditions.\"\n\n\"We need you to be the people that... start bringing attention to this silent war and silent famine.\"\n\nThe warnings come as HRW called for the United Nations and the African Union to impose sanctions on those held responsible for serious crimes in West Darfur as it released a damning 218-page report documenting ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity in El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur.\n\nIn one particularly gruesome incident a 17-year-old witness described watching RSF forces murder children after killing their parents in front of them.\n\n\"Two RSF forces... grabb[ed] the children from their parents and, as the parents started screaming, two other RSF forces shot the parents, killing them. Then they piled up the children and shot them. They threw their bodies into the river and their belongings in after them,\" he said.\n\nHRW alleged the RSF, and their allied mainly Arab militias were targeting the Massalit people and other-Non Arab communities in a wave of attacks that could indicate genocide is being committed.\n\nTirana Hassan HRW's executive director said that governments, the African Union, and the United Nations \"need to act now to protect civilians.\"\n\n\"The global inaction in the face of atrocities of this magnitude is inexcusable,\" She said. \"Governments should ensure those responsible are held to account, including through targeted sanctions and by stepping up cooperation with the ICC.\"\n\nSudan plunged into a devastating conflict last April, when soaring tensions between its military and the RSF erupted into ferocious street battles in the capital, Khartoum, later engulfing other parts of the country, including Darfur.\n\nSince then the RSF have gained control of most of Darfur and are besieging El Fasher, in the north of Darfur, where some 500,000 civilians had taken refuge.\n\nThe WPF warned last week that there is a serious risk of widespread starvation and death across Darfur, where at least 1.7 million people were experiencing emergency levels of hunger.\n\nLeni Kinzli, the WFP's regional spokesperson said the situation in El Fasher, in particular, is \"extremely dire\".\n\nShe received photos of severely malnourished children in a camp for displaced people in Central Darfur, as well as older people \"who have nothing left but skin and bones.\"\n\n\"People are resorting to consuming grass and peanut shells,\" she added.\n\n\"Recent reports from our partners indicate that 20 children have died in recent weeks of malnutrition in that IDP camp,\" she said.\n\nIn West Darfur HRW said that RSF and militias had killed thousands of people and left hundreds of thousands of refugees as they pursued, rounded up, and shot men, women, and children who ran through the streets or tried to swim across the fast-flowing Kajja river. The report said many drowned. Older people and injured people were not spared.\n\nThe gruesome investigation also details rape, torture and looting by the forces that \"methodically\" burned shelled, and razed neighbourhoods to the ground. The violence culminated in a large-scale massacre on 15 June where the global rights group said RSF and its affiliated forces fired on kilometre-long convoys of civilians desperately trying to flee.",

Abuses escalated again in early November. The attackers committed other serious abuses such as torture, rape, and looting. More than half a million refugees from West Darfur have fled to Chad since April 2023. As of late October 2023, 75 percent were from El Geneina.\n\n\"As the UN Security Council and governments wake up to the looming disaster in El Fasher, the large-scale atrocities committed in El Geneina should be seen as a reminder of the atrocities that could come in the absence of concerted action,\" said Tirana Hassan, executive director at Human Rights Watch. \"Governments, the African Union, and the United Nations need to act now to protect civilians.\"\n\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, targeting the Massalit people and other non-Arab communities by committing serious violations against them with the apparent objective of at least having them permanently leave the region constitutes ethnic cleansing. The particular context in which the widespread killings took place also raises the possibility that the RSF and their allies have the intent to destroy in whole or in part the Massalit in at least West Darfur, which would indicate that genocide has been and/or is being committed there.\n\nBetween June 2023 and April 2024, Human Rights Watch interviewed more than 220 people in Chad, Uganda, Kenya, and South Sudan, as well as remotely. Researchers also reviewed and analyzed over 120 photos and videos of the events, satellite imagery, and documents shared by humanitarian organizations to corroborate accounts of grave abuses.\n\nThe violence in El Geneina began nine days after fighting broke out in Khartoum, Sudan's capital city, between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), Sudan's military, and the RSF. On the morning of April 24, the RSF clashed with a Sudanese military convoy traveling through El Geneina. Then the RSF and its allied groups attacked majority Massalit neighborhoods, clashing with predominantly Massalit armed groups defending their communities. Over the following weeks - and even after Massalit armed groups lost control of their neighborhoods - the RSF and allied militias systematically targeted unarmed civilians.\n\nThe violence culminated in a large-scale massacre on June 15, when the RSF and its allies opened fire on a kilometers-long convoy of civilians desperately trying to flee, escorted by Massalit fighters. The RSF and militias pursued, rounded up, and shot men, women, and children who ran through the streets or tried to swim across the fast-flowing Kajja River. Many drowned. Older people and injured people were not spared.\n\nA 17-year-old boy described the killing of 12 children and 5 adults from several families: \"Two RSF forces ... grabb[ed] the children from their parents and, as the parents started screaming, two other RSF forces shot the parents, killing them. Then they piled up the children and shot them. They threw their bodies into the river and their belongings in after them.\"\n\nThat day and in subsequent days, the attacks continued on tens of thousands of civilians who tried to cross into Chad, leaving the countryside strewn with bodies. Videos published at the time show crowds of civilians running for their lives on the road linking El Geneina to Chad.\n\nHuman Rights Watch also documented the killing of Arab residents and the looting of Arab neighborhoods by Massalit forces, and Sudanese Armed Forces' use of explosive weapons in populated areas in ways that caused unnecessary harm to civilians and civilian objects.\n\nThe RSF and allied militias escalated their abuses again in November, targeting Massalit people who had found refuge in the El Geneina suburb of Ardamata, rounding up Massalit men and boys and, according to the UN, killing at least 1,000 people.\n\nDuring the course of these abuses, women and girls were raped and subjected to other forms of sexual violence, and detainees were tortured and otherwise ill-treated. The attackers methodically destroyed critical civilian infrastructure, targeting neighborhoods and sites, including schools, in primarily Massalit displaced communities. They looted on a grand scale; and burned, shelled, and razed neighborhoods to the ground, after emptying them of residents.\n\nThese acts were committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the Massalit and other non-Arab civilian populations of Massalit-majority neighborhoods, and as such also constitute the crimes against humanity of murder, torture, persecution, and forcible transfer of the civilian population, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nThe possibility that genocide has been and/or is being committed in Darfur requires urgent action from all governments and international institutions to protect civilians. They should ensure an investigation as to whether the facts demonstrate a specific intent on the part of the RSF leadership and its allies to destroy in whole or in part the Massalit and other non-Arab ethnic communities in West Darfur, that is, to commit genocide. If so, they should act to prevent its further perpetration and to ensure those responsible for its planning and conduct are brought to justice.\n\nThe global community should support the investigations of the International Criminal Court (ICC), while states party to the court should ensure it has the financial resources needed in its regular budget to carry out its mandate in Darfur and across its docket.\n\nHuman Rights Watch identified the commander of the RSF, Mohammed \"Hemedti\" Hamdan Dagalo, his brother Abdel Raheem Hamdan Dagalo, and the West Darfur RSF commander Joma'a Barakallah as those with command responsibility over the forces that carried out these crimes. Human Rights Watch also named RSF allies, including a commander of the Tamazuj armed group and two Arab tribal leaders, as bearing responsibility for fighters who committed serious crimes.\n\nThe rights group recommended that the United Nations in coordination with the African Union should urgently deploy a new mission to protect civilians at risk in Sudan. The Security Council should impose targeted sanctions on those responsible for serious crimes in West Darfur, and individuals and companies that have and are violating the arms embargo. It should widen the existing arms embargo on Darfur to cover all of Sudan.\n\n\"The global inaction in the face of atrocities of this magnitude is inexcusable,\" Hassan said. \"Governments should ensure those responsible are held to account, including through targeted sanctions and by stepping up cooperation with the ICC.\"", "source": {"uri": "radiotamazuj.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

Sudan's Darfur possibly 'genocide': HRW", "body": "A series of attacks by Sudanese paramilitary forces in the western region of Darfur raise the possibility of \"genocide\" against non-Arab ethnic communities, Human Rights Watch said Thursday.\n\nThe paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), along with allied militias, have been widely accused of ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity and war crimes in their war with the regular army, which began in April 2023.\n\nFor all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.\n\nThe war has killed tens of thousands, including up to 15,000 in the West Darfur town of El-Geneina, according to UN experts.\n\nThe area is the focus of the 186-page HRW report \"'The Massalit Will Not Come Home': Ethnic Cleansing and Crimes Against Humanity in El-Geneina, West Darfur, Sudan.\"\n\nIt describes \"an ethnic cleansing campaign against the ethnic Massalit and other non-Arab populations.\"\n\nFrom late April until early November of last year, the RSF and allied militias \"conducted a systematic campaign to remove, including by killing, ethnic Massalit residents,\" according to HRW.\n\nThe violence, which included atrocities such as mass torture, rape and looting, peaked in mid-June -- when thousands were killed within days -- and surged again in November.\n\nLocal human rights lawyers said they had tracked a pattern where fighters targeted \"prominent members of the Massalit community,\" including doctors, human rights defenders, local leaders and government officials.\n\nHRW added that the attackers \"methodically destroyed critical civilian infrastructure,\" primarily in communities consisting of displaced Massalit.\n\nSatellite imagery showed that since June, predominantly Massalit neighborhoods in El-Geneina have been \"systematically dismantled, many with bulldozers, preventing civilians who fled from returning to their homes,\" HRW reported.\n\nHRW said the attacks constitute \"ethnic cleansing\" as they appeared to be aimed at \"at least having them permanently leave the region.\"\n\nThe context of the killings further \"raises the possibility that the RSF and their allies have the intent to destroy in whole or in part the Massalit in at least West Darfur, which would indicate that genocide has been and/or is being committed there,\" it added.\n\n'Large-scale atrocities'\n\nHRW called for an investigation into genocidal intent, targeted sanctions on those responsible and urged the United Nations to \"widen the existing arms embargo on Darfur to cover all of Sudan.\"\n\nThe International Criminal Court, currently investigating ethnic-based killings in Darfur, says it has \"grounds to believe\" that both the paramilitaries and the army are committing \"Rome Statute crimes,\" which include war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.\n\nAnd in December, the United States said that Sudan's rival forces have both committed war crimes in their brutal conflict, accusing the RSF of ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.\n\nOver half a million Sudanese have fled the violence from Darfur into Chad, according to the latest UN figures.\n\nBy late October, 75 percent of those crossing the border were from El-Geneina, HRW said.\n\nAround 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of El-Geneina, all eyes are currently on El-Fasher in North Darfur, the only state capital not under RSF control.\n\nThe United States has warned of a disaster of \"epic proportions\" if the RSF proceeds with an expected attack, as residents fear the same fate of El-Geneina will befall them.\n\n\"As the UN Security Council and governments wake up to the looming disaster in El-Fasher, the large-scale atrocities committed in El-Geneina should be seen as a reminder of the atrocities that could come in the absence of concerted action,\" said HRW executive director Tirana Hassan.\n\nRead more:\n\nIsrael attack on Lebanon rescuers that killed 7

The RSF has origins in the government-backed janjaweed militias that perpetrated the Darfur genocide in the early 2000s.\n\n\"During their campaign, RSF fighters and allied militias used derogatory racial slurs against Masalits and people from other non-Arab ethnic groups,\" it said. \"They told them to leave, that the land was no longer theirs, and that it would be 'cleaned' and become 'the land of the Arabs.'\"\n\nA spokesperson for the RSF didn't immediately respond to questions about the report sent by email. HRW cited an RSF statement from July 2023 in which the militia reiterated its denial that its forces committed any abuses, describing the unrest in West Darfur as a \"purely tribal conflict\" in which the RSF is \"not a party,\" according to the report.\n\nConflict erupted in Sudan last April, when a long-simmering dispute between the army and the RSF exploded into a full-blown civil war. As many as 150,000 people may have been killed since then, according to US estimates, and the violence shows no sign of abating. Millions have fled their homes, leading to what the United Nations describes as the world's biggest displacement crisis.\n\nRead More: Sudan Ravaged by a Civil War the World Has Overlooked: QuickTake\n\nMany of the killings documented by HRW occurred in June, when violence gripped the city of El Geneina in West Darfur and Masalit forces lost the ability to fight back against RSF attacks.

The city is encircled by the RSF, and diplomats fear it is on the \"precipice of a large-scale massacre\".\n\nTirana Hassan, the executive director at Human Rights Watch, said: \"As the UN security council and governments wake up to looming disaster in El Fasher, the large-scale atrocities committed in El Geneina should be seen as a reminder of the atrocities that could come in the absence of concerted action.\"\n\nOne of the worst episodes of Sudan's civil war was in June when the RSF and its allies attacked a kilometres-long convoy of civilians as people tried to leave El Geneina, escorted by Masalit fighters.\n\nWitnesses told HRW researchers that the RSF had chased, rounded up and shot men, women and children who ran through streets or attempted to swim the fast-flowing seasonal Kaja River that cuts through the city. Many drowned.\n\nA 17-year-old boy described the killing of 12 children and five adults on 15 June, saying: \"Two RSF forces ... grab[bed] the children from their parents and, as the parents started screaming, two other RSF forces shot the parents, killing them.\n\n\"Then they piled up the children and shot them,\" he said. \"They threw their bodies into the river and their belongings in after them.\"\n\nFor the rest of the day and subsequent days, the attacks continued on tens of thousands of civilians as they tried to reach the border with Chad.\n\nRelated: 'Here, there is no future': ethnic cleansing and fresh atrocities drive exodus of thousands from Darfur\n\nOther attacks chronicled by HRW include another RSF attack on 15 June on a makeshift medical clinic in El Geneina, where 25 injured patients were seeking treatment.\n\nAli, who had been shot in the leg during a previous attack, said: \"They started shooting at us and killed everyone except me and a woman [who was also wounded]. They shot me in the right arm. I slumped over, pretending I was dead.\"\n\nSurrounded by corpses for 10 hours, Ali and the woman stayed still as the RSF continued their assault on the city.\n\nAt about 5pm, seven armed men in uniform came into the clinic, beating him and using racial slurs.\n\n\"One said, 'We won't kill you!

The crimes against humanity and widespread war crimes were committed in the context of an ethnic cleansing campaign against the ethnic Massalit and other non-Arab populations in and around El Geneina.\n\nThe 218-page report, \"'The Massalit Will Not Come Home': Ethnic Cleansing and Crimes Against Humanity in El Geneina, West Darfur, Sudan,\" documents that the Rapid Support Forces, an independent military force in armed conflict with the Sudan military, and their allied mainly Arab militias, including the Third-Front Tamazuj, an armed group, targeted the predominantly Massalit neighborhoods of El Geneina in relentless waves of attacks from April to June. Abuses escalated again in early November. The attackers committed other serious abuses such as torture, rape, and looting. More than half a million refugees from West Darfur have fled to Chad since April 2023. As of late October 2023, 75 percent were from El Geneina.\n\n\"As the UN Security Council and governments wake up to the looming disaster in El Fasher, the large-scale atrocities committed in El Geneina should be seen as a reminder of the atrocities that could come in the absence of concerted action,\" said Tirana Hassan, executive director at Human Rights Watch. \"Governments, the African Union, and the United Nations need to act now to protect civilians.\"\n\nTargeting the Massalit people and other non-Arab communities by committing serious violations against them with the apparent objective of at least having them permanently leave the region constitutes ethnic cleansing. The particular context in which the widespread killings took place also raises the possibility that the RSF and their allies have the intent to destroy in whole or in part the Massalit in at least West Darfur, which would indicate that genocide has been and/or is being committed there.\n\nBetween June 2023 and April 2024, Human Rights Watch interviewed more than 220 people in Chad, Uganda, Kenya, and South Sudan, as well as remotely. Researchers also reviewed and analyzed over 120 photos and videos of the events, satellite imagery, and documents shared by humanitarian organizations to corroborate accounts of grave abuses.\n\nThe violence in El Geneina began nine days after fighting broke out in Khartoum, Sudan's capital city, between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), Sudan's military, and the RSF. On the morning of April 24, the RSF clashed with a Sudanese military convoy travelling through El Geneina. Then the RSF and its allied groups attacked majority Massalit neighborhoods, clashing with predominantly Massalit armed groups defending their communities. Over the following weeks - and even after Massalit armed groups lost control of their neighborhoods - the RSF and allied militias systematically targeted unarmed civilians.\n\nThe violence culminated in a large-scale massacre on June 15, when the RSF and its allies opened fire on a kilometers-long convoy of civilians desperately trying to flee, escorted by Massalit fighters. The RSF and militias pursued, rounded up, and shot men, women, and children who ran through the streets or tried to swim across the fast-flowing Kajja river. Many drowned. Older people and injured people were not spared.\n\nA 17-year-old boy described the killing of 12 children and 5 adults from several families: \"Two RSF forces ... grabb[ed] the children from their parents and, as the parents started screaming, two other RSF forces shot the parents, killing them. Then they piled up the children and shot them. They threw their bodies into the river and their belongings in after them.\"\n\nThat day and in subsequent days, the attacks continued on tens of thousands of civilians who tried to cross into Chad, leaving the countryside strewn with bodies. Videos published at the time show crowds of civilians running for their lives on the road linking El Geneina to Chad.\n\nHuman Rights Watch also documented the killing of Arab residents and the looting of Arab neighborhoods by Massalit forces, and Sudanese Armed Forces' use of explosive weapons in populated areas in ways that caused unnecessary harm to civilians and civilian objects.\n\nThe RSF and allied militias escalated their abuses again in November, targeting Massalit people who had found refuge in the El Geneina suburb of Ardamata, rounding up Massalit men and boys and, according to the UN, killing at least 1,000 people.\n\nDuring the course of these abuses, women and girls were raped and subjected to other forms of sexual violence, and detainees were tortured and otherwise ill-treated. The attackers methodically destroyed critical civilian infrastructure, targeting neighborhoods and sites, including schools, in primarily Massalit displaced communities. They looted on a grand scale; and burned, shelled, and razed neighborhoods to the ground, after emptying them of residents.\n\nThese acts were committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the Massalit and other non-Arab civilian populations of Massalit-majority neighborhoods, and as such also constitute the crimes against humanity of murder, torture, persecution, and forcible transfer of the civilian population, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nThe possibility that genocide has been and/or is being committed in Darfur requires urgent action from all governments and international institutions to protect civilians. They should ensure investigation as to whether the facts demonstrate a specific intent on the part of the RSF leadership and its allies to destroy in whole or in part the Massalit and other non-Arab ethnic communities in West Darfur, that is, to commit genocide. If so, they should act to prevent its further perpetration, and to ensure those responsible for its planning and conduct are brought to justice.\n\nThe global community should support the investigations of the International Criminal Court (ICC), while states party to the court should ensure it has the financial resources needed in its regular budget to carry out its mandate in Darfur and across its docket.\n\nHuman Rights Watch identified the commander of the RSF, Mohammed \"Hemedti\" Hamdan Dagalo, his brother Abdel Raheem Hamdan Dagalo, and the West Darfur RSF commander Joma'a Barakallah as those with command responsibility over the forces that carried out these crimes. Human Rights Watch also named RSF allies, including a commander of the Tamazuj armed group and two Arab tribal leaders, as bearing responsibility for fighters that committed serious crimes.\n\nThe United Nations in coordination with the African Union should urgently deploy a new mission to protect civilians at risk in Sudan. The Security Council should impose targeted sanctions on those responsible for serious crimes in West Darfur, and individuals and companies that have and are violating the arms embargo. It should widen the existing arms embargo on Darfur to cover all of Sudan.\n\n\"The global inaction in the face of atrocities of this magnitude is inexcusable,\" Hassan said. \"Governments should ensure those responsible are held to account, including through targeted sanctions and by stepping up cooperation with the ICC.\"", "source": {"uri": "hrw.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Human

series of attacks by Sudanese paramilitary forces in the western region of Darfur raise the possibility of \"genocide\" against non-Arab ethnic communities, Human Rights Watch said Thursday.\n\nThe paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), along with allied militias, have been widely accused of ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity, and war crimes in their war with the regular army, which began in April 2023.\n\nThe war has killed tens of thousands, including up to 15,000 in the West Darfur town of El-Geneina, according to UN experts.\n\nThe area is the focus of the 186-page HRW report The Massalit Will Not Come Home': Ethnic Cleansing and Crimes Against Humanity in El-Geneina, West Darfur, Sudan.\n\nIt describes \"an ethnic cleansing campaign against the ethnic Massalit and other non-Arab populations.\"\n\nFrom late April until early November of last year, the RSF and allied militias \"conducted a systematic campaign to remove, including by killing, ethnic Massalit residents,\" according to HRW.\n\nThe violence, which included atrocities such as mass torture, rape, and looting, peaked in mid-June -- when thousands were killed within days -- and surged again in November.\n\nLocal human rights lawyers said they had tracked a pattern where fighters targeted \"prominent members of the Massalit community,\" including doctors, human rights defenders, local leaders, and government officials.\n\nHRW added that the attackers \"methodically destroyed critical civilian infrastructure,\" primarily in communities consisting of displaced Massalit.\n\nSatellite imagery showed that since June, predominantly Massalit neighborhoods in El-Geneina have been \"systematically dismantled, many with bulldozers, preventing civilians who fled from returning to their homes,\" HRW reported.\n\nHRW said the attacks constitute \"ethnic cleansing\" as they appeared to be aimed at \"at least having them permanently leave the region.\"\n\nThe context of the killings further \"raises the possibility that the RSF and their allies have the intent to destroy in whole or in part the Massalit in at least West Darfur, which would indicate that genocide has been and/or is being committed there,\" it added.\n\nHRW called for an investigation into genocidal intent, targeted sanctions on those responsible, and urged the United Nations to \"widen the existing arms embargo on Darfur to cover all of Sudan.\"\n\nThe International Criminal Court, currently investigating ethnic-based killings in Darfur, says it has \"grounds to believe\" that both the paramilitaries and the army are committing \"Rome Statute crimes,\" which include war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.\n\nAnd in December, the United States said that Sudan's rival forces have both committed war crimes in their brutal conflict, accusing the RSF of ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.\n\nOver half a million Sudanese have fled the violence from Darfur into Chad, according to the latest UN figures.\n\nBy late October, 75 percent of those crossing the border were from El-Geneina, HRW said.\n\nAround 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of El-Geneina, all eyes are currently on El-Fasher in North Darfur, the only state capital not under RSF control.\n\nThe United States has warned of a disaster of \"epic proportions\" if the RSF proceeds with an expected attack, as residents fear the same fate as El-Geneina will befall them.\n\n\"As the UN Security Council and governments wake up to the looming disaster in El-Fasher, the large-scale atrocities committed in El-Geneina should be seen as a reminder of the atrocities that could come in the absence of concerted action,\" said HRW executive director Tirana Hassan.", "source": {"uri": "thedefensepost.com", "dataType":

Witnesses describe children, still alive, being \"piled up and shot\" by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) as they attempted to escape the regional capital of El Geneina in June last year during a bout of ethnic violence in which thousands of civilians were killed.\n\nTogether, the 221 witness statements collated by Human Rights Watch offer the latest evidence that the Arab-led RSF has orchestrated a concerted 12-month campaign of ethnic cleansing against Sudan's non-Arab Masalit tribe in West Darfur. The United Nations and African Union should, says HRW, urgently impose an arms embargo on Sudan and deploy a mission with a robust police force to Darfur, the sprawling region in the west of the country, to protect civilians.\n\nA HRW report published Wednesday calls for sanctions for those ultimately responsible for widespread war crimes, including the West Darfur RSF commander Abdel Rahman Joma'a Barakallah, along with the notorious commander of the RSF, Mohamed \"Hemedti\" Hamdan Dagalo, and his brother Abdel Raheem. Since fighting erupted between the RSF and Sudan's military in April 2023, more than 8 million people have fled their homes amid a humanitarian crisis that the UN warns is one of the largest in decades.\n\nThe current flashpoint, El Fasher, is the last city held by Sudan's military in Darfur. The city is encircled by the RSF, and diplomats fear it is on the \"precipice of a large-scale massacre\".

By late October, 75% of those crossing the border were from El-Geneina,\" HRW said.\n\nAround 400 km (250 miles) east of El-Geneina, all eyes are currently on El-Fasher in North Darfur, the only state capital not under RSF control. The United States has warned of a disaster of \"epic proportions\" if the RSF proceeds with an expected attack, as residents fear the same fate of El-Geneina will befall them.\n\n\"As the UN Security Council and governments wake up to the looming disaster in El-Fasher, the large-scale atrocities committed in El-Geneina should be seen as a reminder of the atrocities that could come in the absence

Governments, the African Union, and the United Nations need to act now to protect civilians.\"\n\nThe call comes as Human Rights Watch releases a comprehensive 218-page report, \"'The Massalit Will Not Come Home': Ethnic Cleansing and Crimes Against Humanity in El Geneina, West Darfur, Sudan,\" which details the RSF's systematic attacks on predominantly Massalit neighbourhoods from April to November 2023. These attacks have resulted in thousands of deaths and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes, with over half a million refugees escaping to Chad.\n\nThe violence in El Geneina began on April 24, 2023, following a clash between the RSF and a Sudanese military convoy. The RSF, along with their allied Arab militias, launched a relentless assault on Massalit neighbourhoods. Despite the loss of control by Massalit armed groups, the RSF continued to target unarmed civilians. The brutality peaked on June 15, when RSF forces massacred a convoy of civilians attempting to flee, killing men, women, and children indiscriminately. Many drowned while trying to escape across the KajjaRiver.\n\nEyewitnesses provided chilling accounts of the violence. A 17-year-old boy recounted the horrific killing of 12 children and 5 adults: \"Two RSF forces grabbed the children from their parents and, as the parents started screaming, two other RSF forces shot the parents, killing them. Then they piled up the children and shot them. They threw their bodies into the river and their belongings in after them.\"\n\nThe RSF and allied militias resumed their attacks in November, targeting Massalit people who had sought refuge in the El Geneina suburb of Ardamata. Reports from the UN indicate that at least 1,000 people were killed during these attacks. Women and girls were subjected to rape and other forms of sexual violence, and detainees were tortured. The militias systematically destroyed civilian infrastructure, including schools, and looted on a grand scale.\n\nInternational accountability\n\nHuman Rights Watch has identified key figures responsible for the violence, including RSF commander Mohamed \"Hemetti\" Hamdan Daglo and his brother Abdel Rahim Hamdan Dagalo.\n\nThe organization calls for immediate international action to prevent further atrocities, including targeted sanctions and enhanced support for the International Criminal Court (ICC) investigations.\n\nThe report underscores the urgent need for global intervention to stop the ongoing ethnic cleansing and ensure accountability for the crimes committed.

More than 570,000 people, mostly Masalit, were displaced and sought refuge in neighboring Chad.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said the campaign of attacks on the non-Arab people in Darfur, including the Masalit, with the \"apparent objective\" of pushing them out, \"constitutes ethnic cleansing.\"\n\n\"Governments, the African Union, and the United Nations need to act now to protect civilians,\" Tirana Hassan, HRW's executive director, said Thursday.\n\n\"The global inaction in the face of atrocities of this magnitude is inexcusable,\" Hassan said. \"Government should ensure those responsible are held to account.\"\n\nThe group called for the United Nations, African Union and states from the International Criminal Court to investigate whether the atrocities documented in the report reveal a specific intent by the RSF paramilitary and armed allies \"to commit genocide\" by destroying the Masalit and other non-Arab groups in West Darfur.\n\nThe media office of the Rapid Support Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn late January, the International Criminal Court's prosecutor, Karim Khan, said there are grounds to believe both the RSF and the Sudanese military may be committing war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide in Darfur.\n\nTwo decades ago, Darfur became synonymous with genocide and war crimes, particularly by the notorious Janjaweed Arab militias, against populations that identify as Central or East African.\n\nThe Rapid Support Forces were formed from Janjaweed fighters by former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who ruled the country for three decades before being overthrown during a popular uprising in 2019. He is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of genocide and other crimes during the conflict in Darfur in the 2000s.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It said its researchers also reviewed and analysed more than 120 photographs and videos of the events, satellite imagery and documents shared by humanitarian groups to corroborate accounts of abuses.\n\nSudan descended into chaos in April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the RSF, lef by Mohamed \"Hemedti\" Dagalo, broke out into street battles in the capital, Khartoum.\n\nEl-Geneina, where Masalits make up more than half of the population, has seen some of the fiercest fighting outside Khartoum since.\n\nThe UN's World Food Programme last week warned of the deteriorating situation in Darfur, where aid has been cut off as advancing RSF forces attempt to take control of el-Fasher, where an estimated 500,000 displaced civilians are sheltering.\n\n\"As the UN Security Council and governments wake up to the looming disaster in El Fasher, the large-scale atrocities committed in El Geneina should be seen as a reminder of the atrocities that could come in the absence of concerted action,\" said HRW executive director Tirana Hassan.\n\nMore than half a million refugees from West Darfur have fled to Chad since April 2023. As of late October 2023, 75 percent were from el-Geneina, HRW said, as it called for the UN and the African Union to sanction those responsible and impose an arms embargo on the RSF.\n\n\"Frankly it would take very high-level political focus on trying to pressure those who are arming the various sides and have the actual belligerence themselves to stop this.

The United Nations has said between 10,000 and 15,000 people were killed by the RSF in El Geneina, a city of around 540,000.\n\nEl Fashir, the final regional capital in the western Darfur region still under government control, has now been surrounded by the RSF and fears a similar fate.\n\n\"We saw what happened in El Geneina, so we fear dying in a horrific way as well,\" said Ahmed Saleh, who has volunteered for a local self-defense group. \"We have no choice but to fight because we have nowhere to go if the RSF gets here.\"\n\nThe people of El Fashir, home to nearly 2 million residents and 800,000 displaced civilians, say the kinds of abuses described in the report are why they are growing increasingly desperate. RSF fighters and allied militias have attacked and burned numerous villages as they encircled the city, and residents say trucks carrying food are stopped from entering unless they pay bribes at checkpoints.\n\n\"The whole area around me is on alert, and almost all of the young men carry weapons,\" Saleh said. \"There is no place for us other than El Fashir. We cannot leave. We can only be buried here.\"\n\nThe 13-month-old civil war pits Sudan's military, led by Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, against the paramilitary RSF and its allied militias. In the vast arid western region of Darfur, regional capitals have fallen one after the other to the RSF, including El Geneina in November.\n\nSurvivors who escaped the city told Human Rights Watch researchers that RSF fighters and their allies had fired into columns of fleeing civilians, and one described children and infants ripped from their parents' arms before the family was slaughtered. Men and boys were especially targeted, and one teenage boy was instructed to slit the throats of his friends.\n\nA senior adviser and delegation member of the RSF, Ezzaddean Elsafi, denied that the group has committed atrocities and said the report contains \"huge disinformation and many false news,\" notably accounts that his group singled out the Black Masalit tribe.\n\n\"There is no discrimination against Masalit tribe. They are currently living peacefully in many cities in west Darfur including El Geneina,\" he said. Many people were killed in the city, he said, but they were from multiple ethnic groups, and the RSF \"did not target civilians.\"\n\nHe also denied that the RSF is taking bribes at checkpoints outside El Fashir.\n\nEl Fashir has so far held out while the rest of Darfur has fallen because it is also home to its own powerful, heavily armed ethnically based armed group -- many coming from the Black Zaghawa tribe -- that fought its own war against the government in the 2000s. For two decades, it battled the military and the allied Janjaweed -- an ethnically Arab paramilitary force that later became the RSF and turned on the army -- before a 2020 peace deal ended the war. That conflict resulted in accusations of genocide against Sudan's then-ruler.\n\nThe showdown for El Fashir has been looming ever since the former rebels allied themselves with the government against the RSF. To swell the city's defenses, reinforcements of former rebel fighters have careened down from Libya, where many work as mercenaries, in dust-choked convoys.\n\n\"The entire city is under siege,\" one member of civil society in El Fashir said. \"People are terrified. All the news that is coming across is that El Fashir will be attacked very soon. RSF members have made many videos warning the people of El Fashir that they are coming.\" He spoke on the condition of anonymity because RSF forces went after leaders, activists and lawyers in El Geneina, with fighters going house to house with a list of people to target.\n\n\"A conflict over El Fashir would be catastrophic for innocent civilians trapped in the city. Many would be killed. Significant bloodshed in El Fashir would likely expand and metastasize the conflict across Darfur and possibly beyond,\" said Toby Harward, the United Nations' deputy humanitarian coordinator for Sudan. \"We cannot allow history to repeat itself in Darfur.", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and Stripes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Support_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapid Support Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Geneina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darfur", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darfur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darfur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masalit_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Masalit people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tribe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human Rights Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramilitary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paramilitary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethnic cleansing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_execution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summary execution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siege"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nairobi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nairobi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nairobi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdel_Fattah_al-Burhan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abdel Fattah al-Burhan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethnicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaghawa_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zaghawa people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janjaweed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Janjaweed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Libya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Libya"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.stripes.com/incoming/h2sntm-0905202sudanviolencephotos01.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/0905202sudanviolencephotos01.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551281", "eventUri": "eng-9551281", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nairobi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5686274509803921, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

He went to law school and, afterwards, established a human rights organization named al-Juzur (Roots in English).\n\nIn April 2023, fighting broke out and quickly spread as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), an independent military force, and allied militias fought Sudan's army. In El Geneina, the capital city of West Darfur where Jamal lived, the RSF and affiliated militias, both of which include former Janjaweed, once again targeted people on an ethnic basis, echoing the atrocities of 20 years ago.\n\nAt first, Jamal and his colleagues documented the waves of attacks by the RSF and the militias. These forces attacked the predominantly Massalit areas of El Geneina, killing, raping, and torturing people as well as assailing people displaced by previous bouts of violence, and at times, destroying whole neighborhoods. The onslaught targeted Massalit and other non-Arab groups in a campaign of ethnic cleansing - with atrocities that amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nBy mid-June 2023, the unrelenting attacks on Jamal's community reached a crisis point and he fled for his life.\n\n\"I didn't think I would survive this,\" Jamal said.\n\nJamal faced discrimination from the beginning of his life. \"We were ethnically discriminated against in the schools. We were targeted based on our skin color. We used to be beaten up when we spoke our mother [tongue], we were asked to speak only in Arabic,\" he told Human Rights Watch from a refugee camp in Chad. His family lived in West Darfur, in the ethnically diverse state in western Sudan that Massalit people see as their homeland. At the time, Sudan's federal government imposed an Arab-centric culture on everyone.\n\nIn 2003, armed groups from non-Arab communities in Darfur, including Massalit, revolted against Sudan's authoritarian government. They wanted to end the government's Arabization agenda, oppressive policies, and the economic and political marginalization of western Sudan. In response, between 2003 and 2005 government forces and Janjaweed militias, which recruited members from nomadic Arab communities who frequently fought with Massalit farmers over water and land, carried out an ethnic cleansing campaign against non-Arab communities, killing hundreds of thousands. The International Criminal Court indicted Sudan's then-president, Omar al-Bashir, for the crime of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.\n\nDuring this ethnic cleansing campaign, Jamal witnessed attacks on his largely Massalit village, and when he was 10, he saw his uncle ambushed and killed. \"I lost so many family members from both my mother and father's side, especially my father's ... [dozens] of them were killed during these wars and clashes.\"\n\nWhile he studied law at a university in Sudan's capital, Khartoum, Jamal headed the Association of Students of Darfur and was arrested four times there for protesting massacres and discrimination in Darfur. After passing the international bar association exam, he returned to West Darfur, where he founded Juzur in El Geneina.\n\n\"I felt that my duty is to spend my whole life defending and fighting for human rights,\" he said.\n\nIn October 2021, two generals staged a coup in Sudan, ending a period of transition that was meant to lead to the emergence of a civilian-led government. Roughly 18 months later, on April 15, 2023, fighting broke out in Khartoum between the forces these generals controlled, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the RSF.\n\nThe RSF had been established nearly a decade before that to formalize the Janjaweed among other government militias. The RSF committed widespread abuses in Darfur and beyond since then.\n\n\"I woke at 7 a.m. in the morning on April 24. While I was brushing my teeth I heard [rocket fire] very close to my house, around 500 meters away,\" he said. \"It escalated quickly. Later we learned that clashes had erupted between the Sudanese Army Forces and the Rapid Support Forces.\" The RSF headquarters was located near Jamal's home in the al-Jamarek neighborhood.\n\nEvents escalated rapidly. Jamal said that the next day, the offices of several international organizations were raided. \"Medical supplies, cars and ambulances were stolen from the Ministry of Health building. El Geneina Teaching Hospital and [the building with] blood banks were also broken into. Medical equipment and supplies were stolen by the militias and the RSF,\" Jamal said. His home was attacked, and his family fled, leaving everything behind.\n\nIn the following days, these forces looted the market, burning shops, Jamal said. Juzur's office was attacked as well; fortunately, no one was killed. A second attack on Juzur's office roughly two weeks later, though, would leave one of Jamal's colleagues dead, their library torched, and office equipment destroyed.\n\n\"April 27 was one of the bloodiest days,\" he said. The RSF and militias attacked camps housing internally displaced people, as well as schools and mosques.\n\nAfter the first four days of heavy attack, there was a lull in large-scale attacks, but the abuses continued. Jamal believed the forces were trying to besiege his community: \"There was a siege around the city with snipers on the main roads of El Geneina, it was impossible to even go get food or drinking water. That was their starvation plan, to kill people out of hunger and thirst. If you tried to go out, you [would] get shot immediately.\" The RSF and allied militias also set fire to water stations and destroyed wells.\n\nOn May 12, the attacks ramped up again. By now, most Massalit people in and around El Geneina had fled to be near the general secretariat, a government building, and the governor's house, where Massalit self-defense forces had gathered. The crowding meant \"very poor living conditions,\" including the spread of measles, according to Jamal. This was \"in addition to the huge numbers of wounded and injured people who couldn't access the needed healthcare.\"\n\nFrom the onset of the fighting, the RSF and their allies targeted Massalit people and other non-Arabs. \"They were also systematically hunting and targeting the activists, educated [people] and human rights advocates,\" Jamal said.\n\nJamal and his colleagues from Juzur used paper and pen to document as many attacks as they could, inputting what they learned into the single laptop they shared. Twelve people killed while sheltering in girls' schools. Five people, including a child, killed in a mosque. Eight people trapped and killed in their home. And on and on.\n\nDuring seven weeks of attacks, the SAF were not there to protect the people of El Geneina. They had retreated to their headquarters in Ardamata, Jamal said, a short distance north of the city, on the first day of the fighting. Only the Massalit self-defense groups were left to protect the community and fight the RSF and affiliated militias, he said.\n\nThe Clinic\n\nDuring the conflict, injured Massalit people only had access to a handful of volunteer-run makeshift clinics. At one of them, the Sadaqa clinic, Jamal said he and his colleagues documented the cases of people who were brought there - close to 1,000 deaths and 2,000 injuries from late April until mid-June. For their part, the activists from Juzur brought the doctors meals and water.\n\nOn May 14, Jamal's friend, Mudather Abdallah Abdel Rahman, called to say he was injured, and he asked Jamal to come to another clinic, which Dr. Mohamed Adam Khatir had founded in his home. But as Jamal neared the clinic, he saw RSF fighters and ducked into a nearby house. The fighters fired their weapons into the clinic; screaming followed. Then silence. Jamal waited until they were gone and then went into the clinic. Twelve people were dead, including doctors he knew.\n\n\"I found my friend Mudather ... sitting casually and resting his head on his hand as if he were sleeping. He looked very normal. I started calling his name to wake him up. I shook his hand and then his legs. Then I realized he was dead.\"\n\nIn June, the attacks escalated in intensity. On June 14, the RSF and allied militias staged attacks across El Geneina's neighborhoods. It was also the day West Darfur's governor - a man who had met with Jamal and other activists to hear their concerns - was brutally killed, last seen in the custody of the RSF.\n\nAlso on June 14, the defenses staged by the Massalit fighters collapsed.\n\nBetween late April and the end of June, an estimated 167,000 people fled from Sudan to Chad, the vast majority from West Darfur. As of early May 2024, over half a million had crossed.\n\nAfter the attacks of June 14, 2023, tens of thousands of people in El Geneina decided to flee at the same time in a convoy, kilometers-long, heading north through the city and towards the Sudanese army's military base at Ardamata, about six kilometers from downtown El Geneina.\n\nJamal had - repeatedly - decided to stay. \"It [is] hard to escape and leave your family behind,\" he said. \"It [is] so hard to leave your country, we are very sentimental, we are attached to our homes and our people.\"\n\nBut now, as violence consumed his city, he decided to flee.\n\nHe and his friend, Yousef Haroun Kabello, who was injured, took a car with acquaintances. But because of the crowds, the pace of evacuation was glacial.\n\n\"Some [people] were riding on donkeys' and horses' backs,\" Jamal said. \"Some were taking cars, some were going on motorbikes and rickshaws. Some injured people were being [transported] on wheelbarrows. Some people were walking while carrying their elderly and injured people on their backs. The street was narrow and crowded, people [were] moving in one long line.\"\n\nThe throng's size and slow speed left them vulnerable.\n\nShortly before sunrise, near the northern al Naseem neighborhood, people wearing RSF uniforms and allied militias appeared, ordering everyone in cars to get out. The armed forces shot out the car tires, then fired into the crowd. \"They were shooting on ... children, women, old and young men. Everyone,\" Jamal said.\n\nJamal and Kabello ran and hid in a pharmacy. \"We witnessed the massacre happening live, hundreds of people dropped dead and injured in front of us.\"\n\nThey tried to run and cross a nearby wadi - Arabic for a seasonal riverbed - but were surprised to find it full of water - and Kabello couldn't swim.\n\nHundreds of panicked people started fleeing into the stream, Jamal recalled. The armed men \"shot them inside the water. Some people were shot before entering the water.\" The armed men used machine guns, rifles, and Dushkas, a heavy Soviet machine gun, he said.\n\nHe and Kabello doubled back. \"We found many dead bodies scattered everywhere. Some of them people we knew, but of course we couldn't even stop or try to check on them.\" They fled with three women, who, when they stopped to discuss a hiding spot, were shot from behind. Three male youths who went back to check on them were also shot.\n\nJamal, Kabello, and others switched direction from the army base, now heading west towards the Chadian city of Adr\u00e9, about 35 kilometers from El Geneina. Jamal spotted a friend driving an uncovered truck carrying women and children, and he asked him to also take Kabello. \"He said his vehicle was already full, but we managed to squeeze him [Kabello] in. But there was no place for me.\" Jamal followed behind on the dirt road by foot.\n\nJamal and others in the crowd were far behind the Massalit fighters of the Sudanese Alliance when vehicles carrying RSF fighters and other militias appeared on the road on the western outskirts of El Geneina. \"They opened fire on the crowds, and they killed [many] people.\"\n\nJamal ran away, and a 9-year-old child, crying hysterically, ran after him, trying to grab him. When the child caught him, Jamal fell. He was exhausted. He told the child to run, but the child was too scared. Instead, they hid among small bushes.\n\nRSF fighters found them and others, Jamal said, and took their phones and money, beating them with whips, iron bars, and the stocks of their rifles. At one point, the RSF ordered everyone - there were seven of them - to lie down, faces to the ground. \"The beating and torturing intensified. The kid couldn't stand that anymore, and he got up,\" Jamal said. \"They immediately shot him in the head.\"\n\nEventually, the fighters released those who survived, and they hid again, only to be found by another group of RSF fighters. This group opened fire near Jamal's hiding place to flush him out, shouting ethnic slurs referring to black people.\n\nA fighter ordered Jamal to lie down, facing Mecca, the direction which Muslims face to pray. He ordered Jamal to say the Shahada, an Islamic declaration of faith one makes before dying, three times. Then the fighter asked Jamal if he'd like to be shot or have his throat slit.\n\n\"I said 'shoot me.'\"\n\nThe RSF fighter prepared his weapon for firing before asking, \"Should I kill you or spare you?\"\n\nThey released the whole group. It was June 15, time for evening prayer, Jamal noted. It was also about to rain.\n\nJamal and five others decided that to survive they needed to get to Adr\u00e9, Chad.\n\nThey waited until the deep of night to travel to better avoid more forces. None in the group had traveled to Chad before, but they heard you could see Adr\u00e9's lights from a distance.\n\nThey walked silently through the bush, avoiding roads.\n\nThey came to a mountain and saw a large group of people - there could be safety in numbers - but this group made noise and smoked cigarettes, so Jamal's group left. They found water at the mountaintop, then descended the mountain and arrived in the Sudanese border town, Adikong.\n\nThey kept walking as the sun rose. They knew they must be close to Chad.\n\nSuddenly, they saw two men in RSF uniforms to the west. The men called them over, but Jamal and the others ran in the opposite direction. \"They started firing bullets above our heads.\"\n\nThen, ahead of them, they saw men with whips and uniforms that looked like RSF who also called out to them. In fear, they turned around again, to run back. But these men ran after them, saying they were from the Chadian army, showing them the Chadian flag on their uniforms, that this was the border to Chad. Once Jamal and the others realized they really were Chadian soldiers, they crossed the Sudan-Chad border to safety.\n\n\"They welcomed us and told us that we are safe ... and told us that many of our people had arrived before us,\" Jamal said.\n\nAcross the border, \"we found community, they gave us biscuits, tea, and food,\" Jamal said. People arrived in Adr\u00e9 barefoot, and people bought them new shoes.\n\n\"The solidarity they offered us was unmatched,\" Jamal said. \"I arrived in Douane Souq [market] barefoot. People began hugging me and crying, and military men were also hugging us and crying. They felt our agony, sympathized with us and offered us everything.\"\n\nSoon after, Jamal collapsed and was taken to the hospital. \"There I found my friend Kabello! He made it safely, with another man from his group.\" However, the sixteen other companions in the car, including the driver, had all been killed.\n\nJamal faced struggles in Adr\u00e9. While new camps had been built for the influx of people from West Darfur, the quality of water and food was poor. People also feared that the RSF or Arab militias would infiltrate the camps. \"We ran into militiamen in the Adr\u00e9 market,\" he said. Jamal and others received threatening messages via WhatsApp and Messenger.\n\nStill, he has hope. \"I hope that [West] Darfur ... will recover and become a safe haven for us, and [that] we go back in the near future.\" But for this to happen, he believes, local, national and international organizations need to work together and end the conflict. It also requires the establishment of a justice system - he'd like to see a joint court operated by teams from Sudan, Africa more broadly, and the International Criminal Court - where perpetrators can be held accountable for the human rights abuses that they committed. Also, it's not just the RSF and allied militias who should be condemned, he said, but also the Sudanese army for not protecting civilians.\n\nThis is what he's waiting for: justice and peace for West Darfur and all of Sudan.", "source": {"uri": "hrw.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Human Rights Watch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Support_Forces",

This vast region in the west of the country is the fiefdom of the RSF and is marked by deep-rooted ethnic tensions, so there were fears that the conflict would take on a dimension of its own.\n\nThose omens were soon fulfilled and the advances of the RSF in the region have been accompanied by numerous atrocities. Violence against civilians in Sudan is widespread, but in Darfur it takes on a markedly ethnic character against local non-Arab communities, with the intention of wiping them off the map in campaigns that more and more observers and human rights organizations believe could amount to genocide.\n\nThe atrocity of the crimes in Darfur are alarming given the recent history of the region. They come two decades after former President Omar al-Bashir launched a devastating counterinsurgency campaign there against armed movements of non-Arab communities rising up against his policies of marginalization and plunder. Al-Bashir's regime exploited local tensions arising from the growing competition between non-Arab farming communities and Arab pastoralist communities for increasingly scarce natural resources.\n\nMany considered that Al-Bashir's offensive led resulted in the ethnic cleansing of non-Arab communities, mainly Massalit, Fur and Zaghawa. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed, a scorched earth policy was applied against entire villages and large tracts of land, vast territories were forcibly depopulated, and sexual violence against women and girls was used systematically. Part of the militias to which the state delegated the campaign were institutionalized years later as the Rapid Support Forces.\n\nThe largest atrocities so far have been perpetrated in the capital of West Darfur, Geneina, which is mostly populated by the Massalit community. Between late April and early November 2023, the RSF and allied militias carried out a campaign of ethnic cleansing according to a report released Thursday by Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe massacres in Geneina were in some ways the chronicle of a tragedy foretold. The convulsive period that began in Sudan in 2019 with the fall of Al-Bashir, attempts to redefine Darfur's political and security architecture, and the withdrawal of United Nations and African Union peacekeepers led to great instability and left Geneina, which suffered three large-scale attacks in just three years, dangerously exposed. \"Between 2019 and now [there have been] numerous major attacks on the same Massalit civilian population, and in none of these cases has there been any accountability,\" notes Mohamed Osman, one of the authors of the HRW report. \"It is carried out by the same groups, the Rapid Support Forces and allied militias, [and] there is no accountability, no real investigations, and no prioritization of civilian protection.\"\n\nJust 10 days after clashes broke out between the army and the Rapid Support Forces in Khartoum in April 2023, the two engaged in brief fighting in Geneina. And what followed was two months of systematic attacks and looting by paramilitaries and allied militias in Massalit-majority neighborhoods and internally displaced people (IDP) centers. The situation deteriorated seriously on June 14, when the Massalit self-defense groups collapsed and the governor of West Darfur, Jamis Abbakar, was arrested and killed. A first mass exodus then took place in two directions: toward Chad and to Ardamata, a northern suburb of Geneina that hosts a garrison of the regular Sudanese Armed Forces. From dawn the following day, the paramilitaries and their allied militias set about expelling, house by house, those who had stayed behind. They also ambushed those who fled, who were subjected to widespread beatings, executions, and extortion, according to HRW's exhaustive report. The escape roads were strewn with corpses.\n\nIn early November the final blow came. The RSF and their allies stormed Ardamata. Survivors told HRW that they again opened fire on fleeing civilians, executed people in their homes, detained hundreds, including children, carried out mass looting and set fire to residential areas. The RSF, which recruits mostly from Arab communities in Darfur, were central to all these attacks and the abuses that accompanied them, and the HRW report notes that Arab tribal militias apparently provided the majority of men. Another armed group of unclear origins, but allied with the paramilitaries, was also involved and some witnesses claimed to have seen foreign fighters in their ranks. Opposing them were Massalit self-defense groups and an armed movement led by Abbakar - the Sudanese Alliance - which were much smaller and less well-armed, and thus unable to stop the coup. The army and police failed to intervene.\n\nThe string of atrocities in the campaign against Geneina was harrowing: widespread killings in houses, streets and checkpoints, the use of explosives in densely populated areas, targeted killings of prominent members of the community, rape, torture, and arbitrary arrests.\n\nThe paramilitaries also deliberately looted, vandalized and burned down Massalit neighborhoods, attacked clinics and medical personnel, markets, critical infrastructure, and prevented community members from accessing places of refuge, food, and water, in an apparent attempt to severely undermine their ability to one day return, HRW concludes. A United Nations panel of experts asserted that the assaults were planned and coordinated, according to a document leaked in December, which estimated the number of people killed at between 10,000 and 15,000 according to intelligence sources. HRW also documented significant coordination between the attacking forces in and around Geneina.\n\nAlthough Geneina suffered the largest campaign of atrocities in Darfur, it was not the only place targeted. Numerous other non-Arab majority towns, particularly in West Darfur, have suffered similar assaults. Between April and July 2023 alone, paramilitaries and their allies attacked and burned at least seven villages in the region, according to HRW. The best documented case is the town of Misterei, from which the army withdrew in April, leaving it vulnerable to a possible attack. This came the following month, when the RSF and allied militias stormed the town in SUVs, on motorcycles, on horseback and on foot. They killed about 100 Massalits, shot those trying to flee, and looted and burned hundreds of homes, according to a report by the Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law.\n\nIn North Darfur, a stronghold of non-Arab armed movements, similar massacres have also occurred. Last June, paramilitaries and allied militias stormed Kutum, a town 120 kilometers from the provincial capital, El Fasher, killing more than 40 people and wounding dozens, according to the Raoul Wallenberg Institute, which has documented a similar attack in at least one town with a majority Fur population. This report, which was endorsed by some 30 experts, concludes that the atrocities carried out by the Rapid Support Forces and allied militias in West Darfur are intended to destroy the Massalit community in whole or in part, and thus constitute a case of ongoing genocide. The institute also believes there is reason to believe that these forces are committing genocide against other non-Arab groups.\n\nThe United Nations special adviser on the prevention of genocide, Alice Wairimu Nderitu, stated in November that several of the attacks in Darfur \"could constitute acts of genocide.\" Soon after, the United States determined that the situation has \"disturbing echoes of the genocide that began nearly 20 years ago in Darfur.\" The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, announced as early as July 2023 that his office is investigating crimes in West Darfur.\n\nAll these precedents mean that the worst is now feared in North Darfur. In April, the RSF launched a major offensive in the state and is now preparing to attack El Fasher, one of Sudan's most populous cities and a haven for hundreds of thousands of displaced people. Its population is mostly from non-Arab ethnic communities that form the bulk of many local armed groups, so an assault could trigger one of the most destructive battles of the war.\n\n\"Geneina highlights the brutality of the Rapid Support Forces against the non-Arab civilian population,\" Osman warns. \"But at the same time, the international community failed to respond and now we see a massacre unfolding, or possibly unfolding, in El Fasher. We are seeing strong messages from international leaders and actors not to attack, but civilians are still in danger,\" he adds, which is why the humanitarian expert believes it is time to start considering the deployment of a civilian protection mission.", "source": {"uri": "english.elpais.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EL PA\u00cdS"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Human Rights Watch released a new report on abuses by the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan against people in West Darfur's capital during 2023. What were the key findings?\n\nIn its new report, \"The Massalit Will Not Come Home,\" Human Rights Watch concludes that the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), an independent military force, and its allies, primarily Arab militias, are responsible for a campaign of ethnic cleansing, targeting the Massalit people and other non-Arab communities in West Darfur's capital, El Geneina. The apparent objective was to permanently remove them from the city. Many of the abuses documented in this report constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nHuman Rights Watch provided a comprehensive account of the seven-week campaign of attacks and abuses between April and June 2023, during which the RSF and its allies killed and injured thousands of civilians, as well as a later escalation of abuses, in November.\n\nThe RSF and allied militias systematically targeted unarmed civilians, especially boys and men, for killings. They also unlawfully killed people who had already been injured, including children and women. The evidence also indicates that the RSF and allied militias sought out prominent members of the Massalit community for abuse, including lawyers, doctors, human rights defenders, academics, community leaders, religious figures, and local government officials.\n\nThe RSF and its allies destroyed entire neighborhoods of this multi-ethnic city in relentless waves of attacks. Satellite imagery shows that large swathes of the city have been deliberately burned and subsequently demolished with heavy machinery.\n\nThe attacks culminated in days of killings in mid-June, as tens of thousands of civilians attempted to escape to areas north of the city and into neighboring Chad. The wave of attacks in November targeted El Geneina's suburb of Ardamata, one of the few remaining areas of refuge for the Massalit.\n\nAs part of this campaign, the RSF and its allies committed pillage, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence, willful killing, extensive destruction and appropriation of property, and unlawful deportation or forcible transfer.\n\nAs a result of these heinous crimes, almost half a million refugees from West Darfur have fled to Chad since April 2023, with 75 percent from El Geneina as of late October.\n\nHuman Rights Watch identified six leaders who are credibly implicated in this campaign or who hold command responsibility for the abuses, and who should be sanctioned and investigated.\n\n2. How did Human Rights watch conduct its research?\n\nHuman Rights Watch carried out 10 months of in-person and telephone research, including six trips to Chad, Kenya, South Sudan, and Uganda. Researchers interviewed over 220 people, most of them witnesses and survivors of abuses who were forced to flee into neighboring countries. Human Rights Watch also assessed and verified over 120 photographs and videos, analyzed satellite imagery, and reviewed documents shared by humanitarian organizations.\n\nThe majority of interviewees were ethnic Massalit or residents of non-Arab communities of El Geneina. Researchers also interviewed 38 Arab residents, as well as international aid workers and analysts. Human Rights Watch could not visit El Geneina, which remains under the control of the RSF and its allies.\n\nNo, but because of the scale of atrocities, the research focused specifically on events in the city of El Geneina and its suburb of Ardamata.\n\nHuman Rights Watch had previously documented attacks on predominantly Massalit civilians and civilian property elsewhere in West Darfur state. At least seven towns and villages of West Darfur have been deliberately destroyed by fire since mid-April 2023. Researchers conducted an in-depth investigation into a large-scale attack on the predominantly Massalit town of Misterei on May 28, 2023. Over the course of 12 hours, the RSF and allied Arab militias attacked the town, killing and injuring dozens of civilians, including women and children. They burned most of the town to the ground.\n\nWest Darfur, including El Geneina, has been the epicenter of attacks by the RSF and allied militias since 2019, targeting the Massalit community, and camps and sites hosting displaced people, and non-Arab communities more broadly. Human Rights Watch has previously documented similar patterns of abuse, including deliberate attacks. In early 2021, Arab tribes held a sit-in demanding the removal of camps for displaced people from the city, and the appointment of a non-Massalit governor. With the ethnic cleansing campaign of 2023, much of this agenda was accomplished.\n\nThe prosecutor for the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced in July 2023 that his office is investigating recent events in Darfur as part of its ongoing investigations in the region, dating back to June 2005. It is important for the ICC and the United Nations Independent International Fact-Finding Mission to include the attacks in El Geneina and other places of West Darfur in their investigations.\n\n4. Why were ethnic Massalit the main target?\n\nThe events in West Darfur since 2019 have regularly been characterized by the international community and Sudanese authorities as \"intercommunal violence.\" This downplays the severity of the events or suggests that not much can be done about it. Such a characterization is also misleading. While it is true that ethnicity plays a key role, describing the events as \"intercommunal violence\" obscures the involvement of national actors, and the fact that these are not random abuses, but large-scale, coordinated attacks with political and military objectives.\n\nIn the case of the recent events of El Geneina, the RSF has been intricately involved in the attacks, in close coordination with the Arab militias. The mostly Arab militias that mobilized alongside the RSF did so along tribal lines and over many weeks, according to witnesses. The magnitude of the attacks in El Geneina indicates a considerable level of coordination, effort, and purpose, as the assailants sought control over land and political power in the federal state of West Darfur. This does not support the idea that the violence was simply \"intercommunal.\"\n\n5. How do these crimes fit into the broader conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the RSF in Sudan?\n\nSince its founding in 2013, the RSF has overwhelmingly recruited from sections of Darfuri Arab communities, through its officers' tribal networks and by rewarding with money, cars, and military ranks, the traditional Arab leaders who enlist their kinsmen. The RSF has mobilized and fought alongside Arab tribal militias during attacks in West Darfur since then.\n\nAs the conflict between the Sudan military (known as the Sudanese Armed Forces, SAF) and the RSF unfolded since April 2023, the local agendas of Arab militias in West Darfur converged with the Rapid Support Forces' attempt to establish military superiority over the SAF throughout key parts of Sudan. The November 2023 wave of attacks in Ardamata, during which the UN estimated that at least 1,000 people were killed, culminated in the RSF posting celebratory videos of its capture of the military garrison in the town, in the presence of deputy RSF commander Abdel Raheem Dagalo. This confirms that the RSF leadership was implicated in the abuses.\n\nThe ethnic cleansing of the Massalit population of El Geneina has left the RSF, and its allies from local Arab communities, in control of El Geneina and West Darfur.\n\nThe research indicates that the RSF and its allies did not just target fighters from Massalit armed groups, they targeted the general Massalit population: men and boys in particular, but also women, girls, injured people, and older people. Prominent figures of the Massalit community, including traditional leaders and human rights activists, were also targeted. The abusers used racist slurs, which testified to their intent to remove the Massalit population as a whole from El Geneina. During these attacks, the military, even though it was present in the region, was unable or unwilling to intervene to protect civilians.\n\n6. What does ethnic cleansing mean?\n\nWhile a policy or practice of ethnic cleansing violates international law, ethnic cleansing is itself not a discrete crime, and as such the term does not have any formal definition under international law. However, the United Nations Commission of Experts mandated to examine international law violations committed in the former Yugoslavia between 1991 and 1994, defined ethnic cleansing as a \"purposeful policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove by violent and terror-inspiring means, the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch used that widely adopted working definition for the characterization and found considerable evidence that the grave abuses that the RSF and its allies carried out against the Massalit population of El Geneina fall within this definition. Ethnic cleansing can be prosecuted as the crimes against humanity of persecution and deportation or forcible transfer of a civilian population, involving the discriminatory targeting of particular groups, including on an ethnic basis, for serious violations.\n\n7. What are crimes against humanity?\n\nThe Rome Statute of the ICC defines crimes against humanity as specific criminal acts - including murder, rape, torture, apartheid, deportations, and persecution, etc. - that are committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population according to a state or organizational policy. These are among the gravest offenses under international law.\n\nMany crimes Human Rights Watch documented in this report formed part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the Massalit and other non-Arab civilian populations of Massalit-majority neighborhoods, and as such constitute the crimes against humanity of murder, torture, and forcible transfer of the civilian population. The evidence also indicates the RSF, and allied militias committed the crime against humanity of persecution of the Massalit and other non-Arab civilian populations in El Geneina and its surroundings.\n\n8. Do the crimes documented in the report have any link to what happened in Darfur 20 years ago?\n\nBeginning in 2003, Sudan's government forces (SAF) and allied militias known as the \"Janjaweed,\" committed crimes against humanity and war crimes, including sexual violence, in Darfur, as part of a counterinsurgency campaign against opposition armed groups who recruited from local non-Arab communities. Government forces and the Janjaweed - primarily recruited among local Arab communities - targeted not only fighters but also non-Arab communities more generally in direct attacks from land and air in which the forces carried out abuses such as summary executions, rape, torture, and pillaging of their property. Ethnic Massalit communities of West Darfur were among those targeted in that campaign.\n\nThe Janjaweed were later integrated into formal government structures, ultimately leading to the emergence of the RSF in 2013. The RSF then committed further abuses during other counterinsurgency campaigns in Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile in the 2010s.\n\nThe situation at the national level has changed; the RSF, since April 2023, is no longer part of the government but is now against the government, fighting the military. But the experience of victims and survivors in West Darfur echoes what survivors went through 20 years ago. Some of the survivors of the atrocities since 2023 were among those displaced 20 years ago, and many again in the 2019-2021 period, when the RSF and allied militias carried out attacks against these communities in and around El Geneina.\n\nFor some, it is the third time they are being displaced. Their description of how the attacks were carried out was eerily similar to what happened in the 2000s: forces attacking residential areas using explosive and automatic weapons, looting and burning, and targeting civilians for killings, rape, and other abuses.\n\nSome of the people carrying out the abuses today were actively involved in the atrocities of the 2000s. The RSF commander, General Mohammed Hamdan Daglo, known as Hemedti, was implicated in grave crimes by the RSF against civilians in Darfur, Southern Kordofan, and Blue Nile, including killings, mass rape, the burning and looting of villages, and mass displacement of civilians. The SAF leader, General Abdelfattah al-Burhan, reportedly oversaw Janjaweed militias from 2002 to 2005, in his previous role as commissioner of Jebel Mara.\n\n9. Where are members of the affected communities now?\n\nSince April 2023, over half a million people have fled into eastern Chad, which borders West Darfur. Most fled directly because of the horrific abuses Human Rights Watch documented in this report. Over 65 percent are ethnic Massalit.\n\nChad has allowed the refugees to enter its territory, and international aid organizations have been responding to the incredibly dire needs of this vulnerable population, but aid groups have repeatedly raised the alarm about severe funding shortages.\n\n10. How have regional and international actors responded since these abuses began over a year ago?\n\nThe United States has been the most vocal and has taken some concrete measures against those responsible for these crimes. The US ambassador to the UN Security Council visited eastern Chad to meet with refugees and has spoken out against obstructions to the delivery of aid by the warring parties. The US government announced a so-called \"atrocities determination\" in December 2023, concluding that the RSF and allied militias are responsible for crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing in West Darfur.\n\nIt also imposed asset freezes on Abel Raheem Hamdan Dagalo, the RSF deputy commander and brother of RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, in addition to imposing visa restrictions on Abdul Rahman Joma'a, RSF commander for West Darfur state. Canada imposed sanctions against Abdel Raheem Hamdan Dagalo, on April 15.\n\nThe European Union has repeatedly condemned violations committed by warring parties in Darfur and elsewhere in Sudan, but has so far not used its Sudan sanction regime to impose targeted measures on individuals responsible for grave human rights violations.\n\nAt the UN, Security Council members have willfully failed in their responsibilities to prevent further atrocities. The UN panel of experts on Sudan submitted a damning report, presenting strong evidence on individuals responsible for atrocities in West Darfur. But the Security Council failed to sanction these individuals, and to name those responsible for violating the arms embargo on Darfur.\n\nThe ongoing conflict in Sudan underlines the limits of continental responses to African conflicts. The African Union (AU), especially the AU Commission and the Peace and Security Council (AUPSC), has failed to end the conflict, protect civilians, and ensure the provision of humanitarian assistance. The relationship between the Peace and Security Council and the Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD) has been obscured by a subsidiarity principle, according to which African regional economic communities and regional mechanisms such as IGAD share responsibilities with the AU on peace and security matters, which has led to confusion and even policy paralysis in dealing with the conflict.\n\nThe AU Peace and Security Council has only recently asked the AU Commission to present options for the investigations of atrocities and accountability, but it has otherwise failed to consider options to protect civilians or to denounce abuses by the warring parties.\n\nIn November 2023, despite ample evidence of the serious crimes underway in Darfur and other parts of Sudan, members of the Security Council acquiesced to the request of the Sudanese authorities - aligned with SAF - to close the UN political mission in the country.\n\nThere have been no substantive discussions at the UN on how civilians could be protected in the context of grave abuses across the country.\n\n11. What are Human Rights Watch and the survivors asking the international community to do?\n\nHuman Rights Watch is asking the AU, in collaboration with the UN and in consultation with IGAD, to urgently address the need to protect civilians. The UN Secretariat should develop options for a new mission to be deployed to areas where civilians are particularly at risk of attack, notably in West Darfur, with a mandate to protect civilians, monitor violations of international humanitarian and human rights law and aid access, and pave the way for the return of those displaced.\n\nThe UN Security Council should sanction the six leaders named in the report, as part of a broader strategy to halt atrocities and prevent these leaders from being in positions where they can continue to oversee abuses. In the meantime, individual states and government bodies should also sanction these leaders in a coordinated manner.\n\nThe international community should actively assist the ICC with its investigations, and ICC state parties should ensure that the court's office of the prosecutor has the financial means within its regular budget to conduct its investigations into events in Darfur and across the court's docket.\n\nThe findings highlight the urgency for states, at the level of the UN Security Council, to establish an arms embargo on all of Sudan, not just Darfur. In the meantime, individual states should halt the sales of weapons to states, such as the UAE, which are known to be providing weapons to the abusive warring parties.", "source": {"uri": "hrw.org",

It said Entire neighborhoods housing primarily Massalit-displaced communities were looted, burned, shelled and razed to the ground.\n\n\"The events are among the worst atrocities against civilians so far in the current conflict in Sudan,\" HRW said. \"Sudanese Red Crescent staff said that on June 13, they counted 2,000 bodies on the streets of El Geneina and then, overwhelmed by the numbers, stopped counting.\"\n\n\"Adolescent boys and men were especially singled out for killings, but among those unlawfully killed were also many children and women,\" the report said, adding RSF fighters and allied militias were using \"derogatory racial slurs\" during their weeks long campaign.\n\nThe civil war that began in 2023 in Sudan has become \"one of the worst humanitarian disasters in recent memory,\" according to the United Nations, displacing more than 8 million people. Fighting erupted in April 2023 between the RSF and its rival, the Sudanese Armed Forces, or SAF.\n\nMORE: Satellite images show devastation in Sudan 1 year since conflict began\n\nA U.N. panel of experts on Sudan estimated between 10,000 and 15,000 people were killed in El Geneina in 2023.\n\nEl Geneina, where ethnic Massalit, which is sometimes spelled Masalit, make up roughly 60% of West Darfur's population, has seen some of the fiercest fighting outside Sudan's capital Khartoum since the onset of the conflict in Sudan.\n\nTestifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan Tom Perriello said the U.S. has determined the RSF and allied militias have committed \"crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing.\"\n\nThe U.S. also found the SAF have committed \"war crimes\" since the onset of the war, bombing civilian areas and \"proactively\" interfering with humanitarian operations.\n\n\"Let's be clear: the RSF and its leadership are rooted in the Janjaweed militias who committed genocide and widespread crimes against humanity,\" said Perriello. \"They have conducted this war with unspeakable brutality, including through ethnic cleansing of the Masalit, sexual violence as a weapon of war, and torching whole villages.\"\n\nAs a result of atrocities in El Geneina over 570,000 predominantly Massalit people have fled their homes, seeking safety in refugee camps in Chad.\n\nThe report found crimes committed against the Massalit people were not restricted to El Geneina, as at least seven villages and towns of West Darfur \"deliberately destroyed by fire since mid-April 2023.\"\n\nAt least 14,000 people have been killed in the conflict, according to the UN.\n\nLocal groups however warn that the true death toll is likely much higher.\n\n\"The mass killings of ethnic Massalit civilians, and in particular the context in which these killings took place, also requires urgent action from all governments and international institutions,\" HRW said.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Support_Forces",

Clashes quickly spread to other parts of the country, and Darfur was engulfed in brutal attacks on African civilians, especially the Masalit tribe.\n\nAccording to the New York-based watchdog, the paramilitary forces and their allied militiamen targeted predominantly Masalit neighborhoods in El Geneina from April to June 2023, with attacks intensifying also last November.\n\nAt least thousands of people were killed and hundreds of thousands were displaced during the attacks, according to the report, entitled \"The Massalit Will Not Come Home: Ethnic Cleansing and Crimes Against Humanity in El Geneina, West Darfur, Sudan.\"\n\nMasalit who were captured were tortured, women and girls were raped and entire neighborhoods were looted and destroyed, the report says. HRW said it interviewed more than 220 people who fled Darfur into neighboring countries and analyzed photos, videos and satellite imagery connected to the attacks.\n\nUnited Nations experts have estimated that at least 10,000 people were killed in the city of El Geneina in 2023. More than 570,000 people, mostly Masalit, were displaced and sought refuge in neighboring Chad.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said the campaign of attacks on the non-Arab people in Darfur, including the Masalit, with the \"apparent objective\" of pushing them out, \"constitutes ethnic cleansing.\"\n\n\"Governments, the African Union, and the United Nations need to act now to protect civilians,\" Tirana Hassan, HRW's executive director, said Thursday.\n\n\"The global inaction in the face of atrocities of this magnitude is inexcusable,\" Hassan said. \"Government should ensure those responsible are held to account.\"\n\nThe group called for the United Nations, African Union and states from the International Criminal Court to investigate whether the atrocities documented in the report reveal a specific intent by the RSF paramilitary and armed allies \"to commit genocide\" by destroying the Masalit and other non-Arab groups in West Darfur.\n\nThe media office of the Rapid Support Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press.\n\nIn late January, the International Criminal Court's prosecutor, Karim Khan, said there are grounds to believe both the RSF and the Sudanese military may be committing war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide in Darfur.\n\nTwo decades ago, Darfur became synonymous with genocide and war crimes, particularly by the notorious Janjaweed Arab militias, against populations that identify as Central or East African.\n\nThe Rapid Support Forces were formed from Janjaweed fighters by former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who ruled the country for three decades before being overthrown during a popular uprising in 2019. He is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of genocide and other crimes during the conflict in Darfur in the 2000s.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Now, experts and residents are bracing for more.\n\n\"We're living in constant terror,\" Mohammed told AFP by telephone, as the UN, world leaders and aid groups voice fears of carnage in the North Darfur state capital of 1.5 million people.\n\nIn September, 2016, a man herds his sheep in Abu Shouk camp for internally displaced people near North Darfur's state capital El-Fasher -- eyewitnesses report fighting 'is now inside' the camp\n\n\"We can't move for the bombardments,\" Mohammed said.\n\nThe RSF has seized four out of five state capitals in Darfur, a region about the size of France and home to around one quarter of Sudan's 48 million people.\n\n\"We're under a total siege,\" another resident, Ahmed Adam, told AFP in a text message that got through despite a near-total communications blackout in Darfur.\n\n\"There's no way in or out of the city that's not controlled by the RSF,\" he said.\n\nFor months, El-Fasher was protected by a fragile peace.\n\nBut unrest has soared since last month when the city's two most powerful armed groups -- which had helped to keep the peace there -- pledged to fight alongside the army.\n\nSince then, El-Fasher and the surrounding countryside have seen \"systematic burning of entire villages in rural areas, escalating air bombardments... and a tightening siege\", according to Toby Harward, the UN's deputy humanitarian coordinator for Sudan.\n\n- 'Large-scale massacre' warning -\n\nAt least 23 communities in North Darfur have been burned in apparent arson, Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab found in a report last week.\n\nBodies lie near houses last year in El-Geneina, where members of the Massalit community were targeted by Sudanese paramilitaries and their allies\n\nThe war's overall death toll, however, remains unclear, a factor \"that captures just how invisible and horrific this war is\", Tom Perriello, US special envoy for Sudan, told a congressional committee on May 1.\n\nWhile figures of 15,000-30,000 have been mentioned, \"some think it's at 150,000\", Perriello said.\n\nUN experts reported up to 15,000 people killed in the West Darfur capital El-Geneina alone.\n\nMembers of the non-Arab Massalit ethnic group in El-Geneina last year were targeted for killing and other abuses by the RSF and allied militias, forcing an exodus to neighbouring Chad, which the UN says is hosting more than 745,000 people from Sudan.\n\nThe International Criminal Court, currently investigating ethnic-based killings primarily by the RSF in Darfur, says it has \"grounds to believe\" both sides are committing atrocities in the war.\n\nAs El-Fasher is home to both Arab and African communities, an all-out battle for control of the city causing massive civilian bloodshed \"would lead to revenge attacks across the five Darfur states and beyond Darfur's borders\", said Harward.\n\nIn late April, United States ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield warned that El-Fasher \"is on the precipice of a large-scale massacre\".\n\nEyewitnesses report fighting \"is now inside\" the nearby Abu Shouk camp, established 20 years ago for people displaced by ethnic violence committed by the Janjaweed militia, which led to ICC war crimes charges.\n\nThe Janjaweed later evolved into the RSF.\n\n\"Everyone who hasn't managed to leave is trapped at home,\" camp resident Issa Abdelrahman told AFP.\n\n\"People are running out of food, and no one can get to them.\"\n\n- Eating grass -\n\nAccording to UN experts, the RSF has repeatedly besieged and set fire to villages and displacement camps in Darfur.\n\nTheir siege of El-Fasher has halted aid convoys and commercial trade, Harward said.\n\nShortages have also hit the El-Fasher Southern Hospital -- the city's only remaining medical facility, where personnel are \"completely exhausted\", a medical source told AFP.\n\nSatellite images show (L) the market in West Darfur's capital El-Geneina on April 20, 2023, and (R) the same area on May 17, 2023\n\nRequesting anonymity for fear of both sides' well-documented targeting of medics, the source said \"some doctors haven't left the hospital in over a month\", tirelessly treating gunshot wounds, bombardment injuries and child malnutrition.\n\nThe Darfur region was already facing widespread hunger, but now \"people are resorting to consuming grass and peanut shells\", according to Michael Dunford, the World Food Programme's regional director for Eastern Africa.\n\nYet it is difficult for them to flee.\n\nUNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said encirclement of El-Fasher by armed groups and restrictions on movement along key roads \"are limiting families from leaving\".\n\nEarly this year the RSF declared victories across Sudan, but the army has since mounted defences in key locations.\n\nThe RSF has for months threatened an attack on El-Fasher but has held off, in large part due to the locally brokered truce.\n\nThey also seem to have been deterred by \"heightened international demands and warnings,\" according to Amjad Farid, a Sudanese political analyst and former aide to ex-civilian prime minister Abdalla Hamdok.\n\nChildren in eastern Sudan move a water tank to a recently dug well -- the UN says the country is experiencing a humanitarian crisis of 'epic proportions'\n\nBut these warnings are \"falling on deaf ears\", Harward says.\n\nWith the US having announced an imminent resumption of peace talks in Saudi Arabia, Farid said the RSF has focused anew on El-Fasher.\n\n\"These are negotiations the militia cannot enter from a position of weakness,\" Farid told AFP.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Now, experts and residents are bracing for more.\n\n\"We're living in constant terror,\" Mohammed told AFP by telephone, as the UN, world leaders and aid groups voice fears of carnage in the North Darfur state capital of 1.5 million people.\n\n\"We can't move for the bombardments,\" Mohammed said.\n\nThe RSF has seized four out of five state capitals in Darfur, a region about the size of France and home to around one quarter of Sudan's 48 million people.\n\n\"We're under a total siege,\" another resident, Ahmed Adam, told AFP in a text message that got through despite a near-total communications blackout in Darfur.\n\n\"There's no way in or out of the city that's not controlled by the RSF,\" he said.\n\nFor months, El-Fasher was protected by a fragile peace.\n\nBut unrest has soared since last month when the city's two most powerful armed groups -- which had helped to keep the peace there -- pledged to fight alongside the army.\n\nSince then, El-Fasher and the surrounding countryside have seen \"systematic burning of entire villages in rural areas, escalating air bombardments... and a tightening siege\", according to Toby Harward, the UN's deputy humanitarian coordinator for Sudan.\n\n- 'Large-scale massacre' warning -\n\nAt least 23 communities in North Darfur have been burned in apparent arson, Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab found in a report last week.\n\nThe war's overall death toll, however, remains unclear, a factor \"that captures just how invisible and horrific this war is\", Tom Perriello, US special envoy for Sudan, told a congressional committee on May 1.\n\nWhile figures of 15,000-30,000 have been mentioned, \"some think it's at 150,000\", Perriello said.\n\nUN experts reported up to 15,000 people killed in the West Darfur capital El-Geneina alone.\n\nMembers of the non-Arab Massalit ethnic group in El-Geneina last year were targeted for killing and other abuses by the RSF and allied militias, forcing an exodus to neighbouring Chad, which the UN says is hosting more than 745,000 people from Sudan.\n\nThe International Criminal Court, currently investigating ethnic-based killings primarily by the RSF in Darfur, says it has \"grounds to believe\" both sides are committing atrocities in the war.\n\nAs El-Fasher is home to both Arab and African communities, an all-out battle for control of the city causing massive civilian bloodshed \"would lead to revenge attacks across the five Darfur states and beyond Darfur's borders\", said Harward.\n\nIn late April, United States ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield warned that El-Fasher \"is on the precipice of a large-scale massacre\".\n\nEyewitnesses report fighting \"is now inside\" the nearby Abu Shouk camp, established 20 years ago for people displaced by ethnic violence committed by the Janjaweed militia, which led to ICC war crimes charges.\n\nThe Janjaweed later evolved into the RSF.\n\n\"Everyone who hasn't managed to leave is trapped at home,\" camp resident Issa Abdelrahman told AFP.\n\n\"People are running out of food, and no one can get to them.\"\n\n- Eating grass -\n\nAccording to UN experts, the RSF has repeatedly besieged and set fire to villages and displacement camps in Darfur.\n\nTheir siege of El-Fasher has halted aid convoys and commercial trade, Harward said.\n\nShortages have also hit the El-Fasher Southern Hospital -- the city's only remaining medical facility, where personnel are \"completely exhausted\", a medical source told AFP.\n\nRequesting anonymity for fear of both sides' well-documented targeting of medics, the source said \"some doctors haven't left the hospital in over a month\", tirelessly treating gunshot wounds, bombardment injuries and child malnutrition.\n\nThe Darfur region was already facing widespread hunger, but now \"people are resorting to consuming grass and peanut shells\", according to Michael Dunford, the World Food Programme's regional director for Eastern Africa.\n\nYet it is difficult for them to flee.\n\nUNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said encirclement of El-Fasher by armed groups and restrictions on movement along key roads \"are limiting families from leaving\".\n\nEarly this year the RSF declared victories across Sudan, but the army has since mounted defences in key locations.\n\nThe RSF has for months threatened an attack on El-Fasher but has held off, in large part due to the locally brokered truce.\n\nThey also seem to have been deterred by \"heightened international demands and warnings,\" according to Amjad Farid, a Sudanese political analyst and former aide to ex-civilian prime minister Abdalla Hamdok.\n\nBut these warnings are \"falling on deaf ears\", Harward says.\n\nWith the US having announced an imminent resumption of peace talks in Saudi Arabia, Farid said the RSF has focused anew on El-Fasher.\n\n\"These are negotiations the militia cannot enter from a position of weakness,\" Farid told AFP.", "source": {"uri": "digitaljournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@digitaljournal.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type":

countryside have seen \"systematic burning of entire villages in rural areas, escalating air bombardments... and a tightening siege\", according to Toby Harward, the UN's deputy humanitarian coordinator for Sudan.\n\n- 'Large-scale massacre' warning -\n\nAt least 23 communities in North Darfur have been burned in apparent arson, Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab found in a report last week.\n\nThe war's overall death toll, however, remains unclear, a factor \"that captures just how invisible and horrific this war is\", Tom Perriello, US special envoy for Sudan, told a congressional committee on May 1.\n\nWhile figures of 15,000-30,000 have been mentioned, \"some think it's at 150,000\", Perriello said.\n\nUN experts reported up to 15,000 people killed in the West Darfur capital El-Geneina alone.\n\nMembers of the non-Arab Massalit ethnic group in El-Geneina last year were targeted for killing and other abuses by the RSF and allied militias, forcing an exodus to neighbouring Chad, which the UN says is hosting more than 745,000 people from Sudan.\n\nThe International Criminal Court, currently investigating ethnic-based killings primarily by the RSF in Darfur, says it has \"grounds to believe\" both sides are committing atrocities in the war.\n\nAs El-Fasher is home to both Arab and African communities, an all-out battle for control of the city causing massive civilian bloodshed \"would lead to revenge attacks across the five Darfur states and beyond Darfur's borders\", said Harward.\n\nIn late April, United States ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield warned that El-Fasher \"is on the precipice of a large-scale massacre\".\n\nEyewitnesses report fighting \"is now inside\" the nearby Abu Shouk camp, established 20 years ago for people displaced by ethnic violence committed by the Janjaweed militia, which led to ICC war crimes charges.\n\nThe Janjaweed later evolved into the RSF.\n\n\"Everyone who hasn't managed to leave is trapped at home,\" camp resident Issa Abdelrahman told AFP.\n\n\"People are running out of food, and no one can get to them.\"\n\n- Eating grass -\n\nAccording to UN experts, the RSF has repeatedly besieged and set fire to villages and displacement camps in Darfur.\n\nTheir siege of El-Fasher has halted aid convoys and commercial trade, Harward said.\n\nShortages have also hit the El-Fasher Southern Hospital -- the city's only remaining medical facility, where personnel are \"completely exhausted\", a medical source told AFP.\n\nRequesting anonymity for fear of both sides' well-documented targeting of medics, the source said \"some doctors haven't left the hospital in over a month\", tirelessly treating gunshot wounds, bombardment injuries and child malnutrition.\n\nThe Darfur region was already facing widespread hunger, but now \"people are resorting to consuming grass and peanut shells\", according to Michael Dunford, the World Food Programme's regional director for Eastern Africa.\n\nYet it is difficult for them to flee.\n\nUNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said encirclement of El-Fasher by armed groups and restrictions on movement along key roads \"are limiting families from leaving\".\n\nEarly this year the RSF declared victories across Sudan, but the army has since mounted defences in key locations.\n\nThe RSF has for months threatened an attack on El-Fasher but has held off, in large part due to the locally brokered truce.\n\nThey also seem to have been deterred by \"heightened international demands and warnings,\" according to Amjad Farid, a Sudanese political analyst and former aide to ex-civilian prime minister Abdalla Hamdok.\n\nBut these warnings are \"falling on deaf ears\", Harward says.\n\nWith the US having announced an imminent resumption of peace talks in Saudi Arabia, Farid said the RSF has focused anew on El-Fasher.\n\n\"These are negotiations the militia cannot enter from a position of weakness,\" Farid told

Governments, the African Union, and the United Nations need to act now to protect civilians, Tirana Hassan, HRWs executive director, said Thursday.The global inaction in the face of atrocities of this magnitude is inexcusable, Hassan said.\n\nA leading rights group said on Thursday that attacks by Sudanese paramilitary forces and their allied militias, which killed thousands in the western region of Darfur last year, constituted a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the area's non-Arab population.\n\nThe paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, which has been fighting Sudan's military for over a year, allied with armed militias to carry out attacks against the ethnic Masalit and other non-Arab groups in El Geneina, the capital city of West Darfur state, Human Rights Watch said in a new report.\n\nSudan has been rocked by violence since mid-April 2023, when tensions between the military and the rival paramilitary erupted into open fighting. Clashes quickly spread to other parts of the country, and Darfur was engulfed in brutal attacks on African civilians, especially the Masalit tribe.\n\nAccording to the New York-based watchdog, the paramilitary forces and their allied militiamen targeted predominantly Masalit neighbourhoods in El Geneina from April to June 2023, with attacks intensifying also last November. At least thousands of people were killed and hundreds of thousands were displaced during the attacks, according to the report, entitled \"The Massalit Will Not Come Home: Ethnic Cleansing and Crimes Against Humanity in El Geneina, West Darfur, Sudan.\" Masalit who were captured were tortured, women and girls were raped and entire neighbourhoods were looted and destroyed, the report says. HRW said it interviewed more than 220 people who fled Darfur into neighbouring countries and analyzed photos, videos and satellite imagery connected to the attacks.\n\nUnited Nations experts have estimated that at least 10,000 people were killed in the city of El Geneina in 2023. More than 570,000 people, mostly Masalit, were displaced and sought refuge in neighboring Chad. Human Rights Watch said the campaign of attacks on the non-Arab people in Darfur, including the Masalit, with the \"apparent objective\" of pushing them out, \"constitutes ethnic cleansing.\" \"Governments, the African Union, and the United Nations need to act now to protect civilians,\" Tirana Hassan, HRW's executive director, said Thursday.\n\n\"The global inaction in the face of atrocities of this magnitude is inexcusable,\" Hassan said. \"Government should ensure those responsible are held to account.\" The group called for the United Nations, African Union and states from the International Criminal Court to investigate whether the atrocities documented in the report reveal a specific intent by the RSF paramilitary and armed allies \"to commit genocide\" by destroying the Masalit and other non-Arab groups in West Darfur.\n\nThe media office of the Rapid Support Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press.\n\nIn late January, the International Criminal Court's prosecutor, Karim Khan, said there are grounds to believe both the RSF and the Sudanese military may be committing war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide in Darfur.\n\nTwo decades ago, Darfur became synonymous with genocide and war crimes, particularly by the notorious Janjaweed Arab militias, against populations that identify as Central or East African.\n\nThe Rapid Support Forces were formed from Janjaweed fighters by former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who ruled the country for three decades before being overthrown during a popular uprising in 2019. He is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of genocide and other crimes during the conflict in Darfur in the 2000s.(AP) RUP RUP\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse

The events are labeled as \"among the worst atrocities against civilians so far in the current conflict in Sudan.\"\n\nThe Rapid Support Forces (RSF) are responsible for the attacks committed against the Massalit ethnic minority. This series of attacks commenced in April 2023, with the start of the conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces, the RSF and other militias. In this period, it is estimated that between 10.000 and 15.000 people were killed in El Geneina. Here, attacks were held against the Massalit minority as part of a widespread ethnic cleansing campaign.\n\nAccording to the report, the Massalit and other non-Arab civilians are being forced out of El Geneina, as displaced residents are seen in Chad, Kenya, Uganda, and South Sudan. HRW referred to the situation as a case of crimes against humanity and even a possible indication of genocide. The cases of murder, torture, persecution, and forcible transfer of the civilian population could amount to crimes against humanity as defined in Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. This was confirmed by ICC prosecutor Karim A. A. Khan in January 2024 during a statement. He mentioned, \"There are grounds to believe that presently Rome Statute crimes are being committed in Darfur by both the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces and affiliated groups.\"\n\nAt an international level, the availability of information regarding the crimes committed in Sudan has been a challenge. As a result, many of the crimes committed go unpunished, resulting in a lack of justice. Executive director at Human Rights Watch, Tirana Hassan, said that \"the global inaction in the face of atrocities of this magnitude is inexcusable.\" Conversely, in March 2024, the UN Security Council took further action regarding the situation in West Darfur. Resolution 2725 extends the Panel of Experts monitoring sanctions and actions in Sudan to 2025, assisting in the various reports.\n\nThe report includes a series of recommended actions to be considered internationally. These include targeted sanctions, an arms embargo, and further investigations into the events committed. The situation in Sudan is still under development. Stressing international cooperation and humanitarian action is a central priority in the report.", "source": {"uri": "jurist.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "JURIST"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matteo_piccioli@jurist.org", "name": "Matteo Piccioli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Support_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapid Support Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crimes against humanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Geneina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ethnic cleansing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human Rights Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sudanese Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chad"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chad"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Sudan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Sudan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_embargo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arms embargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tirana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tirana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Darfur", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Darfur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Darfur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darfur", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darfur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darfur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human_Rights_and_Liberties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human Rights and Liberties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.jurist.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/08/darfur-violence.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551281", "eventUri": "eng-9551281", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

More than half a million refugees from West Darfur have fled to Chad since April 2023. As of late October 2023, 75 percent were from El Geneina.\n\nJamal Abdullah Khamis, Human Rights Lawyer from El Geneina\n\nOf everything that happened what disturbed me most was what happened at the Mohamed Adam Clinic.\n\nWhen I walked in, I found my friend Mudather in the southeast corner of the clinic.\n\nWhen I arrived, they told me that he'd been shot in the back by a bullet.\n\nThey told me he was shot with a DShK gun because the bullet was big.\n\nNarration by Mohamed Osman, researcher, Human Rights Watch\n\nIt marks an escalation of the power struggle between two military leaders who have vied for power since they jointly overthrew a power-sharing government in October 2021.\n\nThe war pits the military against an autonomous force known as the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF.\n\nBy April 24, 2023, the conflict spreads to El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur.\n\nThe atrocities that follow are documented by Jamal and other local human rights activists with the aim of bringing those responsible to justice.\n\nJamal Abdullah Khamis, Human Rights Lawyer from El Geneina\n\nI was at al-Sadaqa Clinic on April 24, from the first day of the events, with a group of my colleagues from our organization.\n\nOur role was documenting violations against the injured and the dead.\n\nEveryone who was brought to the clinic we would document.\n\nThe number, their names, (ethnic) backgrounds and information.\n\nNarration by Mohamed Osman, researcher, Human Rights Watch\n\nJamal and his colleagues notice a pattern to the killings.\n\nThe RSF and allied Arab militias were targeting doctors, lawyers and human rights activists.\n\nMajority-Massalit neighborhoods and camps for internally displaced people were also being systematically targeted.\n\nThe violence feels all too familiar to Jamal and others in West Darfur state, who recall fleeing their home villages in the early 2000s after being attacked by the Janjaweed, the predecessor of the RSF.\n\nThousands were displaced, including many Massalit people.\n\nThey found refuge in the camps for internally displaced people that swelled the outskirts of El Geneina.\n\nThe conflict then occurred against a backdrop of long-standing tensions over land and other resources between non-Arab farmers, such as the Massalit, and nomadic Arab communities who were starting to settle.\n\nOn June 15th, 2023, RSF and Arab militias overwhelm the remaining Massalit-majority neighborhoods.\n\nTens of thousands of Massalit and other non-Arabs try to flee central El Geneina for its northern suburb of Ardamata, where there's a Sudanese Armed Forces base.\n\nThe RSF and militias attack the convoy, injuring and killing men, women, and children.\n\nJamal Abdullah Khamis, Human Rights Lawyer from El Geneina\n\nMinutes later around eight militiamen appeared wearing RSF uniforms.\n\nThere were others with them from these well-known Arab militias.\n\nThey shot at the chests of children, women, old and young men.\n\nThey started chasing people down the valley and firing on people who were in the water.\n\nWe hid in some grass and bushes on the edge of the valley.\n\nWhen we were going down the street we saw bodies everywhere, of women and children.\n\nThey were the bodies of people we knew personally.\n\nBut you can't stop and help someone who is dead in the street.\n\nTEXT: The killings continue for several days in El Geneina and on the road to Chad, where tens of thousands of civilians, including Jamal, flee in search of refuge.\n\nJamal Abdullah Khamis, Human Rights Lawyer from El Geneina\n\nI found someone I knew and said, \"Let my friend Kabello ride with you, he's injured. It's not a problem, I'll walk behind with everyone else.\"\n\nBullets started showering us from all directions and people were being killed.\n\nA child of around nine years old, came to me crying hysterically and was holding on to me.\n\nBut the militiamen probably saw us going in there, because they were nearby.\n\nThey forced us out and started beating us, torturing us, and firing just over our heads.\n\nI had my two mobile phones, a USB stick, and some cash.\n\nThe beating and torturing intensified, they were using a metal rod, some sticks, and whips to beat us.\n\nA second group also started beating and interrogating us.\n\nIf you answered that you are Massalit, they would kill you immediately.\n\nI denied that I am Massalit even though I am Massalit.\n\nThey pressured me, and I told them I am from the Bargo tribe.\n\nThey brought someone to talk to me in the Bargo language and I replied because I know how to speak it.\n\nWe were shocked to see Chadian officials in front of us.\n\nChadian military uniforms are very similar to RSF uniforms.\n\nWhen our group ran towards them (the troops) they told us to stop running.\n\nWe were surprised, and thought it was the RSF again.\n\nThe soldiers ran after us and said, \"We are Chadian officials.\"\n\nWe weren't convinced until we saw the Chadian flag on their uniform.\n\n\"Many of your people arrived here before you. Welcome.\"\n\nDespite the huge shock and gruesome massacres that happened in West Darfur, I still have a lot of hope.\n\nI have hope that El Geneina will recover, and we will go back soon.\n\nWe need the principles of human rights and international law.\n\nThat speak of the dignity of human life and the dignity of people.\n\nIf these are embodied in West Darfur, then there is hope that we can return to El Geneina.\n\nThe international community should deploy a mission to protect civilians in Sudan.\n\nTEXT: The international community should also impose sanctions against those responsible for atrocities and establish an arms embargo on Sudan.\n\n\"As the UN Security Council and governments wake up to the looming disaster in El Fasher, the large-scale atrocities committed in El Geneina should be seen as a reminder of the atrocities that could come in the absence of concerted action,\" said Tirana Hassan, executive director at Human Rights Watch. \"Governments, the African Union, and the United Nations need to act now to protect civilians.\"\n\nTargeting the Massalit people and other non-Arab communities by committing serious violations against them with the apparent objective of at least having them permanently leave the region constitutes ethnic cleansing. The particular context in which the widespread killings took place also raises the possibility that the RSF and their allies have the intent to destroy in whole or in part the Massalit in at least West Darfur, which would indicate that genocide has been and/or is being committed there.\n\nBetween June 2023 and April 2024, Human Rights Watch interviewed more than 220 people in Chad, Uganda, Kenya, and South Sudan, as well as remotely. Researchers also reviewed and analyzed over 120 photos and videos of the events, satellite imagery, and documents shared by humanitarian organizations to corroborate accounts of grave abuses.\n\nThe violence in El Geneina began nine days after fighting broke out in Khartoum, Sudan's capital city, between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), Sudan's military, and the RSF. On the morning of April 24, the RSF clashed with a Sudanese military convoy travelling through El Geneina. Then the RSF and its allied groups attacked majority Massalit neighborhoods, clashing with predominantly Massalit armed groups defending their communities. Over the following weeks - and even after Massalit armed groups lost control of their neighborhoods - the RSF and allied militias systematically targeted unarmed civilians.\n\nThe violence culminated in a large-scale massacre on June 15, when the RSF and its allies opened fire on a kilometers-long convoy of civilians desperately trying to flee, escorted by Massalit fighters. The RSF and militias pursued, rounded up, and shot men, women, and children who ran through the streets or tried to swim across the fast-flowing Kajja river. Many drowned. Older people and injured people were not spared.\n\nA 17-year-old boy described the killing of 12 children and 5 adults from several families: \"Two RSF forces ... grabb[ed] the children from their parents and, as the parents started screaming, two other RSF forces shot the parents, killing them. Then they piled up the children and shot them. They threw their bodies into the river and their belongings in after them.\"\n\nThat day and in subsequent days, the attacks continued on tens of thousands of civilians who tried to cross into Chad, leaving the countryside strewn with bodies. Videos published at the time show crowds of civilians running for their lives on the road linking El Geneina to Chad.\n\nHuman Rights Watch also documented the killing of Arab residents and the looting of Arab neighborhoods by Massalit forces, and Sudanese Armed Forces' use of explosive weapons in populated areas in ways that caused unnecessary harm to civilians and civilian objects.\n\nThe RSF and allied militias escalated their abuses again in November, targeting Massalit people who had found refuge in the El Geneina suburb of Ardamata, rounding up Massalit men and boys and, according to the UN, killing at least 1,000 people.\n\nDuring the course of these abuses, women and girls were raped and subjected to other forms of sexual violence, and detainees were tortured and otherwise ill-treated. The attackers methodically destroyed critical civilian infrastructure, targeting neighborhoods and sites, including schools, in primarily Massalit displaced communities. They looted on a grand scale; and burned, shelled, and razed neighborhoods to the ground, after emptying them of residents.\n\nThese acts were committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the Massalit and other non-Arab civilian populations of Massalit-majority neighborhoods, and as such also constitute the crimes against humanity of murder, torture, persecution, and forcible transfer of the civilian population, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nThe possibility that genocide has been and/or is being committed in Darfur requires urgent action from all governments and international institutions to protect civilians. They should ensure investigation as to whether the facts demonstrate a specific intent on the part of the RSF leadership and its allies to destroy in whole or in part the Massalit and other non-Arab ethnic communities in West Darfur, that is, to commit genocide. If so, they should act to prevent its further perpetration, and to ensure those responsible for its planning and conduct are brought to justice.\n\nThe global community should support the investigations of the International Criminal Court (ICC), while states party to the court should ensure it has the financial resources needed in its regular budget to carry out its mandate in Darfur and across its docket.\n\nHuman Rights Watch identified the commander of the RSF, Mohammed \"Hemedti\" Hamdan Dagalo, his brother Abdel Raheem Hamdan Dagalo, and the West Darfur RSF commander Joma'a Barakallah as those with command responsibility over the forces that carried out these crimes. Human Rights Watch also named RSF allies, including a commander of the Tamazuj armed group and two Arab tribal leaders, as bearing responsibility for fighters that committed serious crimes.\n\nThe United Nations in coordination with the African Union should urgently deploy a new mission to protect civilians at risk in Sudan. The Security Council should impose targeted sanctions on those responsible for serious crimes in West Darfur, and individuals and companies that have and are violating the arms embargo. It should widen the existing arms embargo on Darfur to cover all of Sudan.\n\n\"The global inaction in the face of atrocities of this magnitude is inexcusable,\" Hassan said. \"Governments should ensure those responsible are held to account, including through targeted sanctions and by stepping up cooperation with the ICC.\"", "source": {"uri": "theafricanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title":

Now, experts and residents are bracing for more.\n\n\"We're living in constant terror,\" Mohammed told AFP by telephone, as the UN, world leaders and aid groups voice fears of carnage in the North Darfur state capital of 1.5 million people.\n\n\"We can't move for the bombardments,\" Mohammed said.\n\nThe RSF has seized four out of five state capitals in Darfur, a region about the size of France and home to around one quarter of Sudan's 48 million people.\n\n\"We're under a total siege,\" another resident, Ahmed Adam, told AFP in a text message that got through despite a near-total communications blackout in Darfur.\n\n\"There's no way in or out of the city that's not controlled by the RSF,\" he said.\n\nFor months, El-Fasher was protected by a fragile peace.\n\nBut unrest has soared since last month when the city's two most powerful armed groups -- which had helped to keep the peace there -- pledged to fight alongside the army.\n\nSince then, El-Fasher and the surrounding

report last week.\n\nThe war's overall death toll, however, remains unclear, a factor \"that captures just how invisible and horrific this war is\", Tom Perriello, US special envoy for Sudan, told a congressional committee on May 1.\n\nWhile figures of 15,000-30,000 have been mentioned, \"some think it's at 150,000\", Perriello said.\n\nUN experts reported up to 15,000 people killed in the West Darfur capital El-Geneina alone.\n\nMembers of the non-Arab Massalit ethnic group in El-Geneina last year were targeted for killing and other abuses by the RSF and allied militias, forcing an exodus to neighbouring Chad, which the UN says is hosting more than 745,000 people from Sudan.\n\nThe International Criminal Court, currently investigating ethnic-based killings primarily by the RSF in Darfur, says it has \"grounds to believe\" both sides are committing atrocities in the war.\n\nAs El-Fasher is home to both Arab and African communities, an all-out battle for control of the city causing massive civilian bloodshed \"would lead to revenge attacks across the five Darfur states and beyond Darfur's borders\", said Harward.\n\nIn late April, United States ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield warned that El-Fasher \"is on the precipice of a large-scale massacre\".\n\nEyewitnesses report fighting \"is now inside\" the nearby Abu Shouk camp, established 20 years ago for people displaced by ethnic violence committed by the Janjaweed militia, which led to ICC war crimes charges.\n\nThe Janjaweed later evolved into the RSF.\n\n\"Everyone who hasn't managed to leave is trapped at home,\" camp resident Issa Abdelrahman told AFP.\n\n\"People are running out of food, and no one can get to them.\"\n\n- Eating grass -\n\nAccording to UN experts, the RSF has repeatedly besieged and set fire to villages and displacement camps in Darfur.\n\nTheir siege of El-Fasher has halted aid convoys and commercial trade, Harward said.\n\nShortages have also hit the El-Fasher Southern Hospital -- the city's only remaining medical facility, where personnel are \"completely exhausted\", a medical source told AFP.\n\nRequesting anonymity for fear of both sides' well-documented targeting of medics, the source said \"some doctors haven't left the hospital in over a month\", tirelessly treating gunshot wounds, bombardment injuries and child malnutrition.\n\nThe Darfur region was already facing widespread hunger, but now \"people are resorting to consuming grass and peanut shells\", according to Michael Dunford, the World Food Programme's regional director for Eastern Africa.\n\nYet it is difficult for them to flee.\n\nUNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said encirclement of El-Fasher by armed groups and restrictions on movement along key roads \"are limiting families from leaving\".\n\nEarly this year the RSF declared victories across Sudan, but the army has since mounted defences in key locations.\n\nThe RSF has for months threatened an attack on El-Fasher but has held off, in large part due to the locally brokered truce.\n\nThey also seem to have been deterred by \"heightened international demands and warnings,\" according to Amjad Farid, a Sudanese political analyst and former aide to ex-civilian prime minister Abdalla Hamdok.\n\nBut these warnings are \"falling on deaf ears\", Harward says.\n\nWith the US having announced an imminent resumption of peace talks in Saudi Arabia, Farid said the RSF has focused anew on El-Fasher.\n\n\"These are negotiations the militia cannot enter from a position of weakness,\" Farid told AFP.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@yahoo.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}],

The particular context in which the widespread killings took place also raises the possibility that the RSF and their allies have the intent to destroy in whole or in part the Massalit in at least West Darfur, which would indicate that genocide has been and/or is being committed there.\n\nBetween June 2023 and April 2024, Human Rights Watch interviewed more than 220 people in Chad, Uganda, Kenya, and South Sudan, as well as remotely. Researchers also reviewed and analyzed over 120 photos and videos of the events, satellite imagery, and documents shared by humanitarian organizations to corroborate accounts of grave abuses.\n\nThe violence in El Geneina began nine days after fighting broke out in Khartoum, Sudan's capital city, between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), Sudan's military, and the RSF. On the morning of April 24, the RSF clashed with a Sudanese military convoy travelling through El Geneina. Then the RSF and its allied groups attacked majority Massalit neighborhoods, clashing with predominantly Massalit armed groups defending their communities. Over the following weeks - and even after Massalit armed groups lost control of their neighborhoods - the RSF and allied militias systematically targeted unarmed civilians.\n\nThe violence culminated in a large-scale massacre on June 15, when the RSF and its allies opened fire on a kilometers-long convoy of civilians desperately trying to flee, escorted by Massalit fighters. The RSF and militias pursued, rounded up, and shot men, women, and children who ran through the streets or tried to swim across the fast-flowing Kajja river. Many drowned. Older people and injured people were not spared.\n\nA 17-year-old boy described the killing of 12 children and 5 adults from several families: \"Two RSF forces ... grabb[ed] the children from their parents and, as the parents started screaming, two other RSF forces shot the parents, killing them. Then they piled up the children and shot them. They threw their bodies into the river and their belongings in after them.\"\n\nThat day and in subsequent days, the attacks continued on tens of thousands of civilians who tried to cross into Chad, leaving the countryside strewn with bodies. Videos published at the time show crowds of civilians running for their lives on the road linking El Geneina to Chad.\n\nHuman Rights Watch also documented the killing of Arab residents and the looting of Arab neighborhoods by Massalit forces, and Sudanese Armed Forces' use of explosive weapons in populated areas in ways that caused unnecessary harm to civilians and civilian objects.\n\nThe RSF and allied militias escalated their abuses again in November, targeting Massalit people who had found refuge in the El Geneina suburb of Ardamata, rounding up Massalit men and boys and, according to the UN, killing at least 1,000 people.\n\nDuring the course of these abuses, women and girls were raped and subjected to other forms of sexual violence, and detainees were tortured and otherwise ill-treated. The attackers methodically destroyed critical civilian infrastructure, targeting neighborhoods and sites, including schools, in primarily Massalit displaced communities. They looted on a grand scale; and burned, shelled, and razed neighborhoods to the ground, after emptying them of residents.\n\nThese acts were committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the Massalit and other non-Arab civilian populations of Massalit-majority neighborhoods, and as such also constitute the crimes against humanity of murder, torture, persecution, and forcible transfer of the civilian population, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nThe possibility that genocide has been and/or is being committed in Darfur requires urgent action from all governments and international institutions to protect civilians. They should ensure investigation as to whether the facts demonstrate a specific intent on the part of the RSF leadership and its allies to destroy in whole or in part the Massalit and other non-Arab ethnic communities in West Darfur, that is, to commit genocide. If so, they should act to prevent its further perpetration, and to ensure those responsible for its planning and conduct are brought to justice.\n\nThe global community should support the investigations of the International Criminal Court (ICC), while states party to the court should ensure it has the financial resources needed in its regular budget to carry out its mandate in Darfur and across its docket.\n\nHuman Rights Watch identified the commander of the RSF, Mohammed \"Hemedti\" Hamdan Dagalo, his brother Abdel Raheem Hamdan Dagalo, and the West Darfur RSF commander Joma'a Barakallah as those with command responsibility over the forces that carried out these crimes. Human Rights Watch also named RSF allies, including a commander of the Tamazuj armed group and two Arab tribal leaders, as bearing responsibility for fighters that committed serious crimes.\n\nThe United Nations in coordination with the African Union should urgently deploy a new mission to protect civilians at risk in Sudan. The Security Council should impose targeted sanctions on those responsible for serious crimes in West Darfur, and individuals and companies that have and are violating the arms embargo. It should widen the existing arms embargo on Darfur to cover all of Sudan.\n\n\"The global inaction in the face of atrocities of this magnitude is inexcusable,\" Hassan said. \"Governments should ensure those responsible are held to account, including through targeted sanctions and by stepping up cooperation with the ICC.\"\n\n/Public Release.

Times", "body": "According to Human Rights Watch, the excessive violence that the Sudanese rebel movement RSF has caused in the Darfur region is ethnic cleansing. The human rights organization investigated the town of el-Geneina in the Sudanese region, where thousands of people died last year due to violence by the rebel army and Arab militias against Sudanese of African descent.\n\nRefugee residents of the city speak of looting, rape and murder by the rebel movement. Human Rights Watch (HRW) suspects the report also that there was a conscious search for people from the Masalit ethnic group, which would amount to genocide. HRW wants this to be further investigated by the international community.\n\n\"This report from HRW contains testimonies from survivors about what happened last year in the town of el-Geneina. For example, a 17-year-old boy describes how children were thrown into a pile and then shot dead during an attack on a convoy with refugees. And based on satellite images, HRW concludes that Masalit neighborhoods in the city have been razed to the ground by bulldozers.\n\nThese are horrible stories that are now coming out and it is special that this report is now available. The Darfur region is virtually impassable for journalists and aid workers to conduct research.\"\n\nFive years ago, autocratic leader Omar al-Bashir was deposed in Sudan after three decades. The coup was carried out by the regular Sudanese army SAF and the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces (RSF), but the parties subsequently failed to agree on the division of power. In April last year, fighting broke out in the capital Khartoum and other parts of the country.\n\nBoth parties are supported and opposed by other groups. The warring parties made several deals on a ceasefire, but each time the agreement was reached violated.\n\nAccording to the Red Cross, the conflict receives too little attention due to other crises in the world and the number of deaths can only be estimated. According to the UN, more than eight million people have fled in one year.\n\nIt is not the first time that there is ethnic violence in Darfur. Twenty years ago, an estimated 300,000 Sudanese of African descent were killed. At the time the Arab militias were called Janjaweed, the RSF is a continuation of that.\n\nWestern countries have their citizens from Sudan evacuated; the Sudanese population is lagging behind.

The epicenter of this upheaval is Darfur, a region characterized by ethnic discord between Arab and non-Arab groups, historically vying for key resources such as water, land and other natural untouched resources. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), derived from the infamous Janjaweed militias, has already showed a notably ferocious approach, exactly directing their actions at non-Arab tribes like the Masalit, notoriously engaging in ruthless campaigns aimed at ethnic cleansing. The origins of this conflict may be traced back to Sudan's attainment of independence in 1956, marked by the central government's disregard and exploitation of Darfur. In 2003, the war intensified significantly with the outbreak of rebellion aimed at toppling the then-Islamist military regime of President Omar al-Bashir. As a response, Bashir mobilized Janjaweed militias, whose brutal actions caused extensive suffering all the way, ultimately resulting in their official incorporation into the RSF by 2013, under the command of Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemeti. In 2019, Hemeti and General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan removed Bashir from power during a rebellion, but their partnership quickly fell apart, resulting in additional conflicts by 2023.\n\nAside from its ethnic and political conflicts, Darfur holds significant strategic value due to its abundant natural resources, mainly gold. This precious metal plays a vital role in the economic self-sufficiency and military activities of the RSF. The RSF's dominance over these resources has greatly enhanced their operational and economic might, establishing them as a pivotal force in the ongoing battle. The international dynamics of this battle are noteworthy, as the RSF is receiving support from other entities such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Russia. The UAE has made substantial investments in Sudanese agriculture and infrastructure, driven by geopolitical objectives and economic benefits. Moreover, the RSF has received military assistance from the Wagner Group, which is associated with Russia. Although the U.S.A. has imposed international sanctions on RSF leaders and entities, the effectiveness of these actions has been normal and weakened (less effective in true sense) owing to ongoing external funding, particularly from the UAE and other unknown international actors or game-makers. The international response to the situation in Sudan has been lukewarm, with criticism directed towards its insufficiency and lack of concentration, which has been worsened by other worldwide problems such as Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Palestine conflicts. Efforts to negotiate ceasefire agreements have been unsuccessful and futile despite numerous attempts, as both the SAF and RSF have violated completely the terms and conditions. This has led to increased uncertainty in the region and has made peace efforts more complex outright. As the crisis intensifies, the leader of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Dagalo, can withdraw to his stronghold in Darfur, utilizing his influence over crucial supplies.\n\nTo end the occurrence of these lethal and inhumane atrocities in Sudan, an array of measures must be taken and implemented. The country should consider the following established strategies owing to reach a peaceful solution. Agreements, especially ceasefire agreements, play a vital role in the process of resolving conflicts. Their chief objective is to put a stop to violence and promote discussion. A practical example of such agreements can be seen in the temporary ceasefires during the Syrian civil war. These ceasefires allowed for the delivery of humanitarian aid and created a milieu for peace negotiations, though being frequently violated. Neutral international mediators, like U.S. Senator George Mitchell in the Good Friday Agreement, may greatly assist in settling disputes by facilitating inclusive debate and negotiations, ultimately leading to long-lasting peace solutions. Providing prompt humanitarian aid, as demonstrated by the Red Cross (an international organization) in Rwanda after the genocide, is increasingly indispensable for bringing stability to afflicted areas and facilitating the process of rehabilitation, while also fostering positive relationships among the populations associated with it. Disarmament, Demobilisation, and Reintegration (DDR) programmes play a vital role in helping soldiers adapt to civilian life and curtailing their potential for violence. This was evident in Colombia after the peace accord with FARC rebels. Facilitating inclusive political processes, similar to the negotiations in South Africa that brought an end to apartheid, serves to tackle ethnic or group tensions and cultivate a unified society. Economic development and integration are crucial factors as well in resolving conflicts by shrinking inequalities and fostering peace, as seen by the significant influence of the Marshall Plan on the post-World War II European reconstruction. The utilization of institutions such as Rwanda's Gacaca courts serves the purpose of not only promoting justice but also facilitating national healing and reconciliation in response to past crimes. The application of international pressure and sanctions, as exemplified by the measures taken against Iran in response to its nuclear programme, can effectively induce disputing parties to engage in discussion and adhere to international standards. Utilizing international peacekeeping forces, such as those deployed by the United Nations in the Democratic Republic of Congo, serves to uphold peace and safeguard civilians in the vulnerable stages after an agreement. Additionally, the incorporation of resilient monitoring and verification procedures, similar to those employed in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between North and South Sudan, guarantees adherence to peace agreements and fosters confidence among all participating parties.", "source": {"uri": "moderndiplomacy.eu", "dataType": "news", "title": "Modern Diplomacy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Support_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapid Support Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sudanese Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darfur", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darfur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darfur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janjaweed", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Janjaweed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemedti", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hemedti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdel_Fattah_al-Burhan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abdel Fattah al-Burhan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masalit_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Masalit people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_al-Bashir", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omar al-Bashir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethnic cleansing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military dictatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wagner Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural resource"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Peace_Agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comprehensive Peace Agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Syrian Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_J._Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George J.

The US special envoy for Sudan, Tom Perriello, said on April 16 that the Biden administration \"welcomes the decision of Saudi Arabia to restart Jeddah talks within the next three weeks\".\n\nBut Gen Al Burhan's remarks have dashed hopes of at least a pause in fighting to alleviate what the UN has called a \"humanitarian crisis of epic proportions\", with famine threatening and more than 8.7 million people uprooted - more than anywhere else in the world.\n\nTens of thousands of people have been killed, including up to 15,000 in the West Darfur town of El Geneina in what UN experts said was a campaign of violence by the RSF against civilians there.\n\nExperts have warned the north-east African country is at risk of breaking apart.\n\n\"Our fight against the rebel terrorist Rapid Support militia will not stop except by liberating this country from these criminal rebels,\" Gen Al Burhan said.\n\n\"We will not stop fighting until we defeat these criminals who destroyed this honourable country and who deprived citizens of their property, committed the most horrific violations and raped our free daughters in Khartoum, Al Geneina and Al Jazira.\"\n\nFierce clashes erupted earlier this week, with hundreds of soldiers and RSF fighters killed in battles around the city of El Obeid, the largest city in the central Kordofan region that is mostly controlled by the paramilitary.\n\nOn Thursday, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said it had been forced to suspend work and withdraw staff from the Madani Teaching Hospital, the only functional hospital for the hundreds of thousands of people in dire need of medical assistance in the capital of Al Jazira state.\n\n\"The health system and basic services in Al Jazira state have collapsed as a consequence of the fighting and the systematic blockade on supplies and personnel entering the area,\" Mari Carmen Vinoles, operations manager for MSF in Sudan, said.\n\nThe RSF has seized four out of five state capitals in the Darfur region, home to around one quarter of Sudan's 48 million people.\n\nThe International Criminal Court, currently investigating ethnic killings primarily by the RSF in Darfur, says it has \"grounds to believe\" both sides are committing atrocities in the war.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The base had been under RSF control since the beginning of the ongoing conflict.\n\nAccording to military sources from the Sudan Tribune, the Fifth Infantry Division initiated an offensive early Tuesday morning from the eastern outskirts of Al-Obeid. They engaged in intense combat with the RSF, ultimately securing the Jabal al-Ain camp and the nearby village of Abu al-Ghar.\n\nSituated approximately 20 kilometres east of Al-Obeid along the national road to White Nile State, the Jabal al-Ain camp serves as the primary training facility for the Fifth Infantry Division, known as \"Haggana.\" It had been exploited by the RSF to enforce a blockade on Al-Obeid since the war's early days.\n\nMoreover, the Sudanese army also reclaimed the Central Reserve Forces camp of the Sudanese police within the city, which had been briefly overtaken by the RSF.\n\nSupporters of the RSF circulated videos displaying their forces inside the central reserve camp. However, the army quickly countered by releasing a video confirming their victory over the RSF, reporting significant enemy casualties, including losses of personnel and equipment.\n\nPro-army media outlets have also shown footage of army officers and soldiers re-establishing control over the Jabal al-Ain camp.\n\nIn related developments, the Sudanese army continued aerial assaults on RSF positions in Al-Rahad and Umm Rawaba, North Kordofan, for a second consecutive day. Eyewitnesses reported to the Sudan Tribune that the airstrikes targeted RSF gatherings to the south and east of Um Rawaba and additional sites in southern Al-Rahad. The bombings reportedly resulted in civilian casualties and significant property damage.\n\nThe army's strategic objective is to reopen the national road connecting North Kordofan State with White Nile State, which has been under RSF control since the conflict began. The military efforts are concentrated on forces advancing from Al-Obeid and additional units positioned in Tindelti, White Nile State, with a focus on retaking Umm Rawaba and Al Rahad.\n\nA Rapid Support Forces (RSF) spokesperson disputed recent claims, stating their forces achieved a major victory in North Kordofan.\n\nHe alleged the Sudanese army, which they referred to as \"remnants,\" attempted to reopen the Kosti Al-Obeid National Road through two separate attacks.

The international community's virtual silence continues despite the imminent risk of genocide and crimes against humanity in El Fasher as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group, besieges Darfur's largest city, where essential supplies are running out.\n\nSeventy-five years ago, the United Nations adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide - and with it, made the solemn promise to prevent the worst horrors of the 20th century from ever happening again.\n\nTwenty years ago, a massive movement emerged in the United States rallying behind the populations at risk of genocide in Darfur. However, the absence of a significant transitional justice period led to the same cycles of genocidal violence today - the same perpetrators committing the same crimes of destruction against the same victim groups with impunity. As this genocide in Darfur unfolds before our eyes, it's clear that the international community's promise of \"Never Again\" is not even a rhetorical commitment, despite the clear legal obligations imposed on all States to act under the Genocide Convention.\n\nSince April 2023, tens of thousands of civilians have been killed, nearly nine million people (the largest number globally) forcibly displaced from their homes, including more than 4 million children, and an untold number affected by violence and deadly diseases within a decimated health care system, where 70-80 percent of hospitals and other health care facilities are no longer functional.\n\nThe war is creating \"the world's largest hunger crisis,\" warned the Executive Director of the U.N. World Food Programme. The looming famine threatens to drive 7 million people into catastrophic levels of food insecurity (IPC Level 5) by June, during the lean season. More than half the population is in need of humanitarian aid and food assistance. According to Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), in Zamzam displaced persons' camp near El Fasher, about 30 percent of the children have been found to be suffering from acute malnutrition. Earlier in February, MSF reported at least one child dies every two hours in the camp.\n\nThe war has led to genocidal attacks, displacement, disease, and famine, culminating in one of the gravest humanitarian crises of our time. Yet, amidst the harrowing cries for help echoing from this embattled region, the international community remains disturbingly silent. While conflicts elsewhere capture headlines, the plight of the Sudanese people often goes unnoticed, relegated to the side-lines. And while the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs' 2024 plan for Sudan identified that at least $2.7 billion was needed, only 10.3 percent of that minimum had been funded as of Apr. 25. This lack of attention not only prolongs human suffering and serves as a stain on the international community's collective consciousness, but also sends a chilling message: that some lives are deemed more expendable than others.\n\nLast year, following the rising level of incitement and ethnically targeted killing against members of non-Arab groups in El Geneina and other parts of Darfur, the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights (where we work) and leading experts on genocide and Sudan sounded the alarm on the serious risk of genocide and urged the international community to act immediately to prevent genocide, and hold the perpetrators and their enablers accountable.\n\nIn mid-April, a year since the outbreak of the devastating war between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF, we released the first independent legal analysis into breaches of the Genocide Convention in Darfur. We served as the primary authors of the report, with contributions and endorsements from dozens of world-leading jurists and scholars in the field, including founding prosecutors of the international criminal tribunals, former supreme court justices, and presidents of the International Association of Genocide Scholars.\n\nThe inquiry applies a State and entity accountability legal framework, rather than individual criminal liability - and identifies the perpetrators and enablers responsible for breaches of the Genocide Convention. Accordingly, the report applies standards used by U.N. investigative teams, including clear and convincing evidence and reasonable grounds. The report's evidence (available in the nearly 400 footnotes) is largely drawn from open-source information, including pertinent U.N. reports between April 2023 and April 2024. The analysis is geographically limited to Darfur due to the ethnically motivated nature and severity of the attacks against non-Arab groups there.\n\nBased on this analysis, we reached the following conclusions, the evidentiary bases of which are explained in detail in the full report.\n\nFirst, based on clear and convincing evidence, the RSF has committed and is committing genocide against the non-Arab Masalit group in West Darfur. Despite the early signs, the international community failed to prevent the genocide in West Darfur.\n\nSecond, based on the first conclusion, and as established by the ICJ in Bosnia v. Serbia, all 153 State parties to the Genocide Convention are under the obligation to halt and prevent the genocide and a corresponding duty act. The international community has long avoided responding adequately to the Darfur genocide. As the U.N. Coordinator for Sudan at the time of the first genocide (and author of the report's preface), Mukesh Kapila, made abundantly clear, \"Darfur in 2003 was a highly preventable genocide.\" Information was made available in real time during the early 2000s and is available now. We all knew then. We all know now. The failure to enforce the Genocide Convention is a matter of choice.\n\nThird, based on clear and convincing evidence, the RSF and its allied militia are responsible for direct and public incitement to genocide against the Masalit in West Darfur. The report extensively details the direct incitement expressed often as explicit intent to destroy non-Arab groups preceding genocidal acts. The RSF militias make blanket calls to \"kill Masalit\" or \"shoot the boys,\" use language such as \"we must destroy them now,\" and repeatedly refer to members of non-Arab groups as \"slaves,\" \"dogs,\" or \"dirt.\" This pattern of open dehumanization and incitement results in the most brutal forms of identity-based atrocities.\n\nFourth, based on clear and convincing evidence, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (bearing greatest responsibility), Chad, the Central African Republic, Russia via the Wagner Group, and Sudan are complicit in the genocide. Each of these States is complicit by providing the RSF with political, geographic, financial, and military support directly fuelling the genocide.\n\nFifth and finally, there are reasonable grounds to believe that the RSF and its allied Arab militia are committing genocide against non-Arab populations other than the Masalit, mainly the Fur and Zaghawa.\n\nSince we released the report in April, shocking levels of violence continue to unfold. The RSF has razed villages on its way to attacking El Fasher, signaling the imminent and catastrophic risk of genocide there. The early signs we are witnessing in and around El Fasher are similar to what we have seen in El Geneina. These include deliberate incitement campaigns against the non-Arab Zaghawa and Fur populations. Recently, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield sounded the alarm, saying El Fasher \"is on the precipice of a large-scale massacre.\"\n\nThe calamity in El Fasher will affect even more people than the massacres and systematic sexual violence committed in El Geneina against the Masalit. According to the U.N., El Fasher is now home to more than 1.5 million people, including over 800,000 displaced persons, many of whom have recently fled RSF atrocities in other States. While El Geneina is at least within walking distance of Adr\u00e9, Chad, El Fasher is out of reach of safe destinations for the impending waves of fleeing communities. Without a robust prevention and protection plan, these vulnerable civilians will be left for death. Further, the dry season in Sudan, coupled with desert lands in North Darfur, will undoubtedly exacerbate the already catastrophic situation.\n\nPlacing Darfur's crisis as a top priority on the global agenda is critical. Now that the international community is aware of the risks in El Fasher, all States are under the obligation to decisively act to protect populations in El Fasher and live up to their commitment under the Genocide Convention and international law.\n\nFirst, the international community must be prepared for the worst to come. If the U.N. Security Council is unable to authorize a peacekeeping force to protect civilians, the international community should create safe areas and passage for civilians at risk of genocide. At a minimum, the U.N. Security Council should host an emergency meeting to raise the profile and shine a protective spotlight on the populations at risk. The urgency of the situation in El Fasher demands immediate action and cannot wait for the complex bureaucratic process of deploying troops.\n\nSecond, the African Union member States should take the lead and uphold their promise and commitment to prevent genocide through all reasonable means. Moreover, African States cannot become safe havens for the genocidaires and their enablers. Instead, such actors must be held accountable and made international pariahs.\n\nThird, States should impose immediate costs on the outside actors fueling this conflict and genocide, in open defiance of the U.N. arms embargo and sanctions measures of Resolution 1591, including, most prominently, the UAE. The U.N. Panel of Experts on Sudan already identified some of the financing and arms supply networks in its findings, which should now be targeted with concrete sanctions. The U.N. Security Council can further add the implicated entities to its consolidated sanctions list.\n\nFourth, the International Criminal Court must issue arrest warrants against all perpetrators involved in atrocity crimes in Darfur. Arrest warrants will put the world on notice and at least disqualify the RSF leaders from international diplomacy and engagement.\n\nFifth, the international community must call out the specific individuals behind the genocide and other atrocities as well as their enablers. In particular, the RSF's commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (a.k.a Hemedti) must be directly held accountable for his command responsibility over the RSF.\n\nFinally, the international community must urgently and timely deploy the recent pledges made by donors at the Paris conference for Sudan -- the only way to start adequately addressing the needs of 18 million Sudanese facing acute levels of food insecurity.\n\nIn a climate of apathy and cynicism around an impartial and effective system of international law, these are the bare minimum common-sense steps that States should take today to stop the genocide in Darfur and support the communities most impacted and at risk.", "source": {"uri": "justsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Just Security"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) is defeated.\n\nAl-Burhan, also the general commander of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), made the remarks when addressing an army force in the River Nile state in northern Sudan, the sovereign council said in a statement.\n\n\"There will be no negotiations, no peace, and no ceasefire except after defeating this rebellion... so this country can live in peace,\" Al-Burhan said.\n\nAl-Burhan's remarks came a day after violent battles between the SAF and the RSF in North Kordofan state.\n\nOn Tuesday, the SAF announced on its Facebook page that the army's Fifth Infantry Division achieved victories in El Obeid, the capital city of North Kordofan state.\n\nHowever, the RSF on Wednesday said in a statement that it had repelled an attack by the SAF in North Kordofan state.\n\nA slew of peace initiatives have been put forward to end the armed conflict in Sudan, including by the African Union, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, an East African bloc, Saudi Arabia, and the United States, but all have so far failed.\n\nAccording to the UN, half of Sudan's population -- some 25 million people -- need humanitarian assistance and protection, with nearly 18 million people facing acute food insecurity.\n\nSince the conflict between the SAF and the RSF broke out on April 15, 2023, around 15,000 fatalities have been recorded, while the number of people displaced inside and outside of Sudan has reached 8.2 million, according to recent estimates by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. \u25a0",

paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) is defeated.\n\nAl-Burhan, also the general commander of the Sudanese Armed Forces (Saf), made the remarks when addressing an army force in the River Nile state in northern Sudan, the sovereign council said in a statement.\n\n\"There will be no negotiations, no peace, and no ceasefire except after defeating this rebellion... so this country can live in peace,\" Al-Burhan said.\n\nRead: US to launch new talks to end Sudan war\n\nAl-Burhan's remarks came a day after violent battles between the Saf and the RSF in North Kordofan state.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Saf announced on its Facebook page that the army's Fifth Infantry Division achieved victories in El Obeid, the capital city of North Kordofan state.\n\nHowever, the RSF on Wednesday said in a statement that it had repelled an attack by the Saf in North Kordofan state.\n\nA slew of peace initiatives have been put forward to end the armed conflict in Sudan, including by the African Union, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (Igad), Saudi Arabia, and the US, but all have so far failed.\n\nAccording to the UN, half of Sudan's population -- some 25 million people -- need humanitarian assistance and protection, with nearly 18 million people facing acute food insecurity.\n\nRead: UN warns of potential Sudan deaths as famine looms\n\nSince the conflict between the Saf and the RSF broke out on April 15, 2023, around 15,000 fatalities have been recorded, while the number of people displaced inside and outside of Sudan has reached 8.2 million, according to recent estimates by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha).", "source": {"uri": "theeastafrican.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "The East African"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

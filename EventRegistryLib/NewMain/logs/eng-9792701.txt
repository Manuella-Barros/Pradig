He's 10-of-14 from that distance through three games.\n\nKerr said the plan going into training camp was to have Durant start. There was much anticipation for LeBron James, Stephen Curry and Durant, three all-time greats, to start together in the Olympics.\n\nCurry even said trio the took a picture like Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird did from the iconic 1992 Dream Team, but Durant suffered a calf injury before training camp that sidelined him for Team USA's five exhibition games.\n\nDurant progressed to the point of being able to practice and participate in a 5-on-5 scrimmage days before Team USA's Olympic Group C play opener against Serbia. He not only returned for that game, but Durant played one of his best games ever in Olympic competition.\n\nMaking his first eight shots with five coming from 3-point range, Durant scored 23 points with 21 coming in the first half of a 110-84 blitzing of Serbia.\n\n\"We had kind of established a lineup that we liked,\" Kerr said. \"When we brought (Durant) back, he was only going to play a certain amount of minutes against Serbia and he played so well and he fit so well with that group and it was devastating to see that group together.\"\n\nAfter that game, Durant said he was OK with however Kerr wants to utilize him. Durant played three seasons for Kerr in Golden State, winning back-to-back NBA championships (2017, 2018).\n\n\"I told coach whatever he needs me from me, I'm willing to do anything to adapt to anything,\" Durant said when asked if he's cool as a sixth man. \"It's always been fun trying to figure out new roles, adapt to whatever the game tells me.\"\n\nIn turn, Jayson Tatum didn't see any action at all early on. Kerr admitted the Tatum decision was crazy, but he made it in part because of Durant's return. Kerr also wanted to see certain lineup combinations.\n\nTatum wound up starting the next two games as Team USA finished 3-0 in group play. He and Durant are essentially playing the same position when looking at Devin Booker and Curry starting in the backcourt along with James and either Joel Embiid or Davis in the frontcourt.\n\nRelated: Here's why Phoenix Suns' star Devin Booker is a big hit with fans in France\n\nHaving Durant come off the bench puts him in a potent lineup that has size with Davis and Adebayo playing together, the explosive Edwards and two guys who play multiple roles in White and Holiday. Durant's plug-and-play ability opens up the floor for interior scoring and puts him in position to be the primary 3-point shooter.\n\n\"We've been calling ourselves the bench mob for a long time now,\" Adebayo said after Team USA's 103-86 victory over South Sudan. \"It doesn't matter who's in the lineup, we always seem to figure it out.\"", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType":

He secured that record in the group-stage finale Saturday against Puerto Rico, his four rebounds in that game allowing him to pass both Anthony (125) and David Robinson (124) for the top spot there.\n\nLeslie remains -- far and away -- the career leader in U.S. Olympic play for rebounding with 241 in her 32 games.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

Led by different players each game, Team USA received contributions from up and down their roster as head coach Steve Kerr made difficult rotation decisions.\n\nOne of the tough decisions Kerr made was to bring Phoenix Suns star Kevin Durant off the bench in his return from injury. Scoring 23 points against Serbia in his return, Durant led Team USA in scoring. Kerr, who coached Durant during his three seasons with the Golden State Warriors, plans to continue bringing the star forward off the bench.\n\nReacting to this, Miami Heat star Bam Adebayo sent a message to Durant on Instagram. Also a reserve for Team USA, Adebayo wrote, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bench mob.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nDurant responded to Adebayo with a chair emoji, seeming to embrace his role off Team USA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bench. Despite coming off the bench for all three games, Durant is second on Team USA in scoring, averaging 16.0 points per game. Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards leads the team at 16.7 points per game.\n\nKerr has made some controversial decisions in this Olympics run, and bringing Durant off the bench is another one. That said, Team USA has been dominant so far, and Kerr is sticking with Durant off the bench.\u00c2 There seems to be a real level of buy-in on Team USA, which is essential in a setting like this.\n\nDraymond Green Fires Back at NBA Legend's Outlandish Warriors Statement\n\nMajor Update on Golden State Warriors' Offseason Plans Revealed", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Pierre-Mauroy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Pierre-Mauroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villeneuve-d'Ascq", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villeneuve-d'Ascq"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Villeneuve-d'Ascq"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6000,h_3375,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_warriors/01j4g6nf29fwdmbj9gtf.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792701", "eventUri": "eng-9792701", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

While Durant has dominated for the Oklahoma City Thunder, Golden State Warriors, Brooklyn Nets and Phoenix Suns, he has moved around so much that he hasn't been able to leave a definitive legacy with any one team. If anything, the most stable stop of his career has been for Team USA at the Olympics.\n\nDurant tried to play for Team USA after his rookie season in 2008, but was one of the last cuts from the famous Redeem Team. He didn't let that discourage him, though, because he has played for every American Olympic team since then. Durant won gold for Team USA in 2012, 2016 and 2021, and now, he is two wins away from his fourth Olympic gold medal. If Team USA finishes the job, Durant will become the first male Olympian to earn four gold medals in basketball.\n\nFittingly, he is now also the leading scorer in Team USA Olympic history. While he had long since passed Carmelo Anthony as the leader on the men's side, on Tuesday, this dunk took him to 489 career points at the Olympics. That broke the record previously set by Lisa Leslie, making Durant the all-time American leader.\n\nSadly for Durant, the all-time overall Olympic record is almost certainly out of his grasp. Brazilian legend Oscar Schmidt has scored a staggering 1,093 points in Olympic play, more than 300 points ahead of second-place Andrew Gaze of Australia. Durant entered this tournament at No. 13 overall and will leave within the top 10. Perhaps he could assure himself a top-five all-time finish if he decides to play in the 2028 tournament, but Schmidt is too far away for a 35-year-old Durant to reasonably catch him.\n\nThat does not diminish Durant's achievement, though. The fact that no American will ever approach that record is a testament to the amount of talent it brings to the Olympics. No American ever needs to average 30 points for Team USA to win gold. Its challenge is different. It's about fitting into a team structure and doing what is asked of the players. Durant has done that in spades throughout his Olympic career.\n\nIn truth, Durant's record says as much about his commitment to USA Basketball as it does his scoring ability. Team USA cycles through superstars faster than any other nation. Very few players participate in the Olympics more than once or twice. But whenever Durant has been considered, he has either played for Team USA or at least tried to do so.

If Kevin had been here from day one, chances are he would be starting.

It was devastating to see that group together. There are no plans to change that.\"\n\n\"But of course, as the games get more difficult, Kevin will be playing more minutes. Keep coming off the bench for now but we'll lean on it more and more as we go.\"\n\nView the original article to see embedded media.\n\nDurant has averaged 16.0 points in 19.2 minutes per game in the 2024 Olympics, shooting 63.6% from the field and 71.4% from three.\n\nKD started his campaign off with a red-hot shooting performance against Serbia where he ended the game with 24 points in 17 minutes. He scored 21 of those points in a perfect first half, completely blowing Serbia out of any chance of a comeback.\n\nTeam USA's rotations have been a major topic of debate this summer given the strength of the team means most players won't be starters and some might even get 0 playing time. While players like Anthony Davis and Bam Adebayo have struggled to be definite starters, Joel Embiid, Jayson Tatum, and Tyrese Haliburton have received DNPs on the squad.\n\nThe only definite trend emerging through the first three games of the Olympics is that the USA will start games with Stephen Curry, Devin Booker, and LeBron James.\n\nKevin Durant Is The Greatest Olympic Basketball Player Ever According To Coach K\n\nFormer Team USA head coach and legendary NCAA coach Mike Krzyzewski recently hailed Durant as the greatest player in the history of basketball at the Olympics.\n\n\"I think he is because of longevity and accomplishment. It's unique, but the amount of points he's scored, he's scored a lot more than anyone else. When he scored in Istanbul in 2010, he averaged 33 points a game in the medal round. Obviously, in London, he was a part of a huge team that we had with LeBron and Kobe. In 2016, Rio, he was by far the best scorer and really led us to the Gold medal.\"\n\nDurant is the all-time leading scorer for Team USA at the Olympics with 483 points over his career, playing at every Olympics since London 2012. He's won the last three Gold medals in Olympic basketball, hoping to win his fourth one in Paris.\n\nEven though he's coming off the bench for this run, there's no questioning Durant's importance to the Team USA program and his status as the greatest Olympian in basketball history, especially Team USA.\n\nRelated: Kevin Durant Becomes All-Time Leading Scorer And Rebounder For Team USA\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

He took a selfie with Kevin Durant, who was fast asleep in the backseat of the team bus, mouth wide open. Durant was completely out cold, and Adebayo couldn't resist sharing this hilarious moment with the world. The photo quickly went viral, showcasing the lighter side of Team USA's Olympic journey.\n\nDurant, known for his competitive nature and serious demeanor on the court, will undoubtedly look for an opportunity to get back at Adebayo. However, for now, Team USA's focus remains on their upcoming quarterfinal match against Brazil.\n\nThe image of Durant sleeping has not only entertained fans but also highlighted the camaraderie and playful spirit within Team USA. Despite the fierce competition and high stakes, moments like these remind us that even top athletes need to unwind and enjoy some humor.\n\nKevin Durant, who has been a key player for Team USA, leads the team in scoring and is on the verge of breaking Lisa Leslie's all-time points record for USA Basketball. His stellar performances have been crucial, and his rest, even if caught on camera in an unflattering moment, is well-earned.\n\nDurant's stats speak volumes about his impact on the court. Averaging 16.0 points per game on an impressive 63.6% shooting, he has been a force to be reckoned with. Alongside him, Bam Adebayo has also shone brightly, averaging 8.3 points and 4.7 rebounds per game. The duo has been instrumental in Team USA's 3-0 start, showcasing their chemistry and effectiveness off the bench.\n\nCoach Steve Kerr has strategically used Durant and Adebayo to bolster the second unit, maintaining a strong offensive and defensive presence throughout the games. Their performances have been a key factor in Team USA's dominance so far.\n\nAs Team USA prepares to face Brazil, fans and teammates alike will surely keep an eye on the playful banter between Durant and Adebayo. Moments like these not only build team spirit but also provide a glimpse into the personalities of these world-class athletes. With their sights set on gold, the blend of humor and hard work could be the perfect recipe for success.\n\nKevin Durant On Who He Respects\n\nKevin Durant recently shared his candid thoughts on whose opinions he truly values. Throughout his career, Durant has been a polarizing figure in basketball, garnering both admiration and criticism. However, he has a clear filter for which opinions about himself he chooses to acknowledge.\n\nIn an interview with the media team at the 2024 Olympics, Durant emphasized that the opinions he respects the most come from his peers -- fellow players who understand the game and the effort it takes to excel. He finds particular value in hearing how he has impacted the careers of other players striving to make it in the NBA.\n\n\"It's pretty cool when you hear it from the real players, the guys actually putting in the work, that are trying to make it to the NBA. You hear what I've meant to them and their careers.\"\n\n\"Then you hear what other people say about me sometimes, and they don't understand my impact. But when you talk to the players, they give you a whole different story, which is pretty cool. It always comes down to what the guys on the floor are saying about you. Those are the opinions I really respect.\"\n\nDurant's comments highlight his appreciation for the recognition from his fellow athletes, who truly grasp the nuances and demands of professional basketball. For Durant, it's the acknowledgment of his contributions and influence from those who share the court with him that holds the most weight.\n\nAs a player who has experienced the highest highs and faced significant scrutiny, Durant's focus on the respect of his peers speaks to his understanding of the sport and his legacy within it. While public opinion can be varied and often harsh, Durant remains grounded by valuing the insights and respect of those who know the game best.\n\nRelated: Kevin Durant Expected To Continue Coming Off The Bench For Team USA At Paris 2024\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

Until Tuesday night in Paris, she held the program's all-time scoring record. However, Kevin Durant now holds the honor after another solid performance against Brazil in the 2024 Paris quarterfinals.\n\nWhile some might be rooting for nobody to surpass them, Leslie was the opposite. She sent a message out to Durant on social media, congratulating him for breaking the record. A cool moment between two great Olympians for the United States.\n\nIndividual honors are cool but Leslie did take some time to remind Durant what the ultimate goal is.\n\n\"Congratulations @KDTrey5 I'm honored to have you break my @TeamUSA Olympic record!!!\" Leslie said. \"Our dedication to our country is evident and etched in stone!! Now go get another Gold medal my friend! One Team, One Goal, Gold!\"\n\nLeslie has four Olympic Gold Medals to her name, being a staple for the women's team for years. There are a few more medals Leslie won outside of the Olympics, having four Gold Medals in other events plus a bronze medal.\n\nThe record previously held by the women's star was 488 points. But in the third quarter on Tuesday night, a Durant dunk brought him to 489. With two games remaining, there is a good chance Durant breaks into the 500s and make the all-time record that much tougher to break.\n\nAlthough Durant was not a part of the famous Redeem Team back in 2008, he has been the consistent presence for USA Basketball over the past 16 years. If the US can get the job done in Paris, a fourth consecutive Olympic Gold Medal will be heading back stateside with Durant. That would be a men's record in itself, surpassing Carmello Anthony for the most all-time.\n\nTokyo 2020's gold medal was in large part due to Durant and his accomplishments. In six games, the long-time superstar averaged 20.7 points while shooting 52.9% from the field and 37.5% from three. Durant also led the team in rebounds and assists, averaging 5.3 and 3.7, respectively.\n\nDurant entered the 2024 Olympics dealing with a calf injury and has been coming off the bench for Steve Kerr's team. He is still the second-leading scorer on the squad, averaging 16.0 points entering Tuesday night. Anthony Edwards has been a few ticks better at 16.7 points.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "griffin_mcveigh@on3.com", "name": "Griffin McVeigh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Leslie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lisa Leslie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/07/10154157/Untitled-design2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792701", "eventUri": "eng-9792701", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

He has been effective nevertheless, most notably exploding for 23 points in just 17 minutes in a blowout win versus Serbia on July 28. The prolific scorer has publicly embraced his reserve duties and upheld the theme of selflessness that has defined this Team USA run.\n\nAnd it is a good thing he has, because there will apparently be no change to his role for the remainder of the Paris Games.\n\n\"We've found a good groove,\" head coach Steve Kerr said, via the SportsCenter Instagram account. \"If Kevin had been here from day one, chances are he would be starting.

Labels hold no significance, however, since Kerr plans to lean on the 35-year-old more as the competition stiffens in the quarterfinals and beyond.\n\n\"He played so well {against Serbia} and he fit so well with that group... so there's no plans on changing that,\" Kerr admitted. \"But of course, as the games get more difficult, my guess is Kevin will be playing more and more minutes.\"\n\nWhile no one has questioned the talent of this iteration of Team USA, many wondered how playing time would be distributed. There are many mouths to feed on this roster, all of whom are used to being well-fed at the NBA level. Kerr has struggled at times to accommodate everyone, benching both Jayson Tatum and Joel Embiid during the group stage.\n\nThey handled the move with grace, however, just as Kevin Durant is doing in what is expected to be his final run with Team USA. Regardless of what lineup Steve Kerr rolls out for Tuesday's game against Brazil, fans know it will be a supremely talented, skilled and experienced one.

Kerr revealed that had he been able to do so, he would likely be part of the team's starting lineup.\n\n\"If Kevin had been here from Day 1, chances are he'd be starting. That was the plan coming in. But given that he missed all of our friendlies and came in late, we had kind of established a lineup that we liked,\" the NBA sharpshooter turned coach revealed in a conference call on Sunday.\n\nThe \"Slim Reaper\" returned to Team USA's lineup in their first game in the 2024 Summer Games versus Serbia, albeit in a reserve role. His presence significantly bolstered the second unit, featuring Bam Adebayo and Anthony Davis. KD didn't miss a beat, tallying 23 points on 8-of-9 shooting, showcasing his ability to make an immediate impact off the bench.\n\n\"When we brought him back, he was only going to play a certain amount of minutes against Serbia. And he played so well, and he fit so well with that group, and it was devastating to see that group together,\" Steve said.\n\nRelated: \"This motherf***** didn't speak up\"- Coach K on waiting for LeBron to speak to the group during the Redeem Team's first meeting\n\nNot changing the starting lineup\n\nKerr's recent decisions regarding Team USA's starting lineups in the group stage have led to significant discussions and, at times, outrage.\n\nAgainst Serbia, Steve elected not to play Boston Celtics superstar Jayson Tatum. He followed that up by benching Philadelphia 76ers big man Joel Embiid in the game against South Sudan. However, a lineup change he won't be making soon is putting KD, a 14-time All-Star, in the starting lineup alongside LeBron James, Jrue Holiday, and Stephen Curry.\n\n\"There's no plans on changing that. But of course, as the games get more difficult, my guess is Kevin will be playing more and more minutes. So he'll keep coming off the bench for now, but we'll lean on him more and more as we go,\" Steve stressed.\n\nDurant himself said he has no qualms about not starting, telling ESPN, \"It's basketball. It really doesn't matter who starts. It's about really who finished the game, who put their impact on the game while they're in the game. So I just try to do my best to impact it any way I can.\"\n\nTeam USA was dominant in the group stage, winning by an average margin of 21 points. However, their resolve will be tested more this week as the competition's knockout stages commence. Fortunately for the Americans, they have a wealth of talent and experience on their roster, with 11 All-Stars, including Durant, who can take over a game but is content with being a team player for now.\n\nRelated: Steve Kerr on why Devin Booker has started every game for Team USA: \"He's probably been the guy who's been most adaptable\"", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonas_panerio@postandcourier.com", "name": "Jonas Panerio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_at_the_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball at the Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_basketball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national basketball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Krzyzewski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Krzyzewski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792701", "eventUri": "eng-9792701", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Leslie finished her four Olympic appearances with 488 points and four gold medals.\n\nDurant is bidding to become the first men's player in Olympic history with four golds after being part of the U.S. teams that won titles at London 2012, Rio de Janeiro 2016 and the Tokyo Games that were held three years ago.\n\n\"Training staffs, the work that we put in, just keeping my body ready and just staying in the gym, to be honest,\" Durant said when asked last week what he attributes to his longevity.\n\nDurant is the No. 8 scorer in NBA history with 28,924 points, No. 2 on the active list behind only U.S. Olympic teammate LeBron James' 40,474.\n\n\"Well let me start to (congratulate) @KDTrey5 as he gets ready to break one of my Olympic records! The Slim Reaper!! One of my all time favorites!\" Leslie wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, last week as the perennial All-Star closed in on her mark.\n\nAnd Durant is likely going to keep this record for some time.\n\nHe's one of only five U.S. players with at least 300 points in Olympic competition, joining Leslie, WNBA career scoring leader Diana Taurasi (416 entering the U.S. women's quarterfinal game Wednesday), the retired Carmelo Anthony (336) and James, who is presumably playing in the Olympics for the final time and entered Tuesday with 316 points in his four appearances.\n\n\"He's one of the most efficient players that ever played this game,\" U.S. teammate -- and Phoenix Suns teammate -- Devin Booker said of Durant.\n\nDurant is also the U.S. career men's leader in rebounds in Olympic play, entering Tuesday with 126. He secured that record in the group-stage finale Saturday against Puerto Rico, his four rebounds in that game allowing him to pass both Anthony (125) and David Robinson (124) for the top spot there.\n\nLeslie remains -- far and away -- the career leader in U.S. Olympic play for rebounding with 241 in her 32 games.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

It also came with a little bit of history: With a bucket in the third quarter, Kevin Durant became the all-time leading scorer in U.S. Olympic history:\n\nDurant passed fellow Team USA legend Lisa Leslie for the crown. At this point KD's Olympic resume needs no introduction, but to review: Durant already has three gold medals from London, Rio and Tokyo, and was named Olympic MVP of the latter Games while dropping 20.7 points per game and breaking Carmelo Anthony's U.S. men's scoring record. The most versatile superstar in the NBA, 7-feet with a silky smooth jumper, comfortable on and off the ball, was always going to be an ideal fit for the international game, and Durant has never wavered in his commitment to playing for his country and competing against the very best. The Olympics are everything Durant is about as arguably our nation's foremore True Hooper, and now he stands alone atop the mountain.", "source": {"uri": "nbcolympics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "nbcolympics.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Leslie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lisa Leslie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://images.nbcolympics.com/sites/default/files/2023-03/ParisDefaultThumbnail.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792701", "eventUri": "eng-9792701", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The 35-year-old NBA veteran thrilled fans with his performance, but Coach Steve Kerr has decided not to include Durant in the starting lineup for their upcoming game due to his ongoing injury recovery.\n\n\"If Kevin had been here from Day 1, chances are he'd be starting. That was the plan coming in.

Throughout his career, Durant turned himself into one of the most polarizing figures in the world of basketball. Many respect and adore him for the work he has put into the game. While some hate him for the questionable decisions he made over the years.\n\nNevertheless, Durant seems to know how to filter which opinions about himself he wants to listen to. The star forward said in an interview with the media team at the 2024 Olympics that he appreciates it when he hears how impactful he was to other players' careers. For as long as people praise him for his work, those are the only remarks Durant respects.\n\nIt's pretty cool when you hear it from the real players, the guys actually putting in the work, that are trying to make it to the NBA. You hear what I've meant to them and their careers. Then you hear what other people say about me sometimes, and they don't understand my impact. But when you talk to the players, they give you a whole different story, which is pretty cool. It always comes down to what the guys on the floor are saying about you. Those are the opinions I really respect.\n\nKevin Durant's impact on basketball\n\nKevin Durant has been in the NBA for almost two decades now. He was drafted by the Seattle Supersonics, now known as the Oklahoma City Thunder, in 2007 and changed the landscape of the league from then on. From the beginning of his career, Durant immediately made a reputation of being one of the most lethal scorers in the league's history. He won the Rookie of the Year award and remained consistent on the court in the following years.\n\nDurant's NBA and Olympic accolades\n\nLooking at Durant's career after 16 years, he has accumulated a plethora of awards, a feat that only the greats accomplish. He's a two-time NBA champion, two-time Finals MVP, one-time NBA MVP, 14-time All-Star, and has 11 All-NBA selections.\n\nIf we're going to include his accolades as an Olympian, he won three gold medals in his career and is now the Olympics' greatest scorer of all time in Men's Basketball history. Durant recently accomplished this feat against Puerto Rico last Friday, August 2. Not only did he earn the top spot in scoring, but he also beat Carmelo Anthony's record for the most rebounds in Olympic history. As of the time of this writing, Durant currently holds the record for most points with 483 and most rebounds with 126. With the 2024 Olympics still ongoing, the numbers will still climb up.\n\nGiven these factors, we don't blame Durant for only respecting the opinions of those who regard him in a good light. He has proven himself to be one of the basketball's greatest players that the world has ever seen.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "itiel_estudillo@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Itiel Estudillo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_SuperSonics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle SuperSonics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Olympics-news-Kevin-Durants-blunt-admission-about-opinions-he-respects.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792701", "eventUri": "eng-9792701", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 2200, "textEnd": 2208}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

For Paris, they assembled the most insane collection of talents which had a three-headed monster front and center. LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant have all been wreaking havoc under the guidance of Steve Kerr. However, only one of them is going to be immortalized as the most lethal scorer in Stars and Stripes history. So much so that they even usurped Lisa Leslie.\n\nKevin Durant now has the most points in Team USA history at the Olympics, per Yahoo Sports. The Slim Reaper notched his 489th point for the Stars and Stripes in their quarterfinal battle against Brazil. He did so by getting a bucket through a basket with roughly just three minutes remaining in the third quarter. These points were very crucial in burying Brazil. By the end, Durant's scoring milestone helped them go through the semifinals with a 122-87 scoreline.\n\nWhile he may have beaten Lisa Leslie out in total points. Durant still has to catch up in terms of accomplishments. The WNBA legend has four gold medals in the Olympics. So, Team USA led by Stephen Curry and LeBron James needs to help him equalize that medal count this year. Their next battle? Well, it's Nikola Jokic and the Serbian national team that they blew out in their last exhibition matchup.\n\nKevin Durant gets real on making Team USA Olympics history\n\nLook, beating out one of the most perennial scorers Lisa Leslie is never easy. Doing it in a situation with so much pressure such as the Olympics quarterfinals also does not make the job any less trouble-free. This is why the Slim Reaper noted that he could not have accomplished the feat on his own. He had everyone on the Steve Kerr-led Team USA to thank for how they have taken him under their wing.\n\n\"Training staff, the work that we put in, just keeping my body ready and just staying in the gym, to be honest,\" he noted.\n\nDurant is only one of five players who have notched more than 300 points for Team USA.

Magic Johnson, Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O'Neal and LeBron James, just to name a few, will all go down in history as Laker greats.\n\nAs such, when people name their all-time starting fives, it is nearly impossible to do so without having a Lakers player in the lineup. Even Jaylen Brown, member of the rival Boston Celtics and current NBA Finals MVP, had to name a couple of Lakers on his list.\n\nBrown recently listed his all-time starting five, naming Lakers legends Bryant and James next to Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Bill Russell, via House of Highlights:\n\nIt was nearly three Lakers stars on Brown's lineup as Shaquille O'Neal was originally named, but he would change his mind and replace him with Russell. Brown explained this by saying he wanted a lineup that could get up and down the court quickly and Russell allows for that more than Shaq. It did also allow him to get a Celtics legend in the lineup and, perhaps, escape some anger from Boston fans.\n\nNonetheless, the lineup is a more than formidable one, and one that would actually fit together basketball-wise. Brown's lineup is excellent on both ends of the court with Kobe, LeBron and Russell all being top-tier defenders, along with two of the greatest shooters the NBA has ever seen in Curry and Durant.\n\nIt's always fun to see who players put in these types of lineups. Brown went with more of a current lineup aside from Russell, but it makes sense as these are the players he grew up watching or played against.

For the first time, the setting was the French capital, where the largest venue, Bercy Arena, became available after the conclusion of Olympic gymnastics.\n\nThe United States, Germany, France and Serbia all advanced to the semifinals, which will resume on Thursday. Here are the key takeaways after Team USA's 112-80 victory over Brazil, as LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry all inch closer to a gold medal.\n\nWhen Steve Kerr met with his team before they took the floor Tuesday, he recapped what had happened earlier in the day in the Bercy Arena.\n\nIn the morning, Greece built a 12-point first-half lead on Germany, and it took a dominant second-half performance from the World Cup champs to make sure they advanced to the semifinals.\n\nIn the afternoon, Serbia fell down by 24 points to Australia before pulling off the biggest comeback in Olympic basketball history thanks to a brilliant final few minutes from Nikola Jokic.\n\nThen, just as Team USA was arriving at the arena, France was pulling off a stirring upset over Canada, seen as the biggest challenger to the Americans for the gold.\n\nThree underdogs putting the favorites to the test.\n\n\"All three had big leads at the end of the first quarter,\" Kerr said. \"And we wanted to come out and make sure we were the aggressor.\"\n\nOver the past month, Kerr has consistently gotten a response out of his players. He's challenged them several times, including pressing them to increase their tempo and tighten their focus after arriving in France. They responded -- every time.\n\nDurant was nonchalant to the media after the game in which he broke Lisa Leslie's Team USA Olympic scoring record. After scoring 11 against Brazil, he now has 494 points, six more than Leslie had over four Olympics. And his teammates weren't going to let him get away with playing it cool.\n\nIn the locker room after the game, Durant was celebrated and given the game ball to commemorate the moment.\n\nJayson Tatum was the 11th man to enter the game Tuesday. Kerr said he went to Tatum during the second quarter because Devin Booker had two fouls and they didn't want him to get a third.\n\nTatum had 10 points and 10 rebounds against Puerto Rico -- his best game of the Olympics -- and Kerr said rebounding would be at a premium against Brazil. The First Team All-NBA player remained on the edge of the rotation, underscoring how hard it is for Kerr to get everyone playing time, regardless of their status in the game.\n\n\"Each game is extremely different, but the main thing is that we win,\" Tatum said. \"So whatever I got to do from game to game to be a part of that and contribute when I can, I'm going to do that.\"\n\nTatum ended up getting 15 minutes of playing time because Joel Embiid sat the second half with a minor ankle injury. He had five points and three rebounds.\n\nJames has thrown three passes in the Olympics that would qualify as some of the most impressive he's ever delivered and, yes, it's a long list.\n\nAgainst South Sudan, he threw a sharp pass to Durant from the sideline at midcourt, leading Durant out like a tight end, that led to a turnaround jumper just before the halftime buzzer.\n\nAgainst Puerto Rico, he threw a backwards, behind-the-back bounce pass to Embiid under the basket for a layup. He did it so casually, it was easy to miss the level of difficulty it presented.\n\nOn Tuesday, he inbounded the ball from halfcourt, through the tightest of windows, to Tatum for an alley-oop.\n\n\"I know I didn't draw it up,\" Kerr said. \"Because I didn't know that one was even coming.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

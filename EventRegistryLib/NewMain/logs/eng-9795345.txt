And for more than five years, he's been my partner in justice at the Minnesota Capitol,\" she wrote. \"He has the grit and the grace to keep our country moving forward alongside Kamala Harris.\"\n\nAs lieutenant governor, Flanagan worked with Walz and other members of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party to pass a laundry list of progressive legislation -- including free school breakfasts and lunches, paid family and medical leave, legalizing marijuana, codifying abortion access and enacting stricter firearms laws -- in what Walz called \"the most productive session in Minnesota history,\" according to the Star Tribune.\n\nShe also created the the country's first Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives Office, co-chairs Minnesota's Young Women's Initiative and chairs the Minnesota Interagency Council on Homelessness.\n\nFlanagan was first elected to the Minneapolis Board of Education in 2004. An experienced organizer, she spent nearly a decade training progressive candidates on how to effectively run for public office -- among those candidates was Walz himself.\n\nShe also served as executive director of the Minnesota branch of youth advocacy nonprofit Children's Defense Fund, during which time she successfully campaigned to raise the statewide minimum wage.\n\nFlanagan went on to serve in the Minnesota House of Representatives, where she led the Subcommittee on Child Care Access and Affordability and cofounded the state's first People of Color and Indigenous Caucus.\n\nBorn and raised by a single mother in St. Louis Park, Flanagan still lives in the Minnesota city with her husband Tom, daughter Siobhan and dog, Reuben.\n\nThere have been two Native American men elected to be governor -- Johnston Murray and Kevin Stitt, both in Oklahoma. Stitt is the current governor of Oklahoma.\n\nIn an interview with The 19th, Flanagan previously reflected on what her heritage meant to her as a public servant.\n\n\"I couldn't have ever imagined being able to see elected leaders who look like me.

But under Minnesota state law, Walz is allowed to keep his position as governor while running for vice president.\n\nMinnesota law states that if the governorship is vacant, then the lieutenant governor -- in this case, Flanagan -- takes the spot. Once the lieutenant governor moves up, state law requires that the \"last duly elected president of the senate\" take over for them (currently Sen. Bobby Joe Champion, who would become the state's first Black lieutenant governor). A special election would then be held to fill Champion's seat.\n\nIf Harris loses the presidential race, Walz would continue serving his term through January 2027.\n\nFlanagan is the state's 50th lieutenant governor and a citizen of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe. She's currently the highest-ranking Native woman elected to executive office and was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2015.\n\nIn her current position, Flanagan is the co-chair of the Young Women's Initiative and the Minnesota Interagency Council on Homelessness.\n\nIn late July, Flanagan hosted the first Native American campaign event for Harris.\n\nIn an interview with the 19th News, a nonprofit news organization, Flanagan emphasized the importance of representation in government.\n\n\"For a very long time, women, people of color, Indigenous folks were not at decision-making tables, and too many decisions were made without us,\" she said. \"I think if we're going to have strong policies and strong outcomes for communities, women and BIPOC folks need to be at the table.\"\n\nRead more: How Minnesota Lt.

And for more than five years, he's been my partner in justice at the Minnesota Capitol,\" she wrote. \"He has the grit and the grace to keep our country moving forward alongside Kamala Harris.\"\n\nAs lieutenant governor, Flanagan worked with Walz and other members of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party to pass a laundry list of progressive legislation -- including free school breakfasts and lunches, paid family and medical leave, legalizing marijuana, codifying abortion access and enacting stricter firearms laws -- in what Walz called \"the most productive session in Minnesota history,\" according to the Star Tribune.\n\nShe also created the the country's first Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives Office, co-chairs Minnesota's Young Women's Initiative and chairs the Minnesota Interagency Council on Homelessness.\n\nFlanagan was first elected to the Minneapolis Board of Education in 2004. An experienced organizer, she spent nearly a decade training progressive candidates on how to effectively run for public office -- among those candidates was Walz himself.\n\nShe also served as executive director of the Minnesota branch of youth advocacy nonprofit Children's Defense Fund, during which time she successfully campaigned to raise the statewide minimum wage.\n\nFlanagan went on to serve in the Minnesota House of Representatives, where she led the Subcommittee on Child Care Access and Affordability and cofounded the state's first People of Color and Indigenous Caucus.\n\nBorn and raised by a single mother in St. Louis Park, Flanagan still lives in the Minnesota city with her husband Tom, daughter Siobhan and dog, Reuben.\n\nThere have been two Native American men elected to be governor -- Johnston Murray and Kevin Stitt, both in Oklahoma. Stitt is the current governor of Oklahoma.\n\nIn an interview with The 19th, Flanagan previously reflected on what her heritage meant to her as a public servant.\n\n\"I couldn't have ever imagined being able to see elected leaders who look like me. And for my daughter, this is simply her reality,\" she said. \"That is how we build a strong organization. That is how we build a strong party.\"", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type":

Flanagan has championed Indigenous rights as a part of her legislative agenda.\n\n\"It's always a good day when there are lots and lots of Native folks walking around the Capitol and we start with a drum on the front steps,\" Flanagan told ICT News during American Indigenous Day this year. \"This is how it's supposed to be.\"\n\nFlanagan and Walz signed a landmark Indigenous sovereignty bill in 2021 which affirmed \"tribal sovereignty; requires state agencies to appoint tribal-state liaisons and recognize the unique legal relationship between the State of Minnesota; and mandates tribal-state relations training for state leaders and employees.\"\n\nFlanagan could join Gov.

Upon getting elected to her current title, she became the \"country's highest ranking Native woman elected to executive office,\" according to her government page.\n\nShe is a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe and opened up to Teen Vogue in 2018 about her history-making election, saying, \"I have a responsibility, especially because of those who came before me and cleared a path, to do good for my people.\"\n\nAt the time, she also spoke optimistically about the future of Indigenous communities in Minnesota and said, \"I think we are living in a really, really exciting time.\"\n\nDuring Flanagan's time in office, she has focused on children, working families, people of color and other underrepresented communities. Her bio states that she established the country's first Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives Office, increased the Minnesota Family Investment Program payments and secured investments in affordable housing and child care.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nFlanagan shared her support for Walz throughout the vice presidential nomination process in recent weeks, writing on Instagram in late July that he's \"a good man and I'm grateful to be his friend.\"\n\nAfter Flanagan was confirmed as Harris' VP pick, she shared a photo of herself and him on Instagram with the caption, \"I've been friends with Tim Walz for almost 20 years.

I have to admit, I'm extremely relieved, because we've had such good \"Democrats In Array\" energy happening right and it did seem like the kind of problem Democrats just love to fix!\n\nWalz is just an absolute ray of sunshine and it's bringing good vibes all around -- including in Minnesota! Because while the state will surely miss him, under the state's succession plan, next in line is Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan!\n\nNot only does Lt. Gov Flanagan seem very cool and sartorially interesting, she would also be historic -- she'd be Minnesota's first female governor, as well as the country's first female indigenous governor. How cool is that? So cool.\n\nFlanagan, a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, has served with Walz since he was first elected in 2019 and has been a champion of Indigenous rights throughout.\n\nVia Daily Beast:\n\n\"It's always a good day when there are lots and lots of Native folks walking around the Capitol and we start with a drum on the front steps,\" Flanagan told ICT News during American Indigenous Day this year. \"This is how it's supposed to be.\"\n\nFlanagan and Walz signed a landmark Indigenous sovereignty bill in 2021 which affirmed \"tribal sovereignty; requires state agencies to appoint tribal-state liaisons and recognize the unique legal relationship between the State of Minnesota; and mandates tribal-state relations training for state leaders and employees.\"\n\nShe also worked to establish the nation's first Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives Office.\n\nFlanagan, who previously served in the Minnesota House of Representatives and on the Minneapolis School Board, has also been a strong advocate for transgender people and for providing gender-affirming care to trans kids (as has Gov. Walz).\n\nI also must note that Flanagan appears to have an extremely good earring collection.

Gov. Peggy Flanagan of Minnesota would presumably become the first Native American woman to lead a state.\n\nAfter assuming her position in 2019, Flanagan, a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, became the highest ranking Native woman elected to an executive office, according to her official bio. She won re-election in 2022 with Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nNow, with Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday tapping Walz as her running mate, a victory against Republican nominee Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, would propel Flanagan, 44, to the position of Minnesota governor.\n\nWalz's and Flanagan's current term is up for re-election in 2026. But the state Constitution allows Flanagan to assume the governorship if Walz, for whatever reason, vacates office. She would also become Minnesota's first female governor.\n\nIn a post Tuesday on X, Flanagan congratulated Walz in joining Harris.\n\nNative Americans make up just more than 1% of Minnesota's total population, according to census data, with many living on the state's 11 reservations or in its urban centers. The Native vote helped Joe Biden secure a win against Trump in the state in 2020.\n\nIn her high-profile role, Flanagan has been outspoken in support of Indigenous rights, championing this year's change of Minnesota's state flag -- the previous design had been criticized for decades for its depiction of Native Americans.\n\nIn 2016, when Flanagan was a state representative, she attended the Democratic National Convention and spoke out against then-nominee Trump, who mocked Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., by calling her Pocahontas.\n\n\"Your name is not Pocahontas,\" Flanagan said she told her young daughter in a letter. \"You should never let any one make you feel anything less than proud of who you are. So despite everything that has happened to our people, and no matter what Donald Trump says, we are still here.\"\n\nFlanagan had also been outspoken about Trump's policies when he was president. In 2020, when Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump, one of his senior advisers, visited Minnesota for the opening of the nation's first task force office dedicated to solving cold cases of missing and murdered Native Americans and Alaska Natives, Flanagan took issue.\n\n\"Donald Trump made a career demonstrating and celebrating behavior that perpetuates violence against Native women and girls,\" she said at the time.\n\nSince then, Flanagan helped oversee the creation of the state's first Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives Office in St. Paul, developed to help families navigate the justice system.\n\n\"It really matters who's at the table, and who's elected,\" she told MinnPost in 2023. \"We finally have Native representation in the governor's office and Native women in the Legislature.\"\n\nHowever, governors with Native American ancestry remain rare: Oklahoma Gov.

'That's a pretty good summary of how my dad operated and how I operate.'\n\n'I'm just so proud to be his daughter,' she added. 'When he passed, there was, frankly, a lot of wisdom that went with him. And we will miss him terribly.'\n\nFlanagan first got the politics bug while working on Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone's 2002 reelection campaign while studying at the University of Minnesota.\n\nWellstone tragically died in a plane accident that year.\n\nFlanagan went on to become a community organizer.\n\nMinnesota Lt.

Gov. Peggy Flanagan at the IllumiNative Indigenous House at Sundance Film Festival 2023 in Park City, Utah.Anna Webber / Getty Images for IllumiNative\n\nA win in November for the Democratic ticket could be history making in another way: Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan of Minnesota would presumably become the first Native American woman to lead a state.\n\nAfter assuming her position in 2019, Flanagan, a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, became the highest ranking Native woman elected to an executive office, according to her official bio. She won re-election in 2022 with Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nNow, with Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday tapping Walz as her running mate, a victory against Republican nominee Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, would propel Flanagan, 44, to the position of Minnesota governor.\n\nWalz's and Flanagan's current term is up for re-election in 2026. But the state Constitution allows Flanagan to assume the governorship if Walz, for whatever reason, vacates office. She would also become Minnesota's first female governor.\n\nIn a post Tuesday on X, Flanagan congratulated Walz in joining Harris.\n\nNative Americans make up just more than 1% of Minnesota's total population, according to census data, with many living on the state's 11 reservations or in its urban centers. The Native vote helped Joe Biden secure a win against Trump in the state in 2020.\n\nIn her high-profile role, Flanagan has been outspoken in support of Indigenous rights, championing this year's change of Minnesota's state flag -- the previous design had been criticized for decades for its depiction of Native Americans.\n\nIn 2016, when Flanagan was a state representative, she attended the Democratic National Convention and spoke out against then-nominee Trump, who mocked Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., by calling her Pocahontas.\n\n\"Your name is not Pocahontas,\" Flanagan said she told her young daughter in a letter. \"You should never let any one make you feel anything less than proud of who you are. So despite everything that has happened to our people, and no matter what Donald Trump says, we are still here.\"\n\nFlanagan had also been outspoken about Trump's policies when he was president. In 2020, when Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump, one of his senior advisers, visited Minnesota for the opening of the nation's first task force office dedicated to solving cold cases of missing and murdered Native Americans and Alaska Natives, Flanagan took issue.\n\n\"Donald Trump made a career demonstrating and celebrating behavior that perpetuates violence against Native women and girls,\" she said at the time.\n\nSince then, Flanagan helped oversee the creation of the state's first Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives Office in St. Paul, developed to help families navigate the justice system.\n\n\"It really matters who's at the table, and who's elected,\" she told MinnPost in 2023. \"We finally have Native representation in the governor's office and Native women in the Legislature.\"\n\nHowever, governors with Native American ancestry remain rare: Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt is a member of the Cherokee Nation.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tim Walz as her running mate for the 2024 presidential election.\n\nPrior to this announcement, Walz had a relatively low profile nationally, but he gained traction as a potential candidate alongside other governors from states like California, Pennsylvania, and Illinois.\n\nBut what happens for Minnesotans now that the governor is seeking a national role?\n\nWill Tim Walz resign?\n\nOne advantage for Walz is that he is not obligated to step down as governor while running for vice president, allowing him to potentially pursue another term as governor if the Democrats are not successful in the election.\n\nIf Harris and Walz win, he will have to resign his role, though the timing is up to him. He could step down as soon as the election results are known, or wait until the inauguration in January 2025.\n\nWho becomes governor?\n\nWith Walz out, the role would pass to current Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, also a Democrat, under Minnesota's order of succession. It would be the eighth time a lieutenant governor has stepped up due to the resignation or death of a governor.\n\nFlanagan's appointment to governor would be a historic one, as she would be the state's first female governor and the country's first Native American governor.\n\nWho is Peggy Flanagan?\n\nFlanagan is a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe and served in the Minnesota House of Representatives before being elected as lieutenant governor in 2018.\n\nFlanagan's accomplishments include establishing the nation's first Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives Office and working on initiatives dedicated to combatting homelessness and helping the voices of young women be heard in the state's capitol.\n\nFlanagan is currently the highest-ranking Native American in executive office.\n\nWho becomes Lieutenant Governor?\n\nIf Flanagan steps up to the governor's office, the second-in-command role passes to state senate president. That role is currently held by Sen. Bobby Joe Champion, another Democrat. He would be the state's first Black lieutenant governor.\n\nHowever, that could change depending on when Walz resigns and what happens in a special election in November, which is set to fill the vacant seat of a state senator who resigned to run for Congress.\n\nThe state senate is currently deadlocked in a 33-33 split between Republicans and Democrats. If a Democrat wins the seat, the role would presumably go to Champion, unless he decides he doesn't want to be lieutenant governor and steps down, leaving the party to elect a different president who would then ascend to the job.\n\nIf a Republican wins, the balance of power would shift, giving them more leverage in who would fill the role. They could put forward a Senate president from their party or nominate a Democrat in a swing distance in hopes of taking over that vacated seat.\n\nEither way, another special election would have to be held to fill the seat of the state senate president, the timing of which would depend on Walz's resignation and whether or not the legislature pushes to have November's winner sworn in early.",

As one of the original trainers of Wellstone Action's signature program Camp Wellstone, she trained thousands of organizers, elected officials, and candidates including the now Governor Walz.\n\nFlanagan serves as the chair of the Democratic Lieutenant Governors Association at the same time that Walz is chair of the Democratic Governors Association.\n\nLast week in Phoenix, Flanagan hosted the first Native American campaign event for the Harris for President campaign only one day after President Biden announced he would drop out of the presidential race and promptly threw his support around Harris.\n\nread more: https://nativenewsonline.net/currents/how-minnesota-lt-gov-peggy-flanagan-may-become-first-native-american-a-state-governor", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Earth_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White Earth Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Native Americans in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Flanagan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peggy Flanagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellstone_Action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wellstone Action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Native American studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis_Public_Schools", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis Public Schools"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State governments of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Wellstone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Wellstone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Minnesota", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Governors_Association", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Governors Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Appraisal_and_Valuation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Appraisal and Valuation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795345", "eventUri": "eng-9795345", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Paul Wellstone's campaign, per the MinnPost.\n\nLater, between 2005 and 2009, she became the first Native American on the board of the Minneapolis Board of Education, MinnPost reported.\n\nFollowing a handful of jobs, including working at a nonprofit that trained future organizers and politicians -- including Walz himself -- Flanagan ran unopposed for the Minnesota House representatives in 2015 and won.\n\nThen, in 2017, Walz picked her to run alongside him for his 2018 Gubernatorial campaign. The pair defeated Donald Trump-endorsed candidate Jeff Johnson with 54% of the vote.\n\nIn an interview with Teen Vogue following her election win, she explained why running for public office was important to her.\n\n\"I care tremendously about politics, I care tremendously about social justice and organizing work, and making sure that our democracy accurately reflects the people it seeks to represent,\" she told the publication. \"I think that this is just a natural extension, this is an opportunity for me to serve. That's how I see my role and no matter where I am, I think that my job is to make sure that people feel seen, heard, and valued. That's my vocation.\"\n\nAs lieutenant governor, she established the nation's first Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives Office, per her biography. The office provides resources for Indigenous families affected by violence and supports them during law enforcement investigations, according to the office's website.\n\nFollowing the announcement that Walz had been chosen to run alongside Harris, Flanagan congratulated him on social media.\n\n\"I've been friends with Tim Walz for almost 20 years. And for more than five years, he's been my partner in justice at the Minnesota Capitol,\" Flanagan wrote. \"He has the grit and the grace to keep our country moving forward alongside Kamala Harris.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Flanagan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_getahun@businessinsider.com", "name": "Hannah Getahun", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinnPost", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MinnPost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Native Americans in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Earth_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White Earth Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Wellstone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Wellstone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Johnson_(Minnesota_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Johnson (Minnesota politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis_Public_Schools", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis Public Schools"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Vogue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teen Vogue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples of the Americas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66b2a71eb4912df3ae197c4f?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795345", "eventUri": "eng-9795345", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

With Minnesota Governor Tim Walz selected as her running mate, that means the North Star State's Lieutenant Governor is next in line for the post.\n\nPeggy Flanagan, who was first elected in 2018, would become the first female governor in Minnesota history. In addition, she would become the first Native American governor, as well as the first female Indigenous governor in the U.S.\n\nA former school board member, Flanagan, 44, initially met Walz when he ran for Congress in 2006. The former high school social studies teacher and football coach won the largely rural, conservative district, serving in the House for 12 years. He also carried his home county when he won the gubernatorial race in 2018, capturing 53.8% of the vote statewide.\n\nGoverning with a mandate, Walz and Flanagan have enacted an array of progressive policies, even though Democrats only have a one-vote majority in the state senate. Their administration has successfully enshrined abortion rights, established paid family and medical leave, implemented universal free school meals, and created a refugee program for trans people denied gender-affirming care in other states.\n\nNever mind restoring the voting rights of ex-felons, passing firearms restrictions and legalizing recreational weed. Walz and Flanagan are a dream team... with a dashing sense of humor!\n\nFor queer folx, Walz's and Flanagan's support for LGBTQ+ people really stands out. They've safeguarded access to gender-affirming medical care, banned conversion therapy and made it illegal for school libraries to ban books due to queer themes or imagery.\n\nAn early supporter of the Respect for Marriage Act, Walz is a longtime ally. He was the founder of his high school's gay-straight alliance in 1999... as a vet and high school football coach.\n\nFlanagan also uses her bully pulpit to support queer issues. While LT. gov's often relegate themselves to the background, Flanagan has a robust social media presence.\n\nOn Trans Day of Visibility, she wore a pink sweatshirt that says \"protect trans kids.\"\n\n\"On Trans Day of Visibility, we recommit ourselves to continue to do the work until every trans and nonbinary person is protected. Our trans, two spirit, and nonbinary youth should be safe to grow up to be their full, beautiful selves,\" she wrote.\n\nFlanagan, a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, has made improving relations between state government and Minnesota's 11 tribal nations one of her priorities as Lt. Gov., according to the New York Times. Walz is the only governor in Minnesota history to visit every tribe.\n\nWhen asked about the prospect of Walz joining Harris in the White House, Flanagan affirmed her support... and enthusiasm for finishing out his term.\n\n\"I think Governor Walz would be honored to be selected to be the vice president, and I have been honored this entire time to serve the people of Minnesota,\" she told the Minn Post. \"That would not change.\"\n\nIf Flanagan ascended to the governor's office, the executive branch of Minnesota's state government would change-and we're not only talking about her. Bobby Joe Champion, president of the State Senate, would become Lt. Gov. He would be the first Black person to serve in that role as well.\n\nIf Kamala wins, she'll help shatter many glass ceilings!", "source": {"uri": "queerty.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Queerty"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_reimer@queerty.com", "name": "Alex Reimer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples of the Americas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Native Americans in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Flanagan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peggy Flanagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-binary gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Transgender_Day_of_Visibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Transgender Day of Visibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respect_for_Marriage_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respect for Marriage Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay\u2013straight_alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gay\u2013straight alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_meal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "School meal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Joe_Champion", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bobby Joe Champion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State governments of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://adabgmwwup.cloudimg.io/v7/_queerty-prodweb_/2024/08/screenshot-2024-08-06-at-15710pm.png?auto=format&auto=compress&fit=crop&gravity=smart&w=1200&h=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795345", "eventUri": "eng-9795345", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Walz is also not required to leave office to run with Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nHarris, who has secured the Democratic Party's nomination for president, announced that she picked Walz as her running mate on Aug. 6. Walz was first elected as Minnesota's governor in 2018, and he was re-elected in 2022. His current term ends in 2027.\n\nThere are no credible news reports that Walz has stepped down from his role following his selection as Harris' running mate. He remains governor of Minnesota. Flanagan also remains the state's lieutenant governor, a role to which she was first elected in 2018.\n\nDevin Driscoll, an attorney who teaches state constitutional law at the University of Minnesota Law School, said he is not aware of any statute that would require Walz to resign after becoming the Democratic nominee for vice president.\n\nDriscoll noted that Minnesota's constitution provides that in \"case a vacancy occurs from any cause whatever in the office of governor, the lieutenant governor shall be governor during such vacancy.\" Section 4.06(a) of Minnesota Statutes says the same.\n\nFact check: Video shows Harris defining climate anxiety, explaining efforts to address it\n\nMinnesota law defines when a vacancy occurs, and it includes an incumbent's resignation, Driscoll said.\n\n\"So, unless/until Gov. Walz resigns, there is no vacancy, and if there is no vacancy Lt. Gov. Flanagan does not become governor,\" he said in an email.\n\nThe Minnesota Star Tribune reported that if Walz resigns after the election, Flanagan, a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, would become the state's first female governor and first Native American governor.\n\nMultiple reputable news organizations have laid out this possible succession scenario, with none mentioning Walz being required to resign as governor to run for vice president.\n\nThe Facebook user who shared the post did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Walz's office also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

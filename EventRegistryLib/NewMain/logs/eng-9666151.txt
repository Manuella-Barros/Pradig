(AP) -- North Carolina senators are pushing to legalize medical marijuana again, but it's unclear if the state House will approve it.\n\nA Senate bill that was originally intended to add state regulations to hemp products experienced a major facelift on Wednesday when lawmakers added a provision legalizing medical marijuana. The amendment would apply to qualifying patients who have a \"debilitating medical condition\" such as cancer or epilepsy to be prescribed medical cannabis by a doctor.\n\nIt comes amid a pending decision by the U.S. Department of Justice to drop marijuana as a Schedule I drug to Schedule III and recognize its medical uses.\n\nThe original bill -- which added several regulations for hemp products that are legal under federal law -- was approved in a committee Wednesday morning before a Senate floor vote. Federal law allows for the sale of hemp products with concentrations of less than 0.3% of delta-9 THC, which is one of the main psychoactive substances found in traditional cannabis.\n\nThe hemp regulations bill was suddenly sent back to the Senate Judiciary Committee to add the 35-page medical marijuana provision Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe new provision outlines requirements for physicians to prescribe medical marijuana, how people can get a medical marijuana identification card, what it takes to get a medical cannabis supplier license and restrictions on smoking in certain places.\n\nPatients who qualify for using cannabis medically would need written certification from a physician under the bill.\n\nThe original hemp legislation that still remains prohibits sales of those goods to people under 21, requires testing before distribution and mandates obtaining licenses to sell legal hemp products such as THC gummies and cannabis-infused drinks.\n\nDespite its renewed Senate momentum, House Republicans' current stance on legalizing medical marijuana is murky. Just earlier this month, House Speaker Tim Moore indicated it didn't have enough support.\n\n\"In no uncertain terms, there are not the votes in this caucus right now for this bill,\" Moore said.\n\nSenate Rules Chairman Bill Rabon, a vocal advocate for medical marijuana, told The Associated Press after committee that he reached out to Moore Wednesday morning but did not hear back. He also spoke with other House leaders and caucus members about the amendment, but had \"no idea\" whether they would consider approving it.\n\n\"I'm very optimistic, but I'm also very persistent,\" the Brunswick County Republican said.\n\nThe Senate previously attempted to legalize medical marijuana last year under legislation led by Rabon, who said he smoked pot while undergoing chemotherapy for colon cancer. Lacking enough votes in the House after the Senate's approval, the medical marijuana bill died last session.\n\nMedical cannabis products are legal in 38 states and the District of Columbia, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nThe amended bill will be voted on in the Senate on Thursday, then again on Monday, Rabon said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Michael Lazzara, a Republican from Onslow County, called for an amendment adding what appears to be the entirety of the language of the NC Compassionate Care Act to House Bill 563.\n\nThe Compassionate Care Act would allow medical marijuana use statewide for people who have cancer, ALS, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, post-traumatic stress disorder and other ailments. It also establishes a licensing system.\n\nThis is not the first time the Senate has attempted to force a vote on medical marijuana.\n\nLast year, Senate Republicans attempted to revive the Compassionate Care Act . The marijuana bill was added as an amendment to a House bill up for a vote on the Senate floor.\n\nThe House bill with the amendment passed the Senate but did not pass the House. House Speaker Tim Moore said there was not enough support from House members to move the bill forward.\n\nA similar iteration of the Compassionate Care Act also passed the Senate in 2022 but languished in the House.\n\nThe latest move comes as House and Senate Republicans are locked in a standoff over the budget. The House was set to approve a budget proposal that is expected to stall in the Senate, as Republicans in both chambers continue to try to negotiate a potential spending deal.\n\nHB 563, in addition to now legalizing medical marijuana, would prohibit the sale to and purchase of hemp and hemp-derived products by a person under 21. It also would add kratom, xylazine and tianeptine to the state's list of controlled substances.\n\nSen. Bill Rabon, a main sponsor of the Compassionate Care Act, said Wednesday the attempt to add his bill to this one probably did not come \"as a shock to anyone.\"\n\n\"We have been working diligently on the hemp bill, 563,\" said Rabon, a Brunswick County Republican, \"and our plan has been to regulate...a possibly dangerous and unregulated product.\"\n\n\"At the same time, for the better part of the last decade, we have been trying to get a bill (with) highly controlled (medical marijuana) across the finish line.\"\n\nThe bills being combined \"are very closely related,\" he said, referring to the chemical similarity between hemp and marijuana, which both stem from the cannabis plant.\n\nIn 2018, the federal government removed hemp -- defined as a derivative of cannabis with less than 0.3% of delta-9 THC -- from the definition of marijuana. In 2022, North Carolina followed suit in legalization of hemp.\n\nThe bill passed the judiciary committee and now moves to the rules committee.\n\nShould it pass the Senate, it's unclear whether it'll get backing in the House.\n\nGet the latest news about North Carolina politics from The News & Observer's award-winning team.

(AP) -- North Carolina got a step closer to legalizing medical marijuana on Thursday when the state Senate gave it its initial approval.\n\nThe Senate approved a measure legalizing medical marijuana in its first of two votes, 33-9, with nine Republicans breaking from the rest of the party to oppose it. If approved a second time, the bill will go to the state House, which has historically blocked Senate attempts to legalize the drug's medical use.\n\nLegalizing medical marijuana for qualifying patients with a \"debilitating medical condition\" was added to a bill on Wednesday that originally focused on creating further state regulations for federally legal hemp products. Those hemp products contain a concentration of less than 0.3% of THC concentration, the compound that gives marijuana its high.\n\nAlthough the hemp regulations remain in the bill, Sen. Danny Britt, a Republican from Robeson County, said on the Senate floor that adding medical marijuana was necessary to \"get out in front\" of an expected federal reclassification of marijuana from a Schedule I drug to a less dangerous Schedule III drug.\n\nSen. Bill Rabon, a Republican from Brunswick County who is one of the most vocal proponents of legalizing medical marijuana, said the bill would help sick and dying people in the state. Like in previous sessions, he recounted his own experience smoking pot while undergoing chemotherapy for colon cancer.\n\n\"With 18 months to live, I'm here 20 years later because I had a physician who told me to do this, and I did,\" Rabon told Senate colleagues.\n\nThe bill awaits its second senatorial vote on Monday. Rabon said the chamber might submit additional amendments after reviewing requests from the House.\n\nThe House hasn't clearly indicated if it would pass the bill.\n\nHouse Speaker Tim Moore said Thursday that he supports legalizing medical marijuana through a Senate measure approved last year, but has said repeatedly that it wouldn't be considered because not enough House Republicans back the idea.\n\nMoore didn't know whether combining the legalization with the hemp regulation provisions would persuade additional colleagues. He said he anticipated House Republicans would privately discuss the idea next week.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Gary D.

(AP) -- North Carolina got a step closer to legalizing medical marijuana on Thursday when the state Senate gave it its initial approval.\n\nThe Senate approved a measure legalizing medical marijuana in its first of two votes, 33-9, with nine Republicans breaking from the rest of the party to oppose it. If approved a second time, the bill will go to the state House, which has historically blocked Senate attempts to legalize the drug's medical use.\n\nMedical cannabis products are legal in 38 states and the District of Columbia, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. More than 20 states allow the drug to be used recreationally, too.\n\nSen. Val Applewhite, D-Cumberland, speaks with Sen. Danny Britt, R-Robeson, after he approaches her on the Senate floor during debate on medical marijuana at the Legislative Building in Raleigh, N.C., on Thursday, June 20, 2024. Applewhite submitted an amendment that would have address opioid-related issues but it was shot down by Republican lawmakers. (AP Photo/Makiya Seminera)\n\nLegalizing medical marijuana for qualifying patients with a \"debilitating medical condition\" was added to a bill on Wednesday that originally focused on creating further state regulations for federally legal hemp products. Those hemp products contain a concentration of less than 0.3% of THC concentration, the compound that gives marijuana its high.\n\nAlthough the hemp regulations remain in the bill, Sen. Danny Britt, a Republican from Robeson County, said on the Senate floor that adding medical marijuana was necessary to \"get out in front\" of an expected federal reclassification of marijuana from a Schedule I drug to a less dangerous Schedule III drug.\n\nSen. Bill Rabon, a Republican from Brunswick County who is one of the most vocal proponents of legalizing medical marijuana, said the bill would help sick and dying people in the state. Like in previous sessions, he recounted his own experience smoking pot while undergoing chemotherapy for colon cancer.\n\n\"With 18 months to live, I'm here 20 years later because I had a physician who told me to do this, and I did,\" Rabon told Senate colleagues.\n\nThe bill awaits its second senatorial vote on Monday. Rabon said the chamber might submit additional amendments after reviewing requests from the House.\n\nThe House hasn't clearly indicated if it would pass the bill.\n\nHouse Speaker Tim Moore said Thursday that he supports legalizing medical marijuana through a Senate measure approved last year, but has said repeatedly that it wouldn't be considered because not enough House Republicans back the idea.\n\nMoore didn't know whether combining the legalization with the hemp regulation provisions would persuade additional colleagues. He said he anticipated House Republicans would privately discuss the idea next week.\n\nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedin", "source": {"uri": "wccbcharlotte.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WCCB

(AP) -- North Carolina senators are pushing to legalize medical marijuana again, but it's unclear if the state House will approve it.\n\nA Senate bill that was originally intended to add state regulations to hemp products experienced a major facelift on Wednesday when lawmakers added a provision legalizing medical marijuana. The amendment would apply to qualifying patients who have a \"debilitating medical condition\" such as cancer or epilepsy to be prescribed medical cannabis by a doctor.\n\nIt comes amid a pending decision by the U.S. Department of Justice to drop marijuana as a Schedule I drug to Schedule III and recognize its medical uses.\n\nThe original bill -- which added several regulations for hemp products that are legal under federal law -- was approved in a committee Wednesday morning before a Senate floor vote. Federal law allows for the sale of hemp products with concentrations of less than 0.3% of delta-9 THC, which is one of the main psychoactive substances found in traditional cannabis.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Just earlier this month, House Speaker Tim Moore indicated it didn't have enough support.\n\n\"In no uncertain terms, there are not the votes in this caucus right now for this bill,\" Moore said.\n\nSenate Rules Chairman Bill Rabon, a vocal advocate for medical marijuana, told The Associated Press after committee that he reached out to Moore Wednesday morning but did not hear back. He also spoke with other House leaders and caucus members about the amendment, but had \"no idea\" whether they would consider approving it.\n\n\"I'm very optimistic, but I'm also very persistent,\" the Brunswick County Republican said.\n\nThe Senate previously attempted to legalize medical marijuana last year under legislation led by Rabon, who said he smoked pot while undergoing chemotherapy for colon cancer. Lacking enough votes in the House after the Senate's approval, the medical marijuana bill died last session.\n\nMedical cannabis products are legal in 38 states and the District of Columbia, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nThe amended bill will be voted on in the Senate on Thursday, then again on Monday, Rabon said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

But prior to its passage, members adopted an amendment containing language that would allow doctors to recommend medical marijuana to patients with certain qualifying conditions.\n\nSen. Bill Rabon (R), a cancer survivor who has sponsored multiple medical cannabis bills and has become known for leveraging different legislative tactics to force the issue, previously described his interest in using the hemp legislation as a potential vehicle after his latest standalone stalled in the House.\n\nUnder the senator's amendment, patients would be allowed to access cannabis if they have a \"debilitating medical condition\" such as cancer, epilepsy, HIV/AIDS, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and post-traumatic stress disorder. Smoking and vaping would also be allowed.\n\nSenate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger (R) said in April that he's had bicameral discussions about the prospect of moving the medical marijuana proposal from Rabon forward as part of the hemp measure.\n\nRabon's standalone legislation moved through the Senate, as well as a House committee, last year, but it has not advanced further.\n\nCertain Democratic senators, such as Sen. Graig Meyer (D), have said that any future proposal would need to include \"some type of decriminalization language,\" in addition to the limited medical cannabis program.

Michael Lazzara (R), the bill would allow doctors to recommend medical marijuana to patients with certain qualifying conditions. That's in addition to the original provisions on restricting kratom and intoxicating hemp cannabinoid products such as delta-8 THC.\n\nThe cannabis text is similar to that of a standalone bill from Sen. Bill Rabon (R), a cancer survivor who has sponsored multiple medical marijuana proposals. The senator previously described his interest in using the hemp legislation as a potential vehicle after his latest standalone stalled in the House.\n\n\"The people that need and can benefit from medical-grade cannabis are dying. They're dying every day,\" Rabon said in the Rules Committee hearing on Thursday. \"They've died for six years since I started working on this. I want to know where the compassion in this room is. I want to know because I'm not seeing it.\"\n\n\"People that need help have the right to try to stay alive -- to stay with their loved ones another day, to feel good about life -- not to be put on morphine so they don't know what world they're in, but to have a meal, to be able to clean themselves, to have a conversation with their loved ones before they die,\" he said. \"They deserve that right.\"\n\nThe senator emphasized that he was speaking from personal experience. As he's previously disclosed, Rabon said his doctor advised him to use marijuana before he went through serious chemotherapy, and he visited his local law enforcement to tell them that he intended to break the law to use the plant for therapy. Packages of marijuana then regularly showed up in the mail, and he'd take \"three puffs\" of cannabis after work to treat his symptoms.\n\n\"If you're scared of the boogeyman, so what? Sleep with the lights on,\" he said on Thursday. \"I'm telling you, this is something that we should do. I know. I've been there. I've lived it. You folks who are so dead set against it haven't walk in my shoes, but I stand before you and tell you I was close to death a long time ago, and I would have died had I not broken the law and I had not taken the advice of my health care provider and gotten a cannabis product.\"\n\n\"I was ready to give up. I couldn't eat. There's not a trash can in this room that would hold how much vomit I'd throw up every day,\" Rabon said. \"I'm going to push it. I'm going to stay in this legislature until it passes.\"\n\nOn the floor on Thursday, members also adopted an amendment to expand a proposed cannabis production commission to add another pharmacist, as well as an emergency room physician. Rabon said the change was responsive to requests from House lawmakers, adding that further amendments are expected during Monday's third reading consideration of the bill.\n\nSenators also rejected a floor amendment to expand the bill to legalize adult-use marijuana.\n\nHere are the main components of the medical cannabis provisions of the bill:\n\nSenate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger (R) said in April that he's had bicameral discussions about the prospect of moving the medical marijuana proposal from Rabon forward as part of the hemp measure.\n\nRabon's standalone legislation moved through the Senate and was taken up by a House committee last year, but it has not advanced further in that chamber.\n\nCertain Democratic senators, such as Sen. Graig Meyer (D), have said that any future proposal would need to include \"some type of decriminalization language,\" in addition to the limited medical cannabis program. So it's unclear whether the Democratic caucus would back the amended hemp bill as it's currently drafted, as it calls for a relatively conservative medical cannabis authorization.\n\nHouse Majority Leader John Bell (R) said last year that while there were \"still discussions going on\" about the medical marijuana bill, he was \"very sure you won't see that bill move\" due to insufficient support among Republicans. He said that was \"unfortunately\" the case.\n\nA previous version of the North Carolina Compassionate Care Act from Rabon passed the Senate but did not get a vote in the House of Representatives in 2022.\n\nThe Senate president previously acknowledged that opinions are shifting when it comes to marijuana in the state, and he said that Rabon specifically \"for a long time has looked at the issue.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Tim Moore (R) is among key lawmakers who have downplayed the idea of enacting medical cannabis legislation, saying at one point that \"there are a lot of concerns\" with Rabon's bill that moved through the Senate.\n\nRabon also took another step, including medical marijuana regulatory appointments for the yet-to-be-enacted program in a separate measure that passed the Senate in March.\n\n--\n\nMarijuana Moment is tracking more than 1,500 cannabis, psychedelics and drug policy bills in state legislatures and Congress this year.

(AP) -- North Carolina got a step closer to legalizing medical marijuana on Thursday when the state Senate gave it its initial approval.\n\nThe Senate approved a measure legalizing medical marijuana in its first of two votes, 33-9, with nine Republicans breaking from the rest of the party to oppose it. If approved a second time, the bill will go to the state House, which has historically blocked Senate attempts to legalize the drug's medical use.\n\nLegalizing medical marijuana for qualifying patients with a \"debilitating medical condition\" was added to a bill on Wednesday that originally focused on creating further state regulations for federally legal hemp products. Those hemp products contain a concentration of less than 0.3% of THC concentration, the compound that gives marijuana its high.\n\nAlthough the hemp regulations remain in the bill, Sen. Danny Britt, a Republican from Robeson County, said on the Senate floor that adding medical marijuana was necessary to \"get out in front\" of an expected federal reclassification of marijuana from a Schedule I drug to a less dangerous Schedule III drug.\n\nSen. Bill Rabon, a Republican from Brunswick County who is one of the most vocal proponents of legalizing medical marijuana, said the bill would help sick and dying people in the state. Like in previous sessions, he recounted his own experience smoking pot while undergoing chemotherapy for colon cancer.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"With 18 months to live, I'm here 20 years later because I had a physician who told me to do this, and I did,\" Rabon told Senate colleagues.\n\nThe bill awaits its second senatorial vote on Monday. Rabon said the chamber might submit additional amendments after reviewing requests from the House.\n\nThe House hasn't clearly indicated if it would pass the bill.\n\nHouse Speaker Tim Moore said Thursday that he supports legalizing medical marijuana through a Senate measure approved last year, but has said repeatedly that it wouldn't be considered because not enough House Republicans back the idea.\n\nMoore didn't know whether combining the legalization with the hemp regulation provisions would persuade additional colleagues. He said he anticipated House Republicans would privately discuss the idea next week.\n\nAssociated Press writer Gary D. Robertson contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- North Carolina got a step closer to legalizing medical marijuana on Thursday when the state Senate gave it its initial approval.\n\nThe Senate approved a measure legalizing medical marijuana in its first of two votes, 33-9, with nine Republicans breaking from the rest of the party to oppose it. If approved a second time, the bill will go to the state House, which has historically blocked Senate attempts to legalize the drug's medical use.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nMedical cannabis products are legal in 38 states and the District of Columbia, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. More than 20 states allow the drug to be used recreationally, too.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nLegalizing medical marijuana for qualifying patients with a \"debilitating medical condition\" was added to a bill on Wednesday that originally focused on creating further state regulations for federally legal hemp products. Those hemp products contain a concentration of less than 0.3% of THC concentration, the compound that gives marijuana its high.\n\nAlthough the hemp regulations remain in the bill, Sen. Danny Britt, a Republican from Robeson County, said on the Senate floor that adding medical marijuana was necessary to \"get out in front\" of an expected federal reclassification of marijuana from a Schedule I drug to a less dangerous Schedule III drug.\n\nSen. Bill Rabon, a Republican from Brunswick County who is one of the most vocal proponents of legalizing medical marijuana, said the bill would help sick and dying people in the state. Like in previous sessions, he recounted his own experience smoking pot while undergoing chemotherapy for colon cancer.\n\n\"With 18 months to live, I'm here 20 years later because I had a physician who told me to do this, and I did,\" Rabon told Senate colleagues.\n\nThe bill awaits its second senatorial vote on Monday. Rabon said the chamber might submit additional amendments after reviewing requests from the House.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe House hasn't clearly indicated if it would pass the bill.\n\nHouse Speaker Tim Moore said Thursday that he supports legalizing medical marijuana through a Senate measure approved last year, but has said repeatedly that it wouldn't be considered because not enough House Republicans back the idea.\n\nMoore didn't know whether combining the legalization with the hemp regulation provisions would persuade additional colleagues. He said he anticipated House Republicans would privately discuss the idea next week.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Gary D.

For months Senate Bill 3 has received little attention, while lawmakers have chipped away at legislation that would regulate the sale and distribution of hemp-derived consumables.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, all that changed.\n\nSenator Michael Lazzara (R-Onslow) offered an amendment to House Bill 563 that would roll the Compassionate Care Act into the bipartisan hemp legislation.\n\nSen. Bill Rabon (R-Brunswick), the primary sponsor of the Compassionate Care Act, stood by Lazzara's side and said the addition should not come as a shock to anyone.\n\n\"We have been working diligently on the Hemp Bill -- 563 -- the entire session, and our plan has been to regulate a very possibly dangerous and unregulated product, and we have done that the best we can in 563,\" said Rabon. \"We still have a way to go with that, but hopefully we can get it over the finish line this week.\"\n\nSen. Rabon said the reality is that different types of cannabis like Delta 8 and Delta 9, already in the marketplace, are very closely related.\n\n\"That's not too hard for folks in this room to figure out,\" he explained. \"It's just a matter of one coming from the quote-unquote the hemp plant, the other coming from quote-unquote the bad M word, the marijuana plant, both of which have the same genus and the same species being cannabis sativa. So it doesn't take really smart people to see that they are the same thing.\"\n\nThe difference in the two bills is that hemp products can be used by anyone 21 years of age and older upon the passage of the legislation. Medical marijuana would only be used by people at the recommendation of a physician.\n\n\"It will be a safer product than anything else that you see,\" promised Rabon.\n\nLazarra's new amendment borrows much of the language from Senate Bill 3 and specifies that to qualify, a patient must be suffering from a debilitating medical condition and have a physician provide written certification.\n\nCancer, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and post-traumatic stress disorder are among more than 15 conditions listed in the bill.\n\nRabon said his colleagues should consider this bill very much like the Right to Try measure that has won bipartisan support this session.\n\n\"We have, we've had the issue clouded and clouded and clouded many times. And in my opinion, when the clouds were that thick, it's time for it to rain. And what I would like to do is ask for you to support this amendment, to support this bill when it goes to the floor.\"\n\nAdding a 35-page amendment to a 26-page bill, as the change does, is unusual, but Sen. Lazarra said changes at the federal level made the addition essential.\n\n\"I think one of the things we also have to talk about is the potential federal regulatory change, scheduling change. We have an opportunity now to really put some guardrails around this industry, and I think we don't need to miss this opportunity,\" stressed Lazarra. \"It's a great time to work together and create the framework for this, which is in SB3 as indicated.\"\n\nThe Biden administration announced in late April plans that would remove marijuana from a list of the most highly regulated drugs.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration is now accepting public comments on plans to move cannabis from Schedule I to a less-restrictive Schedule III classification.\n\nMore than 22,000 people had commented on the proposed reclassification as of mid-June.\n\nNorth Carolina remains one of only a dozen states without some form of legal medical marijuana.\n\nThe amended version of 563 won the full support of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday and now heads back to Senate Rules.", "source": {"uri": "ncnewsline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NC Newsline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "clayton_henkel@ncnewsline.com", "name": "Clayton Henkel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemp", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hemp"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_cannabis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medical cannabis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lazzara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Lazzara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Rabon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Rabon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Appetite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_sativa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis sativa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Controlled Substances Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parkinson's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug Enforcement Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epilepsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Cannabis", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Cannabis", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs/Cannabis", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs/Cannabis", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Industrial_Hemp", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Industrial Hemp", "wgt": 26}], "image": "https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Cannabis-buds-Getty.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666151", "eventUri": "eng-9666151", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

They want an age requirement to buy CBD and hemp products and licensing rules to govern retailers and manufacturers.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Senate committee voted to add medical marijuana to the hemp regulations bill.

Senate medical marijuana bill cleared the first of two floor votes in the Senate Thursday with legislative analysts saying the language still lacks enough House support to pass.\n\nAn amendment was attached to House Bill 563 on Wednesday that inserted most of the language from Senate Bill 3, titled \"NC Compassionate Care Act.\"\n\nThe vote passed on Thursday by a vote of 33-9. A final vote is likely to be held Monday night.\n\nUpon approval of the final vote, the bill goes back to the House, which can accept or reject the changes. If the House rejects the changes the bill could go to a concurrence committee.\n\nThe amendment comes as House and Senate Republican leadership are in negotiations over the state 2024-25 budget.\n\nBecause the 2024 session is expected to end shortly after the state budget becomes law, legislators have started their annual 11th-hour scrambling to get hot-button bills through both chambers.\n\nThe amendment filer to HB563 was Sen. Bill Rabon, R-New Hanover, chairman of the Senate Rules and Operations committee, primary sponsor of SB3 and a cancer survivor. SB3 cleared the Senate by a 36-10 vote in March 2023, but has not received a vote in a House committee.\n\nHB563's initial focus was tightening sale and distribution regulations on hemp-derived consumable products, such as vaping devices, as well as banning those devices from school grounds.\n\nThe bill also contains language that would: place Tianeptine, Xylazine and Kratom on the state's controlled substance schedules; create criminal penalties for criminal possession and unlawful sale of embalming fluid; and create penalties for exposing a minor to a controlled substance.\n\nOpponents have expressed concerns about the medical marijuana legislation, including that it would serve as a gateway to legalizing marijuana in North Carolina, and that medical research isn't definitive on benefiting users.\n\nHouse Speaker Tim Moore has told legislative media outlets that for a medical marijuana bill to clear the House, there would need to be \"reasonable controls,\" and a balance to have enough distributors to prescribe and avoid a monopoly.\n\nRabon plea\n\nRabon was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer in 2000 at age 48. Rabon has said his oncologist initially told him he had as much as 18 months to live.\n\nRabon has acknowledged limited use of marijuana -- \"a few puffs\" -- enabled him to withstand the worst of his chemotherapy treatments as he continued to work at his veterinarian practice.\n\nOn Thursday, Rabon made another impassioned plea for recommendation of the medical marijuana language, particularly addressing its provision requiring the necessity of a doctor experienced in cannabis involved in treatment.\n\n\"The people who need -- and can benefit from -- medical-grade cannabis are dying every day,\" Rabon said. \"They are at their wit's end. People are buying marijuana on the street and they don't know what they're getting and no idea the interaction with the drugs they are taking.\n\n\"We have a right to try bill that has passed the House unanimously and is going to be added on the (Senate) floor to the bill because people are dying. They need help to stay alive, to stay with their loved ones another day, to feel good about life, to have a meal, not be put on morphine so they don't know what world they're in.\"\n\nAddressing opponents of medical marijuana language, Rabon said that \"if you are scared of the boogeyman, sleep with the lights on.\"\n\n\"This is something we should do. I have lived it. Those who are dead set against it should walk in my shoes, know what I've done.\n\n\"You can preach to me folks all you want about loving your fellow man,\" Rabon said. \"If you love your fellow man, you will try every day to make their life better.\"\n\nHemp language\n\nRep. Jeffrey McNeely, R-Iredell, and primary sponsor of HB563, asked Senate Rules members to back out of the medical marijuana language, saying the proposed language in the previous version of the House bill should not be tied to language unlikely to pass the House.\n\n\"Don't take your eye off the ball,\" McNeely said. \"We're trying to regulate a completely unregulated industry that is hooking our children on marijuana at a very early age.\n\n\"It's a pathway, and we need to be very mindful of that. So, don't forget that part of this when some shining new object is added. We're trying to save our children from a path of destruction.\"\n\nRabon said the tightening of the hemp vaping regulation is important, saying \"we're in the ninth inning on that one.\"\n\nThat language, according to Rabon, attempts to fix \"our dropping of the ball and letting something that should have been tightly regulated make it to our (retail) shelves, into our homes and into our children's lives with absolutely no control.\"\n\nSB3 background\n\nSB3 would permit the use of medical marijuana for individuals with ALS, cancer, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, post-traumatic stress disorder and other ailments, but not for those experiencing chronic pain.\n\nThe bill does not allow recreational marijuana usage.\n\nLegislative analysts have said House members were likely to amend SB3 to add language that reflects a more conservative approach.\n\nAlthough Rep. Donny Lambeth, R-Forsyth, has championed many health-care bills, foremost the historic Medicaid expansion bill pending funding in the 2023-24 state budget, he had not expressed an opinion on medical marijuana until May 31, 2023, during a non-voting committee meeting.\n\nLambeth said what changed his mind was a fact-finding visit with 15 other legislators to a marijuana operational center in Mississippi. That state has similar restrictions to the ones SB3 proposes for North Carolina.\n\nLambeth said he was reassured by how Mississippi handled the growing of the marijuana used for medical purposes.\n\nLambeth also cited recent conversations \"with ministers, family people, friends, saying 'please help us because we've been in such pain and we think this will actually relieve us'\" of that pain.\n\n'Behind the 8 ball': How research is trying to catch up on cannabis and kids 'Behind the 8 ball': How research is trying to catch up on cannabis and kids 'Behind the 8 ball': How

(AP) -- North Carolina got a step closer to legalizing medical marijuana on Thursday when the state Senate gave it its initial approval.\n\nThe Senate approved a measure legalizing medical marijuana in its first of two votes, 33-9, with nine Republicans breaking from the rest of the party to oppose it. If approved a second time, the bill will go to the state House, which has historically blocked Senate attempts to legalize the drug's medical use.\n\nLegalizing medical marijuana for qualifying patients with a \"debilitating medical condition\" was added to a bill on Wednesday that originally focused on creating further state regulations for federally legal hemp products. Those hemp products contain a concentration of less than 0.3% of THC concentration, the compound that gives marijuana its high.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Burton) among stars in FCA All-Star Game Chesterfield County schools employee charged with possessing child porn\n\nAlthough the hemp regulations remain in the bill, Sen. Danny Britt, a Republican from Robeson County, said on the Senate floor that adding medical marijuana was necessary to \"get out in front\" of an expected federal reclassification of marijuana from a Schedule I drug to a less dangerous Schedule III drug.\n\nSen. Bill Rabon, a Republican from Brunswick County who is one of the most vocal proponents of legalizing medical marijuana, said the bill would help sick and dying people in the state. Like in previous sessions, he recounted his own experience smoking pot while undergoing chemotherapy for colon cancer.\n\n\"With 18 months to live, I'm here 20 years later because I had a physician who told me to do this, and I did,\" Rabon told Senate colleagues.\n\nThe bill awaits its second senatorial vote on Monday. Rabon said the chamber might submit additional amendments after reviewing requests from the House.\n\nThe House hasn't clearly indicated if it would pass the bill.\n\nHouse Speaker Tim Moore said Thursday that he supports legalizing medical marijuana through a Senate measure approved last year, but has said repeatedly that it wouldn't be considered because not enough House Republicans back the idea.\n\nMoore didn't know whether combining the legalization with the hemp regulation provisions would persuade additional colleagues. He said he anticipated House Republicans would privately discuss the idea next week.\n\nAssociated Press writer Gary D. Robertson contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Why it could still face opposition", "body": "The 33-9 vote Thursday marks the third time in three years that the North Carolina Senate has voted, by a broad bipartisan margin, to legalize medical marijuana. But GOP leaders in the state House have never allowed it to come up for a vote.\n\nWith the end of the state's 2024 legislative session looming, Senate Republicans hit the gas Thursday on efforts to legalize medical marijuana in North Carolina.\n\nThe 33-9 vote Thursday marks the third time in three years that the Senate has voted, by a broad bipartisan margin, to legalize medical marijuana. But GOP leaders in the state House have never allowed it to come up for a vote; House Speaker Tim Moore has said that while he personally supports the idea, most of his fellow Republican lawmakers in the House don't.\n\nThursday's vote showed the Senate getting creative in efforts to win more support from House Republicans. Senator Bill Rabon, R-Brunswick, added his legalization bill to a proposal to regulate sales of hemp-derived CBD products -- a top priority of House GOP leadership.\n\nPublic polling shows marijuana legalization -- whether only for medical use, or for full recreational use -- is supported by a majority of North Carolinians. But it faces strong opposition from conservative Christian groups, who wield significant influence in Republican primary elections.\n\nRabon said his fellow Republicans who oppose medical legalization \"haven't walked in my shoes.\"\n\n\"You can preach to me, folks, all you want about loving your fellow man,\" he said. \"If you love your fellow man, you'll try to make every day of their life better.\"\n\nRabon went through a bout of life-threatening colon cancer many years ago. He credits illicit marijuana use, on the advice of his oncologist, with his survival: \"I would have died had I not broken the law,\" he said. \"You can sit there and say, 'Oh, no,' but I lived it. If you haven't lived it, don't tell me what it is.\"\n\nSen. Jim Burgin, R-Harnett, was the only voice against the measure on the Senate floor. He said he worried that legalizing medical marijuana could open the door to future legalization of marijuana for recreational use, too.\n\n\"I've been praying about this bill for days,\" Burgin said. \"I think we have to do what protects everyone, especially our young people.\"\n\nBurgin said no major medical group has endorsed the medical use of marijuana.\n\n\"Marijuana is not a medicine. It's not FDA approved,\" Burgin said.\n\nBut in a Senate Rules Committee debate Thursday, Rabon argued that Delta-9 hemp products -- which are currently legal in North Carolina -- contain the same active ingredient as in marijuana. He said the only difference is potency.\n\n\"The people that need and can benefit from medical-grade cannabis are dying every day. They've died for six years since I started working on this,\" Rabon said. \"I want to know where the compassion in this room is. I want to know because I'm not seeing it. It's ridiculous, people.\"", "source": {"uri": "wral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WRAL"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_cannabis_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medical cannabis in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Moore_(North_Carolina_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Moore (North Carolina politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalization_of_non-medical_cannabis_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Rabon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Rabon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannabidiol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_right", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian right"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cannabis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legality of cannabis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Burgin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Burgin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Rules_and_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemp", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hemp"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorectal cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tetrahydrocannabinol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_cannabis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medical cannabis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Cannabis", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Cannabis", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs/Cannabis", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs/Cannabis", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://images.wral.com/asset/news/political/2024/04/30/21407313/66314624c1dec-lkTrn9dj-DMID1-62sbtjams-640x480.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666151", "eventUri": "eng-9666151", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Senate medical marijuana bill cleared the first of two floor votes in the Senate Thursday with legislative analysts saying the language still lacks enough House support to pass.\n\nAn amendment was attached to House Bill 563 on Wednesday that inserted most of the language from Senate Bill 3, titled \"NC Compassionate Care Act.\"\n\nThe vote passed on Thursday by a vote of 33-9. A final vote is likely to be held Monday night.\n\nUpon approval of the final vote, the bill goes back to the House, which can accept or reject the changes. If the House rejects the changes the bill could go to a concurrence committee.\n\nThe amendment comes as House and Senate Republican leadership are in negotiations over the state 2024-25 budget.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Bill Rabon, R-New Hanover, chairman of the Senate Rules and Operations committee, primary sponsor of SB3 and a cancer survivor. SB3 cleared the Senate by a 36-10 vote in March 2023, but has not received a vote in a House committee.\n\nHB563's initial focus was tightening sale and distribution regulations on hemp-derived consumable products, such as vaping devices, as well as banning those devices from school grounds.\n\nThe bill also contains language that would: place Tianeptine, Xylazine and Kratom on the state's controlled substance schedules; create criminal penalties for criminal possession and unlawful sale of embalming fluid; and create penalties for exposing a minor to a controlled substance.\n\nOpponents have expressed concerns about the medical marijuana legislation, including that it would serve as a gateway to legalizing marijuana in North Carolina, and that medical research isn't definitive on benefiting users.\n\nHouse Speaker Tim Moore has told legislative media outlets that for a medical marijuana bill to clear the House, there would need to be \"reasonable controls,\" and a balance to have enough distributors to prescribe and avoid a monopoly.\n\nRabon plea\n\nRabon was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer in 2000 at age 48. Rabon has said his oncologist initially told him he had as much as 18 months to live.\n\nRabon has acknowledged limited use of marijuana -- \"a few puffs\" -- enabled him to withstand the worst of his chemotherapy treatments as he continued to work at his veterinarian practice.\n\nOn Thursday, Rabon made another impassioned plea for recommendation of the medical marijuana language, particularly addressing its provision requiring the necessity of a doctor experienced in cannabis involved in treatment.\n\n\"The people who need -- and can benefit from -- medical-grade cannabis are dying every day,\" Rabon said. \"They are at their wit's end. People are buying marijuana on the street and they don't know what they're getting and no idea the interaction with the drugs they are taking.\n\n\"We have a right to try bill that has passed the House unanimously and is going to be added on the (Senate) floor to the bill because people are dying. They need help to stay alive, to stay with their loved ones another day, to feel good about life, to have a meal, not be put on morphine so they don't know what world they're in.\"\n\nAddressing opponents of medical marijuana language, Rabon said that \"if you are scared of the boogeyman, sleep with the lights on.\"\n\n\"This is something we should do. I have lived it. Those who are dead set against it should walk in my shoes, know what I've done.\n\n\"You can preach to me folks all you want about loving your fellow man,\" Rabon said. \"If you love your fellow man, you will try every day to make their life better.\"\n\nHemp language\n\nRep. Jeffrey McNeely, R-Iredell, and primary sponsor of HB563, asked Senate Rules members to back out of the medical marijuana language, saying the proposed language in the previous version of the House bill should not be tied to language unlikely to pass the House.\n\n\"Don't take your eye off the ball,\" McNeely said. \"We're trying to regulate a completely unregulated industry that is hooking our children on marijuana at a very early age.\n\n\"It's a pathway, and we need to be very mindful of that. So, don't forget that part of this when some shining new object is added. We're trying to save our children from a path of destruction.\"\n\nRabon said the tightening of the hemp vaping regulation is important, saying \"we're in the ninth inning on that one.\"\n\nThat language, according to Rabon, attempts to fix \"our dropping of the ball and letting something that should have been tightly regulated make it to our (retail) shelves, into our homes and into our children's lives with absolutely no control.\"\n\nSB3 background\n\nSB3 would permit the use of medical marijuana for individuals with ALS, cancer, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, post-traumatic stress disorder and other ailments, but not for those experiencing chronic pain.\n\nThe bill does not allow recreational marijuana usage.\n\nLegislative analysts have said House members were likely to amend SB3 to add language that reflects a more conservative approach.\n\nAlthough Rep. Donny Lambeth, R-Forsyth, has championed many health-care bills, foremost the historic Medicaid expansion bill pending funding in the 2023-24 state budget, he had not expressed an opinion on medical marijuana until May 31, 2023, during a non-voting committee meeting.\n\nLambeth said what changed his mind was a fact-finding visit with 15 other legislators to a marijuana operational center in Mississippi. That state has similar restrictions to the ones SB3 proposes for North Carolina.\n\nLambeth said he was reassured by how Mississippi handled the growing of the marijuana used for medical purposes.\n\nLambeth also cited recent conversations \"with ministers, family people, friends, saying 'please help us because we've been in such pain and we think this will actually relieve us'\" of that pain.\n\n'Behind the 8 ball': How research is trying to catch up on cannabis and kids 'Behind the 8 ball': How research is trying to catch up on cannabis and kids 'Behind the 8 ball': How

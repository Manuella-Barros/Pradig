(Credit: Vanja Terzic / Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain ... [+] Dedication.) Vanja Terzic via a Creative Commons license I\u2019ve shared a number scientific studies about the benefits of nature and how the natural environment has beneficial effects (for example, read more here, here, here and here) \u2014 and this is particularly true for those who live in large cities. Although most of us do recognize that nature benefits the human psyche and soul, we don\u2019t really know what, precisely, it is about nature that is so beneficial. Is it the birds? The flowers? The bees and butterflies? The greenery? A new study by a team based at Bangor University and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology sought to specifically identify which natural elements are beneficial to city dwellers. To do this, the researchers used eye-tracking technology to record their volunteers\u2019 visual attention to both natural and human-made elements in urban areas and assessed the impact of what the volunteers saw upon their well-being. The researchers recruited 117 urban residents to go on a 45-minute urban walk, resembling a typical commute, whilst wearing eye-tracking glasses. The researchers also measured cognition, affect (mood), anxiety, and perceived restorativeness before and after the walk. The study volunteers were directed to focus their gaze on trees, plants, lawns and flowers (green elements), man-made structures (grey elements) or a mix of both, and the researchers analyzed their eye movements to understand how visual attention relates to well-being measures.

(doi:10.1002/pan3.10648) doi:10.1002/pan3.10648 \u201cWe found that the individuals who were guided to direct their gaze more frequently at green elements reported a significant reduction in anxiety, with trees showing the most substantial positive effect,\u201d reported the study\u2019s lead author, Environmental Scientist Whitney Fleming, a lecturer in Human Geography at Bangor University. This unique eye-tracking methodology revealed that a volunteer\u2019s focus on nature was associated with improvements in various mental health metrics, including reduced anxiety levels and increased feelings of restorativeness. \u201cThe study highlights a strong link between observing green elements, especially trees, and an increase in perceived restorativeness, suggesting that even brief interactions with nature can provide mental health benefits,\u201d Dr Fleming noted. This study presents yet more data to urban planners. It suggests that integrating more natural features \u2014 especially trees \u2014 into cityscapes could play a crucial role in improving the mental well-being of city dwellers. Further, creating urban spaces with prominent natural elements could encourage people to engage with nature during their daily routines, and thus, could potentially reduce the mental burden on city residents. Although the eye-tracking technology used in this study did encounter some limitations, it still provided enough practical information to be useful. Of course, future studies should refine these data and also explore other sensory interactions with nature. For example, is birdsong particularly beneficial? or the smell of flowers? Nevertheless, this study is a first step to providing interesting and practical information for how cities can support improvements to urban residents\u2019 mental and physical well-being.

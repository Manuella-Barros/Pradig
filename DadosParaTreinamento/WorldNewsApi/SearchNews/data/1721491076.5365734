Fan votes, submitted in two phases, determine the starters for the All-Star Game, which is set to be held on July 16th at Globe Life Field in Arlington. And the initial returns, which MLB announced Monday, haven\u2019t been promising for the Cubs. Considering the prolonged slump the offense has been stuck in, that isn\u2019t particularly surprising. Cubs center fielder Cody Bellinger led the team with 352,565 votes at the first checkpoint, which put him at No. 8 among National League outfielders, two slots below the cutoff for a Phase 2 berth. Phase 1 voting ends on June 27. While the top six outfielders in each league advance, only the top two in every other position group moves on. And the Cubs don\u2019t have another player higher than No. 9 in their respective position groups. After Bellinger, right-fielder Seiya Suzuki (178,872) was the next-highest vote-getter, putting him at No. 12 among NL outfielders. He was followed by third baseman Christopher Morel (102,119, No. 9), shortstop Dansby Swanson (75,061, No. 9) and second baseman Nico Hoerner (70,789, No. 9). All-Star pitchers and reserves are decided through player ballots and commissioner\u2019s office selections. Cubs left-hander Shota Imanaga, who entered Monday with the third-best ERA (1.89) among qualified pitchers, is on track to earn a bid. Right-hander Javier Assad (2.81), who started for the Cubs on Monday against the Giants and was right behind Imanaga among National League ERA leaders entering the game, could potentially make a push. Every team gets at least one All-Star selection. Voting is available online at MLB.com/vote. Gathering doctors\u2019 opinions The Cubs are still gathering doctors\u2019 opinions on right-hander Ben Brown\u2019s neck injury, looking for a consensus. Brown saw a local specialist on Monday, according to president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer. Manager Craig Counsell said Friday that Brown was diagnosed with a \u201cstress reaction\u201d in his neck but the Cubs were still determining what that would mean for his recovery. \u201cNot one that was particularly straightforward,\u201d Hoyer said of the injury, \u201cand as a result, just trying to get the best information.\u201d Right-hander Daniel Palencia, who was hurt in his first appearance with Triple-A Iowa after being activated from the 15-day IL and optioned, is also seeking a definite diagnosis for his injury. The Cubs aren\u2019t sure whether it\u2019s the same injury, which the Cubs called a right shoulder strain, that landed him on the IL in early May or something new. Almonte progressing Cubs reliever Yency Almonte (strained right shoulder) is set to throw a live batting practice session on Tuesday at Wrigley Field, the second live BP of his progression. If all goes well, pitching coach Tommy Hottovy said late last week, the next step will likely be for Almonte to start a rehab assignment. Almonte was among the Cubs\u2019 high-leverage options before he landed on the IL in early May.", "url": "https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2024/06/17/first-2024-mlb-all-star-voting-update-reveals-cubs-position-players-have-hill-to-climb", "image": "https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a6fd988/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3908x2231+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc6%2Fac%2Fd29bd9f0466fadadefc5fe471898%2F215784", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:39:56", "author": "Maddie Lee", "authors": ["Maddie Lee"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.131}

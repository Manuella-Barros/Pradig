He led the Los Angeles Lakers to greatness and then went to the front office and built a team of his own to return to the summit.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the system felt another shock, and this one was personal.\n\nHearing his name made you stop and look and listen. Seeing him play was appointment viewing, which was quite difficult in the 1960s because you could only see one game a week unless you lived in a Major League city. Unless it was an All-Star Game, seeing Willie Mays or the San Francisco Giants was the rarest of occasions.\n\nI saw Mays in person only once, but it was a moment I will have next to my heart for the rest of my life.\n\nIt was the summer of 1969. I'd attended summer camp in northern New Jersey before returning to my relatives in Harlem, New York. I would return to my mother and her cousin and catch up with my father, who came up from Greenville, North Carolina. But this wasn't an ordinary reconnection.\n\nWaightstill Morehead Scales Jr. was an insurance agent in Greenville. His agency was a part of Integon, whose headquarters were in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in the building that is now known as 500 W. Fifth St.\n\nMy father worked at the local bank in Greenville as a postal clerk and courier; we lived in West Greenville, and occasionally, our family would ride to the east side to see all the fancy homes, and the Scales home was on the tour. We had our dreams.\n\nScales and my father became friends in a way that typified the South in that period. Scales, whose nickname was \"Booger,\" used to charter a train for several years to carry Greenville's affluent men to Washington to watch an NFL game. Tom Foreman was the bartender. It was a little extra money for him, and a few toys and souvenirs for me.\n\nScales was also friends with J. Paul Simpson, who history shows was a hardware store manager in the small town of Williamston, North Carolina, about 30 minutes east of Greenville. During a bank board meeting, Simpson fell, hit his head and died instantly. It was at Simpson's funeral that Scales met another Williamston native, Gaylord Perry.\n\n\"Pop always said he lost his best friend and gained his next best friend,\" said his son, Waighty Scales.\n\nPerry would wind up with the San Francisco Giants, debuting in 1962. In 1966, he carried a 20-2 record into August, before finishing 21-8. He pitched a no-hitter at Candlestick Park in San Francisco in 1968, shutting out St. Louis and ace Bob Gibson, 1-0.\n\nScales became a die-hard Giants fan. He went to see them whenever he could.\n\n\"He sort of ingratiated himself with the team,\" Waighty Scales said. \"We had the parties for the players, and you were sitting up there with all of the players, playing poker, getting drinks.\"\n\nIn 1969, he took a group to New York to watch the Giants play the Mets. at Shea Stadium. Tom Foreman and his 13-year-old son joined the entourage for two nights at the Americana Hotel, as the younger Scales recalls. I have no idea what hotel we were staying in 55 years ago. Remembering lunch from yesterday is a challenge.\n\nI also don't remember if it was the first night or the second night of the Giants-Mets series that they gathered for a party in a very large room, but they showed up. Perry, Willie McCovey and, ultimately, Mays. It was as close as I could get to being on a field with them, but it was better. There they were, face-to-face in the same room. But my eyes never left Mays, and before long, I was next to him as he enjoyed a beverage I am sure was not iced tea.\n\nAs the picture might suggest, I was dumbstruck. What do you say to one of the greatest baseball players of all time? In my case, very little. I'm just immensely grateful somebody got the photo.\n\nThe elder Scales was also a jokester. In the final game of that series with the Mets, he donned a Giants uniform with the number 6 on the back and pretended to be Whitey Lockman, who also played for the Giants. Scales even signed autographs as Lockman.\n\n\"I've got a picture of him signing a teenager's cast,\" Waighty Scales said.\n\nMays came to Greenville in 1980, spending the night at the Scaleses' home. People went to the insurance agency the next day and got their pictures taken with Mays before the young Scales loaded the former baseball star's luggage into his Mazda RX-7 and made the two-hour drive to Raleigh-Durham International Airport.\n\n\"So, I've got Willie for two hours as I drove him back to Raleigh-Durham, which was unbelievable,\" he said, \"a life experience which was unbelievable.\"\n\nMays would finish his career in the city that first embraced him, playing for the Mets. He would enter the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979.\n\nPerry, the first pitcher to win the Cy Young Award in both leagues, would make what amounted to a mini-tour of the Major Leagues, pitching for eight teams. He joined Mays in the hall in 1991.\n\nThey all were great men, but they're now left to our memories. Booger Scales visited my family when my father died in 1977, and I attended his funeral in 2001. Perry died in Gaffney, South Carolina, in 2022. And now, we bid farewell to The Say Hey Kid. This time, the words weren't so hard to come up with.", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It was at Simpson's funeral that Scales met another Williamston native, Gaylord Perry.\n\n\"Pop always said he lost his best friend and gained his next best friend,\" said his son, Waighty Scales.\n\nPerry would wind up with the San Francisco Giants, debuting in 1962. In 1966, he carried a 20-2 record into August, before finishing 21-8. He pitched a no-hitter at Candlestick Park in San Francisco in 1968, shutting out St. Louis and ace Bob Gibson, 1-0.\n\nScales became a die-hard Giants fan. He went to see them whenever he could.\n\n\"He sort of ingratiated himself with the team,\" Waighty Scales said. \"We had the parties for the players, and you were sitting up there with all of the players, playing poker, getting drinks.\"\n\nIn 1969, he took a group to New York to watch the Giants play the Mets. at Shea Stadium. Tom Foreman and his 13-year-old son joined the entourage for two nights at the Americana Hotel, as the younger Scales recalls. I have no idea what hotel we were staying in 55 years ago. Remembering lunch from yesterday is a challenge.\n\nI also don't remember if it was the first night or the second night of the Giants-Mets series that they gathered for a party in a very large room, but they showed up. Perry, Willie McCovey and, ultimately, Mays. It was as close as I could get to being on a field with them, but it was better. There they were, face-to-face in the same room. But my eyes never left Mays, and before long, I was next to him as he enjoyed a beverage I am sure was not iced tea.\n\nAs the picture might suggest, I was dumbstruck. What do you say to one of the greatest baseball players of all time? In my case, very little. I'm just immensely grateful somebody got the photo.\n\nThe elder Scales was also a jokester. In the final game of that series with the Mets, he donned a Giants uniform with the number 6 on the back and pretended to be Whitey Lockman, who also played for the Giants. Scales even signed autographs as Lockman.\n\n\"I've got a picture of him signing a teenager's cast,\" Waighty Scales said.\n\nMays came to Greenville in 1980, spending the night at the Scaleses' home. People went to the insurance agency the next day and got their pictures taken with Mays before the young Scales loaded the former baseball star's luggage into his Mazda RX-7 and made the two-hour drive to Raleigh-Durham International Airport.\n\n\"So, I've got Willie for two hours as I drove him back to Raleigh-Durham, which was unbelievable,\" he said, \"a life experience which was unbelievable.\"\n\nMays would finish his career in the city that first embraced him, playing for the Mets. He would enter the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979.\n\nPerry, the first pitcher to win the Cy Young Award in both leagues, would make what amounted to a mini-tour of the Major Leagues, pitching for eight teams. He joined Mays in the hall in 1991.\n\nThey all were great men, but they're now left to our memories. Booger Scales visited my family when my father died in 1977, and I attended his funeral in 2001. Perry died in Gaffney, South Carolina, in 2022. And now, we bid farewell to The Say Hey Kid. This time, the words weren't so hard to come up with.\n\nSkip.foreman@greensboro.com\n\n336-373-7316\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0 * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this

In the last week, those of us baby boomers who embraced those legends may be feeling loss more than usual. The NBA lost a star and the inspiration for its logo, Jerry West. He led the Los Angeles Lakers to greatness and then went to the front office and built a team of his own to return to the summit.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the system felt another shock, and this one was personal.\n\nHearing his name made you stop and look and listen. Seeing him play was appointment viewing, which was quite difficult in the 1960s because you could only see one game a week unless you lived in a major league city. Unless it was an All-Star Game, seeing Willie Mays or the San Francisco Giants was the rarest of occasions.\n\nI saw Mays in person only once, but it was a moment I will have next to my heart for the rest of my life.\n\nIt was the summer of 1969. I'd attended summer camp in northern New Jersey before returning to my relatives in Harlem. I would return to my mother and her cousin and catch up with my father, who came up from Greenville, North Carolina. But this wasn't an ordinary reconnection.\n\nWaightstill Morehead Scales Jr. was an insurance agent in Greenville. His agency was a part of Integon, whose headquarters were in Winston-Salem, in the building which is now known as 500 W. Fifth St. My father worked at the local bank in Greenville as a postal clerk and courier; we lived in West Greenville, and occasionally, our family would ride to the east side to see all the fancy homes, and the Scales home was on the tour. We had our dreams.\n\nScales and my father became friends in a way that typified the South in that period. Scales, whose nickname was \"Booger,\" used to charter a train for several years to carry Greenville's affluent men to Washington to watch an NFL game. Tom Foreman was the bartender. It was a little extra money for him, and a few toys and souvenirs for me.\n\nScales was also friends with J. Paul Simpson, who history shows was a hardware store manager in the small town of Williamston, about 30 minutes east of Greenville. During a bank board meeting, Simpson fell, hit his head and died instantly. It was at Simpson's funeral that Scales met another Williamston native, Gaylord Perry.\n\n\"Pop always said he lost his best friend and gained his next best friend,\" said his son, Waighty Scales.\n\nPerry would wind up with the San Francisco Giants. He debuted in 1962 with the San Francisco Giants. In 1966, he carried a 20-2 record into August, before finishing 21-8. He pitched a no-hitter at Candlestick Park in 1968, shutting out St. Louis and ace Bob Gibson, 1-0.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nScales became a die-hard Giants fan. He went to see them whenever he could.\n\n\"He sort of ingratiated himself with the team,\" Waighty Scales said. \"We had the parties for the players, and you were sitting up there with all of the players, playing poker, getting drinks.\"\n\nIn 1969, he took a group to New York to watch the Giants play the Mets. at Shea Stadium. Tom Foreman and his 13-year-old son joined the entourage for two nights at the Americana Hotel, as the younger Scales recalls. I have no idea what hotel we were staying in 55 years ago. Remembering lunch from yesterday is a challenge.\n\nI also don't remember if it was the first night or the second night of the Giants-Mets series that they gathered for a party in a very large room, but they showed up. Perry, Willie McCovey and, ultimately, Mays. It was as close as I could get to being on a field with them, but it was better. There they were, face-to-face in the same room. But my eyes never left Mays, and before long, I was next to him as he enjoyed a beverage I am sure was not iced tea.\n\nAs the picture might suggest, I was dumbstruck. What do you say to one of the greatest baseball players of all time? In my case, very little. I'm just immensely grateful somebody got the photo.\n\nThe elder Scales was also a jokester. In the final game of that series with the Mets, he donned a Giants uniform with the number 6 on the back and pretended to be Whitey Lockman, who also played for the Giants. Scales even signed autographs as Lockman.\n\n\"I've got a picture of him signing a teenager's cast,\" Waighty Scales said.\n\nMays came to Greenville in 1980, spending the night at the Scales' home.

In the last week, those of us baby boomers who embraced those legends may be feeling loss more than usual. The NBA lost a star and the inspiration for its logo, Jerry West. He led the Los Angeles Lakers to greatness and then went to the front office and built a team of his own to return to the summit.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the system felt another shock, and this one was personal.\n\nHearing his name made you stop and look and listen. Seeing him play was appointment viewing, which was quite difficult in the 1960s because you could only see one game a week unless you lived in a major league city. Unless it was an All-Star Game, seeing Willie Mays or the San Francisco Giants was the rarest of occasions.\n\nI saw Mays in person only once, but it was a moment I will have next to my heart for the rest of my life.\n\nIt was the summer of 1969. I'd attended summer camp in northern New Jersey before returning to my relatives in Harlem. I would return to my mother and her cousin and catch up with my father, who came up from Greenville, North Carolina. But this wasn't an ordinary reconnection.\n\nWaightstill Morehead Scales Jr. was an insurance agent in Greenville. His agency was a part of Integon, whose headquarters were in Winston-Salem, in the building which is now known as 500 W. Fifth St. My father worked at the local bank in Greenville as a postal clerk and courier; we lived in West Greenville, and occasionally, our family would ride to the east side to see all the fancy homes, and the Scales home was on the tour. We had our dreams.\n\nScales and my father became friends in a way that typified the South in that period. Scales, whose nickname was \"Booger,\" used to charter a train for several years to carry Greenville's affluent men to Washington to watch an NFL game. Tom Foreman was the bartender. It was a little extra money for him, and a few toys and souvenirs for me.\n\nScales was also friends with J. Paul Simpson, who history shows was a hardware store manager in the small town of Williamston, about 30 minutes east of Greenville. During a bank board meeting, Simpson fell, hit his head and died instantly. It was at Simpson's funeral that Scales met another Williamston native, Gaylord Perry.\n\n\"Pop always said he lost his best friend and gained his next best friend,\" said his son, Waighty Scales.\n\nPerry would wind up with the San Francisco Giants. He debuted in 1962 with the San Francisco Giants. In 1966, he carried a 20-2 record into August, before finishing 21-8. He pitched a no-hitter at Candlestick Park in 1968, shutting out St. Louis and ace Bob Gibson, 1-0.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nScales became a die-hard Giants fan. He went to see them whenever he could.\n\n\"He sort of ingratiated himself with the team,\" Waighty Scales said. \"We had the parties for the players, and you were sitting up there with all of the players, playing poker, getting drinks.\"\n\nIn 1969, he took a group to New York to watch the Giants play the Mets. at Shea Stadium. Tom Foreman and his 13-year-old son joined the entourage for two nights at the Americana Hotel, as the younger Scales recalls. I have no idea what hotel we were staying in 55 years ago. Remembering lunch from yesterday is a challenge.\n\nI also don't remember if it was the first night or the second night of the Giants-Mets series that they gathered for a party in a very large room, but they showed up. Perry, Willie McCovey and, ultimately, Mays. It was as close as I could get to being on a field with them, but it was better. There they were, face-to-face in the same room. But my eyes never left Mays, and before long, I was next to him as he enjoyed a beverage I am sure was not iced tea.\n\nAs the picture might suggest, I was dumbstruck. What do you say to one of the greatest baseball players of all time? In my case, very little. I'm just immensely grateful somebody got the photo.\n\nThe elder Scales was also a jokester. In the final game of that series with the Mets, he donned a Giants uniform with the number 6 on the back and pretended to be Whitey Lockman, who also played for the Giants. Scales even signed autographs as Lockman.\n\n\"I've got a picture of him signing a teenager's cast,\" Waighty Scales said.\n\nMays came to Greenville in 1980, spending the night at the Scales' home. People went to the insurance agency the next day and got their pictures taken with Mays before the young Scales loaded the former baseball star's luggage into his Mazda RX-7 and made the two-hour drive to Raleigh-Durham International Airport.\n\n\"So, I've got Willie for two hours as I drove him back to Raleigh-Durham, which was unbelievable,\" he said, \"a life experience which was unbelievable.\"\n\nMays would finish his career in the city which first embraced him, playing for the Mets. He would enter the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979.\n\nPerry, the first pitcher to win the Cy Young Award in both leagues, would make what amounted to a mini-tour of the major leagues, pitching for eight teams. He joined Mays in the hall in 1991.\n\nThey all were great men, but they're now left to our memories. Booger Scales visited my family when my father died in 1977, and I attended his funeral in 2001. Perry died in Gaffney, South Carolina, in 2022. And now, we bid farewell to The Say Hey Kid. This time, the words weren't so hard to come up with.\n\nSkip.foreman@greensboro.com\n\n336-373-7316\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

In the last week, those of us baby boomers who embraced those legends may be feeling loss more than usual. The NBA lost a star and the inspiration for its logo, Jerry West. He led the Los Angeles Lakers to greatness and then went to the front office and built a team of his own to return to the summit.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the system felt another shock, and this one was personal.\n\nHearing his name made you stop and look and listen. Seeing him play was appointment viewing, which was quite difficult in the 1960s because you could only see one game a week unless you lived in a Major League city. Unless it was an All-Star Game, seeing Willie Mays or the San Francisco Giants was the rarest of occasions.\n\nPeople are also reading...

I'd attended summer camp in northern New Jersey before returning to my relatives in Harlem, New York. I would return to my mother and her cousin and catch up with my father, who came up from Greenville, North Carolina. But this wasn't an ordinary reconnection.\n\nWaightstill Morehead Scales Jr. was an insurance agent in Greenville. His agency was a part of Integon, whose headquarters were in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in the building that is now known as 500 W. Fifth St.\n\nMy father worked at the local bank in Greenville as a postal clerk and courier; we lived in West Greenville, and occasionally, our family would ride to the east side to see all the fancy homes, and the Scales home was on the tour. We had our dreams.\n\nScales and my father became friends in a way that typified the South in that period. Scales, whose nickname was \"Booger,\" used to charter a train for several years to carry Greenville's affluent men to Washington to watch an NFL game. Tom Foreman was the bartender. It was a little extra money for him, and a few toys and souvenirs for me.\n\nScales was also friends with J. Paul Simpson, who history shows was a hardware store manager in the small town of Williamston, North Carolina, about 30 minutes east of Greenville. During a bank board meeting, Simpson fell, hit his head and died instantly. It was at Simpson's funeral that Scales met another Williamston native, Gaylord Perry.\n\n\"Pop always said he lost his best friend and gained his next best friend,\" said his son, Waighty Scales.\n\nPerry would wind up with the San Francisco Giants, debuting in 1962. In 1966, he carried a 20-2 record into August, before finishing 21-8. He pitched a no-hitter at Candlestick Park in San Francisco in 1968, shutting out St. Louis and ace Bob Gibson, 1-0.\n\nScales became a die-hard Giants fan. He went to see them whenever he could.\n\n\"He sort of ingratiated himself with the team,\" Waighty Scales said. \"We had the parties for the players, and you were sitting up there with all of the players, playing poker, getting drinks.\"\n\nIn 1969, he took a group to New York to watch the Giants play the Mets. at Shea Stadium. Tom Foreman and his 13-year-old son joined the entourage for two nights at the Americana Hotel, as the younger Scales recalls. I have no idea what hotel we were staying in 55 years ago. Remembering lunch from yesterday is a challenge.\n\nI also don't remember if it was the first night or the second night of the Giants-Mets series that they gathered for a party in a very large room, but they showed up. Perry, Willie McCovey and, ultimately, Mays. It was as close as I could get to being on a field with them, but it was better. There they were, face-to-face in the same room. But my eyes never left Mays, and before long, I was next to him as he enjoyed a beverage I am sure was not iced tea.\n\nAs the picture might suggest, I was dumbstruck. What do you say to one of the greatest baseball players of all time? In my case, very little. I'm just immensely grateful somebody got the photo.\n\nThe elder Scales was also a jokester. In the final game of that series with the Mets, he donned a Giants uniform with the number 6 on the back and pretended to be Whitey Lockman, who also played for the Giants. Scales even signed autographs as Lockman.\n\n\"I've got a picture of him signing a teenager's cast,\" Waighty Scales said.\n\nMays came to Greenville in 1980, spending the night at the Scaleses' home. People went to the insurance agency the next day and got their pictures taken with Mays before the young Scales loaded the former baseball star's luggage into his Mazda RX-7 and made the two-hour drive to Raleigh-Durham International Airport.\n\n\"So, I've got Willie for two hours as I drove him back to Raleigh-Durham, which was unbelievable,\" he said, \"a life experience which was unbelievable.\"\n\nMays would finish his career in the city that first embraced him, playing for the Mets. He would enter the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979.\n\nPerry, the first pitcher to win the Cy Young Award in both leagues, would make what amounted to a mini-tour of the Major Leagues, pitching for eight teams. He joined Mays in the hall in 1991.\n\nThey all were great men, but they're now left to our memories. Booger Scales visited my family when my father died in 1977, and I attended his funeral in 2001. Perry died in Gaffney, South Carolina, in 2022. And now, we bid farewell to The Say Hey Kid. This time, the words weren't so hard to come up with.\n\nSkip.foreman@greensboro.com\n\n336-373-7316\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news

I'd attended summer camp in northern New Jersey before returning to my relatives in Harlem, New York. I would return to my mother and her cousin and catch up with my father, who came up from Greenville, North Carolina. But this wasn't an ordinary reconnection.\n\nWaightstill Morehead Scales Jr. was an insurance agent in Greenville. His agency was a part of Integon, whose headquarters were in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in the building that is now known as 500 W. Fifth St.\n\nMy father worked at the local bank in Greenville as a postal clerk and courier; we lived in West Greenville, and occasionally, our family would ride to the east side to see all the fancy homes, and the Scales home was on the tour. We had our dreams.\n\nScales and my father became friends in a way that typified the South in that period. Scales, whose nickname was \"Booger,\" used to charter a train for several years to carry Greenville's affluent men to Washington to watch an NFL game. Tom Foreman was the bartender. It was a little extra money for him, and a few toys and souvenirs for me.\n\nScales was also friends with J. Paul Simpson, who history shows was a hardware store manager in the small town of Williamston, North Carolina, about 30 minutes east of Greenville. During a bank board meeting, Simpson fell, hit his head and died instantly. It was at Simpson's funeral that Scales met another Williamston native, Gaylord Perry.\n\n\"Pop always said he lost his best friend and gained his next best friend,\" said his son, Waighty Scales.\n\nPerry would wind up with the San Francisco Giants, debuting in 1962. In 1966, he carried a 20-2 record into August, before finishing 21-8. He pitched a no-hitter at Candlestick Park in San Francisco in 1968, shutting out St. Louis and ace Bob Gibson, 1-0.\n\nScales became a die-hard Giants fan. He went to see them whenever he could.\n\n\"He sort of ingratiated himself with the team,\" Waighty Scales said. \"We had the parties for the players, and you were sitting up there with all of the players, playing poker, getting drinks.\"\n\nIn 1969, he took a group to New York to watch the Giants play the Mets. at Shea Stadium. Tom Foreman and his 13-year-old son joined the entourage for two nights at the Americana Hotel, as the younger Scales recalls. I have no idea what hotel we were staying in 55 years ago. Remembering lunch from yesterday is a challenge.\n\nI also don't remember if it was the first night or the second night of the Giants-Mets series that they gathered for a party in a very large room, but they showed up. Perry, Willie McCovey and, ultimately, Mays. It was as close as I could get to being on a field with them, but it was better. There they were, face-to-face in the same room. But my eyes never left Mays, and before long, I was next to him as he enjoyed a beverage I am sure was not iced tea.\n\nAs the picture might suggest, I was dumbstruck. What do you say to one of the greatest baseball players of all time? In my case, very little. I'm just immensely grateful somebody got the photo.\n\nThe elder Scales was also a jokester. In the final game of that series with the Mets, he donned a Giants uniform with the number 6 on the back and pretended to be Whitey Lockman, who also played for the Giants. Scales even signed autographs as Lockman.\n\n\"I've got a picture of him signing a teenager's cast,\" Waighty Scales said.\n\nMays came to Greenville in 1980, spending the night at the Scaleses' home. People went to the insurance agency the next day and got their pictures taken with Mays before the young Scales loaded the former baseball star's luggage into his Mazda RX-7 and made the two-hour drive to Raleigh-Durham International Airport.\n\n\"So, I've got Willie for two hours as I drove him back to Raleigh-Durham, which was unbelievable,\" he said, \"a life experience which was unbelievable.\"\n\nMays would finish his career in the city that first embraced him, playing for the Mets. He would enter the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979.\n\nPerry, the first pitcher to win the Cy Young Award in both leagues, would make what amounted to a mini-tour of the Major Leagues, pitching for eight teams. He joined Mays in the hall in 1991.\n\nThey all were great men, but they're now left to our memories. Booger Scales visited my family when my father died in 1977, and I attended his funeral in 2001. Perry died in Gaffney, South Carolina, in 2022. And now, we bid farewell to The Say Hey Kid. This time, the words weren't so hard to come up with.\n\nSkip.foreman@greensboro.com\n\n336-373-7316\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and

In the last week, those of us baby boomers who embraced those legends may be feeling loss more than usual. The NBA lost a star and the inspiration for its logo, Jerry West. He led the Los Angeles Lakers to greatness and then went to the front office and built a team of his own to return to the summit.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the system felt another shock, and this one was personal.\n\nHearing his name made you stop and look and listen. Seeing him play was appointment viewing, which was quite difficult in the 1960s because you could only see one game a week unless you lived in a Major League city. Unless it was an All-Star Game, seeing Willie Mays or the San Francisco Giants was the rarest of occasions.\n\nPeople are also reading...

I'd attended summer camp in northern New Jersey before returning to my relatives in Harlem, New York. I would return to my mother and her cousin and catch up with my father, who came up from Greenville, North Carolina. But this wasn't an ordinary reconnection.\n\nWaightstill Morehead Scales Jr. was an insurance agent in Greenville. His agency was a part of Integon, whose headquarters were in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in the building that is now known as 500 W. Fifth St.\n\nMy father worked at the local bank in Greenville as a postal clerk and courier; we lived in West Greenville, and occasionally, our family would ride to the east side to see all the fancy homes, and the Scales home was on the tour. We had our dreams.\n\nScales and my father became friends in a way that typified the South in that period. Scales, whose nickname was \"Booger,\" used to charter a train for several years to carry Greenville's affluent men to Washington to watch an NFL game. Tom Foreman was the bartender. It was a little extra money for him, and a few toys and souvenirs for me.\n\nScales was also friends with J. Paul Simpson, who history shows was a hardware store manager in the small town of Williamston, North Carolina, about 30 minutes east of Greenville. During a bank board meeting, Simpson fell, hit his head and died instantly. It was at Simpson's funeral that Scales met another Williamston native, Gaylord Perry.\n\n\"Pop always said he lost his best friend and gained his next best friend,\" said his son, Waighty Scales.\n\nPerry would wind up with the San Francisco Giants, debuting in 1962. In 1966, he carried a 20-2 record into August, before finishing 21-8. He pitched a no-hitter at Candlestick Park in San Francisco in 1968, shutting out St. Louis and ace Bob Gibson, 1-0.\n\nScales became a die-hard Giants fan. He went to see them whenever he could.\n\n\"He sort of ingratiated himself with the team,\" Waighty Scales said. \"We had the parties for the players, and you were sitting up there with all of the players, playing poker, getting drinks.\"\n\nIn 1969, he took a group to New York to watch the Giants play the Mets. at Shea Stadium. Tom Foreman and his 13-year-old son joined the entourage for two nights at the Americana Hotel, as the younger Scales recalls. I have no idea what hotel we were staying in 55 years ago. Remembering lunch from yesterday is a challenge.\n\nI also don't remember if it was the first night or the second night of the Giants-Mets series that they gathered for a party in a very large room, but they showed up. Perry, Willie McCovey and, ultimately, Mays. It was as close as I could get to being on a field with them, but it was better. There they were, face-to-face in the same room. But my eyes never left Mays, and before long, I was next to him as he enjoyed a beverage I am sure was not iced tea.\n\nAs the picture might suggest, I was dumbstruck. What do you say to one of the greatest baseball players of all time? In my case, very little. I'm just immensely grateful somebody got the photo.\n\nThe elder Scales was also a jokester. In the final game of that series with the Mets, he donned a Giants uniform with the number 6 on the back and pretended to be Whitey Lockman, who also played for the Giants. Scales even signed autographs as Lockman.\n\n\"I've got a picture of him signing a teenager's cast,\" Waighty Scales said.\n\nMays came to Greenville in 1980, spending the night at the Scaleses' home. People went to the insurance agency the next day and got their pictures taken with Mays before the young Scales loaded the former baseball star's luggage into his Mazda RX-7 and made the two-hour drive to Raleigh-Durham International Airport.\n\n\"So, I've got Willie for two hours as I drove him back to Raleigh-Durham, which was unbelievable,\" he said, \"a life experience which was unbelievable.\"\n\nMays would finish his career in the city that first embraced him, playing for the Mets. He would enter the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979.\n\nPerry, the first pitcher to win the Cy Young Award in both leagues, would make what amounted to a mini-tour of the Major Leagues, pitching for eight teams. He joined Mays in the hall in 1991.\n\nThey all were great men, but they're now left to our memories. Booger Scales visited my family when my father died in 1977, and I attended his funeral in 2001. Perry died in Gaffney, South Carolina, in 2022. And now, we bid farewell to The Say Hey Kid. This time, the words weren't so hard to come up with.\n\nSkip.foreman@greensboro.com\n\n336-373-7316\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and

I'd attended summer camp in northern New Jersey before returning to my relatives in Harlem, New York. I would return to my mother and her cousin and catch up with my father, who came up from Greenville, North Carolina. But this wasn't an ordinary reconnection.\n\nWaightstill Morehead Scales Jr. was an insurance agent in Greenville. His agency was a part of Integon, whose headquarters were in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in the building that is now known as 500 W. Fifth St.\n\nMy father worked at the local bank in Greenville as a postal clerk and courier; we lived in West Greenville, and occasionally, our family would ride to the east side to see all the fancy homes, and the Scales home was on the tour. We had our dreams.\n\nScales and my father became friends in a way that typified the South in that period. Scales, whose nickname was \"Booger,\" used to charter a train for several years to carry Greenville's affluent men to Washington to watch an NFL game. Tom Foreman was the bartender. It was a little extra money for him, and a few toys and souvenirs for me.\n\nScales was also friends with J. Paul Simpson, who history shows was a hardware store manager in the small town of Williamston, North Carolina, about 30 minutes east of Greenville. During a bank board meeting, Simpson fell, hit his head and died instantly. It was at Simpson's funeral that Scales met another Williamston native, Gaylord Perry.\n\n\"Pop always said he lost his best friend and gained his next best friend,\" said his son, Waighty Scales.\n\nPerry would wind up with the San Francisco Giants, debuting in 1962. In 1966, he carried a 20-2 record into August, before finishing 21-8. He pitched a no-hitter at Candlestick Park in San Francisco in 1968, shutting out St. Louis and ace Bob Gibson, 1-0.\n\nScales became a die-hard Giants fan. He went to see them whenever he could.\n\n\"He sort of ingratiated himself with the team,\" Waighty Scales said. \"We had the parties for the players, and you were sitting up there with all of the players, playing poker, getting drinks.\"\n\nIn 1969, he took a group to New York to watch the Giants play the Mets. at Shea Stadium. Tom Foreman and his 13-year-old son joined the entourage for two nights at the Americana Hotel, as the younger Scales recalls. I have no idea what hotel we were staying in 55 years ago. Remembering lunch from yesterday is a challenge.\n\nI also don't remember if it was the first night or the second night of the Giants-Mets series that they gathered for a party in a very large room, but they showed up. Perry, Willie McCovey and, ultimately, Mays. It was as close as I could get to being on a field with them, but it was better. There they were, face-to-face in the same room. But my eyes never left Mays, and before long, I was next to him as he enjoyed a beverage I am sure was not iced tea.\n\nAs the picture might suggest, I was dumbstruck. What do you say to one of the greatest baseball players of all time? In my case, very little. I'm just immensely grateful somebody got the photo.\n\nThe elder Scales was also a jokester. In the final game of that series with the Mets, he donned a Giants uniform with the number 6 on the back and pretended to be Whitey Lockman, who also played for the Giants. Scales even signed autographs as Lockman.\n\n\"I've got a picture of him signing a teenager's cast,\" Waighty Scales said.\n\nMays came to Greenville in 1980, spending the night at the Scaleses' home. People went to the insurance agency the next day and got their pictures taken with Mays before the young Scales loaded the former baseball star's luggage into his Mazda RX-7 and made the two-hour drive to Raleigh-Durham International Airport.\n\n\"So, I've got Willie for two hours as I drove him back to Raleigh-Durham, which was unbelievable,\" he said, \"a life experience which was unbelievable.\"\n\nMays would finish his career in the city that first embraced him, playing for the Mets. He would enter the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979.\n\nPerry, the first pitcher to win the Cy Young Award in both leagues, would make what amounted to a mini-tour of the Major Leagues, pitching for eight teams. He joined Mays in the hall in 1991.\n\nThey all were great men, but they're now left to our memories. Booger Scales visited my family when my father died in 1977, and I attended his funeral in 2001. Perry died in Gaffney, South Carolina, in 2022. And now, we bid farewell to The Say Hey Kid. This time, the words weren't so hard to come up with.\n\nSkip.foreman@greensboro.com\n\n336-373-7316\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "scnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SCNow"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Mays", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Willie Mays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenville,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greenville, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greenville, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darlington_County,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darlington County, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darlington County, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florence"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florence"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_West", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jerry West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Softball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes_County,_North_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barnes County, North Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barnes County, North Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baby boomers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGill_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McGill University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamston,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Williamston, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Williamston, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_County,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marion County, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marion County, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaylord_Perry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaylord Perry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

In the last week, those of us baby boomers who embraced those legends may be feeling loss more than usual. The NBA lost a star and the inspiration for its logo, Jerry West. He led the Los Angeles Lakers to greatness and then went to the front office and built a team of his own to return to the summit.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the system felt another shock, and this one was personal.\n\nHearing his name made you stop and look and listen. Seeing him play was appointment viewing, which was quite difficult in the 1960s because you could only see one game a week unless you lived in a Major League city. Unless it was an All-Star Game, seeing Willie Mays or the San Francisco Giants was the rarest of occasions.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nInvestigator tracked Kim Gardner to health clinic as St. Louis prosecutor's office crashed Here are 13 must-visit restaurants in the St. Louis area from Ian Froeb's newsletter New Channel 32?

I'd attended summer camp in northern New Jersey before returning to my relatives in Harlem, New York. I would return to my mother and her cousin and catch up with my father, who came up from Greenville, North Carolina. But this wasn't an ordinary reconnection.\n\nWaightstill Morehead Scales Jr. was an insurance agent in Greenville. His agency was a part of Integon, whose headquarters were in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in the building that is now known as 500 W. Fifth St.\n\nMy father worked at the local bank in Greenville as a postal clerk and courier; we lived in West Greenville, and occasionally, our family would ride to the east side to see all the fancy homes, and the Scales home was on the tour. We had our dreams.\n\nScales and my father became friends in a way that typified the South in that period. Scales, whose nickname was \"Booger,\" used to charter a train for several years to carry Greenville's affluent men to Washington to watch an NFL game. Tom Foreman was the bartender. It was a little extra money for him, and a few toys and souvenirs for me.\n\nScales was also friends with J. Paul Simpson, who history shows was a hardware store manager in the small town of Williamston, North Carolina, about 30 minutes east of Greenville. During a bank board meeting, Simpson fell, hit his head and died instantly. It was at Simpson's funeral that Scales met another Williamston native, Gaylord Perry.\n\n\"Pop always said he lost his best friend and gained his next best friend,\" said his son, Waighty Scales.\n\nPerry would wind up with the San Francisco Giants, debuting in 1962. In 1966, he carried a 20-2 record into August, before finishing 21-8. He pitched a no-hitter at Candlestick Park in San Francisco in 1968, shutting out St. Louis and ace Bob Gibson, 1-0.\n\nScales became a die-hard Giants fan. He went to see them whenever he could.\n\n\"He sort of ingratiated himself with the team,\" Waighty Scales said. \"We had the parties for the players, and you were sitting up there with all of the players, playing poker, getting drinks.\"\n\nIn 1969, he took a group to New York to watch the Giants play the Mets. at Shea Stadium. Tom Foreman and his 13-year-old son joined the entourage for two nights at the Americana Hotel, as the younger Scales recalls. I have no idea what hotel we were staying in 55 years ago. Remembering lunch from yesterday is a challenge.\n\nI also don't remember if it was the first night or the second night of the Giants-Mets series that they gathered for a party in a very large room, but they showed up. Perry, Willie McCovey and, ultimately, Mays. It was as close as I could get to being on a field with them, but it was better. There they were, face-to-face in the same room. But my eyes never left Mays, and before long, I was next to him as he enjoyed a beverage I am sure was not iced tea.\n\nAs the picture might suggest, I was dumbstruck. What do you say to one of the greatest baseball players of all time? In my case, very little. I'm just immensely grateful somebody got the photo.\n\nThe elder Scales was also a jokester. In the final game of that series with the Mets, he donned a Giants uniform with the number 6 on the back and pretended to be Whitey Lockman, who also played for the Giants. Scales even signed autographs as Lockman.\n\n\"I've got a picture of him signing a teenager's cast,\" Waighty Scales said.\n\nMays came to Greenville in 1980, spending the night at the Scaleses' home. People went to the insurance agency the next day and got their pictures taken with Mays before the young Scales loaded the former baseball star's luggage into his Mazda RX-7 and made the two-hour drive to Raleigh-Durham International Airport.\n\n\"So, I've got Willie for two hours as I drove him back to Raleigh-Durham, which was unbelievable,\" he said, \"a life experience which was unbelievable.\"\n\nMays would finish his career in the city that first embraced him, playing for the Mets. He would enter the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979.\n\nPerry, the first pitcher to win the Cy Young Award in both leagues, would make what amounted to a mini-tour of the Major Leagues, pitching for eight teams. He joined Mays in the hall in 1991.\n\nThey all were great men, but they're now left to our memories. Booger Scales visited my family when my father died in 1977, and I attended his funeral in 2001. Perry died in Gaffney, South Carolina, in 2022. And now, we bid farewell to The Say Hey Kid. This time, the words weren't so hard to come up with.\n\nSkip.foreman@greensboro.com\n\n336-373-7316\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand

I'd attended summer camp in northern New Jersey before returning to my relatives in Harlem, New York. I would return to my mother and her cousin and catch up with my father, who came up from Greenville, North Carolina. But this wasn't an ordinary reconnection.\n\nWaightstill Morehead Scales Jr. was an insurance agent in Greenville. His agency was a part of Integon, whose headquarters were in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in the building that is now known as 500 W. Fifth St.\n\nMy father worked at the local bank in Greenville as a postal clerk and courier; we lived in West Greenville, and occasionally, our family would ride to the east side to see all the fancy homes, and the Scales home was on the tour. We had our dreams.\n\nScales and my father became friends in a way that typified the South in that period. Scales, whose nickname was \"Booger,\" used to charter a train for several years to carry Greenville's affluent men to Washington to watch an NFL game. Tom Foreman was the bartender. It was a little extra money for him, and a few toys and souvenirs for me.\n\nScales was also friends with J. Paul Simpson, who history shows was a hardware store manager in the small town of Williamston, North Carolina, about 30 minutes east of Greenville. During a bank board meeting, Simpson fell, hit his head and died instantly. It was at Simpson's funeral that Scales met another Williamston native, Gaylord Perry.\n\n\"Pop always said he lost his best friend and gained his next best friend,\" said his son, Waighty Scales.\n\nPerry would wind up with the San Francisco Giants, debuting in 1962. In 1966, he carried a 20-2 record into August, before finishing 21-8. He pitched a no-hitter at Candlestick Park in San Francisco in 1968, shutting out St. Louis and ace Bob Gibson, 1-0.\n\nScales became a die-hard Giants fan. He went to see them whenever he could.\n\n\"He sort of ingratiated himself with the team,\" Waighty Scales said. \"We had the parties for the players, and you were sitting up there with all of the players, playing poker, getting drinks.\"\n\nIn 1969, he took a group to New York to watch the Giants play the Mets. at Shea Stadium. Tom Foreman and his 13-year-old son joined the entourage for two nights at the Americana Hotel, as the younger Scales recalls. I have no idea what hotel we were staying in 55 years ago. Remembering lunch from yesterday is a challenge.\n\nI also don't remember if it was the first night or the second night of the Giants-Mets series that they gathered for a party in a very large room, but they showed up. Perry, Willie McCovey and, ultimately, Mays. It was as close as I could get to being on a field with them, but it was better. There they were, face-to-face in the same room. But my eyes never left Mays, and before long, I was next to him as he enjoyed a beverage I am sure was not iced tea.\n\nAs the picture might suggest, I was dumbstruck. What do you say to one of the greatest baseball players of all time? In my case, very little. I'm just immensely grateful somebody got the photo.\n\nThe elder Scales was also a jokester. In the final game of that series with the Mets, he donned a Giants uniform with the number 6 on the back and pretended to be Whitey Lockman, who also played for the Giants. Scales even signed autographs as Lockman.\n\n\"I've got a picture of him signing a teenager's cast,\" Waighty Scales said.\n\nMays came to Greenville in 1980, spending the night at the Scaleses' home. People went to the insurance agency the next day and got their pictures taken with Mays before the young Scales loaded the former baseball star's luggage into his Mazda RX-7 and made the two-hour drive to Raleigh-Durham International Airport.\n\n\"So, I've got Willie for two hours as I drove him back to Raleigh-Durham, which was unbelievable,\" he said, \"a life experience which was unbelievable.\"\n\nMays would finish his career in the city that first embraced him, playing for the Mets. He would enter the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979.\n\nPerry, the first pitcher to win the Cy Young Award in both leagues, would make what amounted to a mini-tour of the Major Leagues, pitching for eight teams. He joined Mays in the hall in 1991.\n\nThey all were great men, but they're now left to our memories. Booger Scales visited my family when my father died in 1977, and I attended his funeral in 2001. Perry died in Gaffney, South Carolina, in 2022. And now, we bid farewell to The Say Hey Kid. This time, the words weren't so hard to come up with.\n\nSkip.foreman@greensboro.com\n\n336-373-7316\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

Now she says she plans to sue. Beverly Hills \u201cfacialist to the stars,\u201d Dawn DaLuise, was arrested in 2014 on suspicion of ordering a hit against a rival beauty guru and spent ten months in prison before being found not guilty of the charges. She has previously claimed in court papers that two alleged stalkers \u2014 \u201cBling Ring\u2019 leader Nick Prugo and Edward Feinstein \u2014 set her up for the arrest. But on Wednesday DaLuise was stunned to see a trailer for \u201cSkincare\u201d \u2014 a drama that DaLuise says is clearly based on her story \u2014 with Banks starring as Hope Goldman, a Beverly Hills facialist who is plunged into a deadly ordeal involving a rival beauty guru. It was the first she\u2019d heard of the flick. DaLuise tells us that she has been working with a production company to sell the story for some time, and was on the way to signing a deal with Netflix for a documentary, and she fears the Banks movie may scupper the project. \u201cIt could rob me of my ability to tell my own story,\u201d she told us. But her bigger fear is how \u201cSkincare\u201d may affect her life. Prugo and Feinstein pleaded guilty to stalking her and her two daughters, but never did jail time. And DaLuise says that she has felt safest when she\u2019s been able to use the media to \u201cexpose\u201d them. \u201cThe media are my minder and my bodyguard,\u201d DaLuise said, adding that \u2014 while she would use her own project to cast a light on the duo\u2019s alleged activities \u2014 it\u2019s not clear from the trailer that \u201cSkincare\u201d will name Prugo and Feinstein or even explain their role in the case. DaLuise says that since the trailer appeared, she\u2019s been talking to lawyers about her options for going after the filmmakers. Reps for the studio, IFC Films, and Banks didn\u2019t get back to us.", "summary": "Dawn DaLuise was stunned to see a trailer for \u201cSkincare,\u201d a drama that she says is clearly based on her story.

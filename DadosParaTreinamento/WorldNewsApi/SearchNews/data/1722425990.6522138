{"id": 243260714, "title": "In Rafah, 83% Of Refugees Report No Access To Food | - IMEMC News", "text": "Reuters reports: The death of another girl in Kamal Adwan Hospital late on Wednesday raised the number of children who have died of malnutrition and dehydration to at least 31, a Gaza health official said, adding that the war made recording such cases difficult. Israel denies accusations it has created the famine conditions, blaming aid agencies for distribution problems and accusing Hamas of diverting aid, allegations the militants (sic) deny. NOTE: Thousands of aid trucks are reportedly waiting just outside Gaza, where Israel has made it extremely difficult to pass, employing complicated and arbitrary procedures. Israel has on multiple occasions fired at individuals waiting for food aid (once killing over 100); Israel has also attacked food aid convoys. Additionally, Israeli citizens have blocked a border crossing for weeks, and attacked and looted trucks they believed were heading to Gaza \u2013 all with no meaningful attempt by Israel to stop them. In mid-March, Israel promised to \u201cflood\u201d Gaza with aid, but has failed to do so. The US has for months expressed its desire to see appropriate amounts of humanitarian aid reaching Gaza on one hand, while undermining Gaza\u2019s largest aid organization on the other. Meanwhile, the US has built a \u201ctemporary pier\u201d off the Gaza coast to receive aid by sea \u2013 at a cost of at least $230 million (which has so far been ineffective) \u2013 and has, along with other countries, airdropped packages of aid into Gaza \u2013 causing over 20 Palestinian deaths due to malfunction. The Biden administration has so far not used its leverage as the provider of billions of dollars in military aid to and for Israel (with one exception), a move that could potentially end the war in short order. Israel permits 19 medical evacuations, leaves 10,000 stuck in Gaza: Associated Press reports: Israeli authorities say 68 people \u2014 19 sick or wounded children plus their companions \u2014 have been allowed out of the Gaza Strip and into Egypt in the first medical evacuation since early May, when the territory\u2019s sole travel crossing was shut down after Israel captured it. [NOTE: some sources report 21 patients evacuated.] The soldiers didn\u2019t need direct orders in order to dehumanize an innocent injured man by tying him to the hood of a vehicle. Decades of corrupting occupation have brought us to the point where incidents like these have become an inevitability in the occupied territories. pic.twitter.com/5jkntJQFSI \u2014 Breaking the Silence (@BtSIsrael) June 27, 2024 Axios \u2013 U.S. to release part of suspended bomb shipment to Israel: Axios reports: The Biden administration is expected to soon release 500-lb. bombs that were part of a weapons shipment to Israel put on hold in April over U.S. concerns about the Israel Defense Forces\u2019 military operation in Rafah, one U.S. and one Israeli official told Axios. The move suggests the U.S. is now less concerned about Israel possibly using these bombs in Gaza and that the White House wants to decrease some of the tension between President Biden and Israel\u2019s supporters over his decision to withhold this specific shipment. About 1,700 500-lb. bombs are expected to be delivered after Israel\u2019s operation in Rafah ends, which is expected to happen in two weeks, according to an Israeli official. Israel says it needs the bombs in case fighting with Hezbollah on the northern border escalates into an all out war. U.S. and Israeli officials say the Biden administration is still reviewing another part of the shipment that includes 1,800 2,000-lb. bombs. US has provided $6.5bn in aid to Israel since October: Washington Post reports: The United States has provided $6.5 billion in security assistance to Israel since the start of the war \u2014 a previously unannounced figure that was part of discussions in Washington this week with a visiting delegation headed by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The announcement comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly accused the Biden administration of slow-rolling military assistance. \u201cThis is a massive, massive undertaking,\u201d said a senior administration official speaking on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the White House, who disclosed the totals as an indication of the depth and complexity of U.S. support for Israel. Senior US Republican demands Biden administration shut Gaza aid pier: Reuters reports: The Republican lawmaker who leads the House Armed Services Committee has written to the Biden administration formally demanding it shut down its aid pier off the coast Gaza, calling the operation ineffective, risky and a waste of money. The U.S. military has been authorized to operate it until the end of July, but a U.S. Agency for International Development official said this week that the administration could seek to extend it for at least another month. \u201cI urge the Administration to immediately cease this failed operation before further catastrophe occurs and consider alternative means of land and air-based humanitarian aid delivery,\u201d House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers wrote in a letter seen by Reuters. The letter, sent to White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, has not been previously reported. As of June 19, JLOTS had only been operational about 10 days and had only moved 3,415 metric tons onto the beach in Gaza,\u201d Rogers wrote, using the U.S. military\u2019s acronym for the pier system, known as Joint Logistics Over the Shore. Middle East Eye adds: The Pentagon has said that since 17 May, it has delivered 2,500 metric tonnes of aid via the pier. The figure is only a trickle of the amount of aid that was entering the enclave before the war. Prior to October, roughly 7,500 metric tonnes were entering Gaza daily. \u201cThis pier has been an immense and costly distraction from the work that we need to do and the problems we need to solve,\u201d Scott Paul, who leads humanitarian policy at Oxfam, told Middle East Eye. \u201cThis was a way of avoiding addressing the most critical obstacles to humanitarian assistance in Gaza, and so I think it\u2019s fair to say that it has not met even the administration\u2019s modest expectations for it.\u201d Widely reported Palestinian father-son \u2018rape\u2019 confession contradicted by piles of evidence", "summary": "<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://imemc.org/article/in-rafah-83-of-refugees-report-no-access-to-food/\"><img title=\"6-28-c\" src=\"https://imemc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/6-28-c-300x183.jpg\" alt=\"In Rafah, 83% Of Refugees Report No Access To Food\" width=\"300\" height=\"183\" /></a>\n\t</div>\n\tYet another malnutrition death; Gazans surrounded by sewage, garbage, insects; starvation setting in; out of 10,000+ medical evacuations needed, 19 permitted to leave; Gaza&#8217;s ambulance rescue service about to stop due to lack of fuel; Biden admin about to release part of suspended bomb shipment; Congress votes to conceal Gaza death toll; much more.

Trying to overturn a 2-1 deficit from the first-leg, the Stark\u2019s Park men produced a battling and skilful performance in Dingwall. However, their top-flight hosts were the ones who showed the clinical edge needed to stave off their own fears of promotion. Murray confessed the 6-1 aggregate defeat highlighted in stark fashion the improvements that are needed if Rovers are mix it with the country\u2019s best. But he was left proud by the club\u2019s efforts over the course of a remarkable campaign that just fell short in his 100th game in charge of the Kirkcaldy club. \u201cI\u2019m delighted with the boys for going out and showing a bit of character, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do that on Thursday evening for large parts. \u201cBut we knocked the ball about really well. We were trying to find little holes to create chances and we created a couple in the first-half. \u201cOn another day they go in. \u201cBut they showed belief in what we\u2019re doing, and for a manager you have to look at all aspects. \u2018Amazing backing\u2019 \u201cThe headline is we don\u2019t go up and the scoreline. But the way we played for about 110 or 120 minutes over the two legs was really good. \u201cWe had amazing backing from the supporters. I\u2019m gutted for them, more than anyone, that we didn\u2019t manage to do it. \u201cThese guys are spending so much money and time. Coming up here for a 12 o\u2019clock kick-off as well was really hard. \u201cBut they gave us so much backing, even towards the end. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing journey and I thanked the players for making it possible. \u201cThey\u2019ve done that this season. \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed \u2013 but I\u2019m so happy with them. They\u2019ve been amazing. \u201cThey\u2019ve given me so much fun. We\u2019ve had a great time doing it and we keep going.\u201d Raith found themselves way ahead of where they expected to be this season. Their title challenge to Dundee United fell away only in the final few weeks of the regular campaign. \u2018Looking to rebuild\u2019 Reaching the play-offs was the goal last summer and to get to the final was just reward for incredible efforts. Having fallen frustratingly short, Murray confesses the attentions will quickly turn to being able to go the next step next term. \u201cWe thank the boys for their efforts,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we also have to realise there are areas we need to be better at to be a better team and better individuals. \u201cBy Tuesday or Wednesday we\u2019ll be back on it and be looking to rebuild and get a few players in. \u201cA few players will leave and the loan boys will go back and then we\u2019ll get on it. \u201cYou have to give credit to Ross County because they punished us. \u201cThey were clinical, their goals were good strikes and they put you to the sword if you allow them to. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the lower end of the Premiership. \u201cIt\u2019s what we aspire to, to get to that level one day. \u201cIn terms of our endeavour and appetite and discipline, I thought our players were excellent.\u201d", "summary": "The Stark's Park side were swept aside in clinical fashion in 6-1 aggregate defeat to Ross County.", "url": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/sport/football/4991767/ian-murray-players-fans-raith-rovers-journey/", "image": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2024/05/21078418_58040441-k6mpawvs.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:06:45", "author": "Iain Collin", "authors": ["Iain Collin"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.035}

The data came from several sources, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the researchers evaluated states on 32 specific metrics, scoring them relative to each other.\n\nThe report, released Thursday, reveals that states in the Northeast scored highest. Massachusetts came out on top as \"the best-performing health system for women overall,\" with Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New Hampshire rounding out the top five.\n\nThe poorest performers were spread across the southern half of the country. Mississippi had the lowest score overall, followed by Texas, Nevada, Oklahoma and Arkansas.\n\n\"This is the very first time we at the Fund have created a scorecard exclusively focused on states' performance in reproductive care and women's health,\" said Dr. Joseph Betancourt, president of the Commonwealth Fund.\n\n\"While some states undoubtedly are championing women's continued access to vital health and reproductive services, many others are failing to ensure that women can get and afford the health care they need. This failure is having a disproportionate impact on women of color and women with low incomes,\" he said. \"My hope is that policymakers can use these findings to identify and address gaps in care, guaranteeing that all women across the United States can live healthy lives with access to quality, affordable care - no matter where they live or what their background is.\"\n\n'Health of women ... is in a perilous place'\n\nThe new report reveals that life expectancy for US women is the lowest it's been in nearly two decades - since 2006.\n\n\"The health of women in the United States is in a perilous place,\" the authors wrote, highlighting nationwide increases in deaths from preventable causes, as well as significant state-by-state differences in how many women are dying in reproductive age.\n\nIn 2022, the mortality rate ranged from about 204 deaths for every 100,000 women of reproductive age in West Virginia to around 71 deaths per 100,000 in Hawaii, the report says.\n\n\"We looked at deaths from all causes among women and girls ages 15 to 44, a common way to identify women of reproductive age, and we found a threefold difference across states, with the highest rates of death concentrated in the Southeastern states,\" said David Radley, a senior scientist for the Commonwealth Fund's Tracking Health System Performance initiative.\n\nCauses of death included those related to pregnancy - with mental health conditions as the most frequently reported cause of preventable pregnancy-related deaths - as well as other preventable causes such as substance use, Covid-19 and treatable chronic health conditions. The report also noted that the maternal death rate nearly doubled between 2018 and 2022, with rates for Black and American Indian and Alaska Native women increasing the most.\n\nDeaths from breast and cervical cancer also are considered in the new report as preventable and treatable with timely screening and health care. Breast and cervical cancer deaths were found to be highest in Southern states.\n\n\"We also saw big differences across states in women's ability to access care,\" Radley said. \"The state of health care for women in this country is in a vulnerable place.\"\n\nA fractured landscape of health policies - including Medicaid coverage and access to abortion and reproductive care - contributes to significant state-level inequalities for women across the country, according to the new report.\n\n\"We found big differences across states in a woman's ability to access reproductive health care services, the quality of care she's likely to receive and the outcomes she's likely to experience,\" Radley said. \"We looked at insurance coverage and found that uninsured rates among women ranged from 2.5% to over 20% uninsured, with the highest uninsured rates in states that have not expanded their Medicaid programs.\"\n\nExpanding Medicaid coverage to cover more people with household incomes below a certain level is linked with lower rates of maternal mortality, smaller racial and ethnic disparities in maternal mortality and infant health outcomes, and broader use of reproductive health care services, according to the report. The three states with the lowest maternal mortality rates - Vermont, California and Connecticut - have all expanded Medicaid.\n\nTen states have not expanded Medicaid - Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming - leaving about 800,000 women uninsured. Each of those states, except for Wisconsin, ranked below the average on women's health.\n\nWomen in states that had not expanded Medicaid eligibility were among those most at risk of lacking insurance coverage, the researchers found. Among women ages 15 to 44, those in Texas, Georgia and Oklahoma had the highest rates of being uninsured. Those in Massachusetts, the District of Columbia and Vermont had the lowest uninsured rates.\n\n\"But access isn't just about having coverage, it's also about being able to get to a service provider when care is needed. It's estimated that over 5 million women already live in a county that's considered a maternity care desert, meaning there's no hospital or birth center offering obstetric care and there are no obstetric providers,\" Radley said.\n\n\"We looked at the adequacy of the maternity care workforce in each state and found that states with the most restrictive abortion policies also tended to have the fewest maternity care providers,\" he said. \"There's concern among experts that abortion bans and restrictions may reduce the number of maternity care providers even further.\"\n\n'Are those divides ... going to continue?'\n\nStates with abortion restrictions tend to have the fewest maternity care providers, higher rates of maternal mortality and broad disparities in health systems, according to the new report.\n\nFourteen states - Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia - have enacted near-total bans on abortion since the US Supreme Court's Dobbs decision revoked the federal right to abortion two years ago. All but one of those states ranked below average in the new ranking of women's health from the Commonwealth Fund, and seven were among the poorest-performing states.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter\n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe policy choices that state lawmakers put forth, including fully expanding Medicaid and imposing abortion restrictions, have \"clearly had implications for people in their states,\" said Sara Collins, senior scholar and vice president for health care coverage and access and tracking health system performance at the Commonwealth Fund.\n\n\"Those are clear policy choices that states are making that are linked to the politics in their state and that are having an impact on women's access to health care,\" Collins said.\n\n\"Are those divides that we're seeing going to continue into the future?\" she asked. \"Are there going to be more women who are living in states that don't have full access to reproductive health care? Or are those trends going to reverse? And a lot of that is tied to the politics, both in states but also at the federal level.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri":

And it isn't just about being able to afford care: women in these areas are less likely to be able to even find an ob/gyn in their area.\n\nSome of the statistics were particularly grim: In 2022, women living in more than one-third of U.S. counties had little or no access to maternity care.\n\n\"Women's health is in a very fragile place,\" lead report author Sara Collins said during a Wednesday media briefing, NBC News reported. \"Our health system is failing women of reproductive age, especially women of color and low-income women.\"\n\nThose inequities are not new, Commonwealth Fund President Dr. Joseph Betancourt noted during the briefing, \"but recent policy choices and judicial decisions restricting access to reproductive care have and may continue to exacerbate them.\"\n\nThe report weighed a dozen measures of women's health care, including maternal mortality, preterm birth and postpartum depression, in all 50 states in 2022, the year the Dobbs ruling was issued.\n\nThat ruling \"significantly altered both access to reproductive health care services and how providers are able to treat pregnancy complications in the 21 states that ban or restrict abortion access,\" the report authors wrote.\n\nStates with the most restrictive abortion policies, including Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia, scored lowest in the new report. States that protected abortion care, including Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey, ranked highest.\n\nInsurance status also mattered: Women in states that had not expanded Medicaid coverage were the most affected.\n\n\"It's hard to stress how critical a source of coverage Medicaid is for pregnant women,\" David Radley, senior scientist for the Commonwealth Fund, said during the briefing, NBC News reported.\n\nReasons for the disparity are twofold, Collins noted. Women living in the lowest-ranking states are less likely to have health insurance and, even if they do, there aren't enough ob/gyns to take care of them.\n\nWhy? Doctors specializing in obstetrics and gynecology are either leaving states with abortion restrictions or aren't going there in the first place, experts said.\n\n\"It's not surprising that states with the most abortion restrictions or women's health policy restrictions are the same states that are having a real dearth of women's health workforce,\" Dr. Deborah Bartz, an ob/gyn at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, told NBC News. \"People are leaving those states because they can no longer provide the best care for their patients.\"\n\nThat leaves many women stranded when it comes to reproductive care, experts said.\n\n\"Your zip code shouldn't dictate your reproductive health destiny,\" Dr. Jonas Swartz, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke Health in North Carolina, told NBC News. \"But that is the reality.\"\n\nMore information\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute has more on abortion policies in U.S. states.\n\nSOURCES: Commonwealth Fund, report, July 18, 2024; NBC News\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nThe Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v.

It includes the most recent data available, from 2022, when the high court reversed the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision.\n\nMassachusetts, Vermont and Rhode Island were the top states for protecting women's health, while Oklahoma, Texas and Mississippi ranked last, according to the report.\n\nThese gaps could widen even more, particularly for women of color and those with low incomes in states where comprehensive reproductive health care is difficult to obtain, leading to striking inequities in preventable deaths, said Dr. Joseph Betancourt, president of The Commonwealth Fund.\n\n\"These inequities are longstanding, no doubt, but recent policy choices and judicial decisions, restricting access to reproductive care have and may continue to exacerbate them,\" Betancourt said at a media briefing Thursday.\n\n\"Our hope is that these in-depth, state-by-state findings will help inform federal and state policymakers and health care delivery system leaders, and their efforts to strengthen women's health and ensure that all women can get the health care they need when they need it,\" added Sara Collins, the fund's senior scholar and vice president of healthcare coverage and access and tracking health system performance.\n\nThe scorecard examined deaths from all causes among women and girls ages 15 to 44, a common way to identify females of reproductive age. In 2,022, roughly 70,000 deaths from all causes occurred in this age group, said David Radley, a senior scientist tracking health system performance at the fund.\n\n\"Suicide, cancer and complications from pregnancy are among the leading causes of death for women in this age range,\" Radley said.\n\nIn providing \"a vital baseline for tracking the ripple effects\" of the Supreme Court's decision, he added that the scorecard \"also serves as a glaring reminder that where you live matters to your health and health care.\"\n\nFor example, the report found a threefold difference in all-cause mortality between Hawaii, the state with the lowest rate, and West Virginia, the state with the highest rate.\n\nThe researchers factored in insurance coverage and found that uninsured rates among women ranged from 2 1/2% to more than 20%. The highest uninsured rates among those states that have not expanded their Medicaid programs.\n\nHowever, access isn't only about having coverage -- it's also about being able to reach a service provider when care is needed, Radley noted.\n\n\"It's estimated that over 5 million women already live in a county that's considered a maternity care desert, meaning there's no hospital or birth center offering obstetric care, and there are no obstetric providers.\"\n\nThe report found that states with the most restrictive abortion policies also tended to have the fewest maternity care providers.\n\n\"There's concern among experts that abortion bans and restrictions may reduce the number of maternity care providers even further,\" Radley said.\n\nThe report also provides maternal mortality rates across all states in which data are available. (It was missing eight states because of small counts.) These deaths are specifically associated with pregnancy or occur within 42 days of being pregnant.\n\n\"Combined with disparities and socioeconomic status, underlying health and quality of care have helped to drive the maternal mortality rate in the U.S. higher than that of other high-income countries,\" Radley said.\n\nThe highest rates of maternal mortality were in the Mississippi Delta states, including Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee.\n\n\"These are also states where a large number of counties don't have even a single hospital or birth center with providers who offer obstetric care,\" Radley said.\n\nA commonly used quality measure of maternity care is the frequency of birth by Caesarean section among low-risk pregnancies, which includes full-term pregnancies, among women giving birth for the first time and when the child is not in breech.\n\nWhile Cesarean delivery can be a lifesaver in certain situations, Radley said that the procedure also is associated with increased maternal death, greater likelihood of infection, longer recovery and greater pain.\n\nCaesarean deliveries were highest among a few northeastern states and across several southern states, according to the report. While rates in these states are still above the national quality targets, low-risk Caesarean deliveries have fallen nationally in recent years.\n\nAnother key quality measure associated with pregnancy that the report assessed is how often women who recently gave birth are screened for postpartum depression. Women were least likely to report being screened in Mississippi, Arkansas and Alabama, the report said.\n\n\"Conversely, many states with the lowest rates of postpartum depression are also the states where the highest share of women who recently gave birth, reported being screened, including Vermont, Massachusetts and Minnesota,\" Radley said.\n\nThe report also looked at the share of women in each state who are up to date with age-appropriate breast and cervical cancer screening.\n\n\"We see a distinct regional pattern with women in southern states experiencing the highest mortality from these treatable cancers,\" Collins said.\n\n\"While both breast and cervical cancer screening rates are relatively high in all states, there's still room to improve,\" Radley added.\n\nHe singled out Wyoming as an example. There, 65% of women are up to date with breast cancer screening but 35% are not. Overall, 18% to 23% of eligible women in all states are not up to date with recommended screenings.\n\nAlthough the Affordable Care Act has improved access for people across the income spectrum, \"women's health is in a fragile place,\" Collins said. \"We are seeing a deep and likely growing geographic divide.\"", "source": {"uri": "theolympian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The  Olympian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

The data came from several sources, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the researchers evaluated states on 32 specific metrics, scoring them relative to each other.\n\nThe report, released Thursday, reveals that states in the Northeast scored highest. Massachusetts came out on top as \"the best-performing health system for women overall,\" with Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New Hampshire rounding out the top five.\n\nThe poorest performers were spread across the southern half of the country. Mississippi had the lowest score overall, followed by Texas, Nevada, Oklahoma and Arkansas.\n\n\"This is the very first time we at the Fund have created a scorecard exclusively focused on states' performance in reproductive care and women's health,\" said Dr. Joseph Betancourt, president of the Commonwealth Fund.\n\n\"While some states undoubtedly are championing women's continued access to vital health and reproductive services, many others are failing to ensure that women can get and afford the health care they need. This failure is having a disproportionate impact on women of color and women with low incomes,\" he said. \"My hope is that policymakers can use these findings to identify and address gaps in care, guaranteeing that all women across the United States can live healthy lives with access to quality, affordable care - no matter where they live or what their background is.\"\n\nThe new report reveals that life expectancy for US women is the lowest it's been in nearly two decades - since 2006.\n\n\"The health of women in the United States is in a perilous place,\" the authors wrote, highlighting nationwide increases in deaths from preventable causes, as well as significant state-by-state differences in how many women are dying in reproductive age.\n\nIn 2022, the mortality rate ranged from about 204 deaths for every 100,000 women of reproductive age in West Virginia to around 71 deaths per 100,000 in Hawaii, the report says.\n\n\"We looked at deaths from all causes among women and girls ages 15 to 44, a common way to identify women of reproductive age, and we found a threefold difference across states, with the highest rates of death concentrated in the Southeastern states,\" said David Radley, a senior scientist for the Commonwealth Fund's Tracking Health System Performance initiative.\n\nCauses of death included those related to pregnancy - with mental health conditions as the most frequently reported cause of preventable pregnancy-related deaths - as well as other preventable causes such as substance use, Covid-19 and treatable chronic health conditions. The report also noted that the maternal death rate nearly doubled between 2018 and 2022, with rates for Black and American Indian and Alaska Native women increasing the most.\n\nDeaths from breast and cervical cancer also are considered in the new report as preventable and treatable with timely screening and health care. Breast and cervical cancer deaths were found to be highest in Southern states.\n\n\"We also saw big differences across states in women's ability to access care,\" Radley said. \"The state of health care for women in this country is in a vulnerable place.\"\n\nA fractured landscape of health policies - including Medicaid coverage and access to abortion and reproductive care - contributes to significant state-level inequalities for women across the country, according to the new report.\n\n\"We found big differences across states in a woman's ability to access reproductive health care services, the quality of care she's likely to receive and the outcomes she's likely to experience,\" Radley said. \"We looked at insurance coverage and found that uninsured rates among women ranged from 2.5% to over 20% uninsured, with the highest uninsured rates in states that have not expanded their Medicaid programs.\"\n\nExpanding Medicaid coverage to cover more people with household incomes below a certain level is linked with lower rates of maternal mortality, smaller racial and ethnic disparities in maternal mortality and infant health outcomes, and broader use of reproductive health care services, according to the report. The three states with the lowest maternal mortality rates - Vermont, California and Connecticut - have all expanded Medicaid.\n\nTen states have not expanded Medicaid - Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming - leaving about 800,000 women uninsured. Each of those states, except for Wisconsin, ranked below the average on women's health.\n\nWomen in states that had not expanded Medicaid eligibility were among those most at risk of lacking insurance coverage, the researchers found. Among women ages 15 to 44, those in Texas, Georgia and Oklahoma had the highest rates of being uninsured. Those in Massachusetts, the District of Columbia and Vermont had the lowest uninsured rates.\n\n\"But access isn't just about having coverage, it's also about being able to get to a service provider when care is needed. It's estimated that over 5 million women already live in a county that's considered a maternity care desert, meaning there's no hospital or birth center offering obstetric care and there are no obstetric providers,\" Radley said.\n\n\"We looked at the adequacy of the maternity care workforce in each state and found that states with the most restrictive abortion policies also tended to have the fewest maternity care providers,\" he said. \"There's concern among experts that abortion bans and restrictions may reduce the number of maternity care providers even further.\"\n\nStates with abortion restrictions tend to have the fewest maternity care providers, higher rates of maternal mortality and broad disparities in health systems, according to the new report.\n\nFourteen states - Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia - have enacted near-total bans on abortion since the US Supreme Court's Dobbs decision revoked the federal right to abortion two years ago. All but one of those states ranked below average in the new ranking of women's health from the Commonwealth Fund, and seven were among the poorest-performing states.\n\nThe policy choices that state lawmakers put forth, including fully expanding Medicaid and imposing abortion restrictions, have \"clearly had implications for people in their states,\" said Sara Collins, senior scholar and vice president for health care coverage and access and tracking health system performance at the Commonwealth Fund.\n\n\"Those are clear policy choices that states are making that are linked to the politics in their state and that are having an impact on women's access to health care,\" Collins said.\n\n\"Are those divides that we're seeing going to continue into the future?\" she asked. \"Are there going to be more women who are living in states that don't have full access to reproductive health care? Or are those trends going to reverse? And a lot of that is tied to the politics, both in states but also at the federal level.\"", "source": {"uri": "tittlepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "tittlepress.com"}, "authors": [],

Wade in June 2022, even more women have struggled to find reproductive care, a new report warns.\n\nIssued Thursday by the Commonwealth Fund, the report shows that women living in states long plagued by health disparities -- particularly in the Southeast -- have been harmed the most. And it isn't just about being able to afford care: women in these areas are less likely to be able to even find an ob/gyn in their area.\n\nSome of the statistics were particularly grim: In 2022, women living in more than one-third of U.S. counties had little or no access to maternity care.\n\n\"Women's health is in a very fragile place,\" lead report author Sara Collins said during a Wednesday media briefing, NBC News reported. \"Our health system is failing women of reproductive age, especially women of color and low-income women.\"\n\nThose inequities are not new, Commonwealth Fund President Dr. Joseph Betancourt noted during the briefing, \"but recent policy choices and judicial decisions restricting access to reproductive care have and may continue to exacerbate them.\"\n\nThe report weighed a dozen measures of women's health care, including maternal mortality, preterm birth and postpartum depression, in all 50 states in 2022, the year the Dobbs ruling was issued.\n\nThat ruling \"significantly altered both access to reproductive health care services and how providers are able to treat pregnancy complications in the 21 states that ban or restrict abortion access,\" the report authors wrote.\n\nStates with the most restrictive abortion policies, including Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia, scored lowest in the new report. States that protected abortion care, including Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey, ranked highest.\n\nInsurance status also mattered: Women in states that had not expanded Medicaid coverage were the most affected.\n\n\"It's hard to stress how critical a source of coverage Medicaid is for pregnant women,\" David Radley, senior scientist for the Commonwealth Fund, said during the briefing, NBC News reported.\n\nReasons for the disparity are twofold, Collins noted. Women living in the lowest-ranking states are less likely to have health insurance and, even if they do, there aren't enough ob/gyns to take care of them.\n\nWhy? Doctors specializing in obstetrics and gynecology are either leaving states with abortion restrictions or aren't going there in the first place, experts said.\n\n\"It's not surprising that states with the most abortion restrictions or women's health policy restrictions are the same states that are having a real dearth of women's health workforce,\" Dr. Deborah Bartz, an ob/gyn at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, told NBC News. \"People are leaving those states because they can no longer provide the best care for their patients.\"\n\nThat leaves many women stranded when it comes to reproductive care, experts said.\n\n\"Your zip code shouldn't dictate your reproductive health destiny,\" Dr. Jonas Swartz, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke Health in North Carolina, told NBC News. \"But that is the reality.\"\n\nDisclaimer: Statistical data in medical articles provide general trends and do not pertain to individuals.

And in preventable deaths.", "body": "The Commonwealth Fund, a foundation supporting research into public health worldwide, has released their 2024 State Scorecard on Women's Health and Reproductive Care.\n\nThe study assesses all fifty states, plus the District of Colombia, on 32 metrics across three areas - health outcomes, health care quality and prevention, and coverage, access, and affordability.\n\nKentucky performed well in several areas. Kentucky women ages 18-44 rarely went without care because of cost, and only 6% of Kentucky women ages 19-64 lacked health insurance coverage.\n\nHowever, Kentucky ranks in the bottom half on women's health overall, with one of the worst rates of death from breast and cervical cancer - both of which are considered largely treatable with early detection and immediate care.\n\nThe state also had exceptionally high rates of death from any cause, which was mostly attributed to the state's opioid deaths. Kentucky's all-cause mortality rate per 100,000 women ages 15-44 was 176.3 - nearly 60% more than the national average, and well over double the rate of the best performing state.\n\nDr. Sara Collins, Senior Scholar and Vice President of the Commonwealth Fund, said there are clear distinctions between states that perform well for women and states that perform poorly.\n\n\"Higher performing states have invested in health insurance coverage for nearly all their residents,\" said Collins, \"They've made reproductive healthcare legal and accessible, and they've achieved lower maternity mortality rates with more maternal health care workers, more prenatal and postpartum checkups, and higher rates of postpartum depression screening.\"\n\nKentucky adopted the ACA's Medicaid expansion a decade ago, but Commonwealth Fund Senior Scientist Dr. David Radley said access to health care isn't just about access to health insurance.\n\n\"It's also about being able to get to a service provider when care is needed,\" said Radley. \"It's estimated that over 5 million women [nationwide] already live in a county that's considered a maternity care desert, meaning there's no hospital or birth center offering obstetric care and there are no obstetric providers.\"\n\nAccording to a 2022 report by The March of Dimes, nearly half of Kentucky's 120 counties are defined as \"maternity care deserts\", with over 30 percent of women lacking access to a birthing hospital within a 30 minute drive.\n\n\"We looked at the adequacy of the maternity care workforce in each state and found that states with the most restrictive abortion policies also tended to have the fewest maternity care providers,\" said Radley.\n\nFollowing the Dobbs decision, a trigger law banned nearly all abortions in Kentucky, impacting reproductive care beyond abortion alone.\n\n\"Abortion bans or limits may inadvertently reduce the number of providers offering maternity care, owing to increased risk of legal action that practices face,\" concluded the study.\n\nDr. Joseph Betancourt, President of the Commonwealth Fund, said the report is not about politics, but policy.\n\n\"If you track across our scorecards, we engage in this work through the evidence lens, agnostic to politics but looking at policy and trends,\" said Betancourt. \"There's no doubt that there's a series of state-held policy choices here that have a clear impact not only on women's health but on health more generally. Shining a light on these [policies] in our capacity to identify high performers from low performers provides a blueprint for improving health more generally for any state.\"\n\nA bipartisan law tackling the high mortality rate of Kentucky mothers went into effect this week. The legislation expands health care access for new and expecting mothers, with pregnancy now considered a qualifying life event for health insurance coverage. It also establishes a psychiatric hotline called the Kentucky Lifeline for Moms.", "source": {"uri": "wuky.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WUKY-FM 91.3 Radio"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwifery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midwifery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cervical cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opioid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_period", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Postpartum period"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maternal health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_depression", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Postpartum depression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medicaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obstetrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prenatal development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Wade, according to a new report released Thursday.\n\nThe findings, from The Commonwealth Fund, a nonpartisan health care research foundation, show that women living in states with a history of health disparities -- often in the Southeast -- are affected the most. They are not only less likely to be able to afford a doctor's appointment; they're less likely to be able to find an OB/GYN in their area.\n\n\"These inequities are long-standing, no doubt,\" Dr. Joseph Betancourt, president of The Commonwealth Fund, said during a media briefing Wednesday to discuss the report. \"But recent policy choices and judicial decisions restricting access to reproductive care have and may continue to exacerbate them.\"\n\nThe report looked at more than a dozen measures of women's health care, including maternal mortality, preterm birth and postpartum depression, in all 50 states in 2022, the year of the Dobbs ruling.\n\nThat single action \"significantly altered both access to reproductive health care services and how providers are able to treat pregnancy complications in the 21 states that ban or restrict abortion access,\" the authors wrote.\n\nStates with the most restrictive abortion policies, including Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia, scored lowest in the new report. States that protected abortion care, including Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey, ranked highest.\n\nWomen in states that had not expanded Medicaid coverage were most affected.\n\n\"Women's health is in a very fragile place,\" said lead author Sara Collins, vice president for health care coverage and access and tracking health system performance at The Commonwealth Fund. \"Our health system is failing women of reproductive age, especially women of color and low-income women.\"\n\nReasons for the disparity are twofold, Collins said. Women living in the lowest-ranking states are less likely to have health insurance to afford doctor's visits. And even if they can, there aren't enough OB/GYNs to take care of them.\n\nThat is, doctors specializing in obstetrics and gynecology are either leaving states with abortion restrictions or aren't going there in the first place, experts said.\n\nA 2023 survey of third- and fourth-year medical students found, for example, that such laws were a major deterrent in applying for residency programs in those states.\n\n\"It's not surprising that states with the most abortion restrictions or women's health policy restrictions are the same states that are having a real dearth of women's health workforce,\" said Dr. Deborah Bartz, an OB/GYN at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. \"People are leaving those states because they can no longer provide the best care for their patients.\"\n\nStates that expanded Medicaid coverage had higher performances overall, according to the Commonwealth report.\n\n\"It's hard to stress how critical a source of coverage Medicaid is for pregnant women,\" said David Radley, senior scientist for the Commonwealth Fund during Wednesday's briefing.\n\n\"Your zip code shouldn't dictate your reproductive health destiny,\" said Dr. Jonas Swartz, assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke Health in Durham, North Carolina. \"But that is the reality.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

(Thanasis Zovoilis/Getty Images)\n\nA new state-by-state scorecard of women's health released this week by the Commonwealth Fund raises concerns over the care women receive and the ripple effects of the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe \"2024 State Scorecard on Women's Health and Reproductive Care\" is based on 32 measures of state health systems and examines how state policy actions are changing the way women can access and use health care.\n\n\"Based on the evidence and data, one thing is absolutely clear, women's health is in a very fragile state,\" said Dr. Joseph Betancourt, president of the Commonwealth Fund, during a briefing with reporters on Wednesday. \"There are stark disparities in women's access to quality health care among states across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic lines. Those inequities are longstanding, no doubt, but recent policy choices and judicial decisions restricting access to reproductive care have and may continue to exacerbate them.\"\n\nRates of maternal deaths were highest in the Mississippi Delta region, which includes Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee. North Carolina's rates for maternal deaths while pregnant and for infant mortality were both above the national average.\n\nEighteen percent of North Carolina women aged 18-64 reported being in fair or poor health based on the data from 2022.\n\nMore than 1 in 5 women in our state (21%) reported having 14 of more poor mental health days in the past month.\n\nNorth Carolina performed best on women who were up to date on colon cancer screenings.\n\nSuch screenings are critically important as deaths from breast and cervical cancer are considered preventable and treatable for women who receive timely screening and follow-up health care.\n\nResearchers found that Black women experienced higher breast cancer mortality than white women due to a variety of factors, including poorer quality of care after an abnormal test, or a diagnosis made at a more advanced stage.\n\nThe scorecard also found deaths among women of reproductive age are highest in southeastern states. Causes of death included pregnancy related complications and other preventable causes such as substance use, COVID-19, and treatable chronic conditions.\n\nThe uninsured rates among women in the U.S. ranged from 2.5% to over 20% with the highest uninsured rates in states that have not expanded their Medicaid programs.\n\nNorth Carolina expanded its Medicaid coverage on December 1, 2023. Just last week the NC Department of Health and Human Services announced the enrollment of more than 500,000 North Carolinians in the seven months since the program was launched.\n\n\"Each of those 500,000 who now have the peace of mind to be able to face some of the greatest challenges that they ever thought they could face and know that they are not alone,\" said North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kody Kinsley in marking the milestone.\n\nBut while North Carolina has made progress in expanding health care access, 10 states have yet to expand eligibility for Medicaid. That leaves nearly 800,000 women uninsured.\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund experts said access to care isn't just about having coverage, it's also about being able to get to a service provider when care is needed.\n\n\"It's estimated that over five million women (nationwide) already live in a county that's considered a maternity care desert, meaning there's no hospital or birth center offering obstetric care and there are no obstetric providers,\" explained David Radley, Ph.D., a senior scientist for the Commonwealth Fund.\n\nTwenty percent of women in North Carolina age 18-44 said they did not have a person who was their personal or primary health care provider.\n\nAbortion bans are also having an impact on the care that women receive, said Sara Collins, the Commonwealth Fund's vice president for health care coverage and tracking health system performance.\n\n\"A clear pattern in the study is states that have had abortion restrictions prior to Dobbs rank lower and a lot of our measures, including having adequate numbers of maternal health care providers,\" Collins shared. \"We're seeing post-Dobbs the effect that decision is having on states delivery systems. We're seeing lower residency applications in states with abortion bans from new medical students.\"\n\nSo, is there going to be a growing divide across the states between those that have left abortion legal and those that have enacted the tightest restrictions?\n\nWhat researchers do know now is that states in which a large share of residents are living in rural areas, there tend to be the fewest obstetric providers.\n\nFewer providers means that patients face barriers in receiving the full continuum of prenatal and postnatal care.\n\nHow women's health fares in the future could very well depend on the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) not only expanded Medicaid and provided subsidies the help lower-income families, but it also banned insurers in the individual market from charging young women higher premiums than young men. The ACA also required insurers to cover maternity care -something that was not guaranteed prior to the law.\n\nAfter more than 60 failed Republican-led votes to repeal Obamacare, experts believe a scenario could emerge if the GOP takes control of Congress and the White House in 2025 that would involve passage of legislation requiring slimmed down plans and fewer guaranteed benefits. It remains unclear if insurers would be allowed to deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\"While some states undoubtedly are championing women's continued access to vital health and reproductive services, many others are failing to ensure that women can get and afford the health care they need.

Wade in June 2022, even more women have struggled to find reproductive care, a new report warns.\n\nIssued Thursday by the Commonwealth Fund, the report shows that women living in states long plagued by health disparities -- particularly in the Southeast -- have been harmed the most. And it isn't just about being able to afford care: women in these areas are less likely to be able to even find an ob/gyn in their area.\n\nSome of the statistics were particularly grim: In 2022, women living in more than one-third of U.S. counties had little or no access to maternity care.\n\n\"Women's health is in a very fragile place,\" lead report author Sara Collins said during a Wednesday media briefing, NBC News reported. \"Our health system is failing women of reproductive age, especially women of color and low-income women.\"\n\nThose inequities are not new, Commonwealth Fund President Dr. Joseph Betancourt noted during the briefing, \"but recent policy choices and judicial decisions restricting access to reproductive care have and may continue to exacerbate them.\"\n\nThe report weighed a dozen measures of women's health care, including maternal mortality, preterm birth and postpartum depression, in all 50 states in 2022, the year the Dobbs ruling was issued.\n\nThat ruling \"significantly altered both access to reproductive health care services and how providers are able to treat pregnancy complications in the 21 states that ban or restrict abortion access,\" the report authors wrote.\n\nStates with the most restrictive abortion policies, including Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia, scored lowest in the new report. States that protected abortion care, including Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey, ranked highest.\n\nInsurance status also mattered: Women in states that had not expanded Medicaid coverage were the most affected.\n\n\"It's hard to stress how critical a source of coverage Medicaid is for pregnant women,\" David Radley, senior scientist for the Commonwealth Fund, said during the briefing, NBC News reported.\n\nMore from this section Doctors Explain Cameron County Alert: Young Adults Face Silent Sleep-Related Heart Threat.

Doctors Reveal How Sleep Apnea Harms Your Heart\n\nReasons for the disparity are twofold, Collins noted. Women living in the lowest-ranking states are less likely to have health insurance and, even if they do, there aren't enough ob/gyns to take care of them.\n\nWhy? Doctors specializing in obstetrics and gynecology are either leaving states with abortion restrictions or aren't going there in the first place, experts said.\n\n\"It's not surprising that states with the most abortion restrictions or women's health policy restrictions are the same states that are having a real dearth of women's health workforce,\" Dr. Deborah Bartz, an ob/gyn at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, told NBC News. \"People are leaving those states because they can no longer provide the best care for their patients.\"\n\nThat leaves many women stranded when it comes to reproductive care, experts said.\n\n\"Your zip code shouldn't dictate your reproductive health destiny,\" Dr. Jonas Swartz, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke Health in North Carolina, told NBC News. \"But that is the reality.\"\n\nMore information\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute has more on abortion policies in U.S. states.\n\nSOURCES: Commonwealth Fund, report, July 18, 2024; NBC News\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nThe Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v.

The national average is 78.9 providers per 100,000 women.\n\nThe state also ranked second to last in infant mortality with a rate of 8.6 deaths per 100,000 live births. The national average is 5.4.\n\nThe report uses 32 measures to evaluate each state on health care access, affordability, quality of care and health outcomes for U.S. women. Arkansas ranked 50 on health and reproductive care outcomes, 48 on health care quality and prevention, and 35 on coverage, access and affordability.\n\nThe study includes data from 2022, the same year the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which will provide \"a vital baseline for tracking the ripple effects of the decision and impacts of new policy restrictions on reproductive care,\" Commonwealth Fund President Joseph Betancourt told reporters during a call Wednesday.\n\n\"Women's health in the U.S. is in a very fragile state,\" Betancourt said. \"There are stark disparities in women's access to quality health care among states across racial, ethnic and socioeconomic lines. These inequities are longstanding, no doubt, but recent policy choices and judicial decisions restricting access to reproductive care have and may continue to exacerbate them.\"\n\nThe highest maternal mortality rates are found in the Mississippi Delta, which includes Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee, four states that had abortion restrictions prior to the Dobbs decision and now have abortion bans. The exact correlation between abortion bans and maternal mortality is still being studied.\n\nSeveral counties in these states lack a single hospital or birth center with obstetric providers offering obstetric care. States with abortion restrictions tend to have fewer maternity care providers, according to the report.\n\nAbortion has been illegal in Arkansas except to save the life of the pregnant person since 2022. Secretary of State John Thurston disqualified a proposed constitutional amendment to expand abortion access last week, but the group backing the ballot initiative filed a lawsuit Tuesday that asks the state Supreme Court to overturn Thurston's rejection.\n\nStates in the Mississippi Delta rank low on other potential contributors to maternal mortality, including high rates of low-risk cesarean births, high uninsured rates prior to pregnancy and low rates of postpartum depression screening.\n\nArkansas Rep. Aaron Pilkington, R-Knoxville, sponsored a law during the 2023 legislative session that requires physicians to offer postpartum depression screenings to new mothers and requires Medicaid to cover the screenings. He also sponsored a law requiring Medicaid depression screenings for women during pregnancy.\n\nAdditionally, Pilkington led an unsuccessful attempt to expand postpartum Medicaid coverage. Arkansas is one of three states that has not taken advantage of the federal option to extend postpartum Medicaid coverage from 60 days to 12 months after birth.\n\nAfter receiving criticism for saying the expanded coverage is unnecessary due to the state's exciting insurance programs that cover pregnancy care, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in March created a committee tasked with developing a plan for bolstering maternal health in the state.\n\nSara Collins, lead author of the Commonwealth Fund report, said the expansion of postpartum Medicaid coverage has provided a huge improvement in coverage for pregnant women. Uninsured rates tend to be high for women before they become pregnant in states that haven't expanded Medicaid, she said.\n\n\"It means that women enter their pregnancy having had less access to health care, particularly if they're poor or low-income, and probably a much less poorer health situation then they would have been had they had health insurance coverage,\" Collins said. \"It's pretty clear that having health insurance that's adequate, that covers your costs is really necessary to access the health care system.\"\n\nCollins noted that \"insurance coverage is necessary, but it's not sufficient\" without having other things in place, such as access to providers and good networks, as well as the ability to get health care in a timely fashion.\n\n\"We're seeing in states where we have abortion restrictions or abortion bans, just generally fewer providers enabling people to get the health care that they need,\" she said. \"So it's coverage, but it's also the type of coverage you have and the ability to access the providers with that coverage.\"\n\nFor all Arkansas' struggles, the study found that the state performed best on the percent of women ages 18 to 44 without a usual source of care (15%), women with a recent live birth without health insurance coverage during their pregnancy (1.4%) and women ages 18 to 44 who reported not visiting a doctor for a routine checkup in the past two years (13%).\n\nBased on their findings, the report's authors suggested as policy considerations things that worked well in high-performing states, including investing in health insurance coverage for nearly all residents and making reproductive health care legal and accessible.\n\nHigher-ranked states also achieved lower maternal mortality rates with more maternal health workers, more prenatal and postpartum checkups, and higher rates of postpartum screening.\n\n\"My hope is that policymakers can use these findings to identify and address gaps in care, guaranteeing that all women across the United States can live healthy lives with access to quality, affordable care no matter where they live or what their background is,\" Betancourt said.\n\nArkansas Advocate is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

Wade Has Made Access to Ob/Gyns Tougher in Many States: Report", "body": "THURSDAY, July 18, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- Ever since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, even more women have struggled to find reproductive care, a new report warns.\n\nIssued Thursday by the Commonwealth Fund, the report shows that women living in states long plagued by health disparities -- particularly in the Southeast -- have been harmed the most. And it isn't just about being able to afford care: women in these areas are less likely to be able to even find an ob/gyn in their area.\n\nSome of the statistics were particularly grim: In 2022, women living in more than one-third of U.S. counties had little or no access to maternity care.\n\n\"Women's health is in a very fragile place,\" lead report author Sara Collins said during a Wednesday media briefing, NBC News reported. \"Our health system is failing women of reproductive age, especially women of color and low-income women.\"\n\nThose inequities are not new, Commonwealth Fund President Dr. Joseph Betancourt noted during the briefing, \"but recent policy choices and judicial decisions restricting access to reproductive care have and may continue to exacerbate them.\"\n\nThe report weighed a dozen measures of women's health care, including maternal mortality, preterm birth and postpartum depression, in all 50 states in 2022, the year the Dobbs ruling was issued.\n\nThat ruling \"significantly altered both access to reproductive health care services and how providers are able to treat pregnancy complications in the 21 states that ban or restrict abortion access,\" the report authors wrote.\n\nStates with the most restrictive abortion policies, including Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia, scored lowest in the new report. States that protected abortion care, including Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey, ranked highest.\n\nInsurance status also mattered: Women in states that had not expanded Medicaid coverage were the most affected.\n\n\"It's hard to stress how critical a source of coverage Medicaid is for pregnant women,\" David Radley, senior scientist for the Commonwealth Fund, said during the briefing, NBC News reported.\n\nReasons for the disparity are twofold, Collins noted. Women living in the lowest-ranking states are less likely to have health insurance and, even if they do, there aren't enough ob/gyns to take care of them.\n\nWhy? Doctors specializing in obstetrics and gynecology are either leaving states with abortion restrictions or aren't going there in the first place, experts said.\n\n\"It's not surprising that states with the most abortion restrictions or women's health policy restrictions are the same states that are having a real dearth of women's health workforce,\" Dr. Deborah Bartz, an ob/gyn at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, told NBC News. \"People are leaving those states because they can no longer provide the best care for their patients.\"\n\nThat leaves many women stranded when it comes to reproductive care, experts said.\n\n\"Your zip code shouldn't dictate your reproductive health destiny,\" Dr. Jonas Swartz, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke Health in North Carolina, told NBC News. \"But that is the reality.\"", "source": {"uri": "healthday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "healthday.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robin_foster@healthday.com", "name": "Robin Foster", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

But Wisconsin's record is considerably worse on reproductive health care outcomes, the report's authors find, ranking 23 out of 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe findings are in the 2024 State Scorecard on Women's Health and Reproductive Care produced by the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit research and policy organization focusing on improving health care access, quality and efficiency, particularly for the most vulnerable: people of color, people with low incomes and the uninsured. The report was released Thursday.\n\n\"Looking across states and comparing their health care systems is an important way of telling us what is and isn't working in American health care,\" said Sara R. Collins, the study's lead author and vice president for health care coverage and access at the Commonwealth Fund.\n\nThe data used to compile the report largely comes from 2021 and 2022 -- much of it from before the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, \"which has significantly altered access to critical reproductive health care services,\" the Commonwealth Fund announcement of the report stated. Access to abortion care is a significant component of the Commonwealth Fund's assessment process.\n\n\"The scorecard's findings are deeply concerning and underscore the urgent need for federal and state policies to expand women's access to affordable, timely reproductive care and other essential health services, regardless of who they are, what they earn, or where they live,\" Collins said.\n\nThe report's scorecard ranks Mississippi, Texas, Nevada, Oklahoma and Arkansas at or near the bottom for their overall performance on access, quality and outcomes in women's health care. The highest ranking states are Massachusetts, Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New Hampshire.\n\n\"It is disheartening to see the rising disparities in women's health across the nation,\" said Dr. Laurie C. Zephyrin, the study's coauthor and Commonwealth Fund senior vice president for advancing health equity.\n\n\"Our country's fractured landscape of reproductive health access will make it even more difficult to close these widening gaps, especially for women with low incomes and women of color in states with restricted access to reproductive care,\" Zephyrin said. \"Instead of limiting care, federal and state policymakers should work to ensure that women have access to the full continuum of care throughout their lives.\"\n\nThe report evaluates states on 32 data indicators: 12 for health outcomes, eight for coverage, access and affordability and 12 for health care quality and prevention.\n\nWisconsin ranked No. 4 on measures of health care quality and prevention in the report, which highlighted the state's record for use of preventive care, care for women before and after giving birth and mental health screening.\n\nThe state ranks 16 for coverage, access and affordability, boosted by relatively high levels of insurance coverage among other factors.\n\nOn health and reproductive care outcomes, however, Wisconsin ranks 23. While that is lower than the state's rank on other categories, the state's standing was helped by lower rates of maternal mortality and mortality from all causes, among other factors.\n\nThursday's report does not break out maternal mortality rates by race, but other research has shown that maternal death rates in Wisconsin are much higher for Black patients than for white patients.\n\nBecause the data was collected before the 2022 abortion ruling, the report also doesn't take into account the fact that Wisconsin lost all abortion care for about a year and a half. Services were restored earlier in 2024, but access is limited to three clinics statewide.\n\nWisconsin has especially high rates of up-to-date screening for colon cancer and breast cancer and a low rate of births in which parents had to pay out of pocket, according to the report, all beneficial to the state's overall ranking.\n\nThe state performed worse compared to other states in the number of adult women reporting poor mental health (ranking 39), in the number of abortion clinics relative to the population of women ages 15 to 44 (ranking 40), and in the number of adult women who have ever been tested for HIV or AIDS (ranking 43).", "source": {"uri": "urbanmilwaukee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Urban Milwaukee"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erik_gunn@urbanmilwaukee.com", "name": "Erik Gunn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_and_reproductive_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual and reproductive health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes_region", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Lakes region"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance_coverage_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance coverage in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Overall, Florida has a higher than the U.S. average rate of women who lack insurance, die while pregnant, give birth without prenatal care, and succumb to breast and cervical cancer.\n\n\"Our hope is that state policymakers can use this scorecard to identify and address gaps in care to guarantee that all women across the United States can live healthy lives with access to quality, affordable care, no matter where they live or what their background is,\" said Joseph Betancourt, Commonwealth Fund president.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns highlighted in Florida's low ranking is its high rate of uninsured women ages 19-64. It is one of 10 states that have not expanded eligibility for Medicaid and has had a problematic unwinding of pandemic-era Medicaid coverage that has left thousands of women either newly uninsured or with significant gaps in their coverage. Women in states like Florida that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility report skipping health care at higher rates than in states with expanded eligibility. The scorecard shows 22% of women ages 18-44 reported a time in the past 12 months when they needed to see a doctor but could not because of cost.\n\n\"One out of six women in Florida lacks health insurance,\" said David Radley, senior scientist, Tracking Health System Performance, The Commonwealth Fund. He notes the state also has a high percentage of women who don't have a primary care doctor. A regular provider can help manage chronic medical conditions, conduct screenings and test for diseases.\n\n\"To me. the takeaway is if you can get access into the health care delivery system in Florida, you can probably get pretty good care. But if you can't get access, you are going to feel it in your health and life expectancy. If you don't have that doctor to go to who understands your circumstances, you are not as likely to get the things you need to help you live a long life,\" Radley said.\n\nOverall, the scorecard's findings raise concerns over the ripple effects of the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and the access to reproductive health care services. A recent South Florida Sun Sentinel series, Born to Die, found expecting mothers in Florida, particularly those without insurance, are foregoing prenatal care leading to high rates of infant deaths and premature births.\n\nHighlights from the Scorecard include various health trends that affect women's care in Florida:\n\n*States like Florida with abortion restrictions tend to have fewer maternity care providers. Several dozen hospitals in Florida already have closed their labor and delivery units.\n\n*Women of reproductive age in states like Florida that had not expanded Medicaid eligibility were most at risk of going without coverage, as well as skipping needed care because of cost.\n\n*Nearly all states have witnessed an upward trend in syphilis among women of reproductive age since 2019. Florida's rate is higher than the national average.\n\n*Rates of maternal deaths are highest in the Mississippi Delta region, which includes Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee. All four states had abortion restrictions prior to the Supreme Court overturning the constitutional right to an abortion, and they all now have full abortion bans. Florida's strict six-week abortion ban went into effect on May 1. It is too early to measure how it could affect rates of maternal death.\n\n*Deaths among women ages 15 to 44 were highest in southeastern states (which includes Florida). Top causes of death included preventable factors such as pregnancy complications, substance use, COVID-19, and breast or cervical cancer. Death rates from all causes per 100,000 women of reproductive age ranged from 70.5 in Hawaii to 203.6 in West Virginia. Florida's death rate is 114.\n\n\"Overall, there are mounting disparities in women's health and reproductive care across the United States,\" Radley said. \"Some states have built the policies up in ways to enable access to healthcare and some haven't. Florida is a state that has a large low-income population and a lot of people with no health insurance. And, they are less likely to get the care they want or need going forward. What we are finding is the state of healthcare for women is in a fragile place.\"", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.arcamax.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Mississippi has the highest infant mortality rate in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund has been ranking states' health care coverage since 2006. Since 2020, Texas's overall ranking on the Commonwealth Fund's state-by-state scorecard has steadily declined.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year was the first time the foundation began including women's health care in its analysis.

Jackson Women's Health Organization in June 2022, which left the right to abortion up to individual states.\n\n\"There are stark disparities in women's access to quality health care amongst states across racial, ethnic and socioeconomic lines,\" Betancourt said. \"These inequities are long-standing, no doubt, but recent policy choices and judicial decisions restricting access to reproductive care have and may continue to exacerbate this.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince last year, Texas has moved down a ranking for women's health, moving to the penultimate slot after New Mexico jumped from last to 41st. Since the Dobbs ruling, women have begun flocking to New Mexico for safe and legal abortion care because the state's abortion laws are considered among the most permissive in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTexas' current abortion ban, which is the result of a trigger law that went into effect in August 2022, is one of the most restrictive in the country and does not include exceptions for rape or incest. The national rate for abortion clinics per 100,000 women is 1.5. In Texas, it's 0.\n\nDavid Radley, senior scientist at the Commonwealth Fund who tracks health system performance, said based on the foundation's findings, states with the most restrictive abortion policies -- including Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Idaho -- also have the fewest obstetric and maternity care providers.\n\n\"In fact, there's concern that abortion bans or limits will further reduce the number of providers offering maternity care,\" Radley said, pointing to the increased risk of legal action many providers face, especially when state's abortion laws are ambiguous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTexas also has the highest number of uninsured women in the country, with a rate more than double that of the nation's average. Twenty-seven percent of women in Texas went without medical treatment or care in 2022 due to cost barriers, 10 points above the national rate of 17%.\n\nPhilip Huang, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services, said the state's trend is mirrored locally. Huang pointed to 2022 data that showed 21.6% of Dallas County residents are without health insurance.\n\n\"We have some of the higher uninsured rates in North Texas,\" Huang said. \"Texas is one of the lowest in the country in terms of insurance. We don't have Medicaid expansion or anything, but the lack of insurance is certainly one of the factors for all of us in Texas.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQiana Arnold, a birth justice program associate at The Afiya Center for reproductive justice, said, \"Lack of access in Texas is nothing new.\"\n\n\"We live in a state that we've been fighting for years for Medicaid expansion,\" said Arnold, who works primarily with women who are either low-income or uninsured. \"It definitely exacerbates the poor state of women's health.\"\n\nAbortion access advocates like The Afiya Center work with fear of legal repercussions, towing the balance between expanding women's access to reproductive care and navigating a complex legal terrain.\n\n\"There are some levels like aiding and abetting ... and for a Black woman, it could change their life,\" Arnold said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArnold and Huang both noted many women in Dallas are often forced to seek necessary medical treatment in urgent care facilities or emergency rooms, which leads to higher fees.\n\n\"Definitely the uninsured and lower-income population that we have in Dallas County are less likely to have, like usual sources of care, so they wind up going to emergency rooms or things like that, which aren't good for continuity and quality of care,\" Huang said.\n\nHuang said the county is actively working to mitigate women's health care gaps, specifically maternal health. Before Huang's arrival five years ago, the department lacked a program dedicated to maternal and child health.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We brought on a new medical director to try to build that program,\" he said. \"We just got awarded funding for the Healthy Start program, which is a first for us. We're trying to do more services in maternal-child health, so it's sort of a new area for us at the Dallas County Health Department.\"\n\nThe Healthy Start program will afford people greater access to prenatal care and link them to services after birth, which Huang said has been shown to improve maternal outcomes and decrease emergency department visits for children.\n\nHuang said the county's new developments in maternal health will lead to a higher quality of data in an area that had previously been out of focus, which he hopes will improve the state of women's health in North Texas.\n\nSara Collins, the lead author of the Commonwealth Fund's study, said the state of women's health in Texas and nationwide is largely the product of policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"States that haven't fully expanded Medicaid ... and states that have imposed abortion restrictions in the wake of the Dobbs decision ... are having an impact on women's access to health care,\" she said.\n\nWomen's health care, Collins said, is inextricably tied to politics.", "source": {"uri": "dallasnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Dallas Morning News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwifery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwifery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_mortality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infant mortality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Mississippi was the only state with worse health outcomes.\n\nTexas has one of the strictest abortion laws in the country, banning the procedure in nearly all circumstances unless a doctor believes it's necessary to save the life or protect the health of the pregnant patient.\n\nDr. David Radley helped collect and interpret data for the Commonwealth Fund study. He says states with the most restrictive abortion policies -- like Texas, Oklahoma and Mississippi -- also have the fewest obstetric and maternity care providers.\n\n\"There's concern that abortion bans or limits will further reduce the number of providers offering maternity care owing to increased risk of legal action that providers face, especially when state laws are ambiguous,\" Radley said.\n\nA report from the March of Dimes found 46% of counties in the state are defined as maternity care deserts, meaning those counties have no maternity care centers or obstetricians. People seeking care have to travel an average of 30 miles to find a doctor in a maternity care desert, with some traveling up to 70 miles to find the nearest birthing hospital.\n\nIt's not just providers that are hard to access in Texas. According to the report, the state also ranked last in the country for health care access and affordability. The study found 22% of Texas women between the ages of 15-44 don't have health care coverage and 27% haven't seen a doctor when they needed to because they couldn't afford it.\n\nPregnant women are generally eligible for Medicaid in Texas, but Sara Collins, study author and vice president of the Commonwealth Fund, says that often doesn't make up for years without insurance.\n\n\"It means that women enter their pregnancy having had less access to health care, particularly if they're poor or low income, and in a poorer health situation than they would have been in had they had health insurance coverage,\" Collins said.\n\nRadley says those disparities in access to insurance and care are part of the reason Texas has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the country.\n\n\"We know from other research and reporting that inadequate access to health services before, during and after pregnancy, combined with disparities in socioeconomic status, underlying health and quality of care, have helped to drive the maternal mortality rate in the US higher than that of other high income countries,\" Radley said.\n\nGot a tip?

Andrew Harnik / Getty Images file\n\nThe chances that a woman can see a doctor while pregnant -- or during a time when she might become pregnant -- have fallen significantly since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, according to a new report released Thursday.\n\nThe findings, from The Commonwealth Fund, a nonpartisan health care research foundation, show that women living in states with a history of health disparities -- often in the Southeast -- are affected the most. They are not only less likely to be able to afford a doctor's appointment; they're less likely to be able to find an OB/GYN in their area.\n\n\"These inequities are long-standing, no doubt,\" Dr. Joseph Betancourt, president of The Commonwealth Fund, said during a media briefing Wednesday to discuss the report. \"But recent policy choices and judicial decisions restricting access to reproductive care have and may continue to exacerbate them.\"\n\nThe report looked at more than a dozen measures of women's health care, including maternal mortality, preterm birth and postpartum depression, in all 50 states in 2022, the year of the Dobbs ruling.\n\nThat single action \"significantly altered both access to reproductive health care services and how providers are able to treat pregnancy complications in the 21 states that ban or restrict abortion access,\" the authors wrote.\n\nStates with the most restrictive abortion policies, including Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia, scored lowest in the new report. States that protected abortion care, including Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey, ranked highest.\n\nWomen in states that had not expanded Medicaid coverage were most affected.\n\n\"Women's health is in a very fragile place,\" said lead author Sara Collins, vice president for health care coverage and access and tracking health system performance at The Commonwealth Fund. \"Our health system is failing women of reproductive age, especially women of color and low-income women.\"\n\nReasons for the disparity are twofold, Collins said. Women living in the lowest-ranking states are less likely to have health insurance to afford doctor's visits. And even if they can, there aren't enough OB/GYNs to take care of them.\n\nThat is, doctors specializing in obstetrics and gynecology are either leaving states with abortion restrictions or aren't going there in the first place, experts said.\n\nA 2023 survey of third- and fourth-year medical students found, for example, that such laws were a major deterrent in applying for residency programs in those states.\n\n\"It's not surprising that states with the most abortion restrictions or women's health policy restrictions are the same states that are having a real dearth of women's health workforce,\" said Dr. Deborah Bartz, an OB/GYN at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. \"People are leaving those states because they can no longer provide the best care for their patients.\"\n\nStates that expanded Medicaid coverage had higher performances overall, according to the Commonwealth report.\n\n\"It's hard to stress how critical a source of coverage Medicaid is for pregnant women,\" said David Radley, senior scientist for the Commonwealth Fund during Wednesday's briefing.\n\n\"Your zip code shouldn't dictate your reproductive health destiny,\" said Dr. Jonas Swartz, assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke Health in Durham, North Carolina. \"But that is the reality.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maternal death"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Preterm birth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Both women were unable to terminate pregnancies with fatal diagnoses in Texas.\n\nWomen in Texas receive less quality health care than in other states, according to a new report released Thursday.\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit foundation that focuses on health care, ranked Texas 50th overall, out of the 50 states plus Washington, D.C., in its first rankings of women's health care. Only Mississippi had a worse ranking.\n\nIn the big categories, Texas ranked 51st on coverage, access and affordability metrics; 49th in health care quality and prevention; and 38th on health and reproductive care outcomes such as infant mortality, maternal mortality and postpartum depression.\n\n\"Where a woman lives matters,\" said David Radley, a senior scientist at the Commonwealth Fund. The 13 states with the worst rankings were the states that had the strictest abortion access policies, he said. \"They tended to receive lower quality of care.\"\n\nStates that did do well include Massachusetts, Vermont, Rhode Island and Connecticut. Those states invest in health insurance for almost al its residents, made reproductive health care legal and accessible, and had more maternal health workers, more prenatal and postpartum checkups, and higher rates of postpartum depression screenings.\n\nRead more: Provisional data show sharp increase in Texas maternal deaths in 2020 and 2021\n\nWhat are the differences in access to care?\n\nTexas ranked 51st on women ages 18-44 who went without care because of cost. \"Women's inability to afford needed health care is most pronounced in states that have not expanded Medicaid,\" Radley said. Texas is one of those states.\n\n\"We know that people who are uninsured use about half the care as people who are insured,\" said Sara Collins, a senior scholar at the foundation.\n\nWhile this March, Texas extended Medicaid coverage for women up to 12 months after giving birth instead of two months, Texas women are expected to still have worse birth and postpartum outcomes than the national average because women enter pregnancy with less access to health care and in a worse health situation than if they had insurance coverage before pregnancy, Collins said.\n\nHow were the rankings determined?\n\nTo get the rankings, the foundation analyzed 32 metrics from 2021 and 2022, mostly from public data such as government-sponsored surveys, registries, vital statistics and mortality data and publicly reported quality measures.\n\nTexas does not participate in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, which means that Texas didn't receives scores in some of the categories related to pregnant women and postpartum care.\n\nHow did abortion access change women's health?\n\nThe foundation also saw a link between restricted abortion access and less maternity providers.\n\nTexas ranked 51st in abortion clinics (with no clinics available) and ranked 44th in maternity care providers per 100,000 women ages 15-44.\n\nResearchers saw a clear pattern in states with strict abortion access restrictions and medical residents choosing to train in those states.\n\nRead more: More infants have died since Texas anti-abortion heartbeat law took effect, study shows\n\nDid Texas do well in any health measures?\n\nTexas did do well, or at least was ranked in the middle, in mortality rate of women from all causes (rank 15th), infant mortality rate (22nd) and women being up-to-date with cervical cancer screenings (27th).\n\nThe foundation will update the rankings in coming years and will be studying to see how states' handling of the Dobbs Supreme Court abortion decision continues to impact access to medical care and providers.", "source": {"uri": "eu.statesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA TODAY"}, "authors":

Overall, Florida has a higher than the U.S. average rate of women who lack insurance, die while pregnant, give birth without prenatal care, and succumb to breast and cervical cancer.\n\n\"Our hope is that state policymakers can use this scorecard to identify and address gaps in care to guarantee that all women across the United States can live healthy lives with access to quality, affordable care, no matter where they live or what their background is,\" said Joseph Betancourt, Commonwealth Fund president.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns highlighted in Florida's low ranking is its high rate of uninsured women ages 19-64. It is one of 10 states that have not expanded eligibility for Medicaid and has had a problematic unwinding of pandemic-era Medicaid coverage that has left thousands of women either newly uninsured or with significant gaps in their coverage.\n\nWomen in states like Florida that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility report skipping health care at higher rates than in states with expanded eligibility. The scorecard shows 22% of women ages 18-44 reported a time in the past 12 months when they needed to see a doctor but could not because of cost.\n\n\"One out of six women in Florida lacks health insurance,\" said David Radley, senior scientist, Tracking Health System Performance, The Commonwealth Fund. He notes the state also has a high percentage of women who don't have a primary care doctor. A regular provider can help manage chronic medical conditions, conduct screenings and test for diseases.\n\n\"To me, the takeaway is if you can get access into the health care delivery system in Florida, you can probably get pretty good care. But if you can't get access, you are going to feel it in your health and life expectancy. If you don't have that doctor to go to who understands your circumstances, you are not as likely to get the things you need to help you live a long life,\" Radley said.\n\nOverall, the scorecard's findings raise concerns over the ripple effects of the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and the access to reproductive health care services. A recent South Florida Sun Sentinel series, Born to Die, found expecting mothers in Florida, particularly those without insurance, are foregoing prenatal care leading to high rates of infant deaths and premature births.\n\nHighlights from the Scorecard include various health trends that affect women's care in Florida:\n\n\"Overall, there are mounting disparities in women's health and reproductive care across the United States,\" Radley said.\n\n\"Some states have built the policies up in ways to enable access to health care and some haven't. Florida is a state that has a large low-income population and a lot of people with no health insurance. And, they are less likely to get the care they want or need going forward. What we are finding is the state of health care for women is in a fragile place.\"\n\n2024 South Florida Sun Sentinel.

Overall, Florida has a higher than the U.S. average rate of women who lack insurance, die while pregnant, give birth without prenatal care, and succumb to breast and cervical cancer.\n\n\"Our hope is that state policymakers can use this scorecard to identify and address gaps in care to guarantee that all women across the United States can live healthy lives with access to quality, affordable care, no matter where they live or what their background is,\" said Joseph Betancourt, Commonwealth Fund president.\n\nBorn to die: Florida's infant mortality crisis | A special report\n\nOne of the biggest concerns highlighted in Florida's low ranking is its high rate of uninsured women ages 19-64. It is one of 10 states that have not expanded eligibility for Medicaid and has had a problematic unwinding of pandemic-era Medicaid coverage that has left thousands of women either newly uninsured or with significant gaps in their coverage. Women in states like Florida that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility report skipping health care at higher rates than in states with expanded eligibility. The scorecard shows 22% of women ages 18-44 reported a time in the past 12 months when they needed to see a doctor but could not because of cost.\n\n\"One out of six women in Florida lacks health insurance,\" said David Radley, senior scientist, Tracking Health System Performance, The Commonwealth Fund. He notes the state also has a high percentage of women who don't have a primary care doctor. A regular provider can help manage chronic medical conditions, conduct screenings and test for diseases.\n\n\"To me. the takeaway is if you can get access into the health care delivery system in Florida, you can probably get pretty good care. But if you can't get access, you are going to feel it in your health and life expectancy. If you dont have that doctor to go to who understands your circumstances, you are not as likely to get the things you need to help you live a long life,\" Radley said.\n\nOverall, the scorecard's findings raise concerns over the ripple effects of the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and the access to reproductive health care services. A recent South Florida Sun Sentinel series, Born to Die, found expecting mothers in Florida, particularly those without insurance, are foregoing prenatal care leading to high rates of infant deaths and premature births.\n\nHighlights from the Scorecard include various health trends that affect women's care in Florida:\n\n\"Overall, there are mounting disparities in women's health and reproductive care across the United States,\" Radley said. \"Some states have built the policies up in ways to enable access to healthcare and some haven't. Florida is a state that has a large low-income population and a lot of people with no health insurance. And, they are less likely to get the care they want or need going forward. What we are finding is the state of heathcare for women is in a fragile place.\"", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SunSentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cindy_krischer_goodman@sun-sentinel.com", "name": "Cindy Krischer Goodman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cervical cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medicaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complications_of_pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Complications of pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Health_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Center for Health Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_South_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life expectancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prenatal care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_mortality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infant mortality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_condition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chronic condition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preterm birth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primary care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

By contrast, Mississippi, with less supportive policies, reported 44.6 maternal deaths per 100,000 births.\n\nThe report uncovered some striking differences in cancer outcomes for women of color compared to white women.\n\nBlack women were more likely to be up-to-date on screening tests for breast cancer than white women, but less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer and more likely to die from the disease compared to white women.\n\nBlack women were also less likely to receive follow up care and received poorer quality of care after an abnormal test, and they were often diagnosed at later stages of the disease, the report found.\n\nAdditionally, women of color were also more likely to die from cervical cancer White women in the U.S.\n\nA 2022 Gynecologic Oncology Reports study backs up this assertion. It found that follow-up care after abnormal cervical cancer screening is lacking for all races, but Black women are the least likely to get timely care. A quarter of Hispanic and Black women experienced delays in follow-up, the study found.\n\nThe report's big takeaway: Improved health policies mean equitable care for all women.\n\nRadley said the Commonwealth Fund plans to track women's health amid changing legislation and policies.\n\n\"While this is the first edition of the Women's and Reproductive Health Scorecard, we expect to update this report over time to track how state policy actions, specifically how new restrictions on access to abortion services, impact women's health and the care they receive,\" Radley said.", "source":

Nevada health care workers also ranked better on maternal mortality per 100,000 live births.\n\nNevada performed worse with women ages 18-44 who have not had a routine checkup in the past two years or who went without medical care because of the cost. Nevada also performed worst on women with up-to-date cancer screenings.\n\nBetancourt said \"the scorecard's findings are deeply concerning and underscore the urgent need for federal and state policies to expand women's access to affordable, timely reproductive care and other essential health services, regardless of who they are, what they earn, or where they live.\"\n\nAdditional Nevada rankings from the report include:", "source": {"uri": "thenevadaindependent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thenevadaindependent.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Healthcare in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_screening", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer screening"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maternal death"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AIDS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HIV"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Menopause", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Menopause", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenevadaindependent.com/2023/05/WOMENS CLINIC 2-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742989", "eventUri": "eng-9742989", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Wade \"has further fractured women's health care access and dramatically affected the ability of providers to treat pregnancy complications.\"\n\nThose changes are important for Arizonan women, as the state also ranks 49th in the country for infants born with congenital syphilis per 100,000 live births, the study found. The state ranks 45th for the rate of women ages 15-44 per 100,000 female population to have syphilis, as well.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nPart of that could be due to the state's low ranking for health insurance coverage. Arizona ranks 44th in the country for the percentage of women aged 19-64 without health insurance coverage, with 13% not being covered.\n\nMore than that, however, 32% of women ages 18-44 did not have one or more person they thought of as their personal health-care provider. That puts Arizona at 49th in the country for that category.\n\n\"It serves as a glaring reminder that where you live matters to your health and health care,\" Commonwealth Fund President Betancourt said. \"While some states undoubtedly are championing women's continued access to vital health and reproductive services, many others are failing to ensure that women can get and afford the health care they need.\"\n\nTypically, the top performing states tended to be in the northeast, with Massachusetts, Vermont and Rhode Island finishing on top. The fund found that typically, areas with stricter abortion bans, such as the south, tended to score worse on most women's health rankings. Mississippi, the state where the U.S. Supreme Court case to overturn Roe v. Wade originated from, ranked last on the list.\n\n\"Women (in southern states) tend to experience worse health outcomes on average, had less access to care and reproductive health services than in other states and tended to receive lower quality care,\" said David Radley, a senior scientist with the Commonwealth Fund.\n\nArizona currently has a 15-week abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest. While that isn't the strictest law in the nation -- some states have six-week restrictions -- it seems to have brought the state down in quality of care, according to the study.\n\n\"Tighter limits and additional bans on abortion are certain to drive more maternal and reproductive health care providers to shut down or leave their states, deepening the crisis of access to maternity care,\" the report says. \"Abortion bans threaten American's future access to care across all medical specialties.\"\n\nSubscribe to stay connected to Tucson.

The state got low marks for health care affordability and access.\n\nWomen in Kansas have a harder time accessing and affording health care than in most other states, according to a new report by the Commonwealth Fund.\n\nThe report, published Thursday, ranked Kansas 32nd in the U.S. based on how well the state's health system works for women. It placed sixth out of seven states in the Plains region, ahead of Missouri.\n\nThe ranking by the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit foundation that researches health issues, is the organization's first report to focus exclusively on how all states and the District of Columbia fare on women's health and reproductive care outcomes.\n\nKansas scored worst on issues of health insurance coverage, provider accessibility and health care affordability.\n\nKansas women in their reproductive years, ages 18-44, were less likely to have health insurance than the same group nationwide. They were more likely to report not visiting a doctor for a routine checkup in the past two years. Women giving birth in Kansas hospitals are nearly twice as likely to have a self-pay insurance payment source than the national average.\n\nSara Collins, a senior scholar at the Commonwealth Fund and the study's lead author, said that reflects the state's failure to expand Medicaid.\n\nKansas is one of 10 states that still has not done so, despite consistent pressure by advocates and the state's Democratic governor. Republican lawmakers have resisted expansion, arguing in part that it would be too costly.\n\n\"We see a consistent pattern across these 10 states,\" Collins said. \"We see much higher rates of people not accessing care due to cost.\"\n\nAnd even though it's easier for women to qualify for Medicaid once they become pregnant -- the program pays for around 40% of births in the state -- Collins said the fact that many women lack insurance before getting pregnant can contribute to adverse maternal and infant health outcomes.\n\n\"It means that women enter pregnancy having had less access to health care, particularly if they're poor or low-income,\" she said, \"and probably (in a) a poorer health situation than they would be if they'd had health insurance coverage.\"\n\nKansas has among the lowest per-capita rates of maternity care providers in the country, a signal that many women may struggle to find care.\n\nKansas performed better on other metrics. It has slightly lower rates of maternal and infant mortality than the national average -- although the U.S. still performs worse than many other wealthy countries in these areas.\n\nKansas ranks near the top of U.S. states in early access to prenatal care, defined as within the first three months of pregnancy. Kansans were slightly less likely than women nationally to have cesarean sections for low-risk births, and slightly more likely to receive a postpartum checkup visit.\n\nDespite rising syphilis cases in Kansas and nationally, Kansas women aged 15-44 are significantly much less likely to contract syphilis than Americans overall, and infants are nearly three times less likely to be born with congenital syphilis than the U.S. average.\n\nKansas women are also more likely to receive certain preventive health services like flu and pneumonia shots.\n\nBut the state underperformed on other health outcomes. The mortality rate for women of reproductive age was higher than the national average, 121.7 per 100,000 women compared with 110.3 overall.\n\nKansas women who recently gave birth were more likely than Americans overall to report having depression before, during and after pregnancy. They were also more likely to experience intimate partner violence before or during pregnancy.\n\nThe state's mammogram rate was slightly under the national average: 74% of women ages 50-74 had received one in the past two years, compared with 77% nationally.\n\nResearchers analyzed data from 2022, the year that the U.S. Supreme Court issued its Dobbs decision that allowed states to curtail abortion access. In the two years since, 21 states have either banned abortion or restricted it earlier in pregnancy than was previously allowed.\n\nJoseph Betancourt, president of the Commonwealth Fund, said the analysis provides a \"baseline\" for tracking the impact of new abortion restrictions on women's health care.\n\n\"It also serves as a glaring reminder that where you live matters to your health and health care,\" he said. \"Many (states) are failing to ensure that women can get and afford the health care they need. This failure is having a disproportionate impact on women of color and women with low incomes.\"\n\nThe report found that Kansas has a higher ratio of abortion clinics for its population of reproductive-aged women than the U.S. average, emphasizing the state's increasingly prominent role as an abortion access point.\n\nMany women who now travel to Kansas for abortions come from the South and Southeast, regions that have some of the strictest abortion bans -- as well as poorer maternal health outcomes and high rates of maternal mortality.\n\nSince 2022, two new clinics providing abortions have opened in Kansas, and a third is expected to open this fall.

It placed sixth out of seven states in the Plains region, ahead of Missouri.\n\nThe ranking by the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit foundation that researches health issues, is the organization's first report to focus exclusively on how all states and the District of Columbia fare on women's health and reproductive care outcomes.\n\nAccess and affordability\n\nKansas scored worst on issues of health insurance coverage, provider accessibility and health care affordability.\n\nKansas women in their reproductive years, ages 18-44, were less likely to have health insurance than the same group nationwide. They were more likely to report not visiting a doctor for a routine checkup in the past two years. Women giving birth in Kansas hospitals are nearly twice as likely to have a self-pay insurance payment source than the national average.\n\nSara Collins, a senior scholar at the Commonwealth Fund and the study's lead author, said that reflects the state's failure to expand Medicaid.\n\nKansas is one of 10 states that still has not done so, despite consistent pressure by advocates and the state's Democratic governor. Republican lawmakers have resisted expansion, arguing in part that it would be too costly.\n\n\"We see a consistent pattern across these 10 states,\" Collins said. \"We see much higher rates of people not accessing care due to cost.\"\n\nAnd even though it's easier for women to qualify for Medicaid once they become pregnant -- the program pays for around 40% of births in the state -- Collins said the fact that many women lack insurance before getting pregnant can contribute to adverse maternal and infant health outcomes.\n\n\"It means that women enter pregnancy having had less access to health care, particularly if they're poor or low-income,\" she said, \"and probably (in a) a poorer health situation than they would be if they'd had health insurance coverage.\"\n\nKansas has among the lowest per-capita rates of maternity care providers in the country, a signal that many women may struggle to find care.\n\nQuality and prevention\n\nKansas performed better on other metrics. It has slightly lower rates of maternal and infant mortality than the national average -- although the U.S. still performs worse than many other wealthy countries in these areas.\n\nKansas ranks near the top of U.S. states in early access to prenatal care, defined as within the first three months of pregnancy. Kansans were slightly less likely than women nationally to have cesarean sections for low-risk births, and slightly more likely to receive a postpartum checkup visit.\n\nDespite rising syphilis cases in Kansas and nationally, Kansas women aged 15-44 are significantly much less likely to contract syphilis than Americans overall, and infants are nearly three times less likely to be born with congenital syphilis than the U.S. average.\n\nKansas women are also more likely to receive certain preventive health services like flu and pneumonia shots.\n\nBut the state underperformed on other health outcomes. The mortality rate for women of reproductive age was higher than the national average, 121.7 per 100,000 women compared with 110.3 overall.\n\nKansas women who recently gave birth were more likely than Americans overall to report having depression before, during and after pregnancy. They were also more likely to experience intimate partner violence before or during pregnancy.\n\nThe state's mammogram rate was slightly under the national average: 74% of women ages 50-74 had received one in the past two years, compared with 77% nationally.\n\nReproductive care\n\nResearchers analyzed data from 2022, the year that the U.S. Supreme Court issued its Dobbsdecision that allowed states to curtail abortion access. In the two years since, 21 states have either banned abortion or restricted it earlier in pregnancy than was previously allowed.\n\nJoseph Betancourt, president of the Commonwealth Fund, said the analysis provides a \"baseline\" for tracking the impact of new abortion restrictions on women's health care.\n\n\"It also serves as a glaring reminder that where you live matters to your health and health care,\" he said. \"Many (states) are failing to ensure that women can get and afford the health care they need. This failure is having a disproportionate impact on women of color and women with low incomes.\"\n\nThe report found that Kansas has a higher ratio of abortion clinics for its population of reproductive-aged women than the U.S. average, emphasizing the state's increasingly prominent role as an abortion access point.\n\nMany women who now travel to Kansas for abortions come from the South and Southeast, regions that have some of the strictest abortion bans -- as well as poorer maternal health outcomes and high rates of maternal mortality.\n\nSince 2022, two new clinics providing abortions have opened in Kansas, and a third is expected to open this fall. A recent study by the Guttmacher Institute estimates that the number of abortions performed in Kansas rose from less than 8,000 in 2020 to around 20,000 in 2023, a 152% increase.\n\nRepublicans in the Kansas Legislature have passed several new laws in recent years aimed at further restricting access to abortion, although a number are tied up in court.

States that protected abortion care, including Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey, ranked highest.\n\n\"Women's health is in a very fragile place,\" said lead author Sara Collins, vice president for health care coverage and access and tracking health system performance at The Commonwealth Fund. \"Our health system is failing women of reproductive age, especially women of color and low-income women.\"\n\nReasons for the disparity are twofold, Collins said.

Mississippi has the highest infant mortality rate in the country. The Commonwealth Fund has been ranking states' health care coverage since 2006. Since 2020, Texas's overall ranking on the Commonwealth Fund's state-by-state scorecard has steadily declined. Last year was the first time the foundation began including women's health care in its analysis. This year, the foundation went further, producing scorecards specifically ranking women's health care by state.\n\n\"One thing is absolutely clear: Women's health in the U.S. is in a very fragile state,\" said Joseph Betancourt, president of the Commonwealth Fund. Texas ranked last for health care coverage, access and affordability for women in the U.S. The Commonwealth Fund's focus on women's health per state arose after the landmark Supreme Court ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization in June 2022, which left the right to abortion up to individual states. \"There are stark disparities in women's access to quality health care amongst states across racial, ethnic and socioeconomic lines,\" Betancourt said. \"These inequities are long-standing, no doubt, but recent policy choices and judicial decisions restricting access to reproductive care have and may continue to exacerbate this.\" Since last year, Texas has moved down a ranking for women's health, moving to the penultimate slot after New Mexico jumped from last to 41st. Since the Dobbs ruling, women have begun flocking to New Mexico for safe and legal abortion care because the state's abortion laws are considered among the most permissive in the country.", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dallas_Morning_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Dallas Morning News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_mortality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infant mortality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth of Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

The researchers said Black women are more likely to be up to date on their screenings than white women, but they see poorer outcomes and are more likely to die from the cancers. This could be due to poorer access to follow-up testing, poorer quality of care and a longer lag in abnormal mammograms to diagnostic follow-up.\n\nFinally, the report examined women's health in terms of health insurance coverage and how it affects healthcare affordability and access. Specifically, the Commonwealth Fund looked at insurance coverage, usual source of care, cost-related problems accessing healthcare and workforce capacity for reproductive healthcare delivery.\n\nVermont, the District of Columbia and Maine were the top-ranked states in this area, while Texas, Georgia and Nevada rounded out the bottom performers.\n\nNationally, the uninsured rate among women of reproductive age is high. Although aided by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), uninsured rates for women of reproductive age are still higher than for women ages 45 to 64, oscillating from 2.6% in Massachusetts to 22% in Texas.\n\nMeanwhile, challenges associated with accessing Medicaid coverage continue. Ten states have not expanded Medicaid, which is now allowable under the ACA. Additionally, issues for immigrants, limited awareness and Medicaid disenrollments get in the way.\n\nGaps in insurance coverage are reflected in limited access to certain types of healthcare. For example, in states that have not expanded Medicaid, women of reproductive age are more likely to skip necessary healthcare due to cost. This practice was most common in Texas, Nevada, Georgia, Oklahoma, Alabama, Wyoming, Florida, Mississippi, and South Carolina (all but Nevada and Oklahoma have declined Medicaid expansion).\n\nMedicaid plays a big role in access to maternity care. All state Medicaid programs are required to provide pregnancy-related coverage up to 138% of the federal poverty level, but most states set the threshold at 200%. States must also provide 60 days of postpartum coverage, although 47 states have extended this to 12 months.\n\nAll said, Medicaid covers 42% of births in the U.S. and two-thirds of births for Black and AI/AN people.\n\nHowever, the Commonwealth Fund indicated that this creates a gap in insurance access when a woman is and is not pregnant. Uninsured rates for pregnant women are markedly lower than they are for women before they become pregnant. This trend is pronounced in states that haven't expanded Medicaid, such as Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi and Tennessee.\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund also addressed workforce capacity in this report section, zeroing in on trends in maternity care providers. Previous reports have shown that maternity care deserts have become more common, in part due to the closure of birthing wards.\n\nThis report also found that abortion restrictions are linked to workforce issues. In particular, states with abortion restrictions have the fewest number of maternity care providers, potentially due to the risk providers face practicing reproductive healthcare in such states.\n\nOf the 24 states with abortion restrictions, gestational limits or pending legislation, 21 are in the bottom fifth of states with the fewest number of maternity care providers relative to the number of people who might need them.\n\n\"In 2023 and 2024, fewer medical school graduates applied to residency programs in states that banned abortion, both in obstetrics and gynecology and across all specialties, compared to states without bans,\" the report authors added. \"This is an ominous development for these states, where providers are already scarce.\"\n\nThe report authors stressed that there is more on the line in terms of women's health moving forward. Pending healthcare policy could affect access to in vitro fertilization, other types of reproductive healthcare and Medicaid access.\n\n\"The current and future policy environment could make those divides deeper still and weaken performance in even more states,\" the researchers concluded. \"Our findings suggest that urgent action by Congress and state policymakers is necessary to ensure women have timely access to complete health and reproductive care, regardless of who they are, what they earn, or where they live.\"", "source": {"uri": "techtarget.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

In Vermont, the top-ranked state, only 13% of women missed out on prenatal care during the early months of their pregnancies.\n\n\"Where you lives matters to your health and healthcare,\" said Joseph Betancourt, president of The Commonwealth Fund, which produced the report. \"While some states undoubtedly are championing women's continued access to vital health and reproductive services, many others are failing to ensure that women can get and afford the healthcare they need.\"\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund, a healthcare advocacy foundation, found that in the 10 states where Medicaid has not been expanded -- including Florida -- women struggle to pay for medical visits and often skip appointments because of cost.\n\nIn Florida, Medicaid, a state and federally funded program that provides healthcare coverage for low-income people, pays for up to 10 prenatal care visits.\n\nFlorida's lack of Medicaid expansion has left about 388,000 adults in a so-called coverage gap, meaning they would qualify if the program was expanded, according to medical non-profit the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nWomen in Florida were about 28% less likely to have health insurance than the national average, ranking 47th in that category. More than a fifth said they have skipped out on a doctor's appointment in the past year because they couldn't afford it, the report found.\n\nThe state ranked 51st out of the the 50 states and Washington, D.C. on percentage of women that missed early prenatal care.\n\nThe top three states with lowest death rate for mothers -- Vermont, California and Connecticut -- have all expanded Medicaid. Those states also reported more women who accessed care soon after they learned they were pregnant, the report noted.\n\nThe report was a scorecard that ranked the 50 states and D.C. on various aspects of women's health and reproductive care. It was the fund's first scorecard on women's healthcare. It was prompted by social and political events, including the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade, which limited abortion access across the country.\n\nThose same events put women's healthcare nationwide \"under threat,\" the report's authors concluded.\n\n\"Women's health in the U.S. is in a very fragile state,\" Betancourt said.\n\nBecause data for the report was gathered during the past three years, it doesn't entirely show the effects of the overturning of Roe v. Wade or more recent policies.

Here's why", "body": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- A comprehensive study released Thursday by the Commonwealth Fund, a health care equity nonprofit and research group, ranks Missouri and Kansas among the worst states in the nation for a variety of women's health metrics.\n\nMissouri is the seventh-worst state in the nation for women's health across many categories, including reproductive health care, mental health and mortality, the study found. Kansas is a little better, ranking the 20th worst for combined health outcomes.\n\nThe study also looked at factors including mental health, maternal mortality, syphilis rates and domestic violence. Here's how Missouri and Kansas fared.\n\nHow does Missouri rank on women's health care?\n\nMissouri's health and reproductive care outcomes are in the bottom fifth of states, ranking 43rd out of 50 states plus the District of Columbia. These factors include having the eighth-highest rates of death from breast cancer and cervical cancer, and the second-highest rates of poor mental health among adult women.\n\nAccording to the study's data, more than 1 in every 4 Missouri women between the ages of 18 and 64 reported \"14 or more poor mental health days in the past month.\" This persistently poor mental health can lead to other negative outcomes for Missouri women.\n\nMissouri was also the 11th worst out of 50 states plus the District of Columbia for supporting women's access to health care, the study found.\n\nOne in 10 Missouri women between the ages of 19 and 64 have no health insurance coverage, and nearly 1 in 5 in the 18-44 age range said they had skipped a necessary doctor's visit in the past year because they couldn't afford it.\n\nMissouri also has the sixth-lowest rate of Pap smears for adult women, which can be used to detect cervical cancer and other health issues before they become debilitating.\n\nWhile the study covers a wide variety of health issues, it places particular emphasis on reproductive and maternal health care. In this regard, it notes the effect of abortion bans in states like Missouri on broader women's health issues.\n\n\"Many experts are concerned that abortion bans or limits may inadvertently reduce the number of providers offering maternity care, owing to increased risk of legal action that practices face,\" the authors wrote.\n\nMissouri's near-total ban on abortion was implemented immediately after Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, but reports suggest thousands of residents have received abortions in other states.\n\nThe state has 74 maternity care providers per 100,000 women of childbearing age -- defined in the study as ages 15-44. That's lower than the national average of just under 79 providers.\n\nThe effects on pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum care are evident: Just under 29 women die during pregnancy for every 100,000 live births in the state, and 11% of babies are born prematurely.\n\nPregnant women in Missouri are also at a significantly higher risk of intimate partner violence than the national average, with 5.6% experiencing this abuse during pregnancy compared to 3.1% nationwide.\n\nHow does Kansas rank on women's health care?\n\nIn Kansas, women fare a little better than Missouri for health outcomes -- but are still worse than average on most metrics.\n\nWomen in Kansas have the 10th lowest health insurance rate in the country, with 12% of women ages 19-64 living without coverage. And 18% of women ages 18-44 have skipped an important doctor's appointment in the past year because they haven't been able to afford care.\n\nWomen in Kansas typically have low rates of syphilis infection and high rates of vaccination for the flu and pneumonia compared to the national average. The state also has slightly above the national average rate of abortion clinics available per 100,000 women. Kansas voters enshrined the right to abortion in the state's constitution in 2022, and the clinics often serve women from neighboring surrounding states where abortion is more restricted.\n\nHowever, maternal health care access in Kansas lags behind even Missouri in terms of available providers. The state has only around 67.6 providers per 100,000 women aged 15-44, compared to the national average of 78.9.\n\nOverall, Kansas ranked the second-worst for women's health care in the Great Plains region, which in this study included Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota. The only state below it was Missouri.", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.arcamax.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arcamax_publishing@m.arcamax.com", "name": "ArcaMax Publishing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cervical cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maternal death"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Syphilis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breast cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

The report ranks states based on 32 indicators, ranging from insurance coverage to breast and cervical cancer to Covid-19.\n\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island and Vermont ranked at the top across a range of health issues. South-eastern states - most of which now have near-total abortion bans - ranked at the bottom on a wide range of women's health indicators.\n\n\"Where you live matters to your health and healthcare,\" said Dr Joseph Betancourt, president of the Commonwealth Fund. \"This is having a disproportionate effect on women of color and women with low incomes.\"\n\nThe goal of the report was to contribute to policies, \"guaranteeing all women across the US can have access to quality affordable care - no matter where they live\".\n\nThe report largely relies on public data from 2022, a pivotal year in women's health, when the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade. For nearly 50 years, Roe v Wade provided a federal right to terminate a pregnancy. When the decision was overturned, regulation of abortion reverted to the states. Fourteen quickly issued near-total abortion bans, including many across the south-east.\n\nA map of the worst-performing states in the nation looks like a belt across the American south, stretching from Nevada to Florida and north to Tennessee. Notably, Nevada does not have an abortion ban, but tends to have worse health metrics because of a large, first-generation immigrant population.\n\n\"There are clear distinctions between states and delivery systems that perform well for women,\" said Sara Collins, a vice-president at Commonwealth and senior scholar studying healthcare access and quality.\n\nStates that tended to perform worst had not expanded Medicaid, a public health insurance for low-income Americans. They also tended to have fewer healthcare providers overall, particularly OB-GYNs. Those regional differences are likely to be exacerbated by abortion bans, which make it legally perilous for doctors to practice.\n\nDeaths from all causes were highest in south-eastern states - including from preventable causes such as substance use, Covid-19, pregnancy-related deaths and chronic treatable conditions.\n\nPoor performing states also tended to miss opportunities to identify and treat at-risk women. They screened fewer women for postpartum depression, had higher rates of syphilis and congenital syphilis (when the disease is passed to a baby) and higher rates of cancer. They had higher rates of cesarean births for low-risk pregnancies and the worst maternal mortality rates, with particularly stark disparities between Black and white women.\n\nAlso notable is how these trends have become more pronounced in the last four decades. In other reports, researchers have found health disparities shrank between the 1960s and 1980s. Now, worse health outcomes in the south form what some researchers call the \"multiples\" belt, where a laundry list of health outcomes are worse - from cancer to diabetes to HIV infection rates.\n\nStill, the prospects of state legislatures or Congress finding common ground to improve women's health look dim. Many of the issues most impactful to women's health are also the most politically contentious.\n\nFor instance, Republicans have actively sought abortion bans for decades and opposed the expansion of Medicaid since the Obama administration. Republicans have also undermined public health authorities, the sort of workers who are key to disrupting transmission of diseases such as syphilis.\n\nSome researchers, such as the health equity expert Daniel Dawes, have described these outcomes as the \"political determinants of health\" - in other words, the ways policy shapes the health and wellbeing of the population.\n\n\"When you think of the structural conditions that many folks find themselves in, there is an underlying policy - political action or inaction - that has determined those conditions and structured the resources that has enabled those conditions to exist,\" said Dawes, founding dean of the School of Global Health at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nWithout addressing those politics, Dawes said, \"you're only going to continue nibbling around the edges of the problem.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_glenza@theguardian.com", "name": "Jessica Glenza", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

The rankings came from 32 measures of health care availability and outcomes among 50 states plus Washington, D.C.\n\nThe scorecards were compiled from 2022 data, a time when women's reproductive care underwent a massive restructuring with the fall of Roe v. Wade and the loss of abortion access in many states, including Louisiana.\n\n\"Women's health is in a very fragile state,\" said Joseph Betancourt, president of the Commonwealth Fund, pointing out that where a person lives very much influences their health, with clear disparities among states.\n\n37th among states\n\nThe analysis ranked Louisiana 37th among all states for women's health care, a significant bump up from where Louisiana typically falls for health care measures. United Health Rankings, for example, put Louisiana dead last in a 2023 report.\n\nThe higher ranking is due to strides in insurance coverage for women. Louisiana expanded Medicaid in 2016, which has increased the number of people covered by about 75%, or 720,000.\n\nBut a closer look at the ranking method shows that women in Louisiana still suffer among the worst health outcomes. The state had some of the highest rates of infant mortality, deaths surrounding pregnancy, preterm births, mental health problems and syphillis infections.\n\nMore people are getting breast and cervical cancer screenings in Louisiana than in most places. But the state still had among the highest rates of breast and cervical cancer deaths.\n\nInsurance 'not sufficient'\n\nWhile increases in health care coverage are good, that doesn't automatically translate to longer, healthier lives, according to the authors of the report. Women face earlier deaths in Louisiana than in most places. The state ranked 46th for deaths of any cause among women ages 15 to 44.\n\n\"Insurance coverage is necessary, but it's not sufficient,\" said Sarah Collins, lead study author. \"You have to have other things in place.\"\n\nCollins said women in Louisiana could be underinsured, meaning they have high insurance deductibles that keep them from seeking care that will be expensive. Insurance is also complicated.\n\n\"The complexity of our health insurance system has increased,\" said Collins. \"It's made it more difficult for people to use their care, (there are) more pre-authorization phone calls when you're trying to access care, and it's confusing to many people.\"\n\nA number of other factors can also influence whether coverage availability leads to better health, said Dr. Veronica Gillispie-Bell, an Ochsner Health OB-GYN who was not part of the study.\n\nPatients often have problems with transportation or getting childcare while they go to appointments for themselves, Gillispie-Bell pointed out. For those patients, she tries to offer alternatives.\n\n\"If we know transportation is going to be a problem, I offer a virtual visit,\" said Gillispie-Bell, who also leads the state's review committee of maternal deaths and morbidity. \"We've found other ways to bring care to the patient.\"\n\nIn pregnancy, patients are given a blood pressure cuff and scale through Ochsner's Connected Mom program. Patients can strap on the cuff at home and have the results delivered instantly to their physician.\n\nOver the course of her 15-year practice, Gillispie-Bell said she has seen an increase in dangerous hypertensive disorders in pregnant women, one of the leading causes of death.\n\n\"There is not a week I'm in the hospital we don't have somebody admitted for preeclampsia,\" said Gillispie-Bell, referring to a condition of sudden high blood pressure in pregnant women that can be fatal to the mother or fetus.\n\nThe causes for the increase are unclear, but may be related to pollution and environmental exposures, which can cause serious health risks in newborns. Women are also having children later in life, when the chances of complications increase.\n\nState plan to improve\n\nThe Louisiana Department of Health released a state health improvement plan this week, listing maternal health as one of four areas of focus for improvement.\n\nIn the next four years, LDH aims to lower preterm births by 1.5%, reduce the number of babies dying by 0.8%, and increase breastfeeding by eight percentage points.\n\nThe most ambitious goal is lowering the maternal mortality rate from 39.4 deaths per 1,000 births to 19.3, bringing Louisiana below the national average for deaths among pregnant and recently pregnant women.", "source": {"uri": "theadvocate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Advocate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_woodruff@theadvocate.com", "name": "Emily Woodruff", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_healthcare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Preventive healthcare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cervical cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

The highest-ranking states include Massachusetts, Vermont and Rhode Island.\n\n\"It serves as glaring reminder that where you live matters to your health and healthcare,\" said President of The Commonwealth Fund Joseph Bentacourt in a press call.\n\nThe Magnolia State came in last place on the scorecard's state ranking, in part, due to its high maternal mortality rate, high rate of cervical and breast cancer deaths and complete ban on abortion.\n\nMississippi's last abortion clinic, The Jackson Women's Health Organization, closed in 2022.\n\nIn 2018, the clinic and one of its doctors challenged a state law banning abortions at 15 weeks. The case ultimately reached the Supreme Court, which used it to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that enshrined the right to abortion.\n\nMississippi and the other states that make up the Mississippi Delta region have the highest maternal mortality rate in the country, with a sizeable percentage of the area's counties not having a single hospital or birth center with obstetric providers offering obstetric care, according to The Commonwealth Fund.\n\nThe maternal mortality rate in Mississippi was 44.6 deaths per 100,000 live births between 2020 and 2022, more than 1.5 times the national average of 26.3, according to the scorecard.\n\nSouthern states across the board

and cervical cancer in 2022, the most recent year for which data is available, was 27.3 per 100,000 women, nearly seven percentage points higher than the national average, according to the analysis.\n\nBreast and cervical cancer are both treatable and, in some cases, preventable with timely screenings and health care, and the high rate of deaths in the state from these two cancers could in part be linked to low screening rates.\n\nFewer women in Mississippi are receiving regular mammograms, with just 73 percent of 50- to 74-year-old women receiving a mammogram in the past two years, about four percentage points lower than the national average, according to the analysis.\n\nAbout 80 percent of women between the ages of 21 to 65 in Mississippi have received a Pap smear in the past three years, which is two percentage points lower than the national average and nine percentage points lower than the percentage in the best-performing state, data from the analysis show.\n\nAbout 14 percent of women in Mississippi do not have health insurance, which is four percentage points higher than the national average, the analysis found.\n\nThe state is also suffering from an extreme shortage of maternity care providers like doctors and certified nurse midwives, with 60.4 providers per 100,000 women aged 15 to 44, a rate roughly 18 percentage points lower than the national average.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

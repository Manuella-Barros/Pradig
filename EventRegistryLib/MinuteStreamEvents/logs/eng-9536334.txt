An industry-backed proposal would treat app-based drivers for these companies as independent contractors entitled to some new benefits but would make clear they are not employees. A labor-backed proposal would let Uber and Lyft drivers unionize.\n\nUber and Lyft also are preparing to face trial on May 13 in a civil lawsuit filed in 2020 by Maura Healey, who was the state's attorney general at the time and is now its Democratic governor. Massachusetts accuses the companies of unlawfully classifying their drivers as contractors to avoid treating them as employees entitled to a minimum wage, overtime and earned sick time. Should the industry fail in court and at the ballot box, Uber and Lyft face the prospect of a sweeping overhaul of their business model. Uber's lawyers said in court papers such a change could force it to cut or end service in Massachusetts.\n\nA victory for the companies in a state with some of the most employee-friendly laws could embolden them in other states, according to labor activists. \"In Massachusetts, the eyes of the country are going to be on us this year - and in November in particular - because this is ground zero for this fight,\" Shannon Liss-Riordan, a lawyer who has pursued cases against Uber and Lyft nationwide, said at an event on Tuesday concerning the ballot questions.\n\nUber and Lyft have defended against claims that their drivers should be classified as employees because the companies have significant control over working conditions. The flexibility of gig work and the ability of drivers to work for competing apps are hallmarks of independent contracting, according to the companies and their allies. THE COST OF EMPLOYEES\n\nEmployees can cost companies up to 30% more than independent contractors, according to various studies. By not classifying their drivers as employees, Uber and Lyft avoided paying over a 10-year period $266.4 million into workers' compensation, unemployment insurance and paid family medical leave in Massachusetts, the state's Democratic auditor said in a report released on Tuesday. In a $200 million campaign in 2020, Uber, Lyft and others convinced California voters to pass a measure similar to the one backed by the companies in Massachusetts, solidifying drivers as independent contractors with some benefits. Litigation challenging that measure is ongoing.\n\nFights over the rights of drivers have played out elsewhere. In New York, for example, Uber and Lyft in November struck a $328 million deal with the state's Democratic attorney general to resolve claims that they cheated their workers out of pay. The companies in that settlement agreed to institute a minimum \"earnings floor\" and paid sick leave, akin to the industry-backed proposal in Massachusetts.\n\nUber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart have provided millions of dollars to an industry-backed ballot question committee called Flexibility and Benefits for Massachusetts Drivers to support proposed state ballot measures that would keep app-based drivers as contractors but establish an earnings floor equal to 120% of the state's minimum wage, or $18 an hour in 2023 before tips. Drivers also would receive healthcare stipends, occupational accident insurance and paid sick time under these proposals. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court blocked a ballot measure similar to the current industry-backed one from going before voters in 2022. To hedge its bets, Flexibility and Benefits for Massachusetts Drivers is gathering signatures for five different versions of the current ballot question, only one of which would be put before voters on Nov. 5.\n\n\"Our ballot question will secure all of these things for drivers while allowing them to maintain the minute-by-minute flexibility they cherish in demand,\" Conor Yunits, a spokesperson for the ballot committee, said at the Tuesday event.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

A coalition of five different versions of the current ballot question is being collected by Flexibility and Benefits for Massachusetts Drivers, which intends to put only one version before voters on November 5.\n\nA spokesperson for the ballot committee, Conor Yunits, said at the event on Tuesday that the ballot question will secure all of these things for drivers while preserving their minute-by-minute flexibility.\n\nSEE ALSO:", "source": {"uri": "chiangraitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTN News l Chiang Rai Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lyft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gig_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gig worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoorDash", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DoorDash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instacart", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instacart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_leave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sick leave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minimum wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers'_compensation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Workers' compensation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_benefits", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment benefits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Supreme_Judicial_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minimum wage in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Big_Dig", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Big Dig", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.chiangraitimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/809352_74586187-1.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536334", "eventUri": "eng-9536334", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 3623, "textEnd": 3633}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 239, "relevance": 1}

The court then will hear a challenge by a conservative think tank to a proposed ballot measure supported by the Service Employees International Union's Local 32BJ that would ask voters to allow Uber and Lyft drivers to unionize.\n\nUsing contractors can cost companies as much as 30% less than using employees, according to various studies. A ballot victory for the companies in a state with some of the most employee-friendly laws could embolden them to pursue similar measures in other states, according to labor activists. Uber and Lyft, along with app-based delivery services Instacart and DoorDash, have spent millions of dollars to support the ballot proposal that would cement the status of their drivers as contractors under state law.\n\nThe proposal by Flexibility and Benefits for Massachusetts Drivers, a ballot measure committee whose contributors include the four companies, also would establish an earnings floor equal to 120% of the state's minimum wage for app-based drivers, or $18 an hour in 2023 before tips. Drivers would receive healthcare stipends, occupational accident insurance and paid sick time under the proposal.\n\nThe same court in 2022 blocked a similar industry-backed ballot measure, finding that it contained an unrelated proposal that ran afoul of a state constitutional requirement that ballot questions be limited to related subjects. To hedge its bets, Flexibility and Benefits for Massachusetts Drivers is gathering signatures for five different versions of the current ballot question, only one of which would be put before voters on Nov. 5.\n\nUber and Lyft also are preparing to face a May 13 trial in a civil lawsuit filed in 2020 by the state. The state's Democratic attorney general, Andrea Joy Campbell, is asking a judge to conclude that the two companies have been unlawfully classifying their drivers as contractors, not employees. Should Uber and Lyft lose that trial and fail to win over voters at the ballot box, the companies have said they could be forced to cease operations in Massachusetts due to the economics.\n\nIf the industry-backed ballot measure passes but the state wins in the trial, Campbell's office has said the new law would control for the future but that Uber and Lyft could be subject to penalties for the past misclassification of their drivers.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lyft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Supreme_Judicial_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoorDash", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DoorDash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instacart", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instacart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minimum wage in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_05_2019_11_49_54_2610105.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536334", "eventUri": "eng-9536334", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 2509, "textEnd": 2515}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "textStart": 2561, "textEnd": 2567}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

That measure, backed by the Service Employees International Union's Local 32BJ, would ask voters to allow Uber and Lyft drivers to unionize under state oversight.\n\nJustice Scott Kafker envisioned a world where voters sided with the industry yet deemed the drivers as contractors with the right to engage in collective bargaining.\n\n\"This seems to be what's good for the goose is good for the gander,\" Kafker said.\n\nA\n\nMay 13 trial is due in a 2020 lawsuit by the state's attorney general accusing Uber and Lyft of misclassifying their drivers as contractors, not employees, for years.\n\nShould the industry fail in court and at the ballot box, Uber and Lyft could face a sweeping overhaul of their business model. Uber's lawyers have said in court papers such a change could force it to cut or end service in Massachusetts.\n\nUber and Lyft, along with app-based delivery services Instacart and DoorDash, have spent millions of dollars to support the ballot proposal that would cement the status of their drivers as contractors under state law.\n\nUsing contractors can cost companies as much as 30% less than hiring employees, various studies showed.\n\nFlexibility and Benefits for Massachusetts Drivers, a ballot measure committee whose contributors include the four ride-share companies, is also proposing setting an earnings floor for app-based drivers and providing them healthcare stipends, occupational accident insurance and paid sick time.\n\nThaddeus Heuer, a lawyer for the measure's proponents, said his clients had \"a common purpose of defining that relationship as not employer-employee.\"\n\nThe state high court in 2022 blocked a similar industry-backed ballot measure over a provision it deemed unrelated to the proposal.\n\nTo hedge its bets this time, the group is gathering signatures for five versions of the ballot question, only one of which it would have put before voters on Nov. 5.\n\nKafker, in his argument on Monday, questioned a provision tucked into the broadest of those five versions that would require drivers claiming they were fired for discriminatory reasons to appeal to the employer.\n\n\"Generally don't have the person who's accused of discrimination decide whether they discriminated,\" he urged.\n\nA ruling is expected ahead of a July 3 deadline for the ballot measures' proponents to submit signatures to the secretary of state.\n\n(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston, Editing by Will Dunham, Alexia Garamfalvi and Richard Chang)", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Passing a measure that secures drivers' independent contractor status would allow the companies to avoid employment obligations under Massachusetts's worker-friendly laws.\n\nVoters are challenging five initiatives introduced by industry-backed alliance Massachusetts Coalition for Independent Work that would cement drivers as independent contractors, some of which would expand benefits for these workers.\n\nThe justices at times appeared frustrated by the industry's strategy of introducing five proposals in an effort to make sure one passes constitutional muster.\n\n\"Why aren't four-fifths of this case moot, although we haven't been told which four-fifths are?\" Justice Gabrielle Wolohojian asked during oral arguments Monday. \"I'll just put my cards on the table, I don't think that's a fair situation for the court to be in.\"\n\nThe 32BJ affiliate of the Service Employees International Union is backing the proposal related to unionization. The union-backed proposal would grant Uber and Lyft drivers collective bargaining rights, allowing them to negotiate pay, benefits, and working conditions.\n\nThe measure would allow workers to bargain even though they lack employee status. Independent contractors are barred from unionization under the National Labor Relations Act.\n\n\"This is creating a new system and in order for that new system to be legal it has to satisfy antitrust provisions,\" Kafker said. \"I just don't see why this is a problem.\"\n\nThe Supreme Judicial Court blocked an industry-backed initiative in El Koussa v. Attorney General in 2022, ruling it was unconstitutional because it contained two distinct policy decisions.\n\nThe attorney general's office represents Campbell.

PAUL, Minn. -- Minnesota lawmakers announced an agreement that will set a statewide minimum wage for rideshare drivers, but Uber and Lyft have quickly come out against the compromise.\n\nOn Monday, the chief authors from the Minnesota House, Minnesota Senate and Minneapolis City Council said a \"major development\" has been made in negotiations. The agreement includes a statewide minimum wage rate of $1.27 per mile and 49 cents per minute.\n\nThe minimum wage rate is lower than the City Council's ordinance, which requires a minimum wage of $1.40 per mile and 51 cents per minute. That will go into effect on July 1, which is when Uber and Lyft have threatened to leave the state.\n\n\"We are happy to come to a compromise agreement with the Minneapolis City Council on a minimum compensation standard that aligns with other major metropolitan areas,\" said House Majority Leader Jamie Long (DFL-Minneapolis). \"This compromise represents significant movement from the Minneapolis City Council as we all work towards ensuring drivers in our state are fairly paid.\"\n\nThe agreement was reflected in an amendment that was made public Monday and on Tuesday will be introduced to the House Labor and Industry Finance and Policy Committee.\n\nShortly after the compromise was announced by lawmakers, rideshare companies Uber and Lyft released statements objecting to the agreement.\n\nLyft said the proposed rates in the bill would be \"incredibly damaging for both riders and drivers\" by making rides \"unaffordable\" for most Minnesotans.\n\n\"It would make the service unsustainable in Minnesota and we would be forced to shut down throughout the state, should it pass,\" Lyft's statement said.\n\nIn its statement, Uber said it is disappointed that some legislators are \"are allowing the Minneapolis City Council to drive a decision that impacts millions of people\" in the city.\n\n\"We've made serious offers and hope we can still work with the Governor and legislature on a statewide solution that allows rideshare to remain in the state,\" Uber said.\n\nHouse Rep. Pat Garofalo, R-Farmington, released a statement opposed to the announced compromise.\n\n\"Let's be clear about what is happening here: Democrat legislators struck a deal with Democrat City Councilmembers that will still drive Uber and Lyft out of Minnesota,\" Garofalo said. \"If this bill becomes law, Democrats will be fully responsible for the severe consequences for the disability community, tourism industry, and thousands of Minnesotans who rely on ridesharing services each day. We desperately need Gov. Walz and reasonable members of the DFL to wake up and get to work on a real compromise with all stakeholders at the table that will keep Uber and Lyft operating.\"\n\nRepublicans tried but failed again to amend the bill to undo Minneapolis' decision with preemption language.

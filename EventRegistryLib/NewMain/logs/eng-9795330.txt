And they're not like junior-sized versions of a core item. They're unique,\" Gibbs said.\n\nYUM has launched or reintroduced value deals at all of the biggest names in its portfolio. There's KFC's Taste of KFC deals and Pizza Hut's $7 Deal Lovers. Taco Bell, known for its cheap eats, has an extensive Cravings Value Menu.\n\nOf the three, only Taco Bell's U.S. same-store sales grew in the second quarter of 2024, at 5%. Both KFC and Pizza Hut's same-store sales declined 3%.\n\nChief Financial Officer Chris Turner said on the earnings call that there are approximately 210 restaurants temporarily closed across the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia due to the Israel-Hamas war, affecting sales in the region.\n\nThe earnings call highlighted how fast food and fast casual chains are struggling to retain customers who believe it is cheaper to just eat at home. McDonald's, Starbucks, Burger King and Wendy's have all reported less foot traffic and lower overall sales and have jumped into value meals.\n\nBusiness Taco Bell enters the value meal wars with its biggest deal ever By Jordan Valinsky, CNN\n\nMeanwhile, Taco Bell's Cantina Chicken lineup, launched in March, sold above the company's expectations and led to a 7% increase in system sales alone.\n\n\"Since the platform launch, Taco Bell's chicken sales mix has increased 10 points with nearly one in four orders including a Chicken Cantina item,\" Gibbs said.\n\nThe company also reported increases in digital sales and a positive deployment of new technologies. Taco Bell is set to expand the use of artificial intelligence voice technology in its drive-thrus to hundreds of US locations by the end of this year, going all-in on a space where its rivals have failed. Lawrence Kim, chief innovation officer at Yum! Brands, previously told CNN he's confident in his company's technology.\n\nYum reported a revenue of $1.76 billion, below expectations of $1.8 billion in the second quarter.\n\nCNN's Clare Duffy contributed to this report.\n\nFood & Cooking Why fast food value menus aren't as good a deal as you might think By Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN Business Fast food chains launch 'value menu' war after cost complaints.

Taco Bell is set to expand the use of artificial intelligence voice technology in its drive-thrus to hundreds of US locations by the end of this year, going all-in on a space where its rivals have failed.

There's KFC's Taste of KFC deals and Pizza Hut's $7 Deal Lovers. Taco Bell, known for its cheap eats, has an extensive Cravings Value Menu.\n\nOf the three, only Taco Bell's U.S. same-store sales grew in the second quarter of 2024, at 5%. Both KFC and Pizza Hut's same-store sales declined 3%.\n\nChief Financial Officer Chris Turner said on the earnings call that there are approximately 210 restaurants temporarily closed across the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia due to the Israel-Hamas war, affecting sales in the region.\n\nThe earnings call highlighted how fast food and fast casual chains are struggling to retain customers who believe it is cheaper to just eat at home. McDonald's, Starbucks, Burger King and Wendy's have all reported less foot traffic and lower overall sales and have jumped into value meals.\n\nBusiness Taco Bell enters the value meal wars with its biggest deal ever By Jordan Valinsky, CNN\n\nMeanwhile, Taco Bell's Cantina Chicken lineup, launched in March, sold above the company's expectations and led to a 7% increase in system sales alone.\n\n\"Since the platform launch, Taco Bell's chicken sales mix has increased 10 points with nearly one in four orders including a Chicken Cantina item,\" Gibbs said.\n\nThe company also reported increases in digital sales and a positive deployment of new technologies. Taco Bell is set to expand the use of artificial intelligence voice technology in its drive-thrus to hundreds of US locations by the end of this year, going all-in on a space where its rivals have failed. Lawrence Kim, chief innovation officer at Yum! Brands, previously told CNN he's confident in his company's technology.\n\nYum reported a revenue of $1.76 billion, below expectations of $1.8 billion in the second quarter.\n\nCNN's Clare Duffy contributed to this report.\n\nFood & Drink Why fast food value menus aren't as good a deal as you might think By Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN Business Fast food chains launch 'value menu' war after cost complaints.

The company also seeks to reduce wait times.\n\n\"Tapping into AI gives us the ability to ease team members' workloads, freeing them to focus on front-of-house hospitality,\" Dane Mathews, Taco Bell chief digital and technology officer, said in a statement. \"It also enables us to unlock new and meaningful ways to engage with our customers.\"\n\nHere's what to know about the AI voice technology, and what other fast-food chains have also tried it.\n\nPeople are also reading: Elon Musk urged to fix AI election misinformation that Harris not on ballot\n\nAI to take Taco Bell orders at some drive-thrus\n\nIf your local Taco Bell is one of the locations targeted for the AI upgrade, you may soon notice you have a different experience when you order at the drive-thru.\n\nRather than a human employee taking your order, you may find yourself instead talking to a computer.\n\nBut are customers who struggle to correctly pronounce some of the items on Taco Bell's menu destined to receive the wrong food?\n\nApparently not, according to Yum!'s chief innovation officer Lawrence Kim. Kim told CNN that the AI model has been trained to understand various accents and pronunciations from customers - even if they pronounce quesadilla like \"kay-suh-DILL-uh.\"\n\nThe technology has been in the works for two years and is designed to improve over time.\n\n\"The Voice AI technology uses a holistic approach that leverages feedback, data, and insights to enhance consumer relationships with an emphasis on intuitive, user-friendly technology to create a seamless ordering experience,\" Taco Bell's press release says.\n\nKim also told CNN that the AI ordering technology, which should one day be implemented globally, would not replace human jobs. Instead, the innovation is intended to \"ease task load\" for Taco Bell's human employees.\n\nMore on fast food: Texas tops list for cheapest fast food in America. These 3 cities made the top 10\n\nAI in the fast food industry\n\nPlenty of other fast-food chains have similarly gotten into the artificial intelligence game as a way to ease the workload on their employees and alleviate lengthy drive-thru lines.\n\nKFC, another fast food chain owned by Yum! Brands, are also experimenting with Voice AI technology in five Australian drive-thru locations.\n\nWendy's similarly introduced AI voice technology as part of a pilot program that began in June 2023, as has Carl's Jr. and Hardee's.\n\nBut the technology hasn't always worked seamlessly.\n\nAt McDonald's, customers have taken to social media to share videos of the mishaps they encountered, including an order of nine sweet teas for one woman, and a seemingly endless order of chicken nuggets for another, despite her protests to stop.\n\nIn June, McDonald's announced that the chain would stop using artificial intelligence to take drive-thru orders by the end of July after struggling to integrate the technology. However, reports indicated that the franchise aims to have a better plan to implement voice order technology by the end of the year.", "source": {"uri": "eu.statesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA TODAY"}, "authors": [{"uri": "austin_american_statesman@eu.statesman.com", "name": "Austin American-Statesman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-through", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drive-through"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taco_Bell", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taco Bell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yum!_Brands", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yum!

Brands' sales in the second quarter, despite inflation pressures impacting KFC and Pizza Hut.\n\nTaco Bell's New Menu Items Drive Growth for Yum! Brands Amid Inflation, as KFC and Pizza Hut Struggle\n\nAs inflation continues to pressure consumers, Taco Bell provides a modest sales boost to Yum! Brands, even as KFC and Pizza Hut struggle.\n\nAccording to Quartz, Yum! Brands reported lower-than-expected sales for the second quarter on August 6, partly due to reduced spending by U.S. consumers and the impacts of the Middle East conflict. Despite this, Yum! Brands' shares experienced a slight rise on the same day.\n\n\"Taco Bell is a clear standout in today's environment, not only achieving same-store sales growth well ahead of the QSR category but delivering restaurant-level margins near a record high,\" David Gibbs, Yum! Brands' chief executive officer told investors during the earnings call.\n\nGibbs noted that sales at Taco Bell grew \"across all income cohorts,\" despite higher fast food prices industry-wide, new menu items like the Cantina Chicken and the famous Taco August 6 promotion continue to attract consumers.\n\nTaco Bell Boosts Loyalty Programs and Menu to Compete Amid Fierce Fast-Food Market Challenges\n\nTaco Bell and its parent company have invested in loyalty programs and refreshed menu offerings to lure customers. Taco Bell's deals include the $7 Luxe Cravings Box and a Baja Blast-flavored gelato, with a pie of the same flavor coming later this year. The chain is also exploring AI for its drive-thrus.\n\nHowever, competition remains fierce. McDonald's is extending its $5 meal deal and testing a new big burger called the Big Arch. Burger King, Wendy's, Sonic, Dairy Queen, and Arby's offer various meal deals, ranging from $1.99 to $9. Wendy's $3 breakfast bundle has become so popular that the chain is investing millions to extend the promotion through 2025.\n\nShake Shack and Chipotle, on the other hand, are not joining the bundle promotion trend, focusing instead on quality and generous portion sizes, respectively.\n\nDespite the variety of fast-food options, KFC and Pizza Hut saw a 3% decline in sales during the second quarter. Popular chains like Domino's, Starbucks, and McDonald's have also faced waning demand, particularly from international consumers.\n\nYum!

It even makes sense for a bunch of other industries, but I did not expect fast food companies to be leading the charge for rolling out AI-powered chatbots.\n\nTake Taco Bell's announcement that it has been testing AI drive-thru ordering in 100 stores, and plans to expand the test to \"hundreds more.\" According to a press release last week, Yum! Brands, Taco Bell's parent company, wants to roll out the technology to all of its restaurant brands.\n\nI get the appeal for Taco Bell. If you can have a robot take customer orders, you don't have to pay a human to take them. That, presumably saves you money. Except, and this is important, no one wants AI robots taking their order. It's why people will yell at their phones to try to get past the voice menu and talk to a human being. Does anyone really want to talk to a machine at a drive through window? Taco Bell thinks so, and it says the test has improved customer satisfaction:\n\n\"With over two years of fine tuning and testing the drive-thru Voice AI technology, we're confident in its effectiveness in optimizing operations and enhancing customer satisfaction,\" said Lawerence Kim, the company's chief innovation officer in a statement.\n\nAccording to the company's press release, replacing humans with AI chatbots is \"designed to enhance back-of-house operations for team members and elevate the order experience for consumers. Benefits include easing task load for team members, improving order accuracy, providing a consistent, friendly experience, and reducing wait times, while driving profitable growth for Taco Bell, Yum! Brands and their franchisees.\"\n\nLook, I can definitely see how there are ways that AI might be better at this. For one, AI doesn't get flustered or overwhelmed when the drive-thru gets backed up during the lunch rush. It's just always ready to take an order, every time.\n\nBut, I think you can make the case that all of the problems that AI solves could also be solved by better people management. If your employees are doing a bad job taking orders or being friendly to customers, it seems like your first priority should be investing in helping your employees be better at their job.\n\nBesides, I just keep coming back to the idea that AI is almost universally bad at this. I know Taco Bell says that it's been successful, but it doesn't seem likely that a fast food company has managed to make a better chat experience than basically every single tech company.\n\nIt's why McDonald's gave up on the idea--it was a massive failure. No one wants to have to tell a robot over and over that they don't actually want nine sweet teas. They'd rather just talk to a person.\n\nThere is definitely a trend of companies trying to make it so their employees never have to actually talk to employees, but I just think it's a bad idea. Having a person take customer orders isn't just about listening to them talk about what food they want to eat. It's about the overall experience of interacting with people. It makes you feel as though you are valued as a customer and are not an inconvenience.\n\nThis leads to the reason I think this is such a consequential decision for Taco Bell. It represents a massive shift in the type of experience it provides to customers. It represents a move away from human interactions in favor of not having to talk to your customers.\n\nIn theory, AI chatbots will someday be able to take orders more accurately than humans. I'm sure that there are cases already where AI does a good enough job of getting most people's orders correct.\n\nAfter all, anyone who has ever gone through a drive-thru knows that humans are not always accurate. Sometimes, they get your order wrong, and sometimes, they misunderstand what you want.\n\nBut even if AI is someday better, I'm just not sure this is so broken that it needs fixing--at least, not like this. Of course, you don't have to look past the last sentence that I quoted above to really understand what this is about: improving profitability.\n\nUltimately, the reason every company is thinking about ways to incorporate AI is that it costs less than paying real humans to talk to other humans. I'm just not sure that's the kind of experience any company should be excited about. Their customers definitely aren't.", "source": {"uri": "inc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inc.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_aten@inc.com", "name": "Jason Aten", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-through", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drive-through"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taco_Bell", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taco Bell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yum!_Brands", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yum!

He highlighted the Cravings Value Menu, which offers up to 10 meal-sized options, each priced at $3 or less and available at all times.\n\n\"In this environment where the consumer is probably pulling back a little bit, being the always-on value brand has served us well, and it really puts a moat around us when it comes to value,\" he said.\n\nSales from Taco Bell stores open for a year or more are \"well ahead\" of the quick-service restaurant category, Gibbs claims. Same-store sales were up 5% and revenue increased by 7% to $666m (\u00a3524bn) in the period.\n\nHe attributed this success to Taco Bell's product innovation and value focus, highlighting the launch of the Chicken Cantina Menu, featuring slow-roasted chicken, as a key growth driver. Since its introduction, nearly one in four orders now includes a Chicken Cantina item, he claims.\n\n\"The Taco Bell business is serving consumers, creating buzz in the market, bringing great innovation to bear and delivering value when consumers need it,\" he said.\n\nYum! Brands' second-quarter revenue was up 4% to $1.76bn (\u00a3139bn). However, Same-store sales at KFC and Pizza Hut did not match those of Taco Bell - both businesses reported a 3% dip in the period. Gibbs pointed to conflicts in the Middle East, which have led to restaurant closures in the region.\n\nYum! Brands is pushing forward with its ambition to become the \"leading global digital restaurant company\" by expanding the rollout of voice AI technology in Taco Bell drive-thrus across the US and initiating tests with KFC in an international market, according to Gibbs.\n\nThe voice AI system - which interprets customers' orders based on voice recognition - has been in development for more than two years. The organisation claims it is designed to improve order accuracy, reduce waiting times and ease the effort for staff.\n\n\"As of today, we have this technology operational in over 100 Taco Bell stores. We plan to scale this technology to several hundred stores by year end,\" he said. \"We have witnessed consistent consumer experiences and higher team member productivity.\"\n\nIn other areas of the business, KFC's digital sales, excluding China, grew by nearly 20%. Gibbs noted that the KFC global loyalty program is now live across 14 markets.\n\nEarlier this year, KFC marketing director Kate Wall told Marketing Week that the brand is entering its \"next chapter\" of its journey as it looks to reaffirm its appeal among young consumers by launching its biggest-ever brand platform.\n\nThe chicken restaurant chain is building on several years of effective creativity, states Wall. KFC won Marketing Week's Brand of the Year for the effectiveness of its work in 2021 following a series of activity to reconnect with consumers after its sales began to decline in 2016.\n\nIn its Pizza Hut division, Gibbs noted leadership changes for the pizza restaurant, welcoming Kalen Thornton, a former PepsiCo executive, as the new global chief brand officer\n\nHe will be responsible for leading the brand's global strategy and marketing, with a focus on \"connecting\" with consumers across both physical and digital channels.\n\nEarlier this month, Pizza Hut's UK CMO told Marketing Week that the brand will be \"bold\" in its quest to become \"the number one choice in pizza\".\n\nIn a bid to stand out to these younger consumers, Pizza Hut launched a new creative platform 'Together We Pizza', created with agency Iris, the first iteration of which went live on 15 July.\n\n\"We want to continue to innovate and ensure we are relevant and relatable,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "marketingweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marketing Week"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grace_gollasch@marketingweek.com", "name": "Grace Gollasch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yum!_Brands", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yum!

The $20 Family Meal includes six pieces of chicken, four sides and four biscuits.\n\nStill, KFC came up short in its head-to-head brawl with other fast food value meals.\n\nThe persistent sales challenge fell in line with other fast food giants, like McDonald's and Domino's, who saw US customers flee during the pandemic and return in dwindling numbers thanks to high food prices.\n\n\"I'm incredibly pleased with how well our teams have managed through a challenging operating environment,\" Yum Brands CEO David Gibbs said in a statement.\n\nTaco Bell emerged as its parent company's saving grace. Its same-store sales grew 5%, pulling ahead of LSEG analysts' expectations of 3.6%.\n\nGibbs attributed the Taco Bell growth to \"unmatched, crave-worthy innovation\" with the popularity of its new Cantina Chicken menu and a Taco Tuesday promotion.\n\nThe Taco Tuesday promotion was a limited-time $5 Taco Discovery Box available for a few weeks in April and June. The value meal included a Crunchy Taco, Doritos Locos Taco, Cantina Chicken Chicken Crispy Taco and a medium drink.\n\nYum's overall same-stores sales declined by 1%, which was an improvement from the 3% decline in the first quarter but disappointing compared to LSEG analysts' estimates of a 0.2% dip.\n\nThe company reported a 10% increase in overall core operating profit and reaffirmed its forecast of an 8% increase in full-year core operating profit.\n\nExcluding items, the company reported a profit of $1.35 a share, just above LSEG analysts' estimates of $1.33 a share.\n\nGibbs said the company was focusing on its technology improvements, such as adding more kiosks and implementing AI at restaurants to speed up service times - like the drive-thru voice technology used at some Taco Bell locations.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_Hut", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pizza Hut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KFC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "KFC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yum!_Brands", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yum!

Gibbs lauded Taco Bell's 10-item value menu as a prime example of a way to bring in those price-weary customers in a challenging environment.\n\n\"They're unique items that nobody else in the industry has. And they're not like junior-sized versions of a core item. They're unique,\" Gibbs said.\n\nYUM has launched or reintroduced value deals at all of the biggest names in its portfolio. There's KFC's Taste of KFC deals and Pizza Hut's $7 Deal Lovers. Taco Bell, known for its cheap eats, has an extensive Cravings Value Menu.\n\nOf the three, only Taco Bell's US same-store sales grew in the second quarter of 2024, at 5%. Both KFC and Pizza Hut's same-store sales declined 3%.\n\nChief Financial Officer Chris Turner said on the earnings call that there are approximately 210 restaurants temporarily closed across the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia due to the Israel-Hamas war, affecting sales in the region.\n\nThe earnings call highlighted how fast food and fast casual chains are struggling to retain customers who believe it is cheaper to just eat at home. McDonald's, Starbucks, Burger King and Wendy's have all reported less foot traffic and lower overall sales and have jumped into value meals.\n\nMeanwhile, Taco Bell's Cantina Chicken lineup, launched in March, sold above the company's expectations and led to a 7% increase in system sales alone.\n\n\"Since the platform launch, Taco Bell's chicken sales mix has increased 10 points with nearly one in four orders including a Chicken Cantina item,\" Gibbs said.\n\nThe company also reported increases in digital sales and a positive deployment of new technologies. Taco Bell is set to expand the use of artificial intelligence voice technology in its drive-thrus to hundreds of US locations by the end of this year, going all-in on a space where its rivals have failed. Lawrence Kim, chief innovation officer at Yum! Brands, previously told CNN he's confident in his company's technology.\n\nYum reported a revenue of $1.76 billion, below expectations of $1.8 billion in the second quarter.\n\nCNN's Clare Duffy contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

KFC's digital sales excluding China rose 20%, and kiosk sales were up 40%, while Taco Bell's loyalty sales rose 30% year over year.\n\nTurner added that the company is partnering with \"an innovative startup in the AI-driven personalization space to leverage our massive first-party data assets.\" These kinds of initiatives can be key, as PYMNTS Intelligence research finds that 83% of consumers want personalized offers, but only 44% are satisfied with the ones they are receiving. Turner noted that the partnership aims to leverage deep learning in a way that will be \"broadly and easily scalable across brands.\"\n\nYum Brands announced Wednesday (July 31) that it is expanding its AI drive-thru voice ordering test to \"hundreds\" of additional Taco Bell locations by the year's end and trying out the technology in five KFC stores in Australia.\n\nTurner observed on Tuesday's call that tests of the technology, in addition to boosting productivity, have yielded \"consistent consumer experiences.\" Additionally, the capability plays into efforts to provide a connected in-store experience, integrating with digital menu boards.\n\nConsumers are growing more accustomed to engaging in commercial transactions using voice AI. The 2024 edition of PYMNTS Intelligence's \"How the World Does Digital\" report, which drew from a survey of 67,000 consumers across 11 countries, found that 27% use voice technology to shop at least monthly.\n\nOverall, Yum Brands' global system sales grew 3%, driven by impressive gains at Taco Bell and KFC, with Taco Bell achieving a notable 7% growth in system sales. However, same-store sales saw a slight 1% decline. In an effort to return to growth, the company is rolling out initiatives to appeal to cost-conscious consumers.\n\n\"The impacts from the Middle East conflict, in addition to a more cost-conscious consumer, have presented headwinds to same-store sales,\" Gibbs stated. \"Ensuring we provide consumer's affordable options has been an area of greater focus for us since last year, with all of our brands having offered disruptive deals and introduced or reintroduced the track of everyday value. ... Our brands experienced improving trends relative to the first quarter in the US market, and we continue to refine our offerings in international markets to recapture similar momentum.\"", "source": {"uri": "pymnts.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PYMNTS.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taco_Bell", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taco Bell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KFC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "KFC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yum!_Brands", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yum!

Brands, the parent company of Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut, and Habit Burger Grill, is expanding the use of AI voice technology for drive-thru orders at Taco Bell locations across the US, with plans to implement it across all its brands by 2024.\n\nYum Brands aims to become a leading global digital restaurant company by leveraging technology acquisitions, building a unified e-commerce ecosystem, expanding the use of AI, investing in loyalty programs, AI technologies, and proprietary POS systems.\n\nIn Q2 2024, Yum! Brands reported a 3% worldwide system sales growth, beating Wall Street estimates for revenue and core profit, driven by Taco Bell US and KFC International's 5% system sales growth. Same-store sales declined by 1%. Digital sales were nearly $8 billion, with a digital mix over 50%.\n\nTaco Bell outperformed other Yum Brands chains in Q2, driven by successful value offerings, contributing to a 5% rise in comparable sales and a digital business accounting for 35% of sales, with loyalty program sales growing over 30%.\n\nMcDonald's remained the No. 1 quick-service restaurant chain in the US despite a 0.7% drop in comparable sales, maintaining its top spot over Starbucks, Chick-fil-A, and Taco Bell, based on restaurant sales from March through May 2024, when McDonald's offered a $5 value meal to attract customers affected by rising prices.\n\nMcDonald's faced challenges with AI technology for drive-thru orders. The company ended an AI pilot program due to issues with processing customers' accents and is seeking a new vendor for AI technology in its drive-thrus.\n\nOther fast-food chains, such as KFC, Wendy's, Carl's Jr., and Hardee's, are also experimenting with AI voice technology.\n\nThe top 10 quick-service restaurants in the U.S. based on total sales in 2024 include McDonald's, Starbucks, Chick-fil-A, Taco Bell, Wendy's, Dunkin', Burger King, Subway, Chipotle, and Domino's, with Burger King moving to No. 7 and Chipotle to No. 9.\n\nThis article was written in collaboration with Generative AI news company Alchemiq\n\nSources: Reuters, BusinessCheshire, QSR Magazine, NRN, PYMNTS, NorthJersey, News5Cleveland, ProactiveInvestors, Statesman, Spiceworks, BusinessWire, HeadTopics, Gorge News Center.", "source": {"uri": "ynetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ynetnews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-through", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drive-through"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yum!_Brands", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yum!

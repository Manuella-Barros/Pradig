The facilities provided to top teams in the USA, especially New York, have been severely criticised.\n\nThe ongoing ICC T20 World Cup 2024 has come under fire for its use of drop-in pitches in the United States, with players and cricket experts characterizing them as poor.\n\nAmid the issue surrounding drop-in pitches in the United States, Indian cricket team head coach Rahul Dravid expressed discontent with the practice facilities provided for the T20 World Cup 2024 in New York.\n\nDuring a media encounter, Dravid chastised the ICC and the USA Cricket Board for not providing traditional cricket stadiums for participating teams to train for the world competition. Teams playing in New York have had to train at Cantiague Park, about five miles away from the ground, a situation that did not amuse Dravid.\n\n\"It's a bit strange to be practising in a park. Obviously, at the World Cups, you'd be in big stadiums or you'd be at cricket stadiums traditionally. But you know, we're at a public park and practicing,\" Dravid said.\n\nSuddenly, the facilities in New York, which will host eight of the United States' sixteen World Cup games, have come into focus. The International Cricket Council (ICC) created a temporary stadium, and on Monday, Sri Lanka was bowled out for 77 against South Africa, who laboured before hitting the target.\n\nDravid, meanwhile, did not miss the absence of buzz around New York, where India will play three games, and hoped the situation would improve once the games start.\n\n\"Yeah, obviously it's slightly different. It's obviously exciting that it's coming to a new country, it's coming to a new place. (It) feels slightly different in terms of, I guess, typically the buzz that you have around these events, with cricket not being one of the major sports in this country.\n\n\"So you don't feel that kind of buzz over here. But hopefully, once our games start and a lot of the Indian fans do start coming in, you start seeing that similar kind of excitement.\n\nSo things are certainly different from that perspective.

It's pretty, pretty similar to what we would normally do,\" he said.\n\nIndia will play Ireland, Pakistan, and USA at the Nassau County Cricket Ground and take on Canada in Fort Lauderhill Florida.\n\nAlso Read: T20 World Cup 2024: Steve Smith Backs Virat Kohli To Be The Leading Run-Getter", "source": {"uri": "sportzwiki.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportzwiki"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Dravid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Smith_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Smith (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassau_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nassau County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nassau County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauderhill,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lauderhill, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lauderhill, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://sportzwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rd.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622918", "eventUri": "eng-9622918", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

Actually, the ICC constructed a temporary stadium in New York, but the first match on Monday saw Sri Lanka collapse for a mere 77 runs against South Africa.\n\nEven the Proteas team struggled before managing to chase down the modest target. Meanwhile, Rahul Dravid observed the lack of excitement in New York for the T20 World Cup 2024 and expressed hope that the atmosphere would become livelier once their games started and Indian fans started to fill the stands.\n\nHowever, Dravid said that it is thrilling for cricket to be introduced to a new country and venue, but mentioned that the usual buzz surrounding the ICC events is missing, likely because cricket isn't a major sport in the United States.

It was a courageous step by the ICC to conduct the showpiece event on the American shores, especially in New York. They, in fact, scheduled three India games - including the one against Pakistan - in the city, trying to add the much-needed glamour quotient to the tournament. However, the move doesn't seem to be paying off well.\n\nSince cricket isn't one of the major sports being followed in the US, the lack of buzz, which usually is around an ICC event, can be felt very well. Addressing the pre-match presser on Monday, head coach Rahul Dravid also spoke about the 'different feeling' of playing the tournament in a country with the least favouritism for cricket.\n\n\"Yeah, obviously it's slightly different. It's obviously exciting that it's coming to a new country, it's coming to a new place. (It) feels slightly different in terms of, I guess, typically the buzz that you have around these events, with cricket not being one of the major sports in this country.

It's exciting that it's coming to a new country, a new place. (But) it feels slightly different in terms of, I guess, typically the buzz that you have around these events, with cricket not being one of the major sports in this country.\"", "source": {"uri": "crickettimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketTimes.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anirudh_singh@crickettimes.com", "name": "Anirudh Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Dravid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_cricket_team_in_Pakistan_in_2020\u201321", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South African cricket team in Pakistan in 2020\u201321"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://crickettimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Rahul-Dravid-T20-World-Cup-2024-.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622918", "eventUri": "eng-9622918", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Teams playing in New York have had to train at Cantiague Park, about five miles away from the ground, a situation that clearly did not amuse Dravid.\n\n\"Obviously at the World Cups you'd be in big stadiums or you'd be at cricket stadiums traditionally. But you know, we're at a public park and practicing,\" Dravid, who has played in three World Cups and coached the India side in the last three ICC events, said flashing a smile that smacked more of sarcasm rather than amusement.\n\nSuddenly, the facilities in New York which will host eight of the 16 World Cup games allotted to the US, have come into focus. The International Cricket Council (ICC) built a temporary stadium and on Monday Sri Lanka got bundled out for 77 against South Africa, who also struggled before knocking off the target.\n\nDamian Hough, who was in-charge of the drop-in pitches, had predicted the pitches to be like any other Twenty20 surface. \"We are excited to see the arrival of the pitches here in New York. We're now focused on bedding in the pitches here in New York to ensure we're delivering an end product of the highest quality,\" Hough, who is also the head curator of Adelaide Oval, said in a statement released through the ICC last month.\n\nThe pitch received widespread disapproval, with Sanjay Manjrekar posting a comment on social media that seemed to capture the general sentiment. \"Pitch of the 80s & batters of the 2020s. Not a good union,\" Manjrekar wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nDravid, meanwhile, did not miss the absence of buzz around New York, where India will play three games, and hoped the situation will improve once the games start. \"Yeah, obviously it's slightly different. It's obviously exciting that it's coming to a new country, it's coming to a new place.

I am not sure it's going to be too much of a difference. It is a little bit of an unknown for everyone. It's not that you have a history or a lot of track records about the wickets. Generally, in these games, the toss is not a factor. There is not going to be a lot of dew, especially in the day games we are playing in. Hopefully not (Toss not a major factor),\" Dravid said.\n\n\"The pitches and the outfield, little bit of an unknown. It's the same for everyone. We all have to learn how to react to it. I truly believe we have the experience and ability to adapt to different situations. From the very little I have seen, it might not be a 220-230 wicket in the IPL. We have to respond to that,\" he added.\n\nNotably, Sri Lanka complained about the arrangements made for them in New York. Wanindu Hasaranga's men stayed 90 minutes away from the ground and had to travel hours in advance to get used to the conditions for their early morning game on Monday.

Rumors started swirling about the team's dissatisfaction with the facilities at Cantiague Park, where they were getting ready for their warm-up game against Bangladesh. It didn't help that the practice venue was quite a distance away from the main stadium, Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, where they were set to play most of their league matches.\n\nAs the players geared up for the tournament, there was a buzz of discontent about the practice conditions. The stark difference between the practice grounds and the main stadium raised eyebrows and sparked conversations about whether the facilities were up to scratch.\n\nThings reached a boiling point over the weekend, especially after widespread criticism of the New York track during the Sri Lanka vs. South Africa match. Suddenly, everyone was talking about the conditions of the playing field, shining a spotlight on the broader issue of infrastructure and facilities provided for international cricket events.\n\nIn response to the mounting criticism, Rahul Dravid, India's head coach, didn't hold back. He voiced his frustration directly at the International Cricket Council (ICC), stressing the importance of having proper practice facilities, especially when gearing up for such crucial tournaments.\n\nThis incident sheds light on the hurdles faced by teams during global cricket tournaments, especially when they're hosted in non-traditional cricketing nations. The stark contrast between practice venues and match stadiums underscores the need for careful planning and better infrastructure to ensure a smooth experience for players and teams alike.\n\nIt's also reignited discussions about the ICC's role in overseeing and maintaining the quality of facilities provided for international cricket events. As the governing body of the sport, the ICC shoulders the responsibility of setting and maintaining standards, as well as addressing concerns raised by participating teams.\n\nLooking ahead, it's crucial for all stakeholders to work together to address the issues highlighted during India's practice sessions and the subsequent criticism of playing conditions. Paying attention to the details, taking proactive measures, and improving communication between organizers and teams are key to avoiding similar problems in the future.\n\nWhile this incident serves as a reminder of the challenges involved in organizing global cricket events, it also presents an opportunity for reflection and improvement. By learning from these experiences and making necessary changes, everyone involved can work towards enhancing the overall experience for players, fans, and organizers alike.\n\nSEE ALSO: Rahul Dravid Confirms His Exit From Team India's Head Coach Role; Says He'll Not Reapply For The Position", "source": {"uri": "in.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Dravid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantiague_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cantiague Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indian_cricket_team_in_Bangladesh_in_2020\u201321", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Indian cricket team in Bangladesh in 2020\u201321"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassau_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nassau County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nassau County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://sm.mashable.com/mashable_in/seo/7/74017/74017_u9se.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622918", "eventUri": "eng-9622918", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

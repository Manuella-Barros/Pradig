The shock findings were contained in a poll by Techne for Independent Media. It also showed that 90% of people believe they have the correct photographic identification ahead of what will be the first general election featuring UK-wide voter ID rules. All voters must be registered before midnight on June 18 or else they will not be able to vote on July 4.

On voter ID, only 3% said they do not have the correct photographic identification, while 6% don\u2019t know.

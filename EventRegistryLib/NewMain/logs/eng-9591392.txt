Prior to that year, there were two teams to recognize the 10 players most worthy of an All-NBA selection.\n\nThe 2023-24 season is yet another landmark year in All-NBA voting as it will be the first season in which All-NBA teams will be positionless.

Players who did not see at least 20 minutes of playing time in 65 or more games are not eligible for an All-NBA selection, with an exception for those who suffered an injury deemed season-ending.\n\nThe following tables will be updated when the All-NBA Teams are revealed around 7:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday, May 22.\n\nWATCH: Stream All-NBA announcement, Timberwolves vs. Mavericks Game 1 on Sling TV\n\nNBA end-of-season awards are voted on by a global panel of 100 sportswriters and broadcasters, though it appears only 99 responses have been counted in 2023-24.\n\nFor All-NBA, each voter chooses the five players they deem most worth for First, Second and Third Teams.

While there's no way to top Duncan when All-NBA teams are announced, Wemby can join the game's greatest power forward in one regard. No Spurs rookie has made the first, second or third All-NBA team since Duncan.\n\nTim Duncan's All-NBA history\n\nWhen Duncan earned a first team nod in 1998, he became the first rookie to make the league's top squad since Larry Bird in 1980. It marked the first of eight consecutive selections to the ceremonial team, a span that encompassed his two NBA MVP's in 2002 and '03 and the first three NBA championships ('99, '03, '05) in Spurs history. The Hall-of-Famer made the first team again in 2007 and '13, leading the Silver and Black to the Finals in each of those two seasons, including another title in '07.\n\nBy the time his legendary 19-year career was over, Duncan had 15 All-NBA selections with three appearances on the Second Team (2006, '08, '09) and two on the Third Team ('10, '15). Interestingly enough, the top overall pick of the 1997 NBA Draft didn't receive All-NBA honors in '14, when he helped guide San Antonio to its fifth and most recent championship.\n\nSpurs All-NBA history\n\nBehind Duncan's 15 All-NBA selections, David Robinson ranks second in franchise history with ten. \"The Admiral\" earned first team nods in 1991, '92, '95 and '96. His only league MVP came in '95 when Robinson led the organization on its best season to that point with 62 wins and a trip to the Conference Finals where it lost to the eventual champion Houston Rockets. The first pick of the 1987 draft made the Second Team in '94 and '98 and the third team in '90, '93, '00 and '01. Similar to Duncan in 2014, Robinson curiously didn't receive All-NBA recognition during either season in which he won a championship, including in '99 when he was easily the team's second best player.\n\nGeorge Gervin made seven All-NBA teams and would've made more had the NBA featured a third team during his days. The franchise's first star, the \"Iceman\" earned First Team honors consecutively from 1978 to '82 with a couple of Second Team nods sandwiched around that five year span.\n\nKawhi Leonard fills out the list of Spurs who've made the league's first team. The two-time Defensive Player of the year's two nods with the Spurs both came on the First Team in 2016 and '17.\n\nHall of Fame point guard Tony Parker earned four All-NBA selections. His three nods on the Second Team coincided with the franchise's return to a championship level from 2012-'14. He made the Third Team in '09.\n\nFellow Hall-of-Famer and fellow \"Big 3\" member Manu Ginobili earned All-NBA Third Team spots in 2008 when he won the league's Sixth Man of the Year and in '11.\n\nRounding out the list of Spurs who've made All-NBA teams are LaMarcus Aldridge (Second Team 2015, '18 and Third Team '16), Alvin Robertson who made the Second Team when he won the Defensive Player of the Year in '86, and Dennis Rodman, whose Third Team appearance came in that aforementioned '95 campaign.\n\nWembanyama's first bid to join this group revolves around a Rookie of the Year, All-Defensive First Team season that saw him average 21.4 points, 10.6 rebounds, a league leading 3.6 blocks, 3,9 assists and 1.2 steals in just 29.7 minutes per game.", "source": {"uri":

These players, in case it wasn't clear, are considered the cream of the crop, the true and genuine superstars who defined this past NBA regular season best.\n\nBut getting picked for All-NBA means a lot more to some guys this year than others. While I'm sure the Denver Nuggets' Nikola Jokic and the Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo will appreciate likely All-NBA picks, they are firmly entrenched both financially and within the league's greater pantheon. It just means less to them at this point in their respective illustrious careers. Other younger stars who are still establishing themselves after breakout years need an All-NBA pick to really cement their potential earnings, at least according to the league's collective bargaining agreement.\n\nHere are the five NBA stars with the most to gain and lose from the All-NBA selections.\n\n1 Shooting guard, Anthony Edwards, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nThe two-time All-Star is just 22 years old and has his entire career ahead of him. Even still, it'd be nice for him to get a bigger day for the next phase of his days in Minnesota. If Edwards is picked for any of the three All-NBA teams, he will get a 30 percent max contract extension (roughly $40 million more) on his next deal.\n\n2 Small forward, Jaylen Brown, Boston Celtics\n\nThe veteran Celtics forward has established himself as one of the NBA's finer two-way players. Should he earn an All-NBA spot, he will also be in line for up to a $2.2 million bonus one year after signing the richest contract in league history.\n\n3 Center, Domantas Sabonis, Sacramento Kings\n\nSabonis has established himself as one of the best passing bigs of the modern era. If the Kings star gets picked for an All-NBA team, he will get up to a $1.3 million bonus.\n\n4 Point guard, Tyrese Haliburton, Indiana Pacers\n\nHaliburton's ascent has coincided with the best Pacers team in over a decade.

Other notable selections on the team include Nikola Joki\u0107 (first team), Jayson Tatum (first team), Luka Don\u010di\u0107 (first team), Giannis Antetokounmpo (first team) and Anthony Edwards (second team).\n\nJoki\u0107 and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who made the first team for the second straight season, were the only unanimous picks. Don\u010di\u0107 finished one second-place vote shy of being a unanimous selection.\n\nEach of the five players on the first received at least 400 total points in the voting. Jalen Brunson received the most votes of anyone on the second team with 98 total (37 first place, 61 second place) and 368 points.\n\nJames was able to keep his streak of consecutive All-NBA selections going after the best season for a player his age (39) in league history. He averaged 25.7 points, 8.3 assists and 7.3 rebounds in 71 starts for the Lakers.\n\nThe future Hall of Famer became the oldest player in NBA history to shoot at least 40 percent from three-point range (41.0).\n\nNikola Joki\u0107, who won his third career MVP award earlier this month, returned to the All-NBA first team after being relegated to the second team last year when the voting was still determined by position.\n\nEven if the positional rules still applied, Joki\u0107 would have been a lock for the first team. He tied his career-high with 26.4 points per game, while averaging 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists in 79 starts for the Denver Nuggets.\n\nAntetokounmpo was able to extend the longest active streak of first-team selections in the NBA to six. The 29-year-old was the first player in league history to average at least 30 points per game and shoot at least 60 percent from the field.\n\nRight behind Antetokounmpo on the streak of consecutive first-team selections is Don\u010di\u0107. The Dallas Mavericks superstar has made it in each of the past five seasons.\n\nThis was arguably the best season of Don\u010di\u0107's career with 33.9 points, 9.8 assists and 9.2 rebounds per game. His third-place showing in the MVP voting was the highest of his career.\n\nTatum is the first Boston Celtics player to make All-NBA first team in three consecutive years since Larry Bird did it in nine straight seasons from 1979 to '88.\n\nThe two biggest winners from the All-NBA voting were Anthony Edwards and Tyrese Haliburton. Both players have already signed max extensions with their clubs that will kick in with the 2024-25 season, but earning All-NBA honors bumps them up to supermax deals.\n\nInstead of the 25 percent max that Edwards and Haliburton would have been owed under the standard max, they will now make the 30 percent supermax. This translates to approximately $245.3 million over the next five years.\n\nHaliburton is the first player for the Indiana Pacers to make the All-NBA team since Victor Oladipo was a third-team selection in 2017-18.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_wells@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Adam Wells", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Oladipo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victor Oladipo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1716418431/vv4swirgjpdrchbpwhnh.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9591392", "eventUri": "eng-9591392", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

He ranked among the top forwards in scoring, assists, and clutch points this season, showcasing his elite skills. James' consistent dominance, All-Star appearances, and winning percentages highlight his sustained greatness following his 21st season in the league.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James made history following the NBA's announcement of the 2023-24 regular season All-NBA Teams.\n\nJames' Third Team nod marks the 20th time he's been named to one of the three teams. That extends his record by five selections over a trio of current and future Hall-of-Famers in Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kobe Bryant and Tim Duncan.\n\nThe 39-year-old looked anything but his age, as he finished in the top-ten among all forwards in several statistical categories on the campaign while posting a career-high 41 percent clip from the three-point line.\n\nLeBron James' Statistical Rankings Among NBA Forwards in 2023-24 (min. 50 games played/82 3-pointers made)\n\nCategory\n\nAverage\n\nPositional Rank\n\nPoints\n\n25.7 PPG\n\nNo. 4\n\nRebounds\n\n7.3 RPG\n\nNo. 10*\n\nAssists\n\n8.3 APG\n\nNo. 1\n\nSteals\n\n1.3 SPG\n\nNo. 5\n\n3-Point Percentage\n\n41% 3PT\n\nNo. 13\n\nHis gaudy stats only tell half the story. James' athleticism did not regress, neither did his reliability down the stretch of games, where he scored the eighth-most clutch points in the Association at 3.5 PPG.\n\nJames Sits Atop a Prestigious List of Record All-NBA Honorees\n\nLooking at the next three closest All-NBA honorees, James passed Abdul-Jabbar with his 20th All-Star appearance this season, as well as the legendary center and Bryant his ascent to the top of the NBA's all-time scoring list last year.\n\nThe Ohio native's excellence over the course of the 82-game slate brings to light four key indicators of a player's dominance year-in and year-out -- longevity, volume scoring, All-Star selections and elite winning percentages -- areas that he and his three fellow NBA 75th Anniversary Team members including Duncan rank highly in, including the top-five all-time in seasons played and All-Star selections.\n\nTop Four Players With The Most All-NBA Nods\n\nPlayer\n\nSeasons\n\nAll-Star Selections\n\n50-Win Seasons\n\n20 PPG Seasons\n\nLeBron James\n\n21\n\n20\n\n12\n\n21\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar\n\n20\n\n19\n\n16\n\n17\n\nKobe Bryant\n\n20\n\n18\n\n11\n\n15\n\nTim Duncan\n\n19\n\n15\n\n18\n\n9\n\nRegular seasons spent in the league attest to how long a star was able to sustain their level of greatness. All-Star nods tell how good a player was in the first half of the year and if they were able to maintain their play and outpace nine of their 24 counterparts. Further, 50-win seasons are the biggest sign of exceptional team success -- a major factor in All-NBA voting -- while 20-point-per-game season averages weigh them against the best scorers of their eras.\n\nThough the Lakers (47-35) fell three wins shy of the 50-win threshold, James put together a commendable body of work that earned him a well-deserved All-NBA Third Team placement. The four-time league MVP came out recently and stated that he doesn't intend to retire in the short term, and will ride momentum from playing in the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, France into next season, where he can extend his All-NBA record to 21 selections.\n\nRelated 5 Potential Destinations for Lakers' LeBron James in Free Agency The 39-year-old James will have plenty of options if he decides to leave Los Angeles.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clutch (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Duncan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Duncan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winning percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_75th_Anniversary_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA 75th Anniversary Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/lebrano.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9591392", "eventUri": "eng-9591392", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

He was on the Second Team last season despite finishing second in MVP voting -- making him the last in a long tradition of awkward awards contradictions before the league's new collective bargaining agreement established position-less All-NBA ballots.\n\nThis is the first year that zero or multiple centers can appear on the First Team, Second Team or Third Team. Under the old voting system, each of the three teams consisted of two guards, two forwards and one center.\n\nJokic, 29, averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and nine assists per game during the regular season, compiling 25 triple-doubles and shooting 58.3% from the field. The Nuggets outscored their opponents by 11.8 points per 100 possessions when Jokic was on the floor. They were outscored by 8.6 points per 100 possessions when he wasn't on the floor, amounting to a 20.4-point difference in net rating.\n\nBut Denver's Jokic-led starting lineup decomposed in the playoffs, culminating in a shocking Game 7 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday and a disappointing end to the season. The Nuggets were outscored by eight points with Jokic on the court in the second-round series.\n\nBetween Games 2 and 3 of the series, Jokic became the ninth three-time MVP in NBA history. During his six-year All-NBA run, only Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo has joined him in making the prestigious list each of those seasons. With Wednesday's announcement, Antetokounmpo and Luka Doncic have both made the First Team in five consecutive years.\n\nTwo Nuggets players also received votes for the 2023-24 All-Defensive Teams that were announced this week, but neither made the final cut. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope earned 11 votes for the Second Team, making him the seventh player on the outside looking in. Aaron Gordon gathered six votes for the Second Team.\n\nWith those omissions, Jokic completes the ninth season of his career still having never seen a teammate make an All-NBA team, All-Defensive team or All-Star team. Jamal Murray was not eligible for All-NBA honors this season under another new CBA guideline that mandates a 65-games-played minimum in order to appear on ballots.

He has made 10 All-NBA appearances in 15 seasons. He's one of 28 players to be named to 10 All-NBA teams, and that list is a snapshot of the most important figures in basketball history.\n\nThe list encapsulates the combination of greatness wigh longevity. It includes James -- who became the first player ever with 20 selections -- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Karl Malone, Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal, Julius Erving, Dirk Nowitzki, Jerry West, Hakeem Olajuwon, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird.\n\nAnd now Curry.\n\n\"Just to be around those names: Kobe, MJ, Tim Duncan -- Hall of Famers -- it doesn't matter if you're a fan of their team, you respect and appreciate what they've done for this game,\" said Zaza Pachulia, Curry's former teammate who never tires of talking about No. 30.\n\nPachulia played 16 NBA seasons, and Curry is entering his 16th. The two-time league MVP and four-time champion remains one of the NBA's best players.\n\nHe has done so by adding muscle to absorb more contact at the rim and compete more defensively. By using his creativity and 3-point stroke to bend the geometry of basketball to once imaginable places. By not getting complacent despite his accomplishments.\n\n\"It shows the personality, shows the character,\" Pachulia said. \"Shows the intelligence of the person, to first of all identify where you need to get better, and then obviously to put enough time and effort in the gym to make sure you get better.\"\n\nPachulia thinks Curry can play five more seasons to reach 20 years. With modern medicine and training methods, more players are extending their careers. Seven of the 10 players who have played 20 NBA seasons entered the league in 1995 or after.\n\nHow many more All-NBA seasons Curry has is the question. To pry open the Warriors' championship window, he'll have to maintain his elite level, but the team will also need to prop him up with more shot-creators and playmakers around him.\n\nThey can't ask Curry to carry the organization on his back late in his second NBA decade, because even if longevity is at an all-time high, no one's an all-world player forever.", "source": {"uri":

Jayson Tatum was already eligible because he was named All-NBA in 2022 and 2023.\n\nUnsurprisingly, MVP finalists Don\u010di\u0107 and Gilgeous-Alexander were named to the All-NBA First Team.\n\nHowever, Murray, Fox, Siakam, Ingram, Adebayo and Jaren Jackson Jr. did not make the All-NBA teams and will not be eligible for the supermax.\n\nIt should be noted that players had to appear in at least 65 games this season to be eligible for the All-NBA teams. That means Murray, who played just 59 games during the regular season, already wasn't eligible to make one of the three teams.\n\nFox and Adebayo are the most notable snubs, as they both received votes for the All-NBA teams.\n\nAdebayo averaged a double-double of 19.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 1.1 steals and 0.9 blocks per game while shooting 52.1 percent from the field and 35.7 percent from deep. He helped carry the Heat into the playoffs and figured to at least merit consideration.\n\nFox was also impressive this season as a go-to scoring threat who posted 26.6 points, 5.6 assists, 4.6 rebounds and 2.0 steals per game while shooting 46.5 percent from the field and 36.9 percent from deep.\n\nUnfortunately for both players, it wasn't enough to land on the All-NBA teams and become eligible for supermax deals.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_polacek@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Scott Polacek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De'Aaron_Fox", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "De'Aaron Fox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaren_Jackson_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaren Jackson Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Ingram", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Ingram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1716422854/vtydgkhfhjmmjhuvmfmm.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9591392", "eventUri": "eng-9591392", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

They were already having a pretty good month of May, and it just got even better.\n\nEdwards was selected to the 2024 All-NBA second team and Haliburton was selected to the 2024 All-NBA third team. Along with the honor, they each got a $40 million raise.\n\nBoth players signed rookie contract extensions last summer that were due to be worth at least 25% of the salary cap (five years, $204 million), with the potential to increase to 30% of the cap (five years, $245 million) if they made an All-NBA team this year.\n\nTo be eligible, both players needed to play at least 65 games, per the rule in the 2023 collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) and the league. That was no problem for Edwards, who played in 79 games. Haliburton, however, missed 10 contests in January due to a hamstring injury and had to return quickly and avoid resting games thereafter to hit the threshold.\n\nThe players have the 2011 CBA, and specifically the \"Derrick Rose Rule\" (officially named the \"5th year, 30% max criteria\"), to thank for their earnings bumps. The clause allows a player to re-sign with his current team to earn a salary greater than the typical maximum starting in his fifth season if at least one among a list of criteria is met. One of those criteria is being named to an All-NBA team in the most recent season.\n\nEdwards' case was airtight. He averaged 25.9 points, 5.1 assists and 5.4 rebounds per game to go along with above-average defense for the team with the fourth-best record in the NBA.\n\nHaliburton was a closer call. He scored 20.1 points per game and his 10.9 assists per game led the league, but both of those marks, as well as his shooting percentages, dropped after his injury. His complete body of work, though, got him across the finish line.\n\nOther players secured the bag as well. There was no doubt that Luka Doncic was going to get a first team All-NBA nod, but in doing so he became eligible to sign a \"supermax\" contract worth 35% of the cap in the 2025 offseason that would kick in starting with the 2026-27 season. The theoretical five-year deal could be worth more than $80 million in its final season.\n\nOn the flip side, several players missed out on big money. Miami Heat center Bam Adebayo, for instance, needed a selection to be able to sign a lucrative supermax extension, but he missed the cut. Philadelphia 76ers guard Tyrese Maxey will have his next deal limited to 25% of the cap as opposed to 30%.\n\nIn all, the Western Conference had more All-NBA players than Eastern Conference for the 26 straight season.\n\nA system in which the values of contracts lasting four or five years vary so greatly based on just one year of performance is questionable. Even more dubious is the fact that those eight-figure dollar swings are determined by a vote of third-party media members. ESPN senior writer Zach Lowe said that he surrendered his ballot this season because his influence on player contracts felt \"icky.\"\n\nDetermining the salaries of players is a responsibility that many voters wish they didn't have. \"There's some Haliburton guilt there where I think if it's close and a contract extension is on the line, I'd be more likely to vote for that player,\" awards voter Ryen Russillo said on The Bill Simmons Podcast in April. \"I'm just trying to be transparent.\"\n\nNobody seems pleased with the flawed status quo, but ultimately the players agreed to it. For Edwards and Haliburton, it worked out. Whoever is up for a raise next year might not be so lucky.", "source": {"uri": "sportico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportico.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lev_akabas@sportico.com", "name": "Lev Akabas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Simmons", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bill Simmons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Continental Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Players_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Players Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_bargaining", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Collective bargaining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.sportico.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2153753331-e1716404292152.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9591392", "eventUri": "eng-9591392", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

He has six first team accolades in previous years. Durant also secured one vote for all-defensive team voting.\n\nThis is Booker's second All-NBA nod, gaining first team honors in 2022.\n\nThe Suns won 49 games in 2023-24 but were swept by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of action.\n\nNew coach Mike Budenholzer - who is taking over for the freshly fired Frank Vogel - is excited to get to work with his new star players.\n\n\"We have some great players in Devin and Kevin and Brad. They're big time, so I think they know that I'm gonna have high expectations of them,\" Budenholzer said at his introductory press conference.\n\n\"I'm gonna coach them, I'm gonna hold them accountable. But that's what I'm gonna do with everybody, and so it's not any different. That's kind of been my roadmap for coaching, whether it's the best players or the entire roster.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Budenholzer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Budenholzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domantas_Sabonis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domantas Sabonis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4385,h_2466,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_suns/01hyhc2jhkkv7yby0qx6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9591392", "eventUri": "eng-9591392", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 243368570, "title": "Home Affairs Minister Speaks Out on Attack on Police Commissioner\u2019s Residence", "text": "After almost four days, the Minister of Home Affairs, Kareem Musa, has broken his silence on the attack on the Police Commissioner\u2019s home. His home was shot up four days ago, but it is only today that Musa is speaking on the brazen violence. On Monday night, only hours after the SOE was declared, four men on two motorcycles opened fire on Williams\u2019 home while his son was inside alone. Since then, police have detained one of the perpetrators, 21-year-old Threvane Thomas, who was arraigned in the Belmopan Magistrates\u2019 Court on charges of aggravated assault today. According to Musa, the incident is a clear indication the police need to crack down and go after criminals wreaking havoc on society. Kareem Musa, Minister of Home Affairs: \u201cIt is, in my opinion, a very egregious and brazen attack on one of our most prominent public servants, the Commissioner of Police. And our ministry and the government on the whole we absolutely condemn this type of reaction from these gang elements, who in my opinion are trying to make a statement. I can tell you that individual has already been detained, he has already been charged with the offense of aggravated assault with possession of a prohibited firearm. And so that person will be spending some time at Hattieville, at Kolby Foundation, but he did not act in isolation. He acted in concert with other individuals. We already have information on who those individuals are, and the police are actively pursuing those individuals.\u201d Musa responded to the LOO\u2019s sentiments on the shooting, indicating that it proves the Commissioner\u2019s time in office should come to an end. He also refuted Barrow\u2019s remarks on the SOE, and whether it solves the root causes of crime. Kareem Musa, Minister of Home Affairs: \u201cIt\u2019s funny that comments like that come from an individual who was once a part of that lifestyle. In his 10 year incarceration, when he went into that nightclub along with Diddy, when he went to all those parties, you never once heard Shyne Barrow blame the police. Did you ever hear that? Did any of you hear that it\u2019s the police\u2019s fault why he made the personal decision to hang out with individuals like Diddy to have gone into the club and to have shot up a club? You don\u2019t hear those individuals blaming the police. And so these are personal decisions that one makes. I will say that this particular period over the last week reminds me eerily a lot of what took place under the United Democratic Party. All of these murders happening every other day, it is eerily similar to what happened then. And that is why it is absolutely important for us to stem that tide of violent crimes taking place. Because as you know, and I\u2019ve said it time and time again, it is no coincidence that we were able to reduce the homicide rate last year to 87, which was not done since the year 2005. The year before that, 113. Again, you\u2019re looking at an era of the United Democratic Party where crime and violence was promulgated and promoted and you had an average of 140 murders a year. We do not want to get back to there and so we will use every single tool in the toolkit to ensure that we do not go backwards. And so, yes, the state of emergency might be an extreme measure, but it\u2019s an important one for us at this time, because we realize the escalation that was taking place to this very brazen and egregious level that we have not seen in Belize for quite some time. \u201c Musa also denies that the SOE\u2019s extension is a first and noted that the same was done under the Barrow administration.", "summary": "After almost four days, the Minister of Home Affairs, Kareem Musa, has broken his silence on the attack on the Police Commissioner\u2019s home.

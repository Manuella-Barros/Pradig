A pool report from Ms. Harris\u2019 press office from a New York Times journalist said Clio Calvo-Platero, the deputy communications director for the Biden campaign\u2019s Nevada operation, cut off the voters once they questioned the president\u2019s mental acuity. Voter Amy Nelson said the debate was \u201cterrible\u201d and was immediately interrupted by Mr. Calvo-Platero when she said, \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me that there\u2019s not anyone better.\u201d The Biden campaign official stopped her mid-sentence. \u201cWe\u2019re at a Joe Biden event, so I\u2019m going to cut you off there, sorry,\u201d according to the pool report written by Simon Levien. Another voter, Stephen Stubbs, who identified as undecided, criticized Mr. Biden\u2019s \u201cmental acuity,\u201d asking, \u201cWho\u2019s running the country?\u201d Mr. Stubbs said Ms. Harris should be the nominee if Mr. Biden steps aside. \u201cLet Kamala in,\u201d he said, according to the dispatch. Mr. Calvo-Platero again intervened. \u201cI\u2019m going to stop it here, sorry. If I can, it\u2019s a Biden event. Is that OK?\u201d he said. The event was aimed at reaching out to Hispanic voters and featured several Democratic politicians including Ms. Harris, Nevada Sens. Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez-Masto, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Grisham. Ms. Harris acknowledged Mr. Biden\u2019s poor debate performance at the event, insisting the race won\u2019t be decided based on \u201cone night in June.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s widely panned performance, featuring a raspy voice, trailing answers and a low-key stage presence, sparked widespread panic in the Democratic Party and talk of replacing him as the nominee.", "summary": "A Biden campaign official stepped in and stopped voters from talking to the press at a Las Vegas event featuring Vice President Kamala Harris because they criticized President Biden's debate performance.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jun/28/biden-campaign-official-stops-voters-from-taking-t/", "image": "https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/06/28/Harris_Las_Vegas_57757.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:16:31", "author": "Jeff Mordock", "authors": ["Jeff Mordock"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.515}

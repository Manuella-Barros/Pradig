The eight-page detailed verdict has been signed by Chief Election Commissioner Justice (retd) Sardar Muhammad Raza and all four members of the ECP.\n\nThe verdict stated that \"in view of section 103A of ROPA, 1976, the commission is vested with the same powers of contempt as are vested in a high court under Article 204 of the Constitution\".\n\nReferring to the delaying tactics employed by Khan's lawyer, the verdict stated that \"various adjournments were sought on various pretexts. Different Vakalatnamas were filed and at the end, Babar Awan was engaged who raised an objection to the proceedings on the ground that the ECP had no powers to precede for its contempt\".\n\nReferring to Khan's lawyer's argument that with the repeal of Contempt of Court Act, 1976, the ECP had lost the powers of contempt, the verdict states that \"whenever an institution is vested with such executive-cum-judicial powers and, above all, to maintain its independence, it has to be vested with powers to implement its orders in case those are not complied with\". It stated that \"so far as the powers once given to the commission are concerned those cannot be curtailed under Article 222 of the Constitution\".", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T02:02:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 251, "textStart": 242, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-10", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 482, "textStart": 473, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-23", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.9058823585510254, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374901", "time": "02:02:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374901", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "48650", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302557", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Law"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law", "score": 4}, {"id": "303301", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Muhammad"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad", "score": 2}, {"id": "303560", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Court"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court", "score": 4}, {"id": "303670", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Executive (government)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)", "score": 1}, {"id": "304357", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "score": 2}, {"id": "304737", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Khan (title)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_(title)", "score": 5}, {"id": "305403", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "score": 1}, {"id": "306470", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "score": 3}, {"id": "311676", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Contempt of court"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court", "score": 5}, {"id": "314563", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Latitude"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude", "score": 4}, {"id": "316915", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Akbar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akbar", "score": 3}, {"id": "325537", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Imran Khan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan", "score": 4}, {"id": "335568", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf", "score": 4}, {"id": "336242", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Standing (law)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_(law)", "score": 3}, {"id": "394935", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Order to show cause"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_to_show_cause", "score": 4}, {"id": "413393", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Babar Awan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babar_Awan", "score": 2}, {"id": "413429", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Election Commission of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Commission_of_Pakistan", "score": 4}, {"id": "453105", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Chief Election Commissioner of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Election_Commissioner_of_Pakistan", "score": 2}], "image": "http://nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2017-08-20/ecp-says-it-has-right-to-hear-contempt-case-against-imran-1503175929-7689.jpg", "timeCrawl": "02:02:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "ECP says it has right to hear contempt case against Imran ", "originalArticle": null}

Ronaldo, 39, is nearing the end of his career as European football's most recognisable global star. Mbappe is one of the candidates to take over.\n\nThe prospect of this encounter possibly marking their final clash is not lost on Mbapp\u00e9, who views it as a privilege to compete against his longtime inspiration. \"No matter what happened before or what happens after, he'll always be a legend of the game,\" Mbapp\u00e9 affirmed. Yet, the French forward is resolute in his ambition to progress further in the tournament, emphasizing, \"But of course we hope to win tomorrow and reach the semi-finals.\"\n\nCall it a twist of fate or whatever it's possible that Mbappe, who has been vocal about his admiration for Ronaldo, may have a role in terminating a segment of his hero's career.

It is pressing. We saw the results, it's catastrophic. We really hope it's going to change: that everyone is going to rally together, go and vote, and vote for the correct party.\"\n\nMbapp\u00e9 emphasised the importance of voting \"now, more than ever\". France's players are currently in Germany for the European Championship but they have maintained close attention on events back home and, unlike their English counterparts, a number of them have felt comfortable commenting on political matters.\n\nSpeaking on Monday after their victory over Belgium, the defender Jules Kound\u00e9 said he was \"disappointed\" with the level of support for a party that \"seek to take away our freedom and take away the fact that we live together\". He stated that previous non-voters must be persuaded to the ballot box in order to ensure the extreme right do not gain an absolute majority.\n\nBefore the tournament began, the forwards Marcus Thuram and Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 both made similar exhortations to those eligible to vote. Mbapp\u00e9 joined them, saying at the time that he is \"against extreme views and against ideas that divide people\".\n\nThose comments were criticised by, among others, the National Rally leader Jordan Bardella. Mbapp\u00e9, who recently signed for the Champions League winners Real Madrid, is France's star player and a figure whose voice holds considerable weight among the country's youth.\n\nFrance face Portugal in a quarter-final on Friday and it means Mbappe, who will again play in a mask after breaking his nose in the group stage, will face a former Real Madrid forward in Cristiano Ronaldo. It is widely held that this could be the moment Mbapp\u00e9, who is 25, takes the baton of greatness from the 39-year-old Portugal legend. \"He is one of a kind,\" Mbapp\u00e9 said. \"He has shaped football, inspired generations, scored goals.

Irvin pumped his chest and gestured to the crowd for applause after striking out Tyrone Taylor on his 99th pitch and walking off the mound following the longest outing of his major league career.

The far-right National Rally's strong results in the first round of a rushed election has darkened the ambience in Paris, a left-wing stronghold that is one of the few places in France where the party failed to break through. Some Parisians say the Olympics have become a sideshow to the political developments, which could see France getting its first far-right government since World War II.\n\nTransgender, nonbinary 1,500 runner Nikki Hiltz shines on and off track, earns spot at Paris Games\n\nEUGENE, Ore.

Away from it, the transgender and nonbinary runner serves as role model for the queer community. Hiltz competes in the female category. Hiltz ran a personal best and meet-record time of 3 minutes, 55.33 seconds at U.S. track trials last weekend to win the event and earn a spot at Paris.

After the departure of Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 (25) to Real Madrid on a free transfer, Ethan has followed him in leaving his formative club, also on a free transfer. It has been reported that Kylian's acrimonious departure from Les Parisiens soured relations between the player and the club and effectively halted all talks of a contract renewal.\n\nEthan Mbapp\u00e9 therefore left PSG on 1st July, upon the expiry of his deal. He underwent his medical with LOSC on Wednesday before signing a three-year deal on Thursday. Mbapp\u00e9 will wear the No.29 jersey with Les Dogues. After coming through the academy at PSG, Mbapp\u00e9 went on to make five first-team appearances for the club.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethan Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille_OSC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lille OSC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gaelic/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gaelic/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gaelic/Shinty", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gaelic/Shinty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Clubs", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/get_french_football_news_702/66e3c9bf4580ef5210136149f784b22c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9707240", "eventUri": "eng-9707240", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 623, "textEnd": 631}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

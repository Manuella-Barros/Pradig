Simone Biles' Podium Behavior: 'Literally Disgusting'", "body": "There's at least one NFL star who isn't a huge fan of decorated U.S. Olympian Simone Biles -- and he plays for the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nThree-time Pro Bowler and 2019 All-Pro first teamer Marlon Humphrey took to the social media platform X to blast Biles after the gymnast took the silver medal in the floor exercise gymnastics competition on Monday.\n\nBut Humphrey had no issue with Biles suffering a somewhat shocking upset loss (as ESPN pointed out, Biles lost for the first time in a floor finals during a major international competition).\n\nNo, the 28-year-old Humphrey appeared to have an issue with the overly-fawning way that Biles and fellow U.S. teammate Jordan Chiles, who took home the bronze, lauded the gold medal winner.\n\nFirst, some background: Brazil's Rebeca Andrade beat out Biles and Chiles for the top spot at the medal podium, winning gold with a final score that was .033 ahead of Biles' score.\n\nAnd while Biles is the one with the Netflix documentary, Andrade has a pretty inspiring story herself.\n\nAs chronicled in her Olympics profile, Andrade has overcome not one, not two, but three \"devastating\" ACL injuries that derailed her career.\n\nGiven all that, Biles and Chiles both made sure to give Andrade a little extra love on the podium stand.\n\nFor Humphrey, that exhibition of adulation was \"literally disgusting.\"\n\n\"This is literally disgusting,\" Humphrey posted from his X account on Monday, quote-posting an ESPN SportsCenter post showing Biles and Chiles bowing down and praising Andrade for her win.\n\nWhile the Ravens cornerback did not elaborate on what exactly he found disgusting, here's the caption of the post he was responding to: \"Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles showed love to Rebeca Andrade after she won her first gold medal of the Paris Olympics.\"\n\nMost of the early responses to Humphrey have been angry with the NFL star, blasting him for seemingly chiding what many were describing as \"good sportsmanship.\"\n\n\"Yeah, because giving someone their flowers who has come back from THREE ACL tears to continue to be a top gymnast is disgusting,\" one response with over 5,000 likes read.\n\nAnother response with over 7,000 likes included a graphic of Boston Red Sox legend David Ortiz destroying a bat in a fit of rage, and captioned it: \"You when people show good sportsmanship.\"\n\nMuch to the chagrin of any fans of drama, Humphrey and his Ravens do not play against the Chicago Bears this upcoming NFL season.",

Andrade is essentially the Biles of Brazil, with six Olympic medals (including a gold in vault at the Tokyo Games in 2021) and nine world championship medals (including all-around gold in 2022).\n\nGoing into the floor competition Monday, Biles and Chiles had already helped the U.S. win gold in the team competition, while Andrade and Brazil took bronze. Also in Paris, Biles had claimed gold in the all-around and vault, while Andrade took silver in both events.\n\nAfter the all-around competition last week, Biles praised Andrade.\n\n\"I don't wanna compete with Rebeca no more,\" Biles joked. \"I'm tired -- like, she's way too close. I've never had an athlete that close, so it definitely put me on my toes and it brought out the best athlete in myself. So I'm excited and proud to compete with her, but I don't like it no more. I'm getting uncomfortable, guys. I don't like that feeling. I was stressing.\"\n\nWhen Andrade edged Biles for Olympic gold in the floor competition, the two American medalists decided to pay respect on the medal stand.\n\n\"She's so amazing. She's queen,\" Biles said of Andrade afterward. \"And first it was an all-Black podium, so that was super exciting for us. But then Jordan was like, 'Should we bow to her?' And I was like, 'Absolutely.'\"\n\nChiles, whose bronze Monday was her first individual Olympic medal, added of Andrade: \"You know, she's an icon, a legend herself. So I feel like being recognized is what everybody should do when it comes to somebody who's put in the work, put in the dedication.\n\nBiles spoke of the moment again the next morning on NBC's \"Today\" show.\n\n\"I think it's all about sportsmanship, and we don't care whether we win or lose,\" Biles said. \"We're always going to keep a good face and support our competitors because they've worked just as hard as we have for that moment ... and that's exactly what me and Jordan were doing.

Andrade had suffered three ACL tears in her career before winning for the first time in Paris. She now has six Olympic medals in her career, two in gold (Andrade also won the vault final in Tokyo in 2021).\n\n'This is literally disgusting,' Humphrey wrote over SportsCenter's post capturing the moment when Biles and Chiles show love to Andrade. He later faced backlash for his take.\n\n'Yeah, because giving someone their flowers who has come back from THREE ACL tears to continue to be a top gymnast is disgusting,' a user on X shared as a reply to Humphrey's post. Another Olympic viewer echoed: 'God forbid athletes show respect to a fellow athlete who has suffered a torn ACL multiple times.'\n\nSomeone else through some said at Humphrey, telling him to 'get to a final and win something.

'This is literally beautiful,' a user pointed out in contrast to Humphery's reaction.\n\nThe three-time Pro Bowler later said that he felt the wrath of Brazil fans on social media although he seemed to have forgotten that they speak Portuguese in the South American country.\n\n'I'm lowkey getting cooked right now. I think I'm getting cussed out in Brazilian on Instagram lol,' Humphrey shared in a separate post.\n\nBiles finished the 2024 Olympics with four medals, including three in gold, to take her total count to 11.\n\nShe also praised Andrade for her keeping the bar high in gymnastics at the Olympics. 'I've never had an athlete so close,' Biles said about facing the Brazilian. 'This definitely kept me alert and brought out the best athlete in me. So I'm excited and proud to compete with her. 'I've never been so stressed before. Thank you, Rebeca.'\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The medal-winning duo bowed down on the Olympic podium to gold medal-winner Rebeca Andrade of Brazil, creating one of the best images of the games so far, and the ultimate portrait of sportsmanship.\n\nOn the TODAY Show on Tuesday, Biles opened up about the decision to bow to Andrade, which she says was Chiles' idea. Chiles, who first appeared to land in fifth in the floor event, won bronze after an inquiry boosted her score by a tenth of a point at the last second.\n\n\"I think it's all about sportsmanship, and we don't care whether we win or lose. We're always going to keep a good face and support our competitors because they've worked just as hard as we have for that moment,\" Biles said on TODAY.\n\n\"So you have to give them their flowers,\" she continued. \"And that's exactly what me and Jordan were doing, and we were so happy for her. She deserved it. She had the best floor routine of the day and in the Olympics. So it's like, yeah, she deserved it.\"\n\nIt was the first gold medal for Andrade at the 2024 Olympics, and Biles and Chiles made sure she got her due. Andrade had a long journey to her individual floor medal, including recovery from three separate ACL tears in her career.\n\nAndrade's gold medal on Monday came after she and Team Brazil battled the United States for gold in the women's team final earlier at the Paris Olympics.\n\nBaltimore Ravens defensive back Marlon Humphrey found out this week what it's like to be on the wrong side of a bad sports take. After Team USA stars Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles bowed to gold medal-winner Rebeca Andrade of Brazil on the podium after the individual floor finals, Humphrey posted on social media: \"This is literally disgusting.\"\n\nAs it turns out, not many people agree with Humphrey's opinion. His post on X has over 7.5 million views one day after he decided to share his thoughts, it also has more than seven thousand responses.\n\n\"This is literally beautiful,\" a poster responded. Another wrote: \"God forbid athletes show respect to a fellow athlete who has suffered a torn ACL multiple times.\"\n\nHumphrey acknowledged the backlash to his take in another post hours later on X. He wrote: \"I'm lowkey getting cooked right now.

She secured the victory in the Women's Floor: Artistic Gymnastics, marking her first gold this summer. While receiving her medal, both USA stars Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles, who won silver and bronze, praised the Brazilian star by bowing to her on the podium.\n\nIt was an awesome moment for Andrade, as she's overcome three ACL injuries throughout her career. So, while standing on the podium, Biles and Chiles showed her some love in what has become one of the most iconic photos of the 2024 Olympic Games.\n\nThe moment captured love and support from sports fans around the world. However, Baltimore Ravens star cornerback, Marlon Humphrey, seemed to dislike the heartwarming moment altogether. Humphrey shared a four-word take that brought a ton of negative attention his way.Sports\n\nSports fans were quick to defend Biles and Chiles for bowing down to Andrade at the Olympic podium during the medal ceremony. Many let Humphrey know about Andrade's injury history and why the praise is warranted. Meanwhile, others made sure remind the Ravens star that he himself has yet to win a championship in the NFL.\n\nThis dude got straight to the point.\n\nDoes Humphrey hate good sportsmanship?\n\nAndrade has one of the most incredible comeback stories in sports.\n\nLooks like Humphrey got exposed on this one.\n\nHumphrey and the Ravens keep coming short in the NFL Playoffs.\n\nAndrade suffered her first ACL injury back in 2015 that required reconstructive surgery. She was unable to compete in that years World Championships. The Brazilian star bounced back but faced a second ACL tear in 2017. After recovering, Andrade returned a year later but suffered yet another ACL injury on the same knee in 2019 while doing her floor routine during the Brazilian Nationals.\n\nShe has not suffered any injuries since then and has remained healthy. The Brazilian star has been stiff competition for Biles and Chiles throughout the 2024 Olympics.\n\nAltogether, Andrade won one gold, two silver, and one bronze this year. Throughout her career, Andrade has won a total of six medals (two gold, three silver, one bronze), making her the most decorated Brazilian Olympian in the country's history.

The controversy began on Monday after the women's floor exercise finals concluded. Viewers watched as Biles and her teammate Jordan Chiles, who finished in second and third place, respectively, paid tribute to Brazilian gymnast Rebeca Andrade. As Andrade stood on the highest podium, receiving the gold medal, her American counterparts turned to her and bowed, acknowledging her outstanding performance. In no time, Simone Biles and Chiles's bow sparked a wave of admiration online. However, the beautiful gesture didn't sit right with everybody, particularly Marlon Humphrey. Minutes after the results came in, the NFL star took to X to slam Biles and her teammate.\n\n\"This is literally disgusting,\" he wrote over SportsCenter's post capturing the iconic moment.\n\nHumphrey's bizarre take subjected him to heavy criticism from angry fans.\n\n\"Get to a final and win something. Then you can talk,\" one person wrote. Another person commented, \"Who are you? Even in your sport, people don't know who you are, and you want to judge three of the greatest in the world at their sport?\"\n\nDespite the backlash, Humphrey seemed unbothered.\n\n\"I'm lowkey getting cooked right now. I think I'm getting cussed out in Brazilian on Instagram lol,\" he wrote in a tweet in response to the criticism.\n\nMeanwhile, Simone Biles has defended her decision to bow to Andrade amid Marlon Humphrey's criticism. Speaking on the Today Show on Tuesday, the athlete revealed it was simply an act of sportsmanship. \"I think it's all about sportsmanship, and we don't care whether we win or lose,\" she said. Biles added that it was important to support competitors because they worked just as hard.\n\n\"We have to give them their flowers and that's exactly what me and Jordan were doing,\" she noted.\n\nBiles also shared that she and her teammate were just happy for Andrade. The American superstar concluded by explaining that the Brazilian gymnast deserved it, as she had the best floor routine of the day and the Olympics. Indeed, Andrade deserved all her accolades, considering she suffered three ACL tears in the past.

'She's such an excitement to watch and then all the fans in the crowd were always cheering for her, so it was just the right thing to do.\n\n'It was an all-black podium so that was super-exciting for us, but then Jordan was like \"should we bow to her?\" and I was like \"absolutely\".'\n\nAndrade, meanwhile, appreciated the gesture from the American duo, saying: 'It was very cute of them.\n\n'They are the world's best athletes and what they did means a lot to me. We're always rooting for each other, the final is very difficult for everyone.'\n\nParis 2024 is expected to be Biles' final Olympic Games but she has not ruled out competing in 2028 when the show heads to Los Angeles.\n\n'You know, you never say never,' she said.

Clear video shows New York Giants rookie starting fight with Detroit Lions for second straight day\n\nThree-time NFL Pro Bowler Marlon Humphrey has issued an apology following his controversial tweet that criticized Team USA gymnasts Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles. Humphrey's tweet, which described the gymnasts' actions as \"disgusting,\" sparked significant backlash on social media.\n\nThe incident occurred after Biles and Chiles congratulated Brazil's Rebeca Andrade on her gold medal in the women's floor routine. Both American gymnasts bowed to Andrade, acknowledging her remarkable journey back from multiple serious injuries. Andrade, who had suffered three torn ACL injuries over four years, made a triumphant return to claim gold in the vault event at the Tokyo Olympics and continued to excel in the current competition, posing a strong challenge to Biles in the All-Around category.\n\nIn an interview on the TODAY show, Biles emphasized the importance of sportsmanship in gymnastics. \"I think it's all about sportsmanship, and we don't care whether we win or lose. We're always going to keep a good face and support our competitors because they've worked just as hard as we have for that moment,\" she stated. Biles further explained their gesture towards Andrade, saying, \"So you have to give them their flowers. And that's exactly what me and Jordan were doing, and we were so happy for her. She deserved it. She had the best floor routine of the day and in the Olympics. So it's like, yeah, she deserved it.\"\n\nHumphrey faced immediate criticism for his comments. Reflecting on the backlash, he tweeted, \"I'm lowkey getting cooked right now.

It's beautiful to see.\"\n\nBiles, the most decorated American Olympic gymnast of all time, appeared to have put together another stunning performance but landing out of bounds twice cost the US star six-tenths of a point, enough to bring her score down to 14.133 behind gold medalist Andrade, who scored a 14.166.\n\nBut Biles, who now has 11 Olympic medals including seven golds, seemed to take the disappointment in her stride as she hailed Andrade as the new ruler of the floor.\n\n\"She's so amazing. She's queen,\" Biles said of Andrade on Monday. \"And first it was an all-Black podium, so that was super exciting for us. But then Jordan was like, 'Should we bow to her?' And I was like, 'Absolutely.' So we're like, 'Are we gonna do it now?' And then, that's why we did it.\"\n\nChiles, who won bronze in a dramatic twist after she challenged the judges' score, said she wanted to make sure that Andrade got the praise she felt the Brazilian deserved and that the new gold medalist is one of the kinder competitors to go up against.\n\n\"You know, she's an icon, a legend herself,\" Chiles said. \"So I feel like being recognized is what everybody should do when it comes to somebody who's put in the work, put in the dedication.\n\n\"So yeah, in that moment, I was like ... first off, again, yes, it was an all-Black podium. Second off, why don't we just give her flowers? She's given, you know, not only has she given Simone her flowers, but a lot of us on, in the United States our flowers as well, so giving it back is what makes it so beautiful.

But during her final competition, she stepped to the side and paid her respects to her fiercest competitor in an outstanding display of sportsmanship.\n\nDespite her best attempts, Biles placed second during the women's floor exercise final. The gold medal went to Brazil's Rebeca Andrade, who won just fractions of a point ahead of Biles. In a heartwarming gesture, Biles and Jordan Chiles, who came in third place, bowed for Andrade when she stepped onto the podium to receive her medal. The Brazilian gymnast raised her fists to celebrate her victory, before grabbing her competitors hands as a way to thank them.\n\nBiles' action trascended the language barrier that has marked her interactions with Andrade throughout the Olympics. Since Andrade speaks Portuguese, it has been reported that their exchanges have been limited to giggling, enthusiastic nodding, and hand gesturing. By bowing to Andrade, Biles and Chiles reminded the world that sportsmanship is a universal language.\n\n\"I have so much respect for her. She's such a good competitor,\" Biles said about Andrade after the medal ceremony. \"She keeps me on my toes. It's an honor to get to compete with her.\"\n\nAndrade has had many obstacles on her way to Olympic glory. Born in a favela, her mother worked as a maid to provide for her and her siblings. When her mother couldn't afford to pay for her daughter's bus ticket to practice, Andrade and her older brother walked two hours each way to get to her gym. More recently, she overcome adversity after tearing her ACL three times. She is now Brazil's most decorated Olympic athlete, having won four medals -- one gold, two silver, and one bronze -- in Paris 2024.\n\nOn top of the formidable scene, the three athletes also made history. Rebeca Andrade, Simone Biles, and Jordan Chiles made up the first-ever all-Black podium in men's or women's gymnastics at the Olympics. Just days before, Andrade, Biles, and Suni Lee made up the first all-around gymnast podium to be comprised entirely of people of color.\n\nMeanwhile, the women's gymnastics balance beam podium was also the stage of a multicultural endearing scene. Italian gymnasts Alice D'Amato, who won gold, and Manila Esposito, who got the bronze medal, bit their medals for the cameras. Chinese gymnast Zhou Yaqin, who came in second, was caught doing a double take and, to blend in, excitedly placed her medal in front of her mouth. If the Olympics are about athletes from all over coming together, the women's gymnastics podiums are where sisterhood truly takes place.\n\nGymnast With Spinal Injury Turns To Shooting and Wins Guatemala's First-Ever Gold Medal at Olympics\n\nOlympic Champion Simone Biles Fires Back at Negative Comments About Her Hair and Her Team\n\nOlympian Simone Biles Gifts Teammate Suni Lee's Dad a New Electric Wheelchair", "source": {"uri": "mymodernmet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My Modern Met"}, "authors": [{"uri": "regina_sienra@mymodernmet.com", "name": "Regina Sienra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebeca_Andrade", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebeca Andrade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_Esposito", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manila Esposito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_D'Amato", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alice D'Amato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shooting sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multiculturalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guatemala"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Guatemala"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://mymodernmet.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/simone-biles-jordan-chiles-bow-rebeca-andrade-fb.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793570", "eventUri": "eng-9793570", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The first time was during the team event where the Americans finished with a gold medal, while Brazil landed the bronze. Andrade also later won silver in two individual events -- vault and all-around -- where Biles nabbed the gold.\n\nDespite the American star repeatedly standing in the Brazilian's way for gold, Andrade always made sure to show Biles some major love.\n\nBiles was able to return the favor on Monday when Andrade bested her in the floor exercise event. Both Biles and bronze medalist Jordan Chiles went viral for bowing down to the gold medalist Andrade at the podium.\n\nThe two Olympic stars haven't needed to verbally communicate to show respect for one another.

So you have to give them their flowers, and that's exactly what me and Jordan were doing, and we were so happy for her. She deserved it -- she had the best floor routine of that day and of the Olympics, so it's like, yeah, she deserved it!\"\n\nWell, it's hard to go against that response!

It's beautiful to see.\"\n\nBiles, the most decorated American Olympic gymnast of all time, appeared to have put together another stunning performance but landing out of bounds twice cost the US star six-tenths of a point, enough to bring her score down to 14.133 behind gold medalist Andrade, who scored a 14.166.\n\nBut Biles, who now has 11 Olympic medals including seven golds, seemed to take the disappointment in her stride as she hailed Andrade as the new ruler of the floor.\n\n\"She's so amazing. She's queen,\" Biles said of Andrade on Monday. \"And first it was an all-Black podium, so that was super exciting for us. But then Jordan was like, 'Should we bow to her?' And I was like, 'Absolutely.' So we're like, 'Are we gonna do it now?' And then, that's why we did it.\"\n\nChiles, who won bronze in a dramatic twist after she challenged the judges' score, said she wanted to make sure that Andrade got the praise she felt the Brazilian deserved and that the new gold medalist is one of the kinder competitors to go up against.\n\n\"You know, she's an icon, a legend herself,\" Chiles said. \"So I feel like being recognized is what everybody should do when it comes to somebody who's put in the work, put in the dedication.\n\n\"So yeah, in that moment, I was like ... first off, again, yes, it was an all-Black podium. Second off, why don't we just give her flowers? She's given, you know, not only has she given Simone her flowers, but a lot of us on, in the United States our flowers as well, so giving it back is what makes it so beautiful.

On Aug. 5, Team USA's Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles shared the first all-Black podium in Olympic gymnastics history, alongside Brazil's Rebeca Andrade. With Andrade taking home the gold medal for women's floor exercise, Biles and Chiles decided to bow on either side of Andrade at the historic podium ceremony in a particularly poignant act of sportsmanship.\n\n\"I love Rebeca, she's absolutely amazing. She's an amazing person and [an] even better gymnast,\" Biles said in a follow-up press conference. \"I can't say enough good things about her. She keeps me on my toes, she makes me want to perform better.\" In the same interview, Biles revealed that it was actually Chiles's idea to bow to Andrade at the ceremony. \"First, it was an all-Black podium, so that was super exciting for us, but then Jordan was like, 'Should we bow to her?' and I was like, 'Absolutely,'\" Biles said. \"It was just the right thing to do.\"\n\nThe impact of an all-Black podium was not lost on Chiles, whose bronze placement marks her first individual Olympic medal. For her, bowing was an act of respect -- a way to acknowledge all of her competitor's hard work. \"[Rebeca is] an icon, a legend herself, so I feel like being recognized is what everybody should do when it comes to somebody who's put in the work, put in the dedication,\" Chiles said in the post-podium press conference.\n\nViewers were quick to express their appreciation on social media, with one commenter writing, \"The talented US ladies show what many of us here think -- [that] there is room to appreciate more than one great at the top.\" With Andrade having grown up in poverty, Biles becoming an advocate for mental health, and Chiles speaking out about the racism and body-shaming she's faced, all three athletes have overcome massive hardships to get to where they are today.\n\nUltimately, this moment on the podium was a historic snapshot of Black women uplifting and supporting one another, even in the midst of competition. \"Yes, it was an all-Black podium -- second off, why don't we just give [Rebeca] her flowers?\" Chiles said at the press conference. \"Not only has she given Simone her flowers, but [she's given] a lot of us in the United States our flowers as well, so giving it back is what makes it so beautiful.\"", "source": {"uri": "popsugar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POPSUGAR UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chandler_plante@popsugar.com", "name": "Chandler Plante", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_and_arrow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bow and arrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebeca_Andrade", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebeca Andrade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/oFEifl61PCIELSZyZqgnd5ktoAg=/0x94:5295x2742/fit-in/5305x3664/top/filters:format_auto():quality(85):upscale()/2024/08/06/981/n/1922729/dd92124166b2a4c47609d7.60542479_.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793570", "eventUri": "eng-9793570", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 128, "textEnd": 134}], "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Bit harsh.\n\nSpeaking to the TODAY show on August 6, Biles defended the gesture.\n\nShe said: \"I think it's all about sportsmanship, and we don't care whether we win or lose.\n\n\"We're always going to keep a good face and support our competitors because they've worked just as hard as we have for that moment.\"\n\nShe added: \"You have to give them their flowers and that's exactly what me and Jordan were doing.\n\n\"We were so happy for her. She deserved it, she had the best floor routine of the day, and of the Olympics.\"\n\nAnd Biles was not the only person who was left unimpressed by Humphrey's post.\n\nOne wrote: \"God forbid athletes show respect to a fellow athlete who has suffered a torn ACL multiple times.\"\n\nA second posted: \"Yeah, because giving someone their flowers who has come back from THREE ACL tears to continue to be a top gymnast is disgusting.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a stinging rebuke, a third told him to 'get to a final and win something.

They reshaped their sport during almost two decades of competing against each other.\n\nIn tennis, most recently Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal constantly battled each other. Each one knew that when they played one of the others, they had to be in peak form. Or suffer defeat. There was mutual respect between the trio as they played their part in altering the landscape of men's tennis.\n\nIn modern gymnastics, American Simone Biles has been the standout athlete. She has dominated beyond comprehension, pushing her body and mind on the way to becoming statistically the greatest gymnast of all time.\n\nTo accompany her 30 World Championship medals, Biles now has 11 Olympic Games medals from three appearances at the quadrennial multisport event. Of course, she famously pulled out during the Tokyo Games three years ago.\n\nNevertheless, she may have not reached the acrophobia-inducing heights she has in the sport if not for having to constantly look over her shoulder at the charging Rebeca Andrade.\n\nThis is a point that Biles has made in the past, but reiterated after holding off the Brazilian to clinch gold in the all-around individual final a few days ago.\n\n\"I don't want to compete with Rebeca any more,\" Biles stated jokingly after the pair's battle for gold in that event. \"I'm tired. Like, she's way too close. I've never had an athlete that close.\n\n\"She's a competitor. She always keeps me on my toes. It's always an honour every time I get to compete with her,\" Biles added.\n\n\"Knowing that I gave Simone a bit of work is cool, right?\" Andrade retorted. \"She's the best in the world. Simone is a phenomenon.\n\n\"We didn't see it just here (in Paris), but also in many competitions that she has done. I'm so proud of being able to compete by her side,\" the 25-year-old said.\n\n\"Simone is a reference for the entire world, not just for gymnastics, but for many athletes.\"\n\nIn the final gymnastics event of Paris 2024, Brazilian Andrade went more than too close to Biles. The 25-year-old delivered a near-perfect performance in the individual floor exercise competition on Monday, 5 August. She just pipped second-placed Biles and her fellow American - Jordan Chiles - to first place on the podium.\n\nAs the trio of medallists lined up to receive their prizes following the event, Chiles asked Biles whether they should bow to Andrade when she stepped up to receive her gold. Biles was more than willing to show her adversary the respect she deserves for constantly keeping her on her toes.\n\n\"She is such an exciting gymnast to watch, and with all the fans in the crowd cheering for her... it was just the right thing to do. She's a queen,\" Biles said of the gesture.\n\n\"She's an icon, a legend herself. So, why don't we give her her flowers? Not only has she given Simone her flowers, but (she has) for a lot of us in the US as well,\" Chiles said of the American pair's tribute to Andrade. \"Giving back is what makes it so beautiful. We felt it was needed.\"\n\nAndrade departs Paris as the most decorated Brazil Olympian after winning four medals in France to take her overall Olympic tally to six. Sailors Robert Scheidt and Torben Grael jointly held the honour before, with five Games medals apiece. Andrade acrobatically leapt over them to claim top spot.\n\nAndrade won two medals at the Covid-19-delayed Tokyo Games three years ago, including claiming silver in the individual all-around event at that tournament to become the first female artistic gymnast from Brazil to earn a podium spot.\n\nRead more: Star reborn -- Simone Biles's Paris gold a glittering triumph on road to Olympic redemption\n\nShe improved on that milestone just days later when she became the first Brazilian woman to secure a gold medal in artistic gymnastics. It was an achievement that had proven elusive for Andrade's role-model and one of the greatest Brazilian gymnasts of all-time - Daiane dos Santos.\n\nWith her four medals in Paris - one bronze, two silver and her floor routine gold - Andrade has confirmed herself as one of the greatest athletes of her generation. She will leave a legacy that will inspire a number of budding athletes in her native Brazil, as well as globally.\n\n\"I am very happy and proud about what I did,\" Andrade said from Paris. \"We came here every day to compete and perform. Gymnastics is not an easy sport, it requires a lot from our body and mind.\"\n\nWhen she was growing up in a favela (informal settlement) just outside S\u00e3o Paulo, ascending to the heights she has would have seemed a far-fetched fantasy for Andrade.\n\nOne of eight children that her mother Rosa Santos raised, Andrade displayed natural acrobatic skills from a young age.\n\n\"I was always active when I was a small child. So my aunt took me to the gym where she worked and I began doing gymnastics. It was amazing,\" Andrade said in an interview published by the International Federation of Gymnastics.\n\n\"The gym looked like an amusement park. If it was not for that programme (that the gym ran for children), they wouldn't have spotted my talent. I would have just been a girl playing on the street,\" she said.\n\nAfter impressing judges at the 2009 Junior Pan-American Games Andrade was invited to join the Paran\u00e1 Center for Excellence in Gymnastics. Despite being just 10 years old, she took the opportunity to train professionally. Even though it meant she had to leave her family behind and venture out alone to another state.\n\nAndrade's career has soared since then, resulting in where she currently finds herself. However, the road to the summit she has reached was not always smooth.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2019, she suffered three anterior cruciate ligament injuries. After the second one - which happened in 2017 - she was tempted to quit the sport. However, in an interview with the Washington Post, she said it was Biles that helped dissuade her from walking away.", "source": {"uri": "dailymaverick.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily

Baltimore won 16-14. Mandatory Credit: Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports / Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBaltimore Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey has gone viral on social media once again, but not in a good way.\n\nOn Monday, Brazilian gymnastics artist Rebeca Andrade took home the gold medal in floor exercise at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, besting Americans Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles. After the event, the two Americans gave a beautiful display of sportsmanship by bowing down to Andrade while on the podium.\n\nFor some unknown reason, that display of sportsmanship must've struck a nerve with Humphrey, as the Ravens corner posted \"this is literally disgusting\" in response.\n\nAs one might expect, Humphrey received a huge amount of backlash for his comment, especially from Brazilian users.

Additionally, Andrade has overcome three separate ACL tears from 2015-2019 in order to get to where she is now, so there's no doubt that the sign of respect from her competitors meant a lot to her.\n\nBesides, Biles, the most decorated gymnast in history, is still having herself an incredible Olympics as she won gold in team all-around, individual all-around and vault, which is usually Andrade's best exercise. After stepping away from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (played in 2021) to focus on her mental health, Biles has proven that she's still got it.\n\nHumphrey is a notorious trash-talker, but not every athlete needs to be at their competitors' throats all the time.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Humphrey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marlon Humphrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acrisure Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebeca_Andrade", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebeca Andrade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_team_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic team all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_rivalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College rivalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5472,h_3078,x_0,y_287/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/raven_country/01j4kttbg0jp2sgkwegs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793570", "eventUri": "eng-9793570", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2011-12-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

In other words, Andrade, Biles and Chiles became the first all-Black gymnastics podium -- men or women -- in Olympic history.\n\nThis is a win for the decades-long event where Black gymnasts, especially Black women, have faced significant barriers and underrepresentation in the sport. Generally, sports where Black people have been well represented have been accessible through schools, including football, track and field, and basketball. But gymnastics is very expensive and it also comes with enormous training hours, discouraging Blacks from getting involved in the sport.\n\nAlthough it took some time, Black women still made their mark in gymnastics. For instance, Dominique Dawes became the first African-American woman to win an individual gold medal at the Olympics (1996 Atlanta Olympics). Dawes and Dominique Moceanu were members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" U.S. women's gymnastics team at the 1996 Olympics, marking the first time the U.S. women's gymnastics team had any racial diversity, and Gabby Douglas became the first African-American woman to win the Olympic all-around title in 2012.\n\nBiles explained after the event on Monday, \"First, it was an all-Black podium, so that was super exciting for us. But then Jordan was like, 'Should we bow to her?' And I was like, 'absolutely' -- it was just the right thing to do.\"\n\n\"She's so amazing. She's queen,\" Biles said of Andrade, according to ESPN. \"She's such an excitement to watch -- all the fans in the crowd always cheering for her.\"\n\nChiles, an exceptional gymnastics athlete from the United States who won her third Olympic medal overall, reiterated Biles' remarks by stating that Andrade is \"a legend herself.\"\n\nShe stated, \"In that moment, I was like, 'You know what? First off -- yes, it was an all-Black podium.' Second off, 'Why don't we just give her her flowers?' Not only has she given Simone her flowers, but a lot of us in the United States our flowers as well. So, giving it back, is what makes it so beautiful. ... I felt like it was needed.\"\n\nBrazil's Andrade proved to be an impressive opponent at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, winning four medals, including the gold in the floor final, to defeat Biles, the most decorated gymnast who received a silver medal, according to NBC4.\n\nAndrade, who made history as the most decorated Brazilian athlete of all time, took home bronze in the team event and two silver medals in vault and all-around. She already has gold from vault in Tokyo.\n\nFar from the bow being part of a historic moment, it was just beautiful to see the bonding of three Black women who understood that winning isn't only about being the first but being the best and acknowledging that on a global platform is a step in the right direction.\n\nThis year's Olympics was filled with controversies, but moments like these restore our faith in humanity.\n\nWe hope that more Black athletes will follow suit in this pioneering moment.", "source": {"uri": "face2faceafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Face2Face

They just weren't sure how.\n\nWhat they came up with after Andrade's gold medal on floor exercise at the end of 10 days inside Bercy Arena went viral: Biles, the unequivocal Greatest of All Time, and Chiles, a three-time Olympic medalist whose journey back to the Games was a testament to talent and grit, dropped down to one knee.\n\nIt was the first Olympic gymnastics podium with three Black women. It was also a show of respect to Andrade, whose excellence is symbolic of a sport that is getting more diverse, more inclusive and perhaps more positive as it goes.\n\n\"It was just the right thing to do,\" Biles said about a moment, with even the Louvre itself suggesting it might be worthy enough for a spot somewhere in the vicinity of the Mona Lisa.\n\nThe move symbolized the state of their sport at the 2024 Paris Olympics, and caught the attention of countless other athletes and celebrities -- including the likes of one famous Chicagoan, and the U.S.' first African-American First Lady.\n\n\"I'm still not over this beautiful moment of sisterhood and sportsmanship!\" Michelle Obama said in a post to Twitter. \"You can just feel the love shining through these ladies. Congrats Rebeca, Jordan and Simone!\"\n\nBiles and the American women finished off their \"Redemption Tour\" by reclaiming gold in the team final. Biles exorcised whatever inner doubt remained from the Tokyo Games -- and shut up the haters in the process -- by winning a second all-around title eight years after her first.\n\nAndrade led Brazil to its first Olympic team medal (a bronze), then added three more in the individual competition, finishing runner-up to Biles in the all-around and vault before becoming the first woman in memory to edge Biles in a floor exercise final.\n\nThe Italian women won their first team medal in nearly a century. Japan put together a stirring rally on high bar in the last rotation to slip by rival China for gold. The U.S. men and \"Pommel Horse Guy\" Stephen Nedoroscik returned to the Olympic podium for the first time in 16 years. Carlos Yulo of the Philippines tripled his country's Summer Olympic all-time gold medal count in a mere 24 hours.\n\nThe good vibes were everywhere, led by Biles, who seemed to make it a point to take her vibrant spotlight and redirect it toward the other women on the floor as often as possible.\n\nThat was never more evident than what could have been the last day of her career. The 27-year-old's voice could be heard shouting encouragement to each of the other balance beam finalists inside an eerily quiet arena. Regardless of nationality. Regardless of age. Regardless of score. Regardless of how well she might know them.\n\nAfterward, Biles spoke glowingly of Italians Alice D'Amato and Manila Esposito, who earned gold and bronze in beam after half the field -- Biles included -- fell inside an arena so still that Biles joked she could hear cell phones buzzing.\n\n\"I'm super excited and proud of them because now they're building bricks (for a program) for the other Italian girls,\" she said.\n\nThose bricks have long been in place in the U.S., yet what Biles, Chiles, six-time Olympic medalist Sunisa Lee and three-time Olympic medalist Jade Carey did in Paris is destroy the \"little girls in pretty boxes\" stereotype that has lingered over the sport for decades once and for all.\n\nThe four 20-somethings -- oh, and 16-year-old Hezly Rivera, too -- came to France with a score to settle. Biles to put those strange days in Japan three years ago firmly in the rearview mirror. Lee to rid herself of the \"imposter syndrome\" that kept nagging at her following her all-around gold in Tokyo and the health issues that pushed her to the verge of quitting over and over again. Chiles and Carey to put the Americans back on top after ceding the top of the podium to Russia.\n\nSimone Biles shares powerful, three-word message before event that gave her the twisties\n\nThe group checked every box. The U.S. won eight of 18 possible medals, including four for Biles to boost her Olympic total to 11, tied for the second most ever by a women's gymnast in the history of the event.\n\nYet just as important as the results was the process they took to get there. There was pressure but there was also joy in abundance for the oldest team the Americans have ever brought to the Games, a team that has dubbed itself \"The Golden Girls.\"\n\n\"It's been so much fun,\" Carey said. \"And I think so many have seen that, that we're just having fun out there. And I think that's bringing out the best gymnastics from us.\"\n\nA decade ago, the core four would be heading off into retirement while the next wave of prodigies came along. It says something about the rapidly shifting demographics on the floor and the rising interest in women's gymnastics at large that not one of them -- Biles included -- has made any firm decisions about their future.\n\nBiles nudged the door toward Los Angeles 2028 open when she said over the weekend \"never say never.\" Lee, still just 21, is taking time before weighing her options. Carey and Chiles will join Biles on her post-Olympic tour and have college eligibility remaining.\n\nNo one is in a hurry. Biles in particular. She chastised the media for pressing about the future so soon after the biggest moment of athletes' lives. For a long time -- for too long, in hindsight -- she fixated on what's next.\n\nNo longer. She was intent on soaking in her third Olympics. Of enjoying it. And she did, from the first pressure-packed rotation in qualifying to that moment with Chiles and Andrade, when the last of the weight she's been carrying for years lifted off her shoulders, perhaps for good.\n\n\"There's nothing left,\" Biles said. \"We did our job, you know what I'm saying? So yeah, it was hard, but we did it.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Man who absolutely has nothing to do with the sport says: it's literally disgusting. Like what? Smh. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u2640\ufe0f,\" one user commented. Another fan wrote, \"No one cares what he thinks, and he didn't win a medal so he doesn't rate an opinion. He needs to mind his own business and not comment on women's Olympics.\"\n\nHumphrey saw some of the critical comments and decided to speak out via his Instagram Story. \"I guess I can't never go to Brazil now,\" he wrote alongside a face with tears of joy emoji while referencing Andrade's home country.\n\nIn a separate post via X, he added, \"I'm lowkey getting cooked right now. I think I'm getting cussed out in Brazilian on Instagram lol.\"\n\nUs Weekly has reached out to Humphrey's rep for additional comment.\n\nOn Monday, Andrade, 25, beat out Biles, 27, and Chiles, 23, to win the gold medal in the floor finals at the 2024 Paris Olympics. The trio later celebrated together during the medal ceremony by holding hands and embracing each other with hugs.\n\nWhile appearing on Today, Biles explained that she and Chiles had no hesitation in supporting their competitor after a major win.\n\n\"I think it's all about sportsmanship,\" she told Hoda Kotb on Tuesday, August 6. \"We don't care whether we win or lose. We're always going to keep a good face and support our competitors because they've worked just as hard as we have for that moment, so you have to give them their flowers, and that's exactly what me and Jordan were doing. We were so happy for her.\"\n\nAs for Chiles, she had no regrets about her 2024 Olympics experience as she headed to Disneyland Paris to celebrate.\n\n\"Words can't express how proud I am of myself.. this has been an amazing experience and your girl is an individual medalist!!\" she wrote via Instagram on Tuesday. \"Thank you to everyone for all the love and support.

And one that was important to Biles.\n\n\"[We were] showing good sportsmanship [and] having fun out there because it was the last competition,\" the superstar gymnast, 27, tells PEOPLE.\n\nThe moment capped off a medal-heavy and record-breaking Olympics for Biles, who earned three gold and one silver medal during the 2024 Games. Her sole silver came against Andrade in the floor final, and it was there that Biles and Chiles, 23, bowed to the six-time Olympic medalist, 25.\n\nThat podium also held a bigger significance -- it marked the first time, ever, that an Olympics podium was entirely made up of Black gymnasts, a moment that certainly was not lost on Biles.\n\n\"It was representation,\" she says. \"For all the little girls and boys that look like us, for them to believe in themselves that they can do it too. I was one day in their shoes when I saw Gabby [Douglas] win and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, if she can do it, I can do it.' \"\n\nBiles has been setting an example for all the gymnasts, athletes and people that look up to her throughout the Games, not just for her emphasis on representation, but also for how she has highlighted the importance of good mental health.\n\nReflecting on how she feels now, after the Paris Games, compared to after Tokyo in 2021, Biles says she's \"at a better spot, mentally and physically.\"\n\n\"I'm just happy with overall what I've been able to accomplish and what I've done, because putting in that therapy and that mental work meant everything to me, and it was much needed,\" she says.\n\nAnd now, after over a week and a half of competition, Biles, who graces PEOPLE's cover this week, has one thing on her mind: To \"relax.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebeca_Andrade", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebeca Andrade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsmanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sportsmanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Nutrition", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Nutrition", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/M-7t3iCPBjITI-0y8vlb61FWUuw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(730x199:732x201)/Rebeca-Andrade-Simone-Biles-Jordan-Chiles-080624-3-f4d35a2c74f741de8dca5e7e500da379.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793570", "eventUri": "eng-9793570", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

(She had the twisties, which causes gymnasts to lose themselves in the air, which causes gymnasts to break their necks.)\n\nVance opened his pursed butthole mouth at the time to whine that our \"therapeutic society\" was causing us to praise Biles not for \"heroism,\" but for what she did in her \"weakest moments.\" It's funny because JD Vance's entire life is a \"weakest moment\" and he'd be nothing without the welfare of Peter Thiel's money. Ha ha!\n\nWhen we wrote that, Biles, along with her teammates Jordan Chiles, Suni Lee, Jade Carey, and 16-year-old Hezly Rivera, had just taken gold in the team gymnastics final.\n\nBiles immediately went on to win two more golds on her own -- all-around and vault.\n\nNow, after last night's final events, Biles's 2024 Olympics, her Redemption Tour, is over, along with that of the entire women's gymnastics team, and we thought you might like to know how it ended.\n\nBiles didn't win gold in her floor routine final. Brazil's Rebeca Andrade (who is exquisite) won it. Biles won silver.\n\nBiles also, along with Suni Lee, fell during her individual balance beam routine, which meant no medals for the Americans in that event. Oh well.\n\nHer imperfections in the floor routine? Well, she's so damned powerful occasionally she lands in the parking lot, which is considered by the gymnastics authorities to be \"out of bounds.\"\n\nQuote-unquote.\n\nAmerican Jordan Chiles was the last to compete in floor, and when the initial scores came down she was in fifth place, and the bronze position was for Romanian Ana Barbosu, who began to celebrate. Then Chiles's coaches submitted an inquiry, contesting the opening difficulty score for her routine, saying it didn't include a move she performed. The judges agreed, Chiles's score was amended, and the bronze was hers.\n\nSo that was incredibly cool for her, and devastating to watch for poor Ana Barbosu.\n\nBut the coolest part came when it was time for the medals to be awarded. As Andrade was coming forward to take her place at the top of the podium, Biles and Chiles bowed down to her, in an image that's already iconic.\n\nYou can see it all in these videos -- the first is a news report which includes the iconic bowing photograph, and the second shows some of the press conference they gave afterward:\n\nIn that press conference, Biles talked about how much she loves Andrade, how Andrade makes her a better gymnast, and just more nice words.\n\nAnd she addressed the podium moment.\n\n\"It was an all-Black podium, so that was super-exciting for us,\" said Biles. (Pigfuck white supremacist Matt Walsh scoffed at the significance of an all-Black podium, because that's what pigfuck white supremacists say.)\n\n\"But then Jordan was like 'Should we bow to her?' and I was like 'Absolutely!'\"\n\nSo they did it.\n\nChiles took over and talked some more about what an \"icon and legend\" Rebeca Andrade is. They wanted to give Andrade her flowers, Chiles said, because Andrade has been in the position of giving Biles and the rest of the Americans their flowers so many times. It was their turn to give them back.\n\nIt was just about the classiest, most sportsmanslike display imaginable. What a moment to illustrate just how much greater these human beings are than any American conservative loser who can't be normal and be happy for them.\n\nOh did y'all see that after her golds the other day, Biles tweeted, \"I love my black job\"?\n\nWe said they were superior people to JD Vance and Matt Walsh and Charlie Kirk and all the rest. Never said they couldn't be petty AF.\n\nCongratulations to the best among us and fuck MAGA garbage.\n\nOPEN THREAD.\n\nEvan has a new side project called The Moral High Ground, you should check it

However, after he commented on Olympic standouts Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles, Pro Bowl corner Marlon Humphrey now has to play a different defense.\n\nBiles and Chiles were photographed praising Brazilian Olympian Rebeca Andrade after she beat out the two for the gold medal during the women's floor routines, and it's safe to say Humphrey was not too impressed with the move.\n\nThe praise from Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles came after Andrade had fought hard to come back after injuring her ACL three times before taking gold in Tokyo, something Humphrey, being an athlete himself, was apparently not aware of.\n\nAlso Read: Baltimore Ravens Stud Running Back Shocks Everybody By Announcing His Retirement\n\nOne fan gave it to the three-time NFL Pro Bowler, commenting, \" Yeah, because giving someone their flowers who has come back from THREE ACL tears to continue to be a top gymnast is disgusting,\" a sarcastic move on their part.\n\nThe Ravens' standout corner has since made another post on X referencing that he is \"getting cooked.\" He also pointed out that he believes he is getting \"cussed out in Brazilian on Instagram,\" which could be very accurate.\n\nEven on the tweet referencing the shade being thrown his way, fans still weren't happy. One fan pointed out that the Ravens' standout is \"getting cooked for bad sportsmanship\" after the comments that fans view in bad taste.\n\nNo apology has come from the Ravens' star just yet, and fans continue to be upset. Biles has not released a statement on Humphrey's words as she continues to dominate on the world stage in Paris while the Baltimore Ravens continue to prepare for the upcoming season.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaden_harty@totalprosports.com", "name": "Kaden Harty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Humphrey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marlon Humphrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebeca_Andrade", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebeca Andrade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Duckpin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Duckpin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165383089-1-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793570", "eventUri": "eng-9793570", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

She soared to the vault title with a stellar rendition of her signature Yurchenko double pike vault to take her career tally of Olympic gold to seven.\n\nBut she couldn't find her way back to the top of the podium on Monday, two out-of-bounds errors proving too costly in an otherwise breathtaking final floor routine.\n\nAndrade had already moved into first place with an energetic and elegant routine that garnered 14.166 points.\n\nBiles earned 14.133 for silver ahead of teammate Jordan Chiles, who took bronze with 13.766. Chiles's score was upgraded after a review of her degree of difficulty, a devastating blow for Romania's Ana Barbosu who thought she had earned bronze with her score of 13.700.\n\nBiles's legion of fans gave her a standing ovation anyway, and Biles departed the floor mat with both arms raised in acknowledgement.\n\nHer earlier fall from the beam - one of several in the final - was the first major hiccup of her triumphant Olympic return, three years after a bout of the disorientating \"twisties\" cut short her Tokyo Games campaign.\n\nBiles finished fifth in beam, where Alice D'Amato became the first Italian woman gymnast to claim Olympic gold with a score of 14.366.\n\nTeammate Manila Esposito joined D'Amato on the podium in third, with China's Zhou Yuqin taking silver.\n\nThe treacherous nature of the 10cm-wide beam was clear when the first three starters made big mistakes.\n\nChina's world silver medallist Zhou lost her balance and had to grab the beam to avoid coming off.\n\nAmerican medal contender Sunisa Lee took a hard fall onto the beam when her foot slipped at the end of an aerial series. Brazilian Julia Suarez also fell and Romanian Sabrina Maneca-Voinea fell twice.\n\nD'Amato had a couple of minor wobbles in an otherwise impeccable routine to seize first place just before Biles competed.\n\nThe US superstar, again greeted rapturously by a Bercy Arena crowd dotted with celebrities, made a confident start.\n\nBut she slipped off on an aerial series, drawing a collective gasp from the crowd.\n\nLee said she and Biles were both put off by crowd members trying to quiet others who were cheering during the beam competition - including competitors trying to encourage their teammates.\n\n\"You could feel the tension in the room,\" Lee said. \"Me and Simone were like, 'Why are they shushing?'\n\n\"She came off, and she was like 'I don't know why they were shushing in the middle of my routine'.\"\n\nVisibly disappointed, Biles had to wait an agonizingly long time for her score of 13.100 to be posted.\n\nThat was nowhere near good enough, and Biles's chance to join Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina and US swimmer Katie Ledecky as the only women to pile up nine Olympic golds was over - at least for this year.\n\nThe 27-year-old hasn't quite ruled out a return for the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@tribune.com.pk", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beam (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebeca_Andrade", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebeca Andrade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_D'Amato", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alice D'Amato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalia_Yurchenko", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natalia Yurchenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_Esposito", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manila Esposito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larisa_Latynina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larisa Latynina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Ledecky", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katie Ledecky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/121722975107-3/121722975107-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793570", "eventUri": "eng-9793570", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Those two women make me proud to be an American,\" one person wrote via X. Another chimed in that the snapshot captured of the bow was \"the most spectacular image of the Paris games!\"\n\nAn additional fan called Simone and Jordan's decision to bow a \"great example of appreciation, respect and sportsmanship.\"\n\nJordan accepted the bronze after an inquiry was submitted regarding her score, which ultimately solidified her spot on the podium.\n\n\"She's worked so hard for that moment. We really put those routines in, in training ... no matter what pressure we're under, they tried to make us hit as many routines as possible -- like well done,\" Simone said about Jordan, who she previously competed with during the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. \"And so just to see how excited Jordan was, and I knew that meant the world to her.\"\n\nSimone said that she \"was so happy\" for her teammate \"because it's been a long run and we've done this for so long together and competing again on an Olympic stage is crazy.\"\n\nNot only did they celebrate on the podium together, but Simone shared that she and Jordan had a special moment together when they returned to the Olympics Village. \"Yesterday, once we got back to the village, I looked at Jordan and I just started bawling my eyes out,\" she recalled. \"She was like, 'I knew it was gonna happen. I just didn't know when!' And I think it was just, I was so full of emotion and I finally released all of that.\"\n\n\"I was so proud, happy, bittersweet that the journey is over.

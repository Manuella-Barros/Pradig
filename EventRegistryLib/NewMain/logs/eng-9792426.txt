However, the Trump team was quick to decry those findings as they accused the pollsters of over-sampling leftists to tip the balance in the Democrat's favor.\n\n\"The Fake News Media continue to help dangerously liberal Kamala hide her record of economic failure and soft on crime policies,\" said Trump campaign senior adviser Brian Hughes in a statement reported by Newsweek. \"Now, as this analysis shows they'll even put a finger on the scale of polling to inflate results for her.\"\n\n\"This analysis is why the American people are seeing through it and will not allow this national gaslighting campaign to win,\" he continued. \"Despite this manipulated result, from CBS/YouGov it's worth noting that in July and August of 2020, their data showed Biden leading by 10 nationally, reflecting a net positive movement of almost +10 to President Trump this election cycle.\"\n\nThe results depicted a positive gain of 2 points for the vice president in comparison to their last poll that had been conducted prior to President Joe Biden ending his own campaign. It also showed Harris and Trump deadlocked in battleground states while admitting, \"The survey included an oversample of black respondents.\"\n\nThe results showed 81% of black voters favored Harris to 18% for Trump, compared to 73% supporting Biden in July.\n\nLooking even closer at the data showed other advantages for Trump beyond the \"gaslighting\" he highlighted, \"Record performance for a Republican, ME, with Hispanics!\" based on the YouGov data showed him earning 44%, within 7 points of Harris compared to massive double-digit advantages for past Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nAdditionally, Fox News host Laura Ingraham pointed out public opinion on how voters felt they would fair financially depending on who would win on Nov. 5 with 45% of respondents certain they would be better under Trump's policies compared to only 25% under Harris.\n\nWere the vice president to secure her own administration, 44% of survey participants believed they would be financially worse off.\n\n\"This is how Trump wins,\" said Ingraham. \"If you vote for him, you'll have more money in your pocket. If Harris wins, you're going to be poorer. Period!\"\n\nFurthermore, with Harris' positions viewed as even further to the left of the incumbent, after the honeymoon period in which corporate media avoided delving beyond talking points, voters are likely to recognize that changing the ticket leader wouldn't improve the state of the union in which 68% of respondents believed the nation was performing \"somewhat\" or \"very badly.\"\n\nLikewise, 66% said the economy was \"fairly bad\" or \"very bad\" currently and 41% of respondents said the main reason they would pick Harris was to oppose Donald Trump. While 34% claimed to like her and 24% voted blue no matter who ran on the ticket.\n\nReactions to the polling data reflected the Trump campaign's take as some even suggested that Harris' peak had been reached.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Harris's big gain has been among voters 35-54, who support her 54-40%, after supporting Trump 44-41% over Biden in June,\" Siena's Greenberg said.\n\nHarris won in a Democratic-majority New York, with 67% of the vote for Trump to 25%.\n\nMore importantly, Harris also leads Trump in the suburbs, 47% to 47%.\n\nStart your day with everything you need to know\n\nMorning Report provides the latest news, videos, photos and more.\n\nThanks for checking in!\n\nThat's a plus for Democrats, considering Trump beat Biden by 13 percentage points in the suburbs in Siena College's June survey.\n\nMost of the key legislative elections are taking place in the suburbs: in Long Island and Westchester counties, Rockland, Putnam and Orange.\n\nThe match was also nearly even in the northern part of the state, with 47% of voters supporting Harris and 45% for Trump.\n\n\"This is better news for Democrats running in a marginal district,\" Greenberg said.\n\nHarris is supported by 86% of Democrats, compared to 75% for Biden in June. AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn the House of Representatives elections, 47% of suburban voters support a Democratic candidate, while 44% support a Republican candidate - a result too close to predict.\n\nSimilarly, 44% of upstate residents support a Democrat for Congress and 42% a Republican, a tie.\n\nFifty-three percent of voters in blue-leaning New York state had a favorable view of Harris, compared with 43% who did not.\n\nIn contrast, 59% of respondents had an unfavorable opinion of New Yorker Trump, while 39% had a favorable opinion.\n\nMost voters said this presidential race was the most important of their lives: 79% of Democrats, 77% of Republicans and 65% of independents.\n\nIn another key race, Democratic incumbent Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who is running for a third full six-year term, leads her Republican opponent Mike Sapraicone, a retired NYPD detective, by 23 points -- 56 percent to 33 percent.\n\n\"With just 13 weeks until Election Day, Gillibrand is in a strong position to win her fourth election to the United States Senate,\" Greenberg said.\n\nShe was re-elected in 2018 with a 34-point victory over her then-little-known Republican opponent.\n\nThe survey found that 85% of voters did not know Sapraicone well enough to have an opinion, while 27% had no opinion on Gillibrand, who has been in power for 15 years.\n\nThe Siena College poll was conducted July 28 through Aug. 1 among 1,199 likely voters, via smartphones and landlines. Its overall margin of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena_College", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Siena College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_voter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent voter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Siena"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Siena"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

According to Politico, Harris is expected to announce her running mate at some point on Tuesday after which the pair is to make a joint appearance at a rally in Philadelphia in the evening.\n\nThe SurveyUSA poll gave Trump a 13-point lead among white voters, while Harris had a 53-point lead with Black voters and a 19-point lead with Latino and Asian voters. The Republican nominee polled best with voters aged 18-34, where he led by 4 points.

The survey of 11,265 likely voters, which the pollster said was the \"largest advantage for a Democratic presidential candidate over Trump in nearly a year,\" took place between August 2 and 4.\n\nA survey of 3,000 registered voters conducted by RMG Research between July 29 and 31 gave Harris a 5-point lead over Trump, with the support of 47 percent of those surveyed against 42 percent.\n\nOn August 5, Harris held a 2-point lead over Trump according to an analysis of recent polls conducted by polling aggregation website FiveThirtyEight, which placed her on 45.5 percent against 43.5 percent for the former president. The study found another 5.5 percent supported Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the former Democrat turned independent candidate.\n\nThe Silver Bulletin presidential election forecast, which was released on August 2, compiled polling averages from recent surveys in a number of key swing states. It found Harris led Trump in Pennsylvania by 45.3 to 44.8 percent, Wisconsin by 46 to 44.8 percent and Michigan at 45.2 versus 42.8 percent.\n\nHowever, Trump led in Georgia 46.3 to 44.8 percent, North Carolina 46.7 to 44.7 percent, Arizona 46.3 to 43.8 percent and Nevada 43.9 to 42.6 percent.\n\nOn Monday, Reuters reported Harris had narrowed her vice presidential shortlist down to two, with the finalists being Governors Tim Walz of Minnesota and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania. Other candidates who were reportedly under consideration included Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Senator Mark Kelly from Arizona.\n\nIn a message directed to supporters on Monday, Harris insisted she had yet to make a final decision. Providing a link where people could sign up for the announcement the Democratic nominee said: \"I know many of you are eager to find out who I will be selecting to join me on the campaign trail, and hopefully in the White House, as my Vice President.\n\n\"Though I have not made my decision yet, it is important to me that grassroots supporters -- like you -- have direct updates about the state of the race.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_bickerton@newsweek.com", "name": "James Bickerton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Consult", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morning Consult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Beshear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Kentucky", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Kentucky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

But before Biden stepped aside, Donald Trump led polling in every one of these key states.\n\nSo how do the polls currently view Harris' chances of winning the battleground states that will decide the election? Looking at poll trends, state by state, the final analysis shows she has made progress, but will that be enough?\n\nHarris is the presumptive Democratic nominee, with all her major potential rivals in the party having endorsed her. She and her running mate Tim Walz are set to be confirmed at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago later this month.\n\nTrump has not led a national poll for over a week, with Harris leading by between 1 and 5 points in 17 of the 18 most recent surveys (one national survey has them tied).\n\nBut as with Trump in 2016 and George W. Bush in 2000, a candidate can lose the popular vote nationally and still win the White House. While polling in most of the 50 states strongly indicate which candidate will win there in November, neither candidate currently strongly leads in enough states to win the election.\n\nA handful of states remain as tossups and so it is these states that will effectively decide the outcome of the race.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Harris and Trumps' campaigns for comment outside of regular working hours.\n\nHere's how Harris currently fares against Trump in key swing states.\n\nArizona\n\nIn Arizona, Trump has led in five of the eight most recent polls. However the three polls where Harris does lead indicate a change of political winds in the state since she took over. Trump had beaten Biden in every Arizona poll since May, sometimes by margins of 10 to 15 points.\n\nThe latest survey, by Redfield and Wilton Strategies for The Telegraph, between July 31 and August 3, of 567 likely voters, found Harris leading 44 percent to Trump's 43 percent.\n\nAnother poll taken by Public Policy Polling and funded by the Democrat-aligned Progress Action Fund, surveyed 618 registered voters between July 29 and 30 and shows Trump leading 49 percent to Harris' 47 percent.\n\nPolling aggregators have Trump slightly in the lead on average. FiveThirtyEight has Trump on 45.4 percent and Harris on 44.1. RaceToTheWhiteHouse has Trump on 48.8 and Harris on 46.7.\n\nGeorgia\n\nIn Georgia, Trump has led in eight of the eleven most recent polls. Harris leads in one Democrat-funded poll and two more have the candidates tied.\n\nHowever, even more extremely than in Arizona, Harris pulling even or ahead in Georgia shows a massive surge of support toward the Democrats. Trump had beaten Biden in every Georgia poll since May 2023, often by margins of 6 to 10 points.\n\nThe latest survey, by Redfield and Wilton Strategies for The Telegraph, between July 31 and August 3, of 1128 likely voters, found Trump leading 46 percent to Harris's 44 percent.\n\nAnother poll taken by Public Policy Polling and funded by the Democrat-aligned Progress Action Fund, surveyed 662 registered voters between July 29 and 30 and showed Harris leading 48 percent to Trump's 47 percent.\n\nPolling aggregators have Trump slightly in the lead on average. FiveThirtyEight has Trump on 45.9 percent and Harris on 44.8. RaceToTheWhiteHouse has Trump on 48.2 and Harris on 47.5.\n\nMichigan\n\nRecent polls of Michigan voters do not paint a clear picture of which direction the election will go. Trump leads in six of the twelve most recent polls, while the candidates pull even in four and in two polls, which were conducted by the same firm, Harris has a lead of over 10 points, indicating these results may be outliers.\n\nThe latest survey, by Redfield and Wilton Strategies for The Telegraph, between July 31 and August 3, of 771 likely voters, found Trump leading 42 percent to Harris' 41 percent.\n\nAnother poll taken by Public Opinion Strategies, surveyed 400 likely voters between July 23 and 29 and showed Harris and Trump even on 45 percent each.\n\nPolling aggregators have Harris slightly in the lead on average. FiveThirtyEight has Harris on 44.6 percent and Trump on 43.0. RaceToTheWhiteHouse has Harris on 49.2 percent and Trump on 46.5.\n\nNevada\n\nIn Nevada, Trump has led in three of the six most recent polls. Harris leads in one and they are tied in two. However, similar to Arizona and Georgia, Biden had been losing Nevada by a significant margin. Trump led in every poll in the state since the first one held this election cycle, in February. The poll where Harris leads and the two where they pull even suggest a much tighter race than was expected under Biden.\n\nThe latest survey, by Redfield and Wilton Strategies for The Telegraph, between July 31 and August 3, of 470 likely voters, found Harris and Trump even on 40 per cent each.\n\nAnother poll taken by Public Opinion Strategies, surveyed 400 likely voters between July 23 and 29 and found Trump leading 46 percent to Harris' 45 percent.\n\nPolling aggregator RaceToTheWhiteHouse has Harris slightly in the lead on average, with 46.1 percent while Trump has 45.3 percent. FiveThirtyEight has not published an aggregate for Nevada since Biden dropped out.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nTrump leads Harris in every recent poll in North Carolina; he also led Biden in every poll before Biden stepped aside. However, the margin is drawing closer. The five polls conducted since July 19 have Trump ahead of Harris by between 1 and 4 points. Against Biden, Trump was leading by between 2 and 9 points.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania is currently the closest race of the 50 states. Trump has led in five of the ten most recent polls, Harris has led in three, and they are tied in two.\n\nThe latest survey, by Redfield and Wilton Strategies for The Telegraph, between July 31 and August 3, of 743 likely voters, found Trump leading Harris 46 percent to Harris' 44 percent.\n\nAnother poll taken by Public Opinion Strategies, surveyed 400 likely voters between July 23 and 29 and found Harris leading 48 percent to Trump's 45 percent.\n\nPolling aggregators have Harris very slightly in the lead on average, in both cases by less than one percent. FiveThirtyEight has Harris on 45.3 percent and Trump on 44.5. RaceToTheWhiteHouse has Harris on 48 percent and Trump on 47.9.\n\nBefore Biden dropped out, Trump had led in every Pennsylvania poll since the June 27 debate in Atlanta, where Biden's performance was widely criticized.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWisconsin is another close race. Harris has led in four of the nine most recent polls, Trump has led in two, and they are tied in three.\n\nThe latest survey, by Redfield and Wilton Strategies for The Telegraph, between July 31 and August 3, of 597 likely voters, found the candidates tied on 43 percent each.\n\nAnother poll taken by Public Opinion Strategies, surveyed 400 likely voters between July 23 and 29 and found Harris leading 48 percent to Trump's 46 percent.\n\nPolling aggregators have Harris very slightly in the lead on average. FiveThirtyEight has Harris on 45.8 percent and Trump on 44.4. RaceToTheWhiteHouse has Harris on 49.5 percent and Trump on 47.7.\n\nThe final analysis\n\nUsing current polling numbers, Harris leads in four of the seven most competitive swing states, while Trump leads in three. According to the Electoral College polling map produced by RaceToTheWhiteHouse, if the election were exactly matched current polling in each state, Harris would win the Electoral College with 276 votes to Trump's 262.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "flynn_nicholls@newsweek.com", "name": "Flynn Nicholls", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FiveThirtyEight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FiveThirtyEight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Tropical Storm Debby has forced the postponement of a stop in another swing state, Georgia, and according to media reports also North Carolina.\n\nPennsylvania is part of the \"blue wall\" that carried Biden to the White House in 2020, alongside Michigan and Wisconsin. That was one of the main reasons many expected Harris to instead pick that state's governor, Josh Shapiro.\n\nAlso on the vice presidential shortlist had been former astronaut and current senator Mark Kelly, of Arizona, and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.\n\nTrump was riding high politically last month after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally, and then using the Republican convention to highlight his image of vigor against the physically frail Biden.\n\nBut with Biden's dramatic exit and Harris's fast start, he is scrambling to recalibrate.\n\nAt a rally last Saturday in Georgia, Trump called Harris a \"Marxist\" and a \"radical left freak,\" claiming she would cause an \"economic crash.\"\n\nThree days earlier, he shocked many when he told an audience of Black journalists that Harris had \"turned Black\" out of political expediency.\n\nWhere Biden often attacked Trump as a threat to democracy, given his unprecedented refusal to accept his loss in 2020, Harris's team has honed a sharper -- more meme-friendly -- line built around branding Trump and his vice presidential pick J.D. Vance \"weird.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the Harris campaign said Trump was \"scared\" to debate her after he turned down a previously scheduled televised debate on ABC, while saying he'd be ready to debate her on Fox News -- a network that has for years given him support.\n\nsms-ft/nro", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clay Center Dispatch On-Line"}, "authors": [],

Tim Walz (D) helps her is up in the air, but there's no question the vice president has been riding an upward swing in the polls since President Biden ended his reelection bid late last month and endorsed her.\n\nHarris and Trump are basically tied in the national polling average tracked by The Hill/Decision Desk HQ, with Trump winning 47.1 percent in the average of polls, and Harris at 47 percent. Trump had initially been up by more than 6 points when Harris first declared her candidacy following Biden's decision to leave the race.\n\nThe Hill/Decision Desk HQ model polling average isn't the only place giving Harris and Democrats new hope, either.\n\nHarris also led Trump in pollster Nate Silver's electoral forecast for the first time in recent days after Trump had the advantage against first Biden and then Harris for weeks. The vice president's chance of winning the election also surpassed Trump's.\n\nSilver last week declared the race a \"toss-up,\" the same place it is considered now. He had previously seen Trump as a favorite against Biden because of the incumbent's poorer performance in battleground states even before the debate.\n\nDDHQ has tracked a shift in the Democrats' favor in nine of 10 key states in addition to the national polling. The largest shift in the polling average from before Biden dropped out has been in North Carolina, which shifted from a Trump lead of 10 points to just 3 points.\n\nDemocrats have long sought a presidential victory in The Tar Heel State, which they've failed to take in a presidential contest since Barack Obama's narrow victory in 2008. A comeback seemed unlikely as Biden faltered, but North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) expressed optimism on Sunday that Harris is capable of flipping the state.\n\nMargins have also narrowed in other states that are more crucial to Democrats winning the White House, though Trump still leads in most of the states likely to determine the outcome.\n\nOnly two polls have been conducted and released in Nevada since Biden dropped out, but together they show Trump with an average lead of 3 points, down from the 9-point lead previously.\n\nEight polls for Pennsylvania and five polls each from Georgia and Michigan have revealed shifts toward Harris of 2 points, 4 points and 3 points, respectively.\n\nHarris has seen improvements in polling in swing states and nationally.\n\nShe led Trump by 1 percentage point nationally and was exactly tied 50-50 in the battleground states in a CBS News/YouGov poll released Sunday. That poll and others have shown an increase in enthusiasm among Democratic voters, with 85 percent now saying they plan to vote this fall compared to 81 percent last month.\n\nA Morning Consult poll released Monday showed Harris leading Trump by 4 points, which is the largest lead for the Democratic presidential candidate in almost a year. Harris also led Trump by 5 points among independents and 9 points among voters 18 to 35 years old, a group that Biden had seemingly been underperforming with in polls.\n\nHarris has performed better than Biden in polls that include independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nTrump led Biden on average by varying but small margins in three-way contests that included Kennedy, but Harris has held a narrow 1.5-point lead in that scenario in the average from DDHQ and The Hill. FiveThirtyEight's polling average shows her with a similar lead.\n\nAll of the polls point to a tight race, suggesting both candidates will have to work hard to turn out their supporters.\n\nAfter Harris became a candidate, Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio argued in a memo that Harris will experience a honeymoon period of positive headlines that will raise her numbers and possibly even put her ahead of Trump but that the change would be temporary.\n\nThe question now is if and when that honeymoon will end, and what the numbers will look like as the candidates sprint toward the fall.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jared_gans@thehill.com", "name": "Jared Gans", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_Desk_HQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Decision Desk HQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Silver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nate Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roy Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

It is the first time a Democrat has led in the race, according to the aggregator.\n\nThe vice president is also leading Trump by a 0.2 percent margin in VoteHub's poll aggregator, which shows her with 46.4 percent of the vote to his 46.2 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, The Economist's poll aggregator shows Harris with 47 percent to the former president's 46 percent, while Race to the White House shows the vice president with 47.6 percent to Trump's 46.3 percent.\n\nAggregator FiveThirtyEight and pollster Nate Silver show that Harris' lead is larger.\n\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight, Harris is now 2 points ahead of Trump, with 45.5 percent to his 43.5 percent. Similarly, Silver's model, which compiles the results of statewide polls and weights them based on reliability, shows Harris leading Trump with 45.7 percent to his 43.8 percent.\n\nNewsweek has contacted the Trump and Harris campaigns via email for comment.\n\nSilver's model had shown Trump polling ahead of the Democratic candidate for most of July -- including during the weeks immediately after Biden dropped out of the race, with Harris first leading Trump on July 31, according to data published on Sunday.\n\nDespite Harris' lead, the race is still close, according to Silver, who said Harris had a 50.5 percent chance of winning the Electoral College in November and a 66 percent chance of winning the popular vote.\n\nLast week, Silver gave Trump a 54.9 percent chance of winning the Electoral College. Against Biden, his model had given Trump a 73 percent chance to win the election.\n\nRace to the White House also shows Harris winning the Electoral College, as she leads Trump with 275 electoral votes to his 262. Last week, the results were flipped, with the aggregator showing the Democratic candidate with 256 electoral votes to the GOP's 275.\n\nA new CBS News/YouGov poll conducted between July 30 and August 2 found the two candidates tied in key battleground states and Harris leading Trump nationally by 1 point.\n\nThe poll surveyed 3,102 registered voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.1 percentage points.\n\nTrump's campaign dismissed the CBS News/YouGov poll on Sunday, accusing it of putting \"a finger on the scale of polling to inflate results\" for Harris.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martha_mchardy@newsweek.com", "name": "Martha McHardy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Silver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nate Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FiveThirtyEight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FiveThirtyEight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealClearPolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RealClearPolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouGov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2443526/kamala-harris.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=d76135cd80fd05a7c5c737ba1e78aea5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792426", "eventUri": "eng-9792426", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "dateEnd": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 2230, "textEnd": 2250}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 222, "textEnd": 229}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 1496, "textEnd": 1503}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Tropical Storm Debby has forced the postponement of a stop in another swing state, Georgia, and according to media reports also North Carolina.\n\nPennsylvania is part of the \"blue wall\" that carried Biden to the White House in 2020, alongside Michigan and Wisconsin. That was one of the main reasons many expected Harris to instead pick that state's governor, Josh Shapiro.\n\nAlso on the vice presidential shortlist had been former astronaut and current senator Mark Kelly, of Arizona, and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.\n\nTrump was riding high politically last month after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally, and then using the Republican convention to highlight his image of vigor against the physically frail Biden.\n\nBut with Biden's dramatic exit and Harris's fast start, he is scrambling to recalibrate.\n\nAt a rally last Saturday in Georgia, Trump called Harris a \"Marxist\" and a \"radical left freak,\" claiming she would cause an \"economic crash.\"\n\nThree days earlier, he shocked many when he told an audience of Black journalists that Harris had \"turned Black\" out of political expediency.\n\nWhere Biden often attacked Trump as a threat to democracy, given his unprecedented refusal to accept his loss in 2020, Harris's team has honed a sharper -- more meme-friendly -- line built around branding Trump and his vice presidential pick J.D. Vance \"weird.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the Harris campaign said Trump was \"scared\" to debate her after he turned down a previously scheduled televised debate on ABC, while saying he'd be ready to debate her on Fox News -- a network that has for years given him support.", "source": {"uri": "hallmarknews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hallmarknews"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The mainstream media has certainly done their part by trying to hide or even lie about her far-left record, and she hasn't even had to answer to anything through press conferences. Especially with President Joe Biden pretty much being MIA even before he dropped out of the presidential race on July 21, in that context, can we really trust polls showing Harris ahead?\n\nOn Sunday, CBS News/YouGov released a poll showing Harris tied with former and potentially future President Donald Trump in the battleground states, at 50 percent. She has a slight lead nationally, however, at 50-49 percent. The battleground states included Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe results in the battleground states among likely voters look questionable, especially regarding how Trump is only up +3 in Georgia and North Carolina, 50-47 percent against Harris. This poll also shows Harris up +2 in Nevada, 50-48 percent, which has been one of Trump's best states, at least when he was running against Biden.\n\nThe result was something CBS News Poll highlighted, pointing out how Biden never led Trump in such polls.\n\nA headline from CBS News highlighted how Democrats are excited when it comes to their new presumptive nominee. \"Boosts in Democratic excitement help Harris reset the race against Trump -- CBS News poll,\" it read.\n\nAs that piece began by mentioning:\n\nBoosted by Democrats, younger and Black voters becoming more engaged and likely to vote, and by women decidedly thinking she'd favor their interests more, Vice President Kamala Harris has reset the 2024 presidential race.\n\nShe has a 1-point edge nationally -- something President Biden never had (he was down by 5 points when he left the race) -- and Harris and former President Donald Trump are tied across the collective battleground states.\n\nFor all of this talk about black voters being \"becoming more engaged and likely to vote,\" it's worth noting that buried in the methodology section at the end of the write-up is a note about how such respondents are oversampled.\n\nWhile the poll from July 18 showed that 81 percent of registered voters who are Democrats will \"definitely\" vote, that number is now at 85 percent. Republicans, meanwhile, saw a slight decrease. While 90 percent of registered voters who are Republicans said they'll \"definitely\" vote, that number is now at 88 percent.\n\nWith leaners included, Republicans look to be supporting Trump about the same amount that Democrats are supporting Harris, at 97 percent and 96 percent, respectively.\n\nNow is not the time to get complacent, but rather to highlight the records involved. GovTrack may have deleted the web page showing as much, but that doesn't change how Harris was the most liberal senator in 2019, one of the least bipartisan ones, and one of the ones most frequently absent.\n\nThe polling tellingly reveals that a plurality of overall voters (43 percent), Democrats (48 percent), and Independents (43 percent), as well as most other demographics, say they know \"some\" about Harris. This is definitely an opportunity for Republicans and the Trump-Vance campaign. That 15 percent of overall voters consider her to be \"moderate\" is also something to correct.\n\n\"Voters do see her as somewhat or very liberal. (The more conservative one is, the more likely they are to view her as very liberal.) Then again, voters see Trump as very or somewhat conservative -- and so that choice is more polarized than the electorate as a whole,\" the poll's write-up highlighted.\n\nUnder a subheading of \"Enthusiasm and core Democratic groups,\" the poll's write-up speaks further to enthusiasm as well:\n\nMost Democratic voters, and nearly half of voters overall, say that Harris as the Democratic nominee makes them feel more motivated to vote. (There is some countering effect, too: about a third of Trump voters are also more motivated to vote now that Harris is the nominee.)\n\nIt's not just that Democrats are more excited, but also on a number of candidate qualities they feel they've gotten a candidate that can match up more closely with Trump.\n\nHarris has an advantage over Trump on being seen as having the mental and cognitive health to serve, which was a critical deficit for Mr. Biden.\n\nAcross the wider set of voters, she's ahead of Trump on being energetic and focused (two qualities Mr. Biden trailed Trump badly on). She's even with Trump on perceived competence, and closer than Mr. Biden was on being tough and effective.\n\nFor all of these attributes supposedly going in Harris' favor, 56 percent say they would not describe her as \"effective,\" and 52 percent say they would not describe her as \"tough.\" In contrast, 54 percent would describe Trump as \"effective,\" while 66 percent say they would describe him as \"tough.\"\n\nSince the poll was conducted and released, issues about the economy have become that much more prevalent.\n\nA plurality of voters, at 33 percent, say the economy is \"very bad.\" A plurality of voters, at 35 percent, also similarly say that things are going \"very badly\" when asked how they think \"generally speaking\" how do they feel \"things in America today are going[?]\"\n\nThe poll also showed that 26 percent of voters each say they expect the economy next year to be \"growing, but not booming\" or \"holding steady.\" Twenty-three percent expect the economy to be \"in recession.\"\n\nOn Friday, the jobs report for July was released, showing there were far fewer jobs than expected, with unemployment rising to 4.3 percent. The stock market is also burning.\n\nA plurality of voters, at 44 percent, believe they will be \"financially worse off\" if Harris wins, while 31 percent say her policies will make their situation will \"stay about the same,\" and just 25 percent say they will be \"financially better off.\"\n\nA plurality of voters, 45 percent, however, believe that they will be \"financially better off\" under Trump's policies if he wins.\n\nAnother top issue for voters is the border crisis. A majority of voters, 52 percent, believe that Harris' policies will \"increase the number of migrants trying to cross the border.\" A plurality of her fellow Democrats, at 47 percent, believe her policies \"won't have an effect.\"\n\nIn stark contrast, 72 percent of overall voters believe that Trump's policies will \"decrease the number of migrants trying to cross the border,\" with a majority of every single demographic polled saying so. Even 53 percent of Democrats believe that will be the case.\n\n\"But to Trump's advantage, some critical things have not changed: he keeps his sizable lead on voters saying they'll be financially better off with him and that his policies would decrease migrants at the border,\" the poll's write-up highlights, which is indeed a signficant advantage that Trump still enjoys.\n\nThe poll was conducted with 3,102 registered voters from July 30-August 2 with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.1 percentage points. The job report was released on the last day that the poll was conducted.\n\nAlthough he emphasized the enthusiasm of voters for Harris, Anthony Salvanto, the executive director of elections and surveys, also spoke to such benefits for Trump while appearing on Sunday's episode of \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nSalvanto highlighted how \"some things in this race have not changed,\" specifically in that \"the idea that you would be better off financially if Trump were elected, Trump still has a big advantage over now Kamala Harris on that. And the idea that his policies would slow or decrease the number of migrants trying to cross the border, that, he still has an edge on.\"\n\nOn Sunday, when the poll came out, the Trump-Vance campaign sent out a statement from Brian Hughes, senior advisor.\n\n\"The Fake News Media continue to help dangerously liberal Kamala hide her record of economic failure and soft-on crime policies. Now, as this analysis shows they'll even put a finger on the scale of polling to inflate results for her. This analysis is why the American people are seeing through it and will not allow this national gaslighting campaign to win. Despite this manipulated result, from CBS/YouGov it's worth noting that in July and August of 2020, their data showed Biden leading by 10 nationally, reflecting a net positive movement of almost +10 to President Trump this election cycle,\" he noted in a statement about the poll.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Tropical Storm Debby has forced the postponement of a stop in another swing state, Georgia, and according to media reports also North Carolina.\n\nPennsylvania is part of the \"blue wall\" that carried Biden to the White House in 2020, alongside Michigan and Wisconsin. That was one of the main reasons many expected Harris to instead pick that state's governor, Josh Shapiro.\n\nAlso on the vice presidential shortlist had been former astronaut and current senator Mark Kelly, of Arizona, and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.\n\nALSO READ: Republicans must embrace political realities\n\nTrump was riding high politically last month after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally, and then using the Republican convention to highlight his image of vigor against the physically frail Biden.\n\nBut with Biden's dramatic exit and Harris's fast start, he is scrambling to recalibrate.\n\nAt a rally last Saturday in Georgia, Trump called Harris a \"Marxist\" and a \"radical left freak,\" claiming she would cause an \"economic crash.\"\n\nThree days earlier, he shocked many when he told an audience of Black journalists that Harris had \"turned Black\" out of political expediency.\n\nWhere Biden often attacked Trump as a threat to democracy, given his unprecedented refusal to accept his loss in 2020, Harris's team has honed a sharper -- more meme-friendly -- line built around branding Trump and his vice presidential pick J.D. Vance \"weird.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the Harris campaign said Trump was \"scared\" to debate her after he turned down a previously scheduled televised debate on ABC, while saying he'd be ready to debate her on Fox News -- a network that has for years given him support.", "source": {"uri": "citizen.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Citizen"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Right: Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump holds a rally at Van Andel Arena on July 20 in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images; Bill Pugliano/Getty Images .\n\n. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images; Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n\nVice President Harris has shaken up the presidential race and now has a 51% to 48% lead over former President Trump, according to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll.\n\nThat result is 4 points higher than the one Harris got just after she entered the race two weeks ago, when President Biden withdrew. Harris also maintains a 3-point lead (48%-45%) when third-party choices are offered.\n\nBlack voters, college-educated white women, and women who identify as politically independent are driving her rise. She is up 20 to 30 points with them than when she took office, which translates into an improvement in the suburbs and with white voters overall.\n\nOn the economy, negative views of Harris don't stick to Biden the way they did to Trump. Trump still enjoys greater confidence on the economy, but only by 3 points over Harris (51%-48%), compared to 9 points over Biden (54%-45%) in June.\n\nHarris also sees improvement in her handling of immigration, though Trump continues to outperform Trump on that issue by 6 points (52%-46%). The best issue Harris leans on is abortion rights. She has a 15-point lead on that issue.\n\nThe survey was conducted Thursday through Sunday, before Harris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her vice presidential running mate. Marist surveyed 1,613 adults via cellphone, landline and online research panels in English and Spanish. The survey has a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points, meaning the results could be up or down by about 3 percentage points.\n\nWomen, black voters and independents all turned to Harris\n\nBecause of Harris' gains with some groups, she also improved her standing in the suburbs and with white voters overall.\n\nBut the gender gap is now 22 points, which is wider than the gap between Trump and Biden in July. Harris now leads women by 13 points (55%-42%), but trails men by 9 points (54%-45%). Given the margin of error, these results are close to the results of the 2020 presidential election, according to exit polls.\n\nHarris' biggest boost has come from black voters. She went from a 23-point lead over Trump with black voters a few weeks ago, when many voters had swung to the undecided side, to a 54-point lead today. Harris is getting closer to the territory where Democrats need to be with black voters.\n\nSome black voters who seemed to be considering Trump as a candidate have drifted away from him as he lost 10 points with them.\n\nHarris is also now winning votes among independents, something Biden was not. Harris is ahead by 9 points among independents (53%-44%). She was down 14 points among them last month. And in early July, Trump was beating Biden by 4 points among independents.\n\nHarris also made gains with white voters overall. Harris went from 40% with white voters overall to 46% in this poll, which is closer to Biden's, and very high for a Democrat. In fact, no Democrat has scored that high with white voters in a presidential election since Jimmy Carter in 1976. Biden got 41% in 2020, Barack Obama in 2008 won 43%.\n\nThis improvement is driven primarily by white women with college degrees. White voters without college degrees, a key group in Trump's base, largely favor Trump, and their margin remains unchanged. However, two-thirds of white women with college degrees now support Harris, which would be much higher than the percentage who sided with Biden in 2020.\n\nShe is also gaining ground among older voters. Harris leads Trump by 11 points among baby boomers (55%-44%), for example.\n\nLatinos have also shifted toward Harris, with 58% saying they would vote for her now, up from 51% last month. That's still below the 65% Biden won in 2020.\n\nHarris is not yet where she should be with voters under 45. Biden won them in 2020 by 14 points. Harris and Trump are currently tied with this group. However, Harris is doing much better than Biden with this group when it comes to retaining them when third parties are introduced.\n\nBiden, for example, saw a double-digit drop among Gen Z/millennials. Harris, on the other hand, maintained and slightly widened her lead when respondents were given a choice between candidates other than the two chosen by the major parties.\n\nHarris enjoys renewed enthusiasm among key Democratic voter groups\n\nBlack, Latino and young voters say they are more motivated to vote now that Harris is in the race.\n\nBlack, Latino, and Gen Z/millennial voters all jumped by double digits in saying they would definitely vote.\n\nIn July, just 71% of black voters, 68% of Latinos, and 65% of Gen Z/millennials said they would definitely vote, among the lowest rates of any group.\n\nBut now that number is 81% among black voters, 84% among Latinos and 80% among Gen Z/millennials, closer to that of white voters than in previous polls.\n\nThird parties record weakest results in elections\n\nWith Harris in the race, people seem to be moving away from third parties.\n\nAll third-party candidates posted their worst showings since Marist began polling them in April. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running as an independent, is down to 5 percent. Professor Cornel West, also running as an independent, Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver are all polling at 1 percent or less.\n\nKennedy still performs better with those who have an unfavorable opinion of Trump and Harris, attracting about a third of those voters.\n\nPeople are divided on who they think will win, but far more think Harris will win than Biden.\n\nLast month, respondents were 20 points more likely to say Trump would beat Biden (59% to 39%). Today, they are split (48% to 48%).\n\nIt is notable that independents went from 58% thinking Trump would win to 52% now thinking Harris would.\n\nPeople are also more satisfied with their choices, although only 47% say they are, compared to 50% who say they are not. In June, there was a 10-point difference between those who were satisfied (42%) and those who were dissatisfied with their choices (52%).\n\nBeing honest and trustworthy is the most important quality for a president\n\nWhile trustworthiness was the most important quality for Democrats and independent voters, a plurality of Republicans said a strong leader was the most important quality to them.\n\nAll signs continue to point to a close election, not only in the presidential election, but also in Congress.\n\nForty-seven percent of Americans want Democrats to take control of Congress, compared to 45% for Republicans. That two-point advantage remains unchanged from June.\n\nDemocrats traditionally need a larger advantage in this score to make significant gains in 2022; when they prevented Republicans from winning a surge of House seats, they had a 4-point advantage in the Marist poll; in 2020, it was 8, but Democrats lost House seats; they were +6 in 2018 and still made significant gains; in 2014, when Republicans gained seats, Republicans were +5 on the question.\n\nCongressional voting and seat counts are not always perfectly correlated, because the most contested seats are in suburban areas of New York, California and around Philadelphia, where Democrats have the advantage in presidential years due to higher turnout among their core constituencies.\n\nBiden's approval is up\n\nNow that Biden has dropped out of the race, his approval ratings are rebounding.\n\nHis approval rating is now 46%, the highest level since February 2023 and up 5 points from last month.\n\nWhat Are The Main

Morning Consult said the poll was conducted between August 2 and 4 and is based on the responses of 11,265 voters.\n\nMorning Consult said that Harris' 4-point lead is a \"record-high margin in her favor\" and is the \"largest advantage for a Democratic presidential candidate over Trump in nearly a year,\" according to the pollster's election tracking.\n\nOn August 16, 2023, President Joe Biden was found to be ahead of Trump by 5 points among national voters surveyed by Morning Consult. The day before Biden dropped out of the 2024 race, the pollster found him to be 6 points behind the former president (47 percent to 41 percent).\n\nHarris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, also leads Trump by 5 points among independent voters (42 percent to 37 percent) in Monday's poll and was beating the former president by 9 points among young voters between the ages of 18 and 34 (49 percent to 40 percent). The survey has a margin of error of 1 percentage point.\n\nThe vice president was also found to have a higher favorability rating than Trump, with 48 percent of voters saying they have a favorable view of Harris, compared to 47 percent who have an unfavorable view. Trump's favorability rating was in the negatives -- 46 percent of voters said that had a favorable view of the former president, while 52 percent who view him unfavorably.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Harris and Trump's campaigns via email for comment Monday evening.\n\nIn just two weeks since launching her presidential bid, Harris had taken the momentum in the 2024 race. At the end of last week, the vice president was leading in eight national polls. Trump's campaign previously warned its team of a \"Harris honeymoon\" period in the weeks following the vice president's campaign launch.\n\nAggregate polling from The New York Times has Trump still beating Harris by 1 percentage point (48 percent to 47 percent), although the gap between the two candidates has narrowed in recent days. When independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is included in the survey, the Times found that Harris and Trump are tied at 44 percent.\n\nRealClearPolitics also has Trump beating Harris by 0.8 percentage points on average across national polling. On the day that Biden withdrew from the presidential race, Trump was beating the president by just over 3 percentage points, according to RealClearPolitics' polling average.\n\nHarris has also made gains in several pivotal battleground states. Polling averages from the 2024 Silver Bulletin found that the vice president was ahead in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan as of Friday. Polling averages from the Times found Harris and Trump tied in Wisconsin and Michigan, although the vice president was trailing by 2 percentage points in Pennsylvania as of Monday.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaitlin_lewis@newsweek.com", "name": "Kaitlin Lewis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Consult", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morning Consult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_voter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent voter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Tropical Storm Debby has forced the postponement of a stop in another swing state, Georgia, and according to media reports also North Carolina.\n\nPennsylvania is part of the \"blue wall\" that carried Biden to the White House in 2020, alongside Michigan and Wisconsin. That was one of the main reasons many expected Harris to instead pick that state's governor, Josh Shapiro.\n\nAlso on the vice presidential shortlist had been former astronaut and current senator Mark Kelly, of Arizona, and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.\n\nTrump was riding high politically last month after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally, and then using the Republican convention to highlight his image of vigor against the physically frail Biden.\n\nBut with Biden's dramatic exit and Harris's fast start, he is scrambling to recalibrate.\n\nAt a rally last Saturday in Georgia, Trump called Harris a \"Marxist\" and a \"radical left freak,\" claiming she would cause an \"economic crash.\"\n\nThree days earlier, he shocked many when he told an audience of Black journalists that Harris had \"turned Black\" out of political expediency.\n\nWhere Biden often attacked Trump as a threat to democracy, given his unprecedented refusal to accept his loss in 2020, Harris's team has honed a sharper -- more meme-friendly -- line built around branding Trump and his vice presidential pick J.D. Vance \"weird.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the Harris campaign said Trump was \"scared\" to debate her after he turned down a previously scheduled televised debate on ABC, while saying he'd be ready to debate her on Fox News -- a network that has for years given him support.\n\nsms-ft/nro\n\nMore from this section\n\nEnergyCAP Appoints Shawn Lankton as Chief Executive Officer\n\nReformed Gangster Disciples

This could happen as early as Sunday or Monday.\n\nExpectations are that Harris will pick a white man to balance the ticket, and likely a moderate Democrat who would help counterweigh attacks on Harris from Republicans that she is too far to the left.\n\nThe three figures seen as heading the shortlist are Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, and Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona. They were all visiting Harris in Washington on Sunday, The Washington Post reported.\n\n\"It's her first major decision that she's making as an executive, so it tells you about her thought process,\" Amy Walter, a polling expert from Cook Political Report newsletter, told CBS News.\n\nThe CBS poll, which echoes numerous other surveys indicating rapid gains by Harris, shows Trump is still favoured by voters on the key issue of the economy.\n\nOnly 25% said they expected to be better off financially if Harris wins, compared to 45% who said so about Trump.\n\nHowever, when it comes to trust in the candidates' temperament, the poll shows voters prefer the former California prosecutor to Trump, a convicted felon who has made a career out of publicly insulting those who oppose him, including while president.\n\nThe issue of cognitive health, which used to bedevil Biden, is now a liability for 78-year-old Trump, the poll found. Only 51% of respondents thought Trump is mentally capable for the presidency, compared to 64% for Harris. The Democrats believe that if you \"make this referendum on Trump rather than a referendum on the current state of the economy, then we have a real opportunity to win\".\n\nTrump was riding high politically last month after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally, then using the Republican convention to highlight his image of vigour against the physically frail Biden.\n\nBut with Biden's dramatic exit and Harris's fast start, he's scrambling to recalibrate.\n\nAt a rally on Saturday in the swing state of Georgia, Trump called Harris a \"Marxist\" and a \"radical left freak,\" claiming she would cause an \"economic crash.\" On Wednesday, he shocked many when he told an audience of Black journalists that Harris had \"turned Black\" out of political expediency.\n\nWhere Biden often attacked Trump\n\nas a threat to democracy, given his unprecedented refusal to accept his loss in 2020, Harris's team has honed a sharper, more meme-friendly line built around branding Trump and his vice presidential pick J.D. Vance \"weird.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the Harris campaign said Trump was \"scared\" to debate her after he turned down a previously-scheduled televised debate on ABC while saying he'd be ready to debate her on Fox News, a network that has for years given him support.", "source": {"uri": "neweralive.na", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Era Live"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouGov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democrats", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Democrats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Harris 2024 Polls: Harris Widens Lead In Latest Surveys", "body": "Vice President Kamala Harris continues to cut into former President Donald Trump's lead since becoming the official Democratic presidential nominee, according to several new polls -- with the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist survey showing Harris leading Trump by three points.\n\n0.7. That's how many points Trump leads Harris by in RealClearPolitics' latest polling average. Meanwhile, FiveThirtyEight's weighted average shows Harris with a 1.9-point lead.\n\nThe New York Times/Siena poll found voters are more tuned into the race in the aftermath of the June 27 Biden-Trump debate, which was widely considered disastrous for Biden. Some 64% percent of respondents now say they're paying a lot of attention to the contest, compared to 48% prior to the debate.\n\nHarris leads Trump by one point overall in the seven battleground states likely to decide the election: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia, according to a July 24-28 Bloomberg/Morning Consult poll. Harris is ahead in Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and Nevada; Trump leads in Pennsylvania and North Carolina; and the two are tied in Georgia.\n\nDemocrats are far more enthusiastic about Harris than they were about Biden, the Times/Siena survey found, with nearly 80% of voters who lean Democratic saying they would like Harris to be the nominee, compared to 48% of Democrats who said the same about Biden three weeks ago. In a stark contrast with sentiment surrounding Biden's mental fitness, 56% of voters polled by Reuters/Ipsos said Harris was \"mentally sharp and able to deal with challenges,\" compared to 49% who said the same about Trump and 22% for Biden. A 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll found 87% of Americans agreed with Biden's decision to end his campaign, and more Americans think the decision will help the Democratic Party (45%) than the Republican Party (29%). The 19th News survey also showed Americans are split on whether Harris' gender and race will help or hurt her: 31% think being a woman will help her, compared to 33% who think it will hurt her and 34% who see no impact. Respondents were more optimistic that Harris being Black and Indian American will benefit her, with 32% seeing it as helpful compared to 24% seeing it as harmful -- though 41% expected it to have no impact.\n\nTrump campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio predicted a \"short term\" bump in polls for Harris in the coming weeks as her entrance into the race is expected to reenergize Democrats, referring to the anticipated boost as a \"Harris Honeymoon,\" in a memo released shortly after the Reuters/Ipsos poll was made public.\n\nBiden dropped out of the race on July 21 after earlier resisting growing calls from within his own party to end his reelection bid in the wake of his disastrous performance in the June 27 debate. Biden immediately endorsed Harris and she announced plans to seek the nomination. The party has quickly coalesced around her, with all Democratic governors and the majority of Democrats in Congress backing her. She has effectively clinched the Democratic nomination as more than half of all delegates have announced plans to formally vote to nominate her -- something the party is expected to do in the first week of August. An ABC News/Ipsos poll taken July 26-27 found Harris' favorability rating has increased to 43%, from 35% in the groups' previous poll taken July 19-20, while Trump's favorability rating stands at 36% and Biden's is at 37%.\n\nTrump's Lead Over Biden And Harris Jumped After RNC, HarrisX/Forbes Poll Finds (Forbes)", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors":

Of 3,092 registered voters contacted, only 35.5% identified themselves as conservatives, compared to 30.3% moderate voters and 30.2% liberal leaners. That's fewer conservatives and moderates than seen in past polls, they say, and unfairly skewed to the left.\n\n\"Without this manipulation, President Trump would be maintaining a 51-49 lead in their August 4 survey,\" the Trump's team said.\n\nBrian Hughes, a Trump campaign senior advisor, said the polls demonstrate that the \"fake news media\" is continuing its crusade to \"help dangerously liberal Kamala hide her record of economic failure and soft on crime policies.\"\n\n\"As this analysis shows they'll even put a finger on the scale of polling to inflate results for her. This analysis is why the American people are seeing through it and will not allow this national gaslighting campaign to win,\" Hughes said.\n\nBut despite the skepticism cast by team Trump, a slew of polls released Monday show similar results.\n\nA survey of 1,326 registered voters conducted by I&I/TIPP shows Harris up by one point in a head-to-head matchup and by two points in a race including third party alternatives, both within the 2.9-point margin of error.\n\nA SurveyUSA poll of 1,500 likely voters found the Vice President leading the 45th President by three points -- outside the 2.4% margin of error -- with 4% of those surveyed reporting they are still undecided.\n\nA Morning Consult poll of 11,265 registered voters released on Monday has Harris up by 4%, well outside that weekly survey's 1% margin of error.\n\n\"Harris leads Trump, 48% to 44%, a record-high margin in her favor in our tracking and the largest advantage for a Democratic presidential candidate over Trump in nearly a year,\" pollsters wrote.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_medsger@bostonherald.com", "name": "Matthew Medsger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "YouGov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partisan_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Partisan (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fake news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaslighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_party_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Third party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Margin of error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Consult", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morning Consult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Marketing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Geomatics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geomatics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24210622885334-1-1.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792426", "eventUri": "eng-9792426", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 1629, "textEnd": 1637}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Tropical Storm Debby has forced the postponement of a stop in another swing state, Georgia, and according to media reports also North Carolina.\n\nPennsylvania is part of the \"blue wall\" that carried Biden to the White House in 2020, alongside Michigan and Wisconsin. That was one of the main reasons many expected Harris to instead pick that state's governor, Josh Shapiro.\n\nAlso on the vice presidential shortlist had been former astronaut and current senator Mark Kelly, of Arizona, and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.\n\nTrump was riding high politically last month after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally, and then using the Republican convention to highlight his image of vigor against the physically frail Biden.\n\nBut with Biden's dramatic exit and Harris's fast start, he is scrambling to recalibrate.\n\nWhere Biden often attacked Trump as a threat to democracy, given his unprecedented refusal to accept his loss in 2020, Harris's team has honed a sharper -- more meme-friendly -- line built around branding Trump and his vice presidential pick J.D. Vance \"weird.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the Harris campaign said Trump was \"scared\" to debate her after he turned down a previously scheduled televised debate on ABC, while saying he'd be ready to debate her on Fox News -- a network that has for years given him support.", "source": {"uri": "manilastandard.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manila Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's always hard to get a quick handle on public reaction to a huge event like that, but after a couple of weeks, the news has had time to sink in with voters, and it's time to start looking at some new polling.\n\nThe bottom line is that so far, the Biden gambit, the sudden switch forced on the president by powerful Democratic Party insiders, appears to be working. In early July, before the wild series of events that rocked the race -- Trump assassination attempt, GOP convention, JD Vance, Biden withdrawal, rushed delegate vote for Harris -- Trump had a lead of slightly more than 3 points over Biden in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls. Now, two weeks after the Biden/Harris swap, Harris leads Trump by less than a point in the same average.\n\nWhat has happened is precisely what Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio predicted when Biden pulled out. \"We will start to see public polling -- particularly national public polls -- where Harris is gaining on or even leading President Trump,\" Fabrizio wrote in a July 23 memo. \"The Democrats and the MSM will try and tout these polls as proof that the race has changed.\"\n\nThat is the story of the last two weeks and could be the story of the next two weeks before the Democratic convention, which will then add one more week of Harris celebration. Still, Harris is quickly backing away from positions she has held for years, and she has still not answered a single substantive question from any journalist in her two weeks as nominee.\n\nIn a new CBS News/YouGov national poll, Harris has the narrowest possible lead, 50% to 49%, in a head-to-head matchup with Trump. In the last CBS poll, conducted in July during the Republican convention, Trump had a five-point lead over Biden, 52% to 47%.\n\nThere have been other signs that Democrats and some independents are much more enthusiastic about Harris than they were about Biden. Last week, the Harris campaign announced that it raised $310 million in July. That is huge -- a lot more than the $139 million Trump raised, which itself is pretty big.\n\nPlus, there is the obvious fact that Democratic crowds appear more enthusiastic for Harris than they were for Biden. She held her first rally in Atlanta -- no accident, given the huge importance of Georgia in the Electoral College battle -- and she got a big, loud crowd.\n\nAs it turned out, a few days later, Trump had a rally of his own at the same site in Atlanta. He, too, got a big, loud crowd of people happy to be supporting him. Trump has been leading Biden in Georgia for months, and it appears he is still leading Harris, although likely by less.\n\nNevertheless, Trump has clearly had problems re-orienting his campaign. For obvious reasons: He ran against one candidate, Biden, for two years, focusing every thought and attack on Biden, Biden, Biden. Then Democratic insiders pulled off an unprecedented switcheroo, and Trump is no longer facing the opponent he built his campaign around. No candidate and campaign could change tracks without some rough patches.\n\nPlus, Trump is still making some of the same mistakes he has made for years, regardless of his opponent. For example, in the big, enthusiastic Atlanta rally, Trump could not resist bashing Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who Trump still holds a grudge over the 2020 vote counting in Georgia, which Biden narrowly won. It made no sense, yet Trump could not stop himself from doing it.\n\nOn the other hand, Harris has had two weeks of the most positive press coverage imaginable, and after that the race is still tied. But is it a new race altogether? Has it been \"reset,\" as some say? Are the issues somehow different? When Fabrizio wrote, \"The Democrats and the MSM will try and tout these polls as proof that the race has changed,\" his next sentence was: \"But the fundamentals of the race stay the same.\"\n\nObviously, Democrats hope that, with the assistance of a willing press, they can make the honeymoon last for the next three months. Maybe they can. But Republicans believe that, given Harris' weaknesses as a candidate and the weaknesses of her record, the current celebration can't continue forever, or even for three months. Fabrizio is probably right that the fundamentals of the race are still the same. It is Donald Trump's job to stay steady, and keep pursuing his three-part message, with one small change: 1) Things were good when I was president. 2) Things went to hell when Harris took office. 3) Elect me, and I'll make them good again. It's a simple message, and we'll see if it can withstand the current wave of Kamalamania.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "byron_york@townhall.com", "name": "Byron York", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Tropical Storm Debby has forced the postponement of a stop in another swing state, Georgia, and according to media reports, North Carolina.\n\nPennsylvania is part of the \"blue wall\" that carried Biden to the White House in 2020, alongside Michigan and Wisconsin. That was one of the main reasons many expected Harris to instead pick that state's governor, Josh Shapiro.\n\nAlso on the vice presidential shortlist had been former astronaut and current senator Mark Kelly, of Arizona, and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.\n\nTrump was riding high politically last month after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally, and then using the Republican convention to highlight his image of vigor against the physically frail Biden.\n\nBut with Biden's dramatic exit and Harris's fast start, he is scrambling to recalibrate.\n\nAt a rally last Saturday in Georgia, Trump called Harris a \"Marxist\" and a \"radical left freak,\" claiming she would cause an \"economic crash.\"\n\nThree days earlier, he shocked many when he told an audience of Black journalists that Harris had \"turned Black\" out of political expediency.\n\nWhere Biden often attacked Trump as a threat to democracy, given his unprecedented refusal to accept his loss in 2020, Harris's team has honed a sharper - more meme-friendly - line built around branding Trump and his vice presidential pick J.D. Vance \"weird.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the Harris campaign said Trump was \"scared\" to debate her after he turned down a previously scheduled televised debate on ABC, while saying he'd be ready to debate her on Fox News - a network that has for years given him support.", "source": {"uri": "timesofmalta.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "timesofmalta.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(TND) -- We are officially 90 days out from an unprecedented presidential election in the U.S.\n\nWe've got a former president who's trying to redeem himself after losing his first bid for re-election four years ago -- who is also a convicted felon -- up against the current vice president, who was nominated after the incumbent president dropped out of the race.\n\nThe unusual arrangement has cast aside a long-expected Trump-Biden rematch for a short term race to the finish line.\n\nWith enthusiasm for Vice President Kamala Harris atop the Democratic ticket suddenly surging, she's riding a wave of excitement similar to the one former President Donald Trump rode to the White House in 2016.\n\nAnd with few opportunities to nail down Harris on her policy positions ahead of Election Day, Americans may find themselves voting for the candidate whose personality most resonates with them.\n\nWe know Trump's top priorities: tax cuts, tariffs, immigration crackdown, border security, crime crackdown, relaxed environmental regulations, states' rights, and an \"America First\" foreign policy.\n\nAnd we already know Harris', although her presidential campaign began just roughly 100 days before game time: climate action, tax the rich, fund public education, support foreign allies, restore reproductive rights, affordable health care, police reform, and a legal pathway to citizenship for immigrants.\n\nWe'll hear both candidates tout these priorities, but probably not as much as we'll hear them attack each other.\n\nTrump is trying to paint Harris as \"too liberal\" with further left policies than her boss, President Joe Biden. He's questioning her authenticity and race, trying to highlight that she was tasked with addressing immigration challenges for the Biden administration, and pointing to her record as a prosecutor in California.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris is painting Trump as a criminal who directed his supporters to launch an insurrection after he lost the 2020 election. She said Trump will take freedom away from Americans, and abuse his position of power.\n\nBut, perhaps most importantly, is that we'll see both candidates try to hijack enthusiasm from the other.\n\nAfter all, excitement and enthusiasm are essentially the name of the game this November.\n\nRight now, Harris appears to be winning the enthusiasm competition since Biden dropped out. Most polls since then have shown Harris with a slight lead over Trump nationally, and neck-and-neck in key battleground states.\n\nA CBS-YouGov poll conducted July 30 through Aug. 2 (a week after Biden dropped out and Harris stepped in) found enthusiasm among Democratic voters to \"definitely vote\" this fall increased from 81% earlier in July to 85%. Enthusiasm among Republican voters went down, from 90% saying they will \"definitely vote\" earlier in July to 88%.\n\nThere was also a 16-point increase in enthusiasm among black registered voters.\n\nAmong people who say they sometimes or rarely vote but say they'll definitely vote now, Harris is winning.\n\nHarris waits to see if the ticket will enjoy polling gains after announcing her running mate Tuesday: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and after the Democratic National Convention later this month.\n\nMuch of Trump's running mate announcement and Republican National Convention enthusiasm was drowned out by the assassination attempt against him earlier in July, though he did see a brief boost in the wake of the shooting.\n\nTrump had lots of excitement about his candidacy in 2016. According to a March 2016 Gallup poll, 65% of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters said they were very or extremely enthusiastic about him, compared to 54% of Democrats who felt that way about Hillary Clinton.\n\nNow, Trump and Harris are in a tight race to win voters' enthusiasm -- and much of what will decide the next president has to do with how voters feel about the candidates.\n\nThe CBS poll finds Harris (59 years old) has an advantage over Trump (78 years old) as having the mental cognitive health to serve. She's also ahead of Trump on being energetic, focused and competent. Trump beats her in the \"tough\" and \"effective\" department.\n\nVoters appear to trust Trump more with the economy, which is often a leading ballot box issue. Just 25% of voters say they'll be financially better off if Harris wins, versus 45% if Trump wins.\n\nSome analysts say Harris is just enjoying the \"honeymoon\" polling right now, and enthusiasm will wane over the coming weeks. Others point to Trump's un-favorability rating (nearly 52% according to FiveThirtyEight polling) and say Harris is a credible threat to Trump getting re-elected.", "source": {"uri": "cbs12.com",

It has an overall margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena_College", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Siena College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Siena"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Siena"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Tropical Storm Debby has forced the postponement of a stop in another swing state, Georgia, and according to media reports also North Carolina.\n\nPennsylvania is part of the \"blue wall\" that carried Biden to the White House in 2020, alongside Michigan and Wisconsin. That was one of the main reasons many expected Harris to instead pick that state's governor, Josh Shapiro.\n\nAlso on the vice-presidential shortlist had been former astronaut and current senator Mark Kelly, of Arizona, and Kentucky governor Andy Beshear.\n\nTrump was riding high politically last month after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally, and then using the Republican convention to highlight his image of strength against the physically frail Biden.\n\nBut with Biden's dramatic exit and Harris' fast start, he is scrambling to recalibrate.\n\nAt a rally last Saturday in Georgia, Trump called Harris a \"Marxist\" and a \"radical left freak\", claiming she would cause an \"economic crash\".\n\nThree days earlier, he shocked many when he told an audience of Black journalists that Harris had \"turned Black\" out of political expediency.\n\nWhere Biden often attacked Trump as a threat to democracy, given his unprecedented refusal to accept his loss in 2020, Harris' team has honed a sharper - more meme-friendly - line built around branding Trump and his vice-presidential pick J.D. Vance \"weird\".\n\nOn Saturday, the Harris campaign said Trump was \"scared\" to debate her after he turned down a previously scheduled televised debate on ABC, while saying he'd be ready to debate her on Fox News - a network that has for years given him support.

With the November 5 election approaching, Harris has erased Trump's earlier lead, gaining a slight one-point advantage over him nationwide, compared to Trump's previous five-point edge over Biden.\n\nIn key swing states, where the Electoral College contest is decided, Harris and Trump are now evenly matched. This is notable for Harris, who entered the race just last month after President Joe Biden withdrew his reelection bid due to concerns over his age and fitness for a second term.\n\nHarris, Biden's vice president and the first Black and South Asian woman in that role, is in a crucial phase to define her candidacy before Trump does. Her upcoming choice for a running mate is expected to be a significant decision that will shape her campaign's direction.\n\nThe CBS News/YouGov poll also highlights that Trump still leads on economic issues, with 45% of voters expecting to be better off financially if he wins, compared to 25% for Harris. However, Harris is preferred over Trump in terms of temperament, with Trump facing scrutiny over his cognitive health, an issue that now concerns voters more about him than about Harris.\n\nDespite Trump's political high last month, following an assassination attempt and a Republican convention that showcased his vigour, he now faces challenges with Biden's exit and Harris's rapid rise.\n\nTrump has been attacking Harris, calling her names and making controversial remarks, while Harris's campaign has been focusing on portraying Trump and his vice presidential pick, J.D.

Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. gets 7%, and three minor party candidates earn a total of 4%.\n\n\"The landscape has changed since the last Siena College poll,\" Siena College pollster Steven Greenberg said. \"The change at the top of the Democratic ticket has had a noticeable, while not dramatic, effect on the horse race\"\n\nTrump still leads (47%-40%) among registered independent voters, but Harris has cut into the former president's advantage. Against Biden, the former president led 45%-28% among unaffiliated voters.\n\nThe former president also fares well among two traditionally Democrat-leaning groups -- Jews and Hispanics. He virtually split the Jewish vote with Harris (50%-49%) and Latinos (47%-48%).\n\nHarris outperforms Biden among women and Black voters and runs even with Trump in battleground New York City suburbs and upstate.\n\nTrump had earned 29% of Black voters against Biden (59%) and only 11% against Harris (81%).\n\nAmong women, Harris leads Trump 64%-30%. Biden led Trump 51%-33% in June.\n\n\"Interestingly, it wasn't young voters that moved the needle [for Harris],\" Greenberg said. \"Among voters under 35, Harris leads 49-34%, down a little from the 51-32% lead Biden had in June. Harris' big pickup was among voters 35-54, who favor her 54-40%, after backing Trump 44-41% over Biden in June.\"\n\nThe vice president is backed by 86% of New York's Democrats, up from the 75% support Biden had in June.\n\nHarris also is running even (47%-47%) with Trump in the city's suburbs, where many key battleground congressional races are located.\n\nTrump trounced Biden by 13 percentage points in the suburbs in June.\n\nThis Siena College Poll was conducted July 28-Aug. 1 among 1,199 likely voters in New York. the results have a margin of error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points.\n\nCharlie McCarthy \u2709 Charlie McCarthy, a writer/editor at Newsmax, has nearly 40 years of experience covering news, sports, and politics.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlie_mccarthy@newsmax.com", "name": "Charlie McCarthy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena_College", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Siena College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_voter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent voter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siena"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Siena"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Harris maintains a 3-point lead (48%-45%) when third-party choices are offered, too.\n\nFueling her rise are Black voters, white women with college degrees and women who identify as political independents. She is doing 20 to 30 points better with them than when she first got in, leading to improvement in the suburbs and with white voters overall.\n\nOn the issues, the negative views of the economy are not sticking to Harris the way they did Biden. Trump is still more trusted on the economy, but only by 3 points over Harris (51%-48%), compared to 9 points over Biden (54%-45%) in June.\n\nHarris is also seeing improvement on how she would handle immigration, though Trump is still more trusted on that topic by 6 points (52%-46%). Harris' best issue is handling abortion rights. She has a 15-point advantage on that.\n\nThe survey was conducted from Thursday through Sunday, before Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her vice-presidential running mate. Marist interviewed 1,613 adults via cellphone, landline and online research panels in English and in Spanish. The survey has a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points, meaning results could be roughly 3 points higher or lower.\n\nWomen, Black voters and independents have all moved toward Harris Because of Harris' gains with certain groups, she's also improved her standing in the suburbs and with white voters overall.\n\nBut there's now a 22-point gender gap, which is wider than the margin between Trump and Biden in July. Harris now leads by 13 points with women (55%-42%), but is losing men by 9 points (54%-45%). Considering the margin of error, those are close to the results of the 2020 presidential election, according to exit polls.\n\nHarris' biggest boost is coming with Black voters. She has gone from a 23-point lead with Black voters over Trump a couple of weeks ago, when many voters moved into the undecided camp, to a 54-point lead now. Harris is moving closer to territory where Democrats need to be with Black voters.\n\nSome Black voters, who appeared to be considering Trump, have moved away from him, as he's dropped 10 points with them.\n\nHarris is also now winning independents, something Biden was not doing. Harris is up 9 points with independents (53%-44%). She was down 14 points with them last month. And in early July, Trump was beating Biden by almost 20 points with the group. That's a huge turnaround.\n\nHarris has also improved with white voters overall. Harris has gone from 40% with white voters overall to 46% in this survey, which is closer to where Biden was, and that's very high for a Democrat. In fact, no Democrat has scored that high with white voters in a presidential election since Jimmy Carter in 1976. Biden got 41% in 2020, Barack Obama in 2008 won 43%.\n\nThat improvement is mostly because of college-educated white women. White voters without degrees, a core Trump base group, are heavily in Trump's favor and their margin is unchanged. Two-thirds of college-educated white women, though, are now in Harris' camp, which would be far higher than the percentage that sided with Biden in 2020.\n\nShe's also winning with older voters. Harris is leading Trump by 11 points with Baby Boomers (55%-44%), for example.\n\nLatinos have also moved in Harris' favor. Fifty-eight percent say they would vote for her now, compared to 51% last month. That's still below the 65% Biden won in 2020.\n\nHarris is not where she needs to be with voters under 45 at this point. Biden won them in 2020 by 14 points. Harris and Trump right now are tied with the group. Where Harris does far better than Biden with the group, though, is retaining them when third parties are introduced.\n\nBiden was seeing double-digit drop offs with Gen Z/Millennials, for example. Harris, on the other hand, maintains and slightly expands her margin when respondents have a choice of candidates other than the two major-party picks.\n\nHarris is benefiting from a boost in enthusiasm with core Democratic voter groups\n\nBlack, Latino and younger voters are saying they're more fired up to vote now that Harris is in the race.\n\nBlack voters, Latinos and Gen Z/Millennial voters have all jumped double-digits in saying they're definitely voting.\n\nIn July, just 71% of Black voters, 68% of Latinos and 65% of Gen Z/Millennials said they were definitely voting, among the lowest of any groups.\n\nBut now, that's up to 81% with Black voters, 84% with Latinos and 80% with Gen Z/Millennials, closer to being on par with white voters than in previous surveys.\n\nThird parties seeing their lowest marks of the election\n\nWith Harris in the race, people appear to be moving away from third parties.\n\nAll of the third-party candidates are seeing their worst scores since Marist started asking about them in April. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., running as an independent, is down to just 5%. Professor Cornel West, also running as an independent, Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver are all polling at or below 1%.\n\nKennedy still does best with those who have an unfavorable opinion of both Trump and Harris, pulling in about a third of those voters.\n\nPeople are split on who they think will win, but far more say Harris will than they said of Biden\n\nLast month, respondents were 20 points more likely to say Trump would beat Biden (59%-39%). Now, they're split (48%-48%).\n\nNotably, independents have flipped from 58% thinking Trump would win to 52% now saying they think Harris will.\n\nPeople are also more satisfied with their choices, though only 47% say they are compared to 50% who say they are not. In June, there was a 10-point difference between people satisfied (42%) and those who were dissatisfied with their choices (52%).\n\nBeing honest and trustworthy is the most important quality for a president\n\nWhile trustworthiness was the most important quality for Democrats and independent voters, a plurality of Republicans said a \"strong leader\" was most important to them.\n\nAll signs continue to point to a close election - not just in the presidential but also for Congress\n\nForty-seven percent said they want to see Democrats in control of Congress, while 45% said Republicans. That 2-point advantage is unchanged from June.\n\nDemocrats traditionally need a wider advantage in that score to make significant gains - in 2022, when they denied Republicans from winning a wave of House seats, they had a 4-point edge in the Marist poll; in 2020, it was 8, but Democrats lost House seats; they were +6 in 2018 and made significant gains, however; in 2014, when Republicans won seats, Republicans were +5 on the question.\n\nThe congressional ballot and the change in numbers of seats don't always correlate cleanly because of where the most competitive seats are that cycle. In this cycle, for example, many are in suburban areas in New York, California and around Philadelphia, where Democrats have advantages in presidential years because of higher turnout among their core voter groups.\n\nBiden's approval is up\n\nNow that Biden has dropped out of the race, his approval rating is seeing a bounce.\n\nHis approval is now 46%, which is the highest since February of 2023 and up 5 points since last month.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "domenico_montanaro@npr.org", "name": "Domenico Montanaro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Margin of error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hispanic and Latino Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generation Z"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baby boomers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_Senate_election_in_Georgia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022 United States Senate election in Georgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_voter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent voter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Tropical Storm Debby has forced the postponement of a stop in another swing state, Georgia, and according to media reports also North Carolina.\n\nPennsylvania is part of the \"blue wall\" that carried Biden to the White House in 2020, alongside Michigan and Wisconsin. That was one of the main reasons many expected Harris to instead pick that state's governor, Josh Shapiro.\n\nAlso on the vice presidential shortlist had been former astronaut and current senator Mark Kelly, of Arizona, and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.\n\nTrump was riding high politically last month after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally, and then using the Republican convention to highlight his image of vigor against the physically frail Biden.\n\nBut with Biden's dramatic exit and Harris's fast start, he is scrambling to recalibrate.\n\nAt a rally last Saturday in Georgia, Trump called Harris a \"Marxist\" and a \"radical left freak,\" claiming she would cause an \"economic crash.\"\n\nThree days earlier, he shocked many when he told an audience of Black journalists that Harris had \"turned Black\" out of political expediency.\n\nWhere Biden often attacked Trump as a threat to democracy, given his unprecedented refusal to accept his loss in 2020, Harris's team has honed a sharper -- more meme-friendly -- line built around branding Trump and his vice presidential pick J.D. Vance \"weird.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the Harris campaign said Trump was \"scared\" to debate her after he turned down a previously scheduled televised debate on ABC, while saying he'd be ready to debate her on Fox News -- a network that has for years given him support.\n\nsms-ft/nro", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Harris maintains a 3-point lead (48%-45%) when third-party choices are offered, too.\n\nLoading...\n\nFueling her rise are Black voters, white women with college degrees and women who identify as political independents. She is doing 20 to 30 points better with them than when she first got in, leading to improvement in the suburbs and with white voters overall.\n\nOn the issues, the negative views of the economy are not sticking to Harris the way they did Biden. Trump is still more trusted on the economy, but only by 3 points over Harris (51%-48%), compared to 9 points over Biden (54%-45%) in June.\n\nHarris is also seeing improvement on how she would handle immigration, though Trump is still more trusted on that topic by 6 points (52%-46%). Harris' best issue is handling abortion rights. She has a 15-point advantage on that.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe survey was conducted from Thursday through Sunday, before Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her vice-presidential running mate. Marist interviewed 1,613 adults via cellphone, landline and online research panels in English and in Spanish. The survey has a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points, meaning results could be roughly 3 points higher or lower.\n\nBecause of Harris' gains with certain groups, she's also improved her standing in the suburbs and with white voters overall.\n\nBut there's now a 22-point gender gap, which is wider than the margin between Trump and Biden in July. Harris now leads by 13 points with women (55%-42%), but is losing men by 9 points (54%-45%). Considering the margin of error, those are close to the results of the 2020 presidential election, according to exit polls.\n\nHarris' biggest boost is coming with Black voters. She has gone from a 23-point lead with Black voters over Trump a couple of weeks ago, when many voters moved into the undecided camp, to a 54-point lead now. Harris is moving closer to territory where Democrats need to be with Black voters.\n\nSome Black voters, who appeared to be considering Trump, have moved away from him, as he's dropped 10 points with them.\n\nHarris is also now winning independents, something Biden was not doing. Harris is up 9 points with independents (53%-44%). She was down 14 points with them last month. And in early July, Trump was beating Biden by almost 20 points with the group. That's a huge turnaround.\n\nHarris has also improved with white voters overall. Harris has gone from 40% with white voters overall to 46% in this survey, which is closer to where Biden was, and that's very high for a Democrat. In fact, no Democrat has scored that high with white voters in a presidential election since Jimmy Carter in 1976. Biden got 41% in 2020, Barack Obama in 2008 won 43%.\n\nThat improvement is mostly because of college-educated white women. White voters without degrees, a core Trump base group, are heavily in Trump's favor and their margin is unchanged. Two-thirds of college-educated white women, though, are now in Harris' camp, which would be far higher than the percentage that sided with Biden in 2020.\n\nShe's also winning with older voters. Harris is leading Trump by 11 points with Baby Boomers (55%-44%), for example.\n\nLatinos have also moved in Harris' favor. Fifty-eight percent say they would vote for her now, compared to 51% last month. That's still below the 65% Biden won in 2020.\n\nHarris is not where she needs to be with voters under 45 at this point. Biden won them in 2020 by 14 points. Harris and Trump right now are tied with the group. Where Harris does far better than Biden with the group, though, is retaining them when third parties are introduced.\n\nBiden was seeing double-digit drop offs with Gen Z/Millennials, for example. Harris, on the other hand, maintains and slightly expands her margin when respondents have a choice of candidates other than the two major-party picks.\n\nBlack, Latino and younger voters are saying they're more fired up to vote now that Harris is in the race.\n\nBlack voters, Latinos and Gen Z/Millennial voters have all jumped double-digits in saying they're definitely voting.\n\nIn July, just 71% of Black voters, 68% of Latinos and 65% of Gen Z/Millennials said they were definitely voting, among the lowest of any groups.\n\nBut now, that's up to 81% with Black voters, 84% with Latinos and 80% with Gen Z/Millennials, closer to being on par with white voters than in previous surveys.\n\nWith Harris in the race, people appear to be moving away from third parties.\n\nAll of the third-party candidates are seeing their worst scores since Marist started asking about them in April. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., running as an independent, is down to just 5%. Professor Cornel West, also running as an independent, Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver are all polling at or below 1%.\n\nKennedy still does best with those who have an unfavorable opinion of both Trump and Harris, pulling in about a third of those voters.\n\nLast month, respondents were 20 points more likely to say Trump would beat Biden (59%-39%). Now, they're split (48%-48%).\n\nNotably, independents have flipped from 58% thinking Trump would win to 52% now saying they think Harris will.\n\nPeople are also more satisfied with their choices, though only 47% say they are compared to 50% who say they are not. In June, there was a 10-point difference between people satisfied (42%) and those who were dissatisfied with their choices (52%).\n\nWhile trustworthiness was the most important quality for Democrats and independent voters, a plurality of Republicans said a \"strong leader\" was most important to them.\n\nForty-seven percent said they want to see Democrats in control of Congress, while 45% said Republicans. That 2-point advantage is unchanged from June.\n\nDemocrats traditionally need a wider advantage in that score to make significant gains - in 2022, when they denied Republicans from winning a wave of House seats, they had a 4-point edge in the Marist poll; in 2020, it was 8, but Democrats lost House seats; they were +6 in 2018 and made significant gains, however; in 2014, when Republicans won seats, Republicans were +5 on the question.\n\nThe congressional ballot and the change in numbers of seats don't always correlate cleanly because of where the most competitive seats are that cycle. In this cycle, for example, many are in suburban areas in New York, California and around Philadelphia, where Democrats have advantages in presidential years because of higher turnout among their core voter groups.\n\nNow that Biden has dropped out of the race, his approval rating is seeing a bounce.\n\nHis approval is now 46%, which is the highest since February of 2023 and up 5 points since last month.", "source": {"uri": "bpr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "bpr.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Margin of error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generation Z"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hispanic and Latino Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baby boomers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_Senate_election_in_Georgia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022 United States Senate election in Georgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_voter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent voter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Tropical Storm Debby has forced the postponement of a stop in another swing state, Georgia, and according to media reports also North Carolina.\n\nPennsylvania is part of the \"blue wall\" that carried Biden to the White House in 2020, alongside Michigan and Wisconsin. That was one of the main reasons many expected Harris to instead pick that state's governor, Josh Shapiro.\n\nAlso on the vice presidential shortlist had been former astronaut and current senator Mark Kelly, of Arizona, and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.\n\nTrump was riding high politically last month after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally, and then using the Republican convention to highlight his image of vigor against the physically frail Biden.\n\nBut with Biden's dramatic exit and Harris's fast start, he is scrambling to recalibrate.\n\nAt a rally last Saturday in Georgia, Trump called Harris a \"Marxist\" and a \"radical left freak,\" claiming she would cause an \"economic crash.\"\n\nThree days earlier, he shocked many when he told an audience of Black journalists that Harris had \"turned Black\" out of political expediency.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump told an audience of Black journalists that Kamala Harris had 'turned Black' out of political expediency\n\nWhere Biden often attacked Trump as a threat to democracy, given his unprecedented refusal to accept his loss in 2020, Harris's team has honed a sharper -- more meme-friendly -- line built around branding Trump and his vice presidential pick J.D. Vance \"weird.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the Harris campaign said Trump was \"scared\" to debate her after he turned down a previously scheduled televised debate on ABC, while saying he'd be ready to debate her on Fox News -- a network that has for years given him support.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tropical Storm Debby has forced the postponement of a stop in another swing state, Georgia, and according to media reports also North Carolina.\n\nPennsylvania is part of the \"blue wall\" that carried Biden to the White House in 2020, alongside Michigan and Wisconsin. That was one of the main reasons many expected Harris to instead pick that state's governor, Josh Shapiro.\n\nAlso on the vice presidential shortlist had been former astronaut and current senator Mark Kelly, of Arizona, and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.\n\nTrump was riding high politically last month after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally, and then using the Republican convention to highlight his image of vigor against the physically frail Biden.\n\nBut with Biden's dramatic exit and Harris's fast start, he is scrambling to recalibrate.\n\nAt a rally last Saturday in Georgia, Trump called Harris a \"Marxist\" and a \"radical left freak,\" claiming she would cause an \"economic crash.\"\n\nThree days earlier, he shocked many when he told an audience of Black journalists that Harris had \"turned Black\" out of political expediency.\n\nWhere Biden often attacked Trump as a threat to democracy, given his unprecedented refusal to accept his loss in 2020, Harris's team has honed a sharper -- more meme-friendly -- line built around branding Trump and his vice presidential pick J.D. Vance \"weird.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the Harris campaign said Trump was \"scared\" to debate her after he turned down a previously scheduled televised debate on ABC, while saying he'd be ready to debate her on Fox News -- a network that has for years given him support.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times AU"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The progressive governor with a history of winning over Republicans\n\nBut Tatishe Nteta, provost professor of political science at UMass Amherst and director of its poll, pointed to a key finding: a seven-point swing to the Democrat since January, when Trump led Joe Biden by four.\n\n\"For weeks after the first presidential debate in June,\" Nteta said, \"Democratic donors, prominent Democratic elected officials and members of the news media made the case that President Joe Biden faced long odds to defeat former President Donald Trump and called for Biden to step down.\n\n\"In the aftermath of Biden's historic decision to forgo his re-election campaign, it seems as if Biden's critics were indeed correct as his replacement, Vice-President Kamala Harris, has emerged as the frontrunner in the race for the White House.\n\n\"While there are still three months to go, the Harris campaign and the Democratic party must like their chances to maintain control of the White House and to send former President Trump to his second consecutive defeat in his quest to return to Pennsylvania Avenue.\"\n\nThere was also good news for Harris from The Hill, as the site's \"ultimate hub for polls, predictions and election results\" showed the Democrat with a positive favourabilty rating for the first time, after a steep climb since mid-July, when Biden stepped down.\n\nAs to be expected, August polls in the seven battleground states where the election is expected to be decided presented a more mixed picture.\n\nIn polls concluding in August, Public Policy Polling, a Democratic firm, found Harris up one in Georgia but down two on Trump in Arizona and down one in Pennsylvania. Trafalgar/Insider Advantage, a right-leaning operation, put Trump up two in Georgia.\n\nAccording to battleground averages maintained by the polling site FiveThirtyEight, Trump led Harris by four points in Georgia and two points in Arizona, with Harris up by two points Michigan, one in Pennsylvania and one and a half in Wisconsin.\n\nNorth Carolina polls collected by FiveThirtyEight but not averaged showed Trump up but with a shrinking lead, down from nine points in mid-July to two points in early August.\n\nThere was also good news for Harris in a solidly Democratic state, New York, where Trump showed signs of progress while Biden led the blue ticket. With Harris in place, Siena College found her up 14 points, 53%-39%.\n\nOn Monday, Nate Silver, founder of FiveThirtyEight and an influential voice among polling analysts, said Harris \"now has a real lead in national polls - about two points - and has also been ahead in most recent polls of\" Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\"\n\nConcerns about economic conditions should not be counted out, Silver said, on a day of Wall Street sell-offs and reports of recession fears. \"But the momentum in the polls outweighs it for now.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Since then, Harris has seen waves of enthusiasm and support for her White House bid, particularly among young voters, who were previously thought to be disillusioned.\n\nHarris' momentum has also helped the vice president overtake Trump in the polls. According to FiveThirtyEight's real-time poll tracking system, Harris leads Trump by two points as of August 5, with 45.5% of the vote to Trump's 43.5%.\n\nThe social media account Polling USA, which aggregates national polls, also gives Harris an average 2-point lead over Trump in polls, and RealClearPolitics shows Trump in second place for the first time this year.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks before a rally at the Georgia State University Convocation Center in Atlanta on August 3. Experts say it is too early to say that Trump's poll numbers have peaked.

Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nWith Harris appearing to be the leading contender heading into November and Trump seemingly struggling to regain momentum, Sean Freeder, an assistant professor of political science at the University of North Florida, suggested it was still \"way too early\" to make assumptions about current polls.\n\nFreeder added that while Trump's campaign may be \"very concerned\" about the shift in poll numbers seen in recent days, Harris' two-point lead is \"far from insurmountable.\" He added that a major, unexpected event could see Trump's numbers improve.\n\n\"We can prove this for ourselves simply by looking back over a four-week period in which a poor debate performance caused [Biden] to ultimately abandon his campaign and the other presidential candidate was nearly assassinated,\" Freeder told Newsweek.\n\n\"We could not have predicted these events in early June, and so we cannot predict the next 90 days,\" he continued. \"That said, Trump had an unusually weak opponent in Biden, given the internal discontent within his own party, and it seems unlikely to me that Trump will again enjoy the kind of positive and sustained polling that he had before Harris.\"\n\nOver the next three months, several events that could prove decisive for the White House race are expected to occur, including Harris' choice of running mate, Trump's conviction in September in the falsification of business records case and a potential debate between the two leading candidates.\n\nCarl Cavalli, a political science professor at the University of North Georgia, said any updates between now and November could be significant because that's when many voters begin to really focus on the election.\n\n\"As we've seen, debates can be decisive. If Trump and Harris agree to have one, or if their running mates do, it could go a long way toward helping one side emerge from a very tight race so far,\" Cavalli told Newsweek.\n\n\"Most Americans don't pay much attention to the campaign trail during the summer. As we approach Labor Day, a time after the conventions and when debates typically take place, more people are likely to be paying attention. And this year, that engagement will be a very different dynamic than we've seen before,\" he continued.\n\nA late-campaign event that could influence the outcome of the upcoming November election is so well established that it already has a name: an \"October surprise.\"\n\nAs Trump and his campaign appear to be struggling to get their attacks on Harris across -- such as one suggesting that the vice president, whose mother is Indian and father is Jamaican, \"became black\" in recent years for political reasons -- Freeder said a timely attack on Harris in mid-October could \"weaken\" her campaign.\n\nFreeder cited a surprise in October during the 2016 election, when then-FBI Director James Comey reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server 11 days before that year's election against Trump. Freeder said it \"arguably cost\" Clinton the race.\n\nHe added: \"This is a race that either side could end up winning, but the Trump campaign must now recognize that it will likely once again find itself in a race against time rather than its own.\"\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Trafalgar/Insider Advantage, a right-leaning operation, put Trump up two in Georgia.\n\nAccording to battleground averages maintained by the polling site FiveThirtyEight, Trump led Harris by two points in Arizona and one in Georgia, with Harris up by two points Michigan, one in Pennsylvania and one and a half in Wisconsin.\n\nNorth Carolina polls collected by FiveThirtyEight but not averaged showed Trump up but with a shrinking lead, down from nine points in mid-July to two points in early August.\n\nThere was also good news for Harris in a solidly Democratic state, New York, where Trump showed signs of progress while Biden led the blue ticket. With Harris in place, Siena College found her up 14 points, 53%-39%.\n\nOn Monday, Nate Silver, founder of FiveThirtyEight and an influential voice among polling analysts, said Harris \"now has a real lead in national polls - about two points - and has also been ahead in most recent polls of\" Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nConcerns about economic conditions should not be counted out, Silver said, on a day of Wall Street sell-offs and reports of recession fears. \"But the momentum in the polls outweighs it for now.\"", "source": {"uri": "pakistantoday.com.pk", "dataType": "news",

Harris has also narrowed the gap with Trump on overall handling of the economy, unemployment, taxes and interest rates.\n\n\"Many Americans are looking for a fresh face with fresh ideas. And Harris is capitalizing on that opportunity,\" Michael Ryan, financial expert and founder of michaelryanmoney.com, told Newsweek.\n\n\"Working with clients, I've seen what people feel when they're fed up with their financial situation. They don't just want minor changes. They want a whole new approach. That's what I see when I look at the Harris Poll data.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris leads Trump on housing and has improved voter sentiment on key economic issues.\n\nIn a poll earlier this year, 51% of voters said they trusted Trump more to handle the economy, compared to just 37% for Biden.\n\nAfter Biden dropped out of the race and Harris announced her candidacy, voters now say they trust Trump more on the economy (50%), and 42% trust Harris more, a marked improvement over Biden's ratings.\n\nHarris also found that 46% of voters said they trust her more on housing issues, compared to just 41% for Trump.\n\nHarris was also just 3 percentage points below Trump in voters' opinion of her ability to handle the availability of good jobs and unemployment.\n\nU.S. Vice President and 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris smiles as she steps up to the podium to speak at a campaign rally in Atlanta, Georgia, July 30, 2024. Harris has gained ground on economic issues over Trump. More ELIJAH NOUVELAGE/AFP via Getty Images\n\nOn tax policy, Harris garnered 42% of votes who said she had the best policies, while Trump was slightly ahead at 47%.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris had support from 39 and 42 percent of voters on interest rates and the cost of goods, compared to 46 and 47 percent for Trump.\n\nThe Biden administration has been criticized by some Americans for its economic policies, largely because broad-based inflation remains high despite continued interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.\n\nWith inflation now approaching normal levels, Biden, and in turn Harris, continue to face criticism over the jobs numbers.\n\nThe labor market is losing steam: the United States recorded an increase of only 114,000 jobs, while unemployment climbed to 4.3% in July.\n\nThat could complicate Harris's presidential bid, as rising unemployment often drives support away from the incumbent administration. Republicans have already taken last week's less-than-ideal jobs report as an indication of how the Biden/Harris administration is performing.\n\n\"This jobs report is one of the worst we have ever seen from the Biden/Harris administration,\" Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri said in a statement Friday.\n\nAlex Beene, a professor of financial education at the University of Tennessee at Martin, said Trump might also disagree with the sentiment that much of the economic success that occurred during his administration was not actually tied to his policies.\n\n\"I think this latest poll highlights a question that was asked consistently during the last election cycle of Trump's first presidency and ended up working against him: 'How much credit can we give President Trump for the economic health of his term?'\" Beene told Newsweek. \"Virtually every indicator by which we measure the health of the economy has increased, but those gains are building on the already strong economic data from Obama's second term.\"\n\nMany of the economic victories under Trump, such as lower gasoline prices, were due to the pandemic's impact on traffic and not necessarily to bills proposed by the White House, Beene said.\n\nHowever, some of the rapid improvements in voters' perceptions of the Democratic candidate's economic policies may be due to initial enthusiasm, Beene said.\n\n\"These numbers could also simply be due to the fact that Harris is new to the race and the high level of enthusiasm that has brought to this election cycle,\" Beene said. \"This is the first time in most voters' lives that they've seen something like this happen, and the instant polls show the results.\"\n\nHarris and Trump could also adopt different policies regarding the Social Security funding crisis. Earlier this year, analysts estimated that the Social Security program would become insolvent by the mid-2030s if nothing changes.\n\n\"Harris has supported Biden's position, which is to tax high-income earners more,\" Robert Shapiro, a political science professor at Columbia University, told Newsweek. \"Trump has just backtracked and said he won't cut Medicare and Social Security, but his credibility is questionable.\"\n\nWilliam Hall, a professor of political science and business at Webster University, said Harris' entry into the presidential race has mostly created problems for the Republican Party in seeking a strategy against Harris rather than against Biden.\n\n\"I believe that former President Trump and the Republican Party in general have floundered, are in permanent disarray and seem totally incapable of figuring out what to do to mount a successful campaign against Harris,\" Hall told Newsweek.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes

In late a June poll, Trump also trailed President Joe Biden by a narrower 47-39%.\n\nHarris has a 53-43% favorability rating, up from 42-47% in October 2023. While Trump's favorability rating is 39-59%, little changed from 37-59% in June, among registered NY voters.\n\n\"The landscape has changed since the last Siena College poll. The change at the top of the Democratic ticket has had a noticeable, while not dramatic, effect on the horserace. Harris has the support of 86% of Democrats, up from the 75% support Biden had in June. And while independent voters support Trump over Harris 47-40%, they supported Trump over Biden 45-28%,\" Siena College pollster Steven Greenberg said. \"Harris leads with Black voters 81-11%, up from Biden's 59-29% lead in June.\n\nIn a six-way election race, Harris leads Trump 49-37%, with seven percent for Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and four percent for the other three minor party candidates, according to a Siena College poll of New York State likely voters released Tuesday.\n\nBy a large 74-23% margin, voters say this is the most important election of their lifetime.\n\nWhen asked if this election is the most important of their lifetime or no more or less important than any other election, more than three-quarters of Democrats (79%) and Republicans (77%) say it is the most important, while nearly two-thirds (65%) of independents say it's the most important election of their lifetime,\" Greenberg said.\n\nDemocratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand leads Republican challenger Mike Sapraicone 56-33%. Voters strongly support the proposed constitutional amendment on November's ballot, called the Equal Rights Amendment, 68-23%.\n\nThe gender gap has widened with Harris replacing Biden. Currently Harris leads with women by 34 points, 64-30%, up from Biden's 51-33%, or 18-point lead. The race moved far less with men, who favor Trump over Harris 49-43%, compared to the 46-42% lead men gave Trump in June,\" Greenberg said. \"Interestingly, it wasn't young voters that moved the needle.

This represents a significant tightening from the more than 6-point advantage Trump held when Harris first announced her candidacy.\n\nThe Hill/Decision Desk HQ model isn't alone in showing a shift. Nate Silver's electoral forecast now places Harris ahead of Trump for the first time. This reversal comes after Trump consistently led against Biden and initially Harris, with Silver now labeling the race a \"toss-up.\"\n\nShifting dynamics in key battlegrounds\n\nDemocrats have found renewed hope in several battleground states. Decision Desk HQ reports that nine out of ten key states have shown a trend favoring Harris. North Carolina, a state where Democrats have not won since Barack Obama's narrow 2008 victory, has seen Trump's lead diminish from 10 points to just 3. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper (D) expressed confidence on Sunday that Harris could finally turn the state blue.\n\nOther battlegrounds are also in play. Nevada polls, though few, show Trump's lead shrinking from 9 to 3 points since Biden's exit. In Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Michigan, Harris has closed the gap, gaining 2, 4, and 3 points respectively.\n\nNational and demographic trends\n\nHarris's national standing has also improved. A CBS News/YouGov poll released Sunday shows her with a 1-point lead over Trump and tied at 50% in critical battleground states. The poll reflects increased enthusiasm among Democratic voters, with 85% planning to vote this fall, up from 81% last month.\n\nIn a Morning Consult poll released Monday, Harris holds a 4-point lead over Trump, the largest margin for any Democratic candidate in nearly a year. Her appeal extends to independents, where she leads Trump by 5 points, and among younger voters aged 18 to 35, where she has a 9-point advantage -- a demographic where Biden struggled.\n\nImpact of independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nPolling also suggests Harris is better positioned than Biden in a three-way race that includes independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. While Trump had a slight edge over Biden in such matchups, Harris holds a narrow 1.5-point lead according to the averages from DDHQ and The Hill, with FiveThirtyEight showing similar results.\n\nDespite the favorable shift for Harris, the race remains tight, indicating that both candidates will need to energize their bases as the general election approaches. Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio previously suggested that Harris might enjoy a temporary boost in the wake of her announcement. Whether this so-called honeymoon period will last remains an open question, as both candidates gear up for a fiercely contested fall campaign.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

(Brandon Bell, Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nThe Democratic Party officially nominated Vice President Kamala Harris for president late on Aug. 5 when delegates finished virtual voting.\n\nHarris and former President Donald Trump are now deadlocked in a race that has taken presidential politics into territory uncharted in the modern era.\n\nWithin three days in late July, Trump survived an assassination attempt on the campaign trail, was formally nominated by his party, and named Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate.\n\nLess than a week later, President Joe Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed Harris. She became the Democratic nominee on Aug. 5 without winning a single primary election, something that hasn't happened since 1968.\n\n\"[It's] like a giant jigsaw puzzle, with the pieces changing practically every day, or at least a couple times a week,\" Susan MacManus, a political scientist from Florida, told The Epoch Times.\n\nKen Kollman, a political science professor at the University of Michigan, made a similar comment.\n\n\"Things have gotten really scrambled,\" Kollman told The Epoch Times.\n\nDespite these unusual circumstances, the old rules of politics still apply, according to political experts. The winner will likely be the candidate who can do three things well: maintain their core constituents, present an issues-based appeal to independent voters, and turn out the vote on Election Day.\n\nHere's the status of the race to date, and what each side is doing to gain an advantage.\n\nPolling shows that the race is essentially tied at this point. Harris and Trump are each polling within the margin of error in national polls.\n\nAn Aug. 5 polling average compiled by FiveThirtyEight has the vice president up 1.7 percent nationally. A TIPP Insights poll, also released Aug. 5, shows Harris up 1 point.\n\nThe candidates are running close to each other in most of the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada, and North Carolina, which could determine the Electoral College vote.\n\nRecent polls have shown Harris with a slight lead in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and Trump leading in Arizona, Nevada, and North Carolina. Other polling shows a dead heat in Michigan and Georgia.\n\nHarris' entry into the race significantly changed the picture, as Trump had been leading Biden by several percentage points. However, the bump in polling could be a honeymoon effect based on her entry into the race, according to TIPP Insights.\n\nAnalysts agree that the race is still very much up for grabs. To negate Harris' momentum, Trump will have to settle on new messaging, experts told The Epoch Times.\n\nThe Trump campaign appears to be searching for new messaging now that Biden has left the race, according to Aaron Dusso, a professor of political science at Indiana University, Indianapolis.\n\n\"I think they were surprised, like most of us, that Biden chose to step aside,\" Dusso said. \"They weren't really prepared for that.\"\n\nTo regain traction, experts say the Trump campaign must move beyond personal attacks and general promises to mount an issues-based campaign.\n\nPersonality-based campaigning will benefit neither side, according to MacManus, adding that both candidates would be wise to address \"how they are going to solve a problem, and how their opponent is not.\"\n\nAmerican political history professor Jeff Bloodworth said the Trump campaign should focus on this question: \"Are you -- or the world -- better off\" under the Biden-Harris administration than you were during the Trump administration?\n\n\"That was the subtext of the Trump-Biden campaign. That should be the text of the Trump-Harris contest,\" said Bloodworth, who teaches at Gannon University in Erie, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"It's the economy,\" said Edwin Benton, a political science professor at the University of South Florida. \"Always, what's on the mind of the public is their pocketbook, economic issues.\"\n\nThere is evidence that the Trump campaign is shifting its message in that direction. A political action committee supporting the campaign has aired a series of ads tying Harris to high grocery prices, rising crime rates, and the surge of illegal immigrants.\n\nHarris has gained momentum in part because she is new to the race. Multiple experts said her greatest advantage may be her youth. At age 59, she entered a race in which age had been a significant handicap for her predecessor. She now appears as the fresh face running against Trump, who is 78.\n\nIn campaign speeches, Harris has presented herself as the candidate for a new generation.\n\n\"This campaign is about two very different visions for our nation: one focused on the future, the other focused on the past,\" she told rallygoers in Atlanta on July 30.\n\nThe obvious line of attack for the Trump campaign is to identify Harris with her predecessor, experts said.\n\n\"Her biggest liability is her link to the Biden administration, a pretty unpopular president,\" Kollman said.\n\n\"[Biden's] weaknesses are her weaknesses,\" Dusso said. \"Continue to tie those together.\"\n\nIn an email to The Epoch Times, Karoline Leavitt, national press secretary for the Trump campaign, said Harris must defend her support for the Biden record, including inflation, immigration, and foreign wars.\n\nThe Epoch Times requested comments from the Harris campaign but did not receive a reply by the time of publication.\n\nBoth candidates have issues they can win with, and both would do well to present their core issues in a problem-solution formula, pundits said.\n\nHarris' strongest issue is abortion access, which has become a winner for Democrats following the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"That, I think, has really been a major change in American politics,\" Kollman said. He noted that abortion access is now the single most important for Democrats -- and many Republicans -- in the way the pro-life cause was for decades.\n\nTrump holds a number of strong cards, experts said. Immigration continues to be a winning issue for Republicans, despite Harris' attempt to nullify it by pointing out that Trump opposed a bipartisan border security bill earlier this year, which went on to fail in the Senate twice.\n\nInternational affairs remain a strong point for Republicans also. According to Benton, the Biden administration's position on Ukraine and Israel has been confusing. On the one hand, the administration has advocated military aid to Ukraine and Israel. But it has attempted to moderate the effect by prescribing how the weapons should be used.\n\n\"Joe Biden and Harris tried to play at both ends, and you can't do that,\" Benton said.\n\nThe winning formula in politics remains the same, according to Dusso: \"Point to a problem, and say, 'I have a solution.'\"\n\nBoth campaigns have mounted efforts to rally voters in swing states. The Harris campaign has stated that it now has a network of staffed field offices in most swing states, and more than 500,000 volunteers focused on mobilizing voters, according to the campaign's battleground director, Dan Kanninen.\n\nThe Trump campaign's battleground initiative, Trump Force 47, has engaged tens of thousands of volunteers, Leavitt told The Epoch Times by email.\n\n\"We have paid staffers and volunteer-powered field programs in every battleground state, and they are expanding daily,\" she said.\n\nBoth campaigns have impressive fundraising totals. As of May 24, the Harris campaign had about $96 million on hand. The Trump campaign had a balance of $128 million.\n\nThe Harris campaign said it has raised $310 million in July. The Trump campaign reported $137 million raised in July.\n\nIn the end, the race may come down to which candidate can rally his or her core voters on Election Day. For Harris, that means rallying younger people, who are historically the least likely to vote.\n\nFor Trump, that means turning out rural voters, especially men, who are also infrequent voters, according to Kollman.\n\nLatino voters have been a historic demographic for Democrats but have been trending toward the Republican Party. Experts had mixed opinions on whether the Latino vote would shift decisively toward Trump or move back toward the Democrats.\n\nTrump has also made inroads among black voters, but the experts are uncertain whether that will produce enough movement, especially in swing states, to affect the election.\n\nBiden won a number of votes from disgruntled Republicans in the last election, according to Kollman. Harris has launched a campaign to round up those voters, but it's uncertain whether she'll inherit those who defected for Biden in 2020.\n\nDespite the relatively brief window remaining in this campaign, it will take time for the dust to settle after Harris' entry into the race.\n\n\"Everything's brand new,\" Dusso said, adding that it will take a couple of weeks to figure out where the polling will land after voters get used to Harris as a candidate.\n\nThe candidates now have less than three months to settle on the best issues and messaging to present to the voters.

Before Biden left the race, 39 percent of Americans - regardless of who they support - said he stood a chance at winning the election.\n\nIn this latest poll, 48 percent of U.S. adults said they think Harris will win, putting her in a dead-heat with Trump. Another 48 percent of Americans said they think he has the best shot of getting elected.\n\n\"Democrats are totally of a different mindset,\" said Lee Miringoff, who directs the Marist Poll. \"There's no doubt that the Harris candidacy has unleashed a whole new wave of enthusiasm among Democrats, and in the process has also moved some voters who were either straddling the fence or were in Trump's column.\"\n\nConfidence in Trump's ability to recapture the presidency has been shaken since a month ago, when 59 percent of voters overall thought he'd win.\n\n\"We've seen a complete flip of a switch,\" Republican strategist Olivia Troye said.\n\nCompared to June, more people also report being satisfied with the candidates for the president. In this latest poll, 47 percent of Americans said they were satisfied with who Democrats and Republicans have put forward, marking a 5 percentage-point increase since earlier in the summer. Still, 50 percent of Americans overall say they are dissatisfied with their options.\n\nFor much of his presidential race, Biden struggled to gain momentum among younger voters and voters of color. These latest poll numbers show where Harris has already gained ground and how much further she needs to go to motivate communities to throw their support behind her, Miringoff said.\n\nHarris vs. Trump\n\nIf the election were today, 51 percent of U.S. registered voters said they would support Harris and 48 percent said they would back Trump, a gap that narrowly falls within the margin of error.\n\nChart by Jenna Cohen/PBS News\n\nHere are more takeaways:\n\nSupport for Harris rose 6 percentage points since Biden announced he would exit the race. Trump saw a 2-percentage point jump in support since late July. Democrats, Black voters and white women who graduated from college were most likely to support Harris. Republicans, white men who did not graduate from college and white Christian evangelicals were most likely to support Trump.\n\nWhen registered voters were asked to consider a race including third-party candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Harris' lead over Trump was diminished, falling just within the margin of error.\n\nWith a wider roster to choose from, 48 percent said they would vote for Harris if the election were today. 45 percent said they would back Trump. 5 percent of registered voters said they would vote for Kennedy.\n\nSurvey interviews with voters concluded before a news story broke that Kennedy had been involved in leaving a dead black bear cub in New York City's Central Park.\n\nOn the issues\n\nThe most important quality in a possible president is someone American can trust, according to this latest poll. Overall, 27 percent picked honesty and trustworthiness as an essential characteristic, while 20 percent said they want a strong leader.\n\nChart by Jenna Cohen/PBS News\n\nIn this poll, Americans also were asked which of the two major party candidates they thought would better manage a series of pressing issues.\n\nOn the economy, 51 percent of Americans said Trump would do a better job of leading, while 48 percent said Harris would be do better. On abortion, 56 percent of Americans said Harris would do a better job managing the issue, while 41 percent said Trump would. On immigration, 52 percent of Americans said Trump would handle the issue best, while46 percent said Harris would.\n\nLess than two weeks out from the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents were split over whether Harris should continue to pursue Biden administration policies or plan to forge a new path for the U.S.\n\nForty-eight percent of likely Democratic voters said they want Harris to further build upon the work Biden started, while 49 percent said they want Harris to take the country in a new direction. At the moment, Democrats feel largely united behind their future nominee, but as Miringoff warned, it's too soon to \"start measuring the windows for curtains in the White House.\"\n\nPBS News, NPR and Marist Poll conducted a survey on Aug. 1 through 4 that polled 1,613 U.S. adults with a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points, 1,513 registered voters with a margin of error of 3.4 percentage points, 1,309 registered voters who definitely plan to vote in November's general election with a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points and 717 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents with a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points.", "source": {"uri": "pbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "PBS.org"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_santhanam@pbs.org", "name": "Laura Santhanam", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Troye", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olivia Troye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Expectations had always been that Harris would pick a white man to balance the ticket - and the kind of Democrat who can help counter attacks from Republicans that she is too far to the left.\n\nWalz fits that description as a 60-year-old Midwesterner with a folksy manner from a state that could be light years from the coastal elites of California, where Harris comes from, or the East Coast.\n\nHe will also appeal to progressives after having championed popular Democratic policies, including cannabis legalisation and increasing worker protections.\n\nThe duo will hit the campaign trail immediately, launching an intense, five-day swing through battleground states beginning on Tuesday in the biggest prize, Pennsylvania.\n\nFresh from securing the official Democratic nomination overnight, Harris can now head to the national convention in Chicago in two weeks in total control of her party.\n\nIt has been a remarkable journey for Harris, who only entered the race last month when President Joe Biden withdrew, bowing to mounting concerns over his mental acuity and ability at 81 to serve a second term.\n\nIn a campaign that is barely two weeks old, the 59-year-old former prosecutor has obliterated fundraising records, attracted huge crowds and dominated social media on her way to erasing what had been Trump's growing lead in polls over Biden. The latest presidential poll by the University of Massachusetts Amherst released on Monday has Harris leading Trump nationally by three points - 46 per cent to 43pc - compared to a four-point lead for Trump over Biden in January.\n\nIn the swing states that decide the Electoral College contest in US elections, Harris is neck and neck with Trump, who shocked the world with his 2016 presidential victory but was beaten by Biden in 2020.\n\nPicking a vice presidential running mate was seen as the first big test for Harris in her bid to become the country's chief executive.", "source": {"uri":

Trafalgar/Insider Advantage, a right-wing polling firm, gives Trump a two-point lead in Georgia.\n\nAccording to polling averages from the polling site FiveThirtyEight, Trump leads Harris by two points in Arizona and one in Georgia, with Harris ahead by two points in Michigan, one in Pennsylvania and one and a half in Wisconsin.\n\nThe Guardian guides you through the chaos of a presidential election with far-reaching consequences\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online advertising, and content funded by third parties.

With Harris in place, Siena College found her ahead by 14 points, 53% to 39%.\n\nOn Monday, Nate Silver, founder of FiveThirtyEight and an influential voice among pollsters, said Harris now has a real lead in national polls of about two points and is also ahead in the most recent polls in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nConcerns about the economy shouldn't be ignored, Silver said, on a day of Wall Street selloffs and recession fears.

The change at the top of the Democratic ticket has had a noticeable, while not dramatic, effect on the horserace. Harris has the support of 86% of Democrats, up from the 75% support Biden had in June. And while independent voters support Trump over Harris 47-40%, they supported Trump over Biden 45-28%,\" Siena College pollster Steven Greenberg said in a poll press release. \"Harris leads with Black voters 81-11%, up from Biden's 59-29% lead in June.\"\n\nHarris is helped by having better approval numbers in the solidly blue state compared to both Biden and Trump, with Harris coming in at a 53% favorable, while 43% of respondents view the vice president unfavorably. Trump has only garnered favorability ratings hovering between 37% to 39% in the poll, while Biden's June rating was underwater at 42-53 in June.\n\n\"Among all the presidential candidates that are likely to be on New York's ballot, Harris is the only one with a positive favorability rating,\" Greenberg said. \"And looking at the race if it is a six-way election, Harris' lead falls slightly from 14 points to 12 points. At the moment, 11% of voters - and 19% of independents - say they will vote for a minor party candidate.\"\n\nIT'S OFFICIAL: VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS FORMALLY WINS THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION\n\nThe poll in the solidly blue state, which has not gone to a Republican candidate since Ronald Reagan's landslide win in 1984, comes as Harris has closed on Trump in national polls since taking over for Biden at the top of the ticket.\n\nAccording to the Real Clear Politics polling average on Tuesday, Harris now holds a slim lead nationally over Trump. That lead represents a dramatic shift over the outlook the day before Biden dropped out of the race, when Trump held a three-point lead over the incumbent president.\n\nBetting markets have also tightened significantly since Biden's decision to drop out of the race, with the Real Clear Politics Betting Average showing Trump with a 52% chance to win the race and Harris with a 46.3% chance.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThat number compares favorably to the betting odds a week before Biden's decision to drop out, when Trump held a 66.2% chance compared to Biden's 18% and Harris' 7.3%.\n\nThe Siena College Research Institute poll was conducted between July 28 and Aug. 1, surveying 1,199 likely voters in New York and having a margin of error of +/- 4.0 percentage points.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_lee@foxnews.com", "name": "Michael Lee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena_College", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Siena College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red states and blue states"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena_College_Research_Institute", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Siena College Research Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_voter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent voter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealClearPolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RealClearPolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/07/1024/512/Kamala-Harris.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792426", "eventUri": "eng-9792426", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-28", "dateEnd": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 3335, "textEnd": 3353}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Simultaneously, Donald Trump's backing by white voters has slightly increased. The race straddles a statistical tie, revealing Harris's strengths and weaknesses among racial groups ahead of the November 5 election.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris is drawing more support from Black voters than President Joe Biden did when he was in the race this year, while Republican Donald Trump's support among white voters has risen somewhat in recent months, according to an analysis of Reuters/Ipsos polling.\n\nThe analysis, which examined more than 10,000 responses from seven nationwide Reuters/Ipsos polls conducted since May, points to significant strengths and vulnerabilities for Harris, the U.S. vice president who took over Biden's campaign when the president dropped his re-election bid on July 21. Harris would be the first Black woman elected president, as well as the first Asian American, if she were to defeat Trump in the Nov. 5 election.\n\nSome 70% of Black voters polled in July picked Harris over Trump on a hypothetical ballot, up from 59% who backed Biden in May and June polls. Trump's share of the Black vote rose marginally to 12% in July from 9% in May and June. Trump, meanwhile, is seeing increased support from white voters. Some 50% picked Trump in July polls, up from 46% in May and June. Harris had the support of 38% of white voters in July, compared to 36% in May and June.\n\nThe race remains essentially tied, with Harris and Trump each getting 43% support in an aggregate of last month's polls. Biden and Trump each had 40% in the polls conducted in the previous two months. The analysis examined poll responses gathered throughout July on a hypothetical Harris-Trump contest and included responses from before Biden, 81, ended his bid. All responses on Harris, however, were gathered after Biden's June 27 debate against Trump, when the president's faltering performance led Democrats to call on him to end his campaign.\n\nWhite voters make up the biggest racial bloc, accounting for 72% of all voters in the 2020 election, according to the Pew Research Center, though their share of the electorate has dropped sharply in recent decades. African Americans accounted for only 11% of voters that year. But they are a critical component of the Democratic Party's coalition and could play an outsized role in this year's election.\n\nBlack voters in Georgia, for example, propelled Biden to victory over Trump in the 2020 presidential election. But a surge in the cost of living and what they see as a lack of progress on racial justice issues has prompted disillusionment in some quarters. Terrance Woodbury, a Democratic pollster who specializes in minority voter outreach, said Harris needs overwhelming support from African Americans to compensate for her weakness among white voters, particularly white men and seniors. Biden won 92% of the Black vote in 2020, while Trump won 55% of white votes, according to analysis of exit polls by the Pew Research Center.\n\n\"She's going to have to consolidate her base of Black voters, of young voters and women of color,\" Woodbury said. Harris could be picking up a larger share of Black voters who had previously been on the fence. Some 19% of Black registered voters in July said they were undecided, might pick a third candidate or not vote at all, down from 31% in May and June.\n\nA Harris campaign official said the campaign expects the race to remain close in the run-up to November. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump has falsely accused Harris of previously downplaying her Black heritage. He drew jeers from a convention of Black journalists when he said she only promoted her Indian heritage in the past. Harris, who is of Indian and Jamaican heritage, has long identified as both Black and Asian. Reuters combined multiple polls to examine trends among smaller racial and ethnic groups. Margins of error for the poll results varied between about 2 and 6 percentage points.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ipsos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pew Research Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Margin of error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Native Americans in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/01_08_2024_09_46_36_8134926.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792426", "eventUri": "eng-9792426", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 326, "textEnd": 336, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 938, "textEnd": 945}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 1970, "textEnd": 1977}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Back then, Trump received support from 33% of the RFK voters while Biden took only 23%.\n\nBut RFK voters leaning toward Trump aren't enough to offset Democratic gains elsewhere in a D+4 poll that sampled 42% Democrats, 38% Republicans, and 20% independents.\n\nThe data indicate Harris' choice of running mate could give her a boost. Expected Tuesday, the announcement will be a kickoff of her campaign's battleground-states tour.\n\nRoughly half of respondents believe the selection should be a male and about the same amount said he should hail from a swing state.\n\nThat checks the boxes for Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, two Democrats in the running -- and seen as top favorites -- as of Monday evening.\n\nAmong Democrats, 14% want Kelly and 12% prefer Shapiro. Kelly has a slight edge among independents at 7%, with Shapiro and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg not far behind at 5%.\n\nThe polling points to the former president's polarization, with 75% of Trump backers saying his accomplishments drive their support and 48% citing Trump's ability to \"save America\" as a key point in his favor.\n\nConversely, 66% of those not voting for Trump say he's a \"threat to America,\" with 48% of them also blaming Trump for the \"Jan. 6 insurrection.\"\n\nHarris supporters, meanwhile, see her campaign in aspirational terms, with 66% believing the 59-year-old former prosecutor and senator represents a \"new generation\" in the Democratid Party. Of Harris supporters, 37% think she'll enhance America's \"global standing,\" while 35% think Harris will continue the policies of the Biden administration.\n\nIronically, America's global standing and the threat of continued Biden policies are key reasons many voters are looking elsewhere, with 77% of Harris haters worried she will perpetuate Bidenism and 49% convinced she will erode international perception of the United States.\n\nWhen asked about candidate qualities, Harris has the advantage over Trump in being perceived as compassionate, energetic, likable, intelligent, hardworking and \"moderate,\" which suggests Trump's branding of her as \"dangerously liberal\" isn't catching on.\n\nTrump is thought of as more experienced, strong and patriotic.\n\nThe polling also indicates the prospect of a Harris election inspires more positive feelings than Biden's re-election would have, with twice as many people saying they would feel \"pride\" if the vice president was elected in November rather than the incumbent.\n\nA quarter of independents say they're more excited about voting in a Harris-Trump race, but that number is dwarfed by the 66% of Democrats and the 37% of Republicans who say the same.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate.\n\nLess than a week later, President Joe Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed Harris. She became the Democratic nominee on Aug. 5 without winning a single primary election, something that hasn't happened since 1968.\n\n\"[It's] like a giant jigsaw puzzle, with the pieces changing practically every day, or at least a couple times a week,\" Susan MacManus, a political scientist from Florida, told The Epoch Times.\n\nKen Kollman, a political science professor at the University of Michigan, made a similar comment.\n\n\"Things have gotten really scrambled,\" Kollman told The Epoch Times.\n\nDespite these unusual circumstances, the old rules of politics still apply, according to political experts. The winner will likely be the candidate who can do three things well: maintain their core constituents, present an issues-based appeal to independent voters, and turn out the vote on Election Day.\n\nThe candidates are running close to each other in most of the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada, and North Carolina, which could determine the Electoral College vote.\n\nRecent polls have shown Harris with a slight lead in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and Trump leading in Arizona, Nevada, and North Carolina. Other polling shows a dead heat in Michigan and Georgia.\n\nHarris' entry into the race significantly changed the picture, as Trump had been leading Biden by several percentage points. However, the bump in polling could be a honeymoon effect based on her entry into the race, according to TIPP Insights.\n\n\"I think they were surprised, like most of us, that Biden chose to step aside,\" Dusso said. \"They weren't really prepared for that.\"\n\nTo regain traction, experts say the Trump campaign must move beyond personal attacks and general promises to mount an issues-based campaign.\n\nPersonality-based campaigning will benefit neither side, according to MacManus, adding that both candidates would be wise to address \"how they are going to solve a problem, and how their opponent is not.\"\n\nAmerican political history professor Jeff Bloodworth said the Trump campaign should focus on this question: \"Are you -- or the world -- better off\" under the Biden-Harris administration than you were during the Trump administration?\n\n\"That was the subtext of the Trump-Biden campaign. That should be the text of the Trump-Harris contest,\" said Bloodworth, who teaches at Gannon University in Erie, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"It's the economy,\" said Edwin Benton, a political science professor at the University of South Florida. \"Always, what's on the mind of the public is their pocketbook, economic issues.\"\n\nIn campaign speeches, Harris has presented herself as the candidate for a new generation.\n\n\"This campaign is about two very different visions for our nation: one focused on the future, the other focused on the past,\" she told rallygoers in Atlanta on July 30.\n\nThe obvious line of attack for the Trump campaign is to identify Harris with her predecessor, experts said.\n\n\"Her biggest liability is her link to the Biden administration, a pretty unpopular president,\" Kollman said.\n\n\"[Biden's] weaknesses are her weaknesses,\" Dusso said. \"Continue to tie those together.\"\n\nIn an email to The Epoch Times, Karoline Leavitt, national press secretary for the Trump campaign, said Harris must defend her support for the Biden record, including inflation, immigration, and foreign wars.\n\nHarris' strongest issue is abortion access, which has become a winner for Democrats following the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"That, I think, has really been a major change in American politics,\" Kollman said. He noted that abortion access is now the single most important for Democrats -- and many Republicans -- in the way the pro-life cause was for decades.\n\nTrump holds a number of strong cards, experts said. Immigration continues to be a winning issue for Republicans, despite Harris' attempt to nullify it by pointing out that Trump opposed a bipartisan border security bill earlier this year, which went on to fail in the Senate twice.\n\nInternational affairs remain a strong point for Republicans also. According to Benton, the Biden administration's position on Ukraine and Israel has been confusing. On the one hand, the administration has advocated military aid to Ukraine and Israel. But it has attempted to moderate the effect by prescribing how the weapons should be used.\n\n\"Joe Biden and Harris tried to play at both ends, and you can't do that,\" Benton said.\n\nThe Trump campaign's battleground initiative, Trump Force 47, has engaged tens of thousands of volunteers, Leavitt told The Epoch Times by email.\n\n\"We have paid staffers and volunteer-powered field programs in every battleground state, and they are expanding daily,\" she said.\n\nBoth campaigns have impressive fundraising totals. As of May 24, the Harris campaign had about $96 million on hand. The Trump campaign had a balance of $128 million.\n\nFor Trump, that means turning out rural voters, especially men, who are also infrequent voters, according to Kollman.\n\nLatino voters have been a historic demographic for Democrats but have been trending toward the Republican Party. Experts had mixed opinions on whether the Latino vote would shift decisively toward Trump or move back toward the Democrats.\n\nTrump has also made inroads among black voters, but the experts are uncertain whether that will produce enough movement, especially in swing states, to affect the election.\n\nBiden won a number of votes from disgruntled Republicans in the last election, according to Kollman. Harris has launched a campaign to round up those voters, but it's uncertain whether she'll inherit those who defected for Biden in 2020.\n\nDespite the relatively brief window remaining in this campaign, it will take time for the dust to settle after Harris' entry into the race.\n\n\"Everything's brand new,\" Dusso said, adding that it will take a couple of weeks to figure out where the polling will land after voters get used to Harris as a candidate.\n\nThe candidates now have less than three months to settle on the best issues and messaging to present to the voters.

The margin of error in the recent poll is 3.8 percent.\n\nIn January, a UMass poll showed Trump leading President Biden 43 percent to 39 percent.\n\nWhile the subject of Biden's ouster and who should replace him at the top of the ticket consumed Democrats for weeks this summer, the choice to unite around Harris appears to be paying off so far.\n\n\"In the aftermath of Biden's historic decision to forgo his re-election campaign, it seems as if Biden's critics were indeed correct as his replacement, Vice President Kamala Harris, has emerged as the frontrunner in the race for the White House,\" Tatishe Nteta, a political science professor at UMass Amherst and the director of the poll, said in a statement.\n\nCompared to the January poll, Harris has improved on Biden's standing among Latino voters by 13 points, among independent voters by 17 points, and among voters between the ages of 18 and 29 by 14 percent.\n\nHarris' ascent has increased enthusiasm throughout her party. The UMass poll found that 66 percent of Democrats are more enthusiastic about voting now that Harris will be taking on Trump.\n\nThe poll does find that, among a wide variety of issues, Trump is seen as more reliable. Voters were asked which candidate they think would best handle 12 issues. Trump was favored in seven of them, including the economy, crime, and immigration. Harris was seen as the better candidate to handle four: climate change, reproductive rights, education, and healthcare. Respondents were evenly split between the two when asked about foreign policy.\n\nHarris has reportedly narrowed down her considerations for who would become her vice presidential running mate to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Voters surveyed in the UMass poll were asked about who they would like to see her pick. About 52 percent said that they were unsure. The most popular option was Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly with 9 percent, while Shapiro garnered 8 percent of responses and Walz received just 4 percent.\n\nOnce she announces her decision, Harris is set to go on a five-day, seven-city blitz through battleground states.\n\n\"Harris has improved upon Biden's horserace standing in virtually every demographic subset, including a whopping 17% shift among independents and a notable 14 percentage point uptick among young voters,\" Alexander Theodoridis, associate professor of political science at UMass Amherst and co-director of the poll said in a statement. \"The three months between now and Election Day might as well be an eternity in political time and the last few weeks should remind us how quickly fortunes can change, but Kamala Harris and Democrats are riding a

The numbers reflect a 7 point pro-Harris swing from a January 2024 poll when Trump led then challenger President Joe Biden 39% to 36%.\n\nREAD MORE: Harris vs. Trump: Latest polling numbers show major change in race\n\n\"Harris's entry has really shaken up the presidential race,\" Jesse Rhodes, professor of political science at UMass Amherst and co-director of the poll said in a statement. \"Where Donald Trump was once heavily favored over Joe Biden, we now see Harris with a narrow lead. This appears to be driven by big shifts among young voters, African Americans and Latinx Americans toward Harris. Moderates also appear to have shifted dramatically to Harris.\n\n\"The 2024 presidential election is still extremely close, but it's an entirely different race than it was a month ago,\" Rhodes added.\n\nOf those who are backing Trump, 75% said they were doing so because of his first-term accomplishments followed by 48% who said he will save America. Twenty-seven percent, each, said he was the best president America has ever had or are casting their vote because he is the Republican nominee. Those who aren't voting for Trump said he was a threat to America (66%) followed by 41% who said he was responsible for the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nSixty-six percent of Harris supporters said they are voting for the vice president because she represents a new generation. Thirty-seven percent said she will strengthen America's global standing. Twenty-seven percent said they are backing Harris because she is the Democratic pick for the White House. The majority of people who said they weren't voting for Harris - 77% - said it was because they thought she would consider the policies of the Biden administration; 49% said she would weaken America's global standing.\n\nWhen asked to compare who would handle issues the best, Trump received his highest scores for the economy, taxes, crime and immigration (all 53%) as well as the Israel-Hamas War (54%) and Ukraine-Russia War (52%). Harris received her highest marks for reproductive rights (61%), handling climate change (60%), healthcare (58%) and education (56%).\n\nThe poll included a nationwide sample of 1,000.

It's great to have him on the team.\"\n\nExpectations had always been that Harris would pick a white man to balance the ticket and help win over working-class, white, male voters, a demographic that propelled Trump to victory in 2016.\n\nWalz fits that description as a 60-year-old Midwesterner with a folksy manner, decades of military experience and a rural perspective -- a gun-owning Democrat who tweets about hunting.\n\nThe onetime teacher and school sports coach flipped a Republican district to win a seat in the US House of Representatives in a state seen as light years from the coastal elites of California, Harris's home turf, or the East Coast.\n\nAt the same time, Walz will appeal to the left for championing popular Democratic policies including cannabis legalization, increasing worker protections, safeguarding abortion rights, and supporting tighter firearm restrictions.\n\nTrump's campaign immediately branded the Minnesotan as a \"dangerously liberal extremist\" seeking to impose California values on the nation.\n\nBut \"to characterize him as left is so unreal,\" Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker who worked extensively with him in Congress, told MSNBC.\n\nWalz \"is right down the middle. He's a heartland of America Democrat.\"\n\nWalz called his naming the \"honor of a lifetime\" and quipped it felt like \"the first day of school.\"\n\n- Battleground swing -\n\nHe and Harris will hit the campaign trail immediately, launching an intense, five-day swing through battleground states starting Tuesday in the biggest prize, Pennsylvania.\n\nFresh from securing the official Democratic nomination, Harris will head to the national convention in Chicago in two weeks in total control of her party.\n\nIt has been a remarkable journey for Harris, who only entered the race last month when 81-year-old President Joe Biden withdrew, bowing to mounting concerns over his mental acuity.\n\nIn a campaign barely two weeks old, the 59-year-old former prosecutor and senator has obliterated fundraising records, attracted huge crowds and dominated social media on her way to erasing what had been Trump's growing lead in polls over Biden.\n\nThe latest presidential poll by the University of Massachusetts Amherst released Monday has Harris leading Trump nationally by three percentage points -- 46 to 43 -- compared to a four-point lead for Trump over Biden in January.\n\nIn the swing states that decide the Electoral College contest in US elections, Harris is neck and neck with Trump, who shocked the world with his 2016 presidential victory but was beaten by Biden in 2020.\n\n- First major test -\n\nPicking a running mate was seen as the first big test for Harris in her bid to become the country's chief executive.\n\nNow, Harris and Walz will face the first hurdle of their ground game as they make the nationwide swing this week from Philadelphia to Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada. Tropical Storm Debby has forced the postponement of a stop in battleground Georgia, and according to media reports also North Carolina.\n\nPennsylvania is part of the \"blue wall\" that carried Biden to victory in 2020, alongside Michigan and Wisconsin. That was a main reason many expected Harris to instead pick that state's governor, Josh Shapiro.\n\nAlso on the vice presidential shortlist had been former astronaut and current US Senator Mark Kelly, of Arizona, and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.\n\nTrump was riding high politically last month after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally, and then using the Republican convention to highlight his image of vigor against the physically frail Biden.\n\nBut with Biden's dramatic exit and Harris's fast start, he is scrambling to recalibrate.\n\nAt a rally Saturday in Georgia, Trump called Harris a \"Marxist\" who would cause an \"economic crash.\"\n\nThree days earlier, he shocked many when he told an audience of Black journalists that Harris had \"turned Black\" out of political expediency.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5,

Tim Walz (D-MN) as her running mate.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was flirting with the possibility of putting Minnesota in play when he was running against President Joe Biden. But with Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket, and Walz joining her on Tuesday, it doesn't appear likely the North Star State is flipping into Trump's column in November.\n\nTrump has had his eyes set on winning Minnesota ever since he lost the state in 2016 by fewer than 45,000 votes. However, in 2020 he lost the state by more than 7 percentage points.\n\nBut internal polling conducted by the Trump campaign back in May showed Trump and Biden tied at 40%, giving the former president the idea that Minnesota might be winnable.\n\n\"Joe Biden is so weak, and Democrats are in such disarray, that not only is President Trump winning every traditional battleground state, but longtime blue states such as Minnesota, Virginia, and New Jersey are now in play,\" Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told Politico in May.\n\nHowever a lot has changed in the past few months. Harris has now replaced Biden, and polling numbers indicate Harris has a 10-point lead on Trump in Minnesota.\n\nGOP senators told the Hill that Trump was surprised by the overwhelming support that Harris received once Biden stepped out of the race.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nAnd now that Harris has selected Walz, a strong union supporter and abortion rights advocate, Trump faces stiff competition in convincing Minnesota voters to go against their governor.\n\nWalz wasn't the only VP option for Harris if she wanted to seal a battleground state for herself.\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA) and Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) were the other two rumored finalists who came just short of joining Harris at the top of the ticket.\n\nArizona is an important swing state that was at the heart of some of the most highly contested election security fights in recent years. It is also a border state, and Kelly's strong record on illegal immigration would have helped soothe voter fears about how a Harris administration would address the problem.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nEven more important than Arizona or Minnesota is Pennsylvania, which is a must-win contest for Harris as there is virtually no path to winning 270 Electoral College votes without it.\n\nHarris is cruising ahead of Trump in Minnesota according to the Real Clear Politics average, but she is still trailing him in Arizona and Pennsylvania.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE

She has limited time until Election Day on November 5.\n\nCNN initially reported the decision early Tuesday morning.\n\nExpectations had always been that Harris would choose a white male to balance the ticket -- and a Democrat who could help fight Republican accusations that she is too far left.\n\nWalz fits that description as a 60-year-old Midwesterner with a folksy demeanor from a state that could be light years away from the coastal elites of California, Harris' home state, or the East Coast.\n\nHe will also appeal to progressives, having advocated for popular Democratic ideas like as cannabis legalization and more worker rights.\n\nThe duo will hit the campaign trail right away, embarking on an aggressive five-day swing through battleground states beginning Tuesday in Pennsylvania, the greatest prize.\n\nHarris, who secured the formal Democratic nomination overnight, may now proceed to the national convention in Chicago in two weeks with complete control of her party.\n\nHarris' path has been extraordinary, considering she only entered the campaign last month when President Joe Biden resigned due to growing worries about his mental acuity and capacity to serve a second term at the age of 81.\n\nIn a campaign that is only two weeks old, the 59-year-old former prosecutor has broken money records, drew large audiences, and dominated social media on her route to erasing Trump's rising poll lead over Biden.\n\nAccording to the most recent presidential survey released by the University of Massachusetts Amherst on Monday, Harris leads Trump nationwide by three points (46 percent to 43 percent), compared to Trump's four-point lead over Biden in January.\n\nIn the swing states that decide the Electoral College contest in US elections, Harris is neck and neck with Trump, who shocked the world with his 2016 presidential victory but was beaten by Biden in 2020.\n\nPicking a vice presidential running mate was seen as the first big test for Harris in her bid to become the country's chief executive.\n\n\"It tells you about her thought process,\" Amy Walter, a polling expert from Cook Political Report newsletter, told CBS News.\n\nHarris and Walz will now face the first test of their ground game as they travel across the country this week, from Philadelphia to Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada. Tropical Storm Debby has prompted the postponing of a stop in Georgia, as well as North Carolina, according to media reports.\n\nPennsylvania, together with Michigan and Wisconsin, formed the \"blue wall\" that propelled Biden to the presidency in 2020. That was one of the key reasons why many expected Harris to choose Josh Shapiro, the governor of that state.\n\nFormer astronaut and current Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, as well as Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, were both on the vice presidential shortlist.\n\nTrump was riding high politically last month after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally and then used the Republican convention to contrast his strength with Biden's physical frailty.\n\nHowever, with Biden's abrupt resignation and Harris's quick start, he is scrambling to adjust.\n\nAt a rally in Georgia last Saturday, Trump described Harris as a \"Marxist\" and a \"radical left freak,\" alleging she would create a \"economic crash.\"\n\nThree days earlier, he stunned many by telling a group of Black journalists that Harris had \"turned Black\" for political reasons.\n\nWhereas Biden has blasted Trump as a threat to democracy, given his extraordinary refusal to recognize his 2020 loss, Harris's campaign has polished a sharper -- and more meme-friendly -- message centered on portraying Trump and his vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance as \"weird.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the Harris campaign said Trump was \"scared\" to face her after turning down a previously scheduled aired debate on ABC, but that he would be willing to debate her on Fox News, a network that has long supported him.", "source": {"uri": "howafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "How Africa News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

How will it affect Senate races in the West?", "body": "Vice President Kamala Harris' rapid rise to the top of Democratic ticket hasn't just reset the 2024 presidential election -- it may have changed the battle over the Senate majority taking place in the West.\n\nNevada, Arizona and Montana are three of a handful of \"toss-up\" Senate seats Democrats are defending to retain a majority in Congress' upper chamber where they currently govern with 47 Democratic senators plus four independents compared to Republicans' 49.\n\nIn all three Western states, the Democratic incumbents polled far ahead of their party's previous presidential nominee, President Joe Biden, sparking fears the aging candidate would be a drag on down ballot races, costing Democrats not only the presidency but the Senate as well.\n\nBut former President Donald Trump's 6-percentage-point lead over Biden in the purple states of Arizona and Nevada appears to have been cut in half or eliminated after Biden dropped out of the running and Harris received support from the party establishment. Voters looking for a more electable alternative to Trump now have somewhere to go -- a fact that could boost Democratic turnout.\n\nWhile Harris may present a liability for red-state Democrats, like Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., because of her progressive record, having her atop the ticket could be a help embattled Democrats in other close Senate races, like Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., according to experts and voters in the Silver State.\n\n\"When you're running in a presidential year, it's all about the top of the ticket,\" said Kenneth Miller, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, in an interview with the Deseret News. \"(Rosen's) fortunes rise and fall with the with the fortunes of the presidential race. So Biden's exit and Kamala Harris' entry was a massive boon for her campaign.\"\n\nRosen, a one-term member of the U.S House and a former synagogue president, is running against Army veteran Sam Brown, who narrowly survived a roadside bomb in Afghanistan. Echoing national messaging by their respective parties, Rosen has emphasized abortion access while Brown has focused on inflation, immigration and energy.\n\nRosen has consistently led Brown in the polls, with the Real Clear Politics average putting her up by 4 percentage points, significantly outperforming Biden, who was down 5.6 points on average in the state. But polling better than your party's presidential candidate isn't typically a good sign, Miller said, because your election showing \"is going to come down to the president's number, you're not going to bring the president's number up.\"\n\n\"(Rosen) was in a situation where it really looked like Biden was going to drag her down,\" Miller said. \"Biden's exit has eliminated that problem.\"\n\nOnly one poll has been conducted in Nevada since Biden withdrew himself on July 21 and Harris emerged as the party's presumptive nominee. It shows Trump's lead in the state disappearing, and Harris ahead by 2 points, according to the Bloomberg-Morning Consult poll.\n\nPolls only represent a snapshot of how voters are feeling. But the current national snapshot is of a race moving in Harris' direction.\n\nThe latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll shows Harris up 51%-48% over Trump, 4 percentage points better than her showing two weeks ago, according to the same poll. A new University of Massachusetts Amherst-YouGov poll conducted over the weekend also shows Harris with a 3-percentage-point lead -- a 7-point swing from the poll's findings of a Trump-Biden rematch in January.\n\nHarris led Trump by 1 percentage point nationally, and was tied in the key battleground states, according to a CBS News/YouGov poll released Sunday. And a Morning Consult poll published on Monday showed Harris leading Trump by 4 points. The Hill/Decision Desk HQ now shows Harris and Trump neck and neck in an average of national polls. And pollster Nate Silver's electoral forecast showed Harris leading Trump for the first time on Monday.\n\nJust a few days after Biden dropped out, Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio predicted a \"Harris Honeymoon\" period that would exaggerate her popularity as voters expressed interest in a relatively unknown candidate. The temporary shift in polling would not represent a shift in the fundamentals of the race, Fabrizio said.\n\nBut Miller said the shift from Biden to Harris will have a very real impact on who comes out to vote: \"People decide whether or not participate in the election based on the biggest races.\"\n\nLifelong Nevada resident Lindsey Forbes told the Deseret News she was a \"decided\" vote for Rosen because of her stance on abortion. But having Harris as the Democratic standard bearer has increased her motivation to volunteer her time for the campaign.\n\n\"I think that I was always going to vote but I feel more energized to get people around me to vote,\" Forbes said.\n\nRobert Ellis, who works in casino security in Reno, Nevada, told the Deseret News his electoral decisions are motivated by a desire to keep Trump out of office because Ellis sees the former president as irresponsible and a threat to the country's democratic institutions. While he said he would \"vote for any Democrat over Trump,\" Ellis believes that Biden being replaced expands the Democratic base from anti-Trump voters to those who want to vote for Harris.\n\n\"The morale has been lifted and people are more energized for sure,\" Ellis said. \"I think people would vote against Trump. Now there's going to be more people who will vote Democrat.\"\n\nTo Zach Guymon, a Las Vegas-based GOP strategist at Reformation Strategies, it's no surprise that Nevadans are now more likely to vote for Democrats in November, including for Rosen. But don't let the recent wave of positive polls create an exaggerated perception of Harris' popularity, Guymon cautioned.\n\n\"They replaced the worst Democratic candidate they could ever have with a still deeply flawed, pretty unpopular Democratic nominee,\" Guymon said.\n\nRepublicans have attacked Harris for her role in the Biden administration's efforts to stem migration at the southern border, as well as her past stances on universal health care programs, gun control and a Green New deal. Harris has yet to face significant media scrutiny and hasn't sat down for an interview since becoming her party's nominee for president.\n\nBut as the electorate gets to know Harris better, and even when she does make an inevitable gaffe, it is unlikely to derail her campaign because the bar was set so low by Biden, Guymon said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Trump's share of the Black vote rose marginally to 12% in July from 9% in May and June.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is seeing increased support from white voters. Some 50% picked Trump in July polls, up from 46% in May and June. Harris had the support of 38% of white voters in July, compared to 36% in May and June.\n\nThe race remains essentially tied, with Harris and Trump each getting 43% support in an aggregate of last month's polls. Biden and Trump each had 40% in the polls conducted in the previous two months.\n\nThe analysis examined poll responses gathered throughout July on a hypothetical Harris-Trump contest and included responses from before Biden, 81, ended his bid. All responses on Harris, however, were gathered after Biden's June 27 debate against Trump, when the president's faltering performance led Democrats to call on him to end his campaign.\n\nWhite voters make up the biggest racial bloc, accounting for 72% of all voters in the 2020 election, according to the Pew Research Center, though their share of the electorate has dropped sharply in recent decades.\n\nAfrican Americans accounted for only 11% of voters that year. But they are a critical component of the Democratic Party's coalition and could play an outsized role in this year's election.\n\nBlack voters in Georgia, for example, propelled Biden to victory over Trump in the 2020 presidential election. But a surge in the cost of living and what they see as a lack of progress on racial justice issues has prompted disillusionment in some quarters.\n\nTerrance Woodbury, a Democratic pollster who specializes in minority voter outreach, said Harris needs overwhelming support from African Americans to compensate for her weakness among white voters, particularly white men and seniors. Biden won 92% of the Black vote in 2020, while Trump won 55% of white votes, according to analysis of exit polls by the Pew Research Center.\n\n\"She's going to have to consolidate her base of Black voters, of young voters and women of color,\" Woodbury said.\n\nHarris could be picking up a larger share of Black voters who had previously been on the fence. Some 19% of Black registered voters in July said they were undecided, might pick a third candidate or not vote at all, down from 31% in May and June.\n\nA Harris campaign official said the campaign expects the race to remain close in the run-up to November.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump has falsely accused Harris of previously downplaying her Black heritage. He drew jeers from a convention of Black journalists when he said she only promoted her Indian heritage in the past. Harris, who is of Indian and Jamaican heritage, has long identified as both Black and Asian.\n\nReuters combined multiple polls to examine trends among smaller racial and ethnic groups. Margins of error for the poll results varied between about 2 and 6 percentage points.\n\n(Reporting by Jason Lange and Trevor Hunnicutt in Washington; editing by Andy Sullivan, Kat Stafford and Deepa

Please try again later.\n\nIf Donald Trump is too rattled and off-balance to debate Vice President Harris, so be it. Let him bark all he wants. The caravan moves on.\n\nTrump's decision to back out of the scheduled Sept. 10 debate is not really surprising, given how perplexed he is about how to run against Harris. And I would bet that it is also not final. If the next five weeks are even remotely like the last two, Trump may conclude that he needs a televised faceoff more than she does.\n\nAnd no, the fact that Trump would be up against Harris instead of President Biden does not somehow nullify the existing debate agreement. The terms of the encounter -- which is, or was, set to be held on ABC -- do not name the participants. Instead, the agreement specifies the minimum levels of polling support and state ballot access required for eligibility.\n\nHarris is right to ignore Trump's unserious counter-offer of an alternative debate on Fox News, his comfort zone, in front of a \"full arena audience\" he can pack with boisterous supporters. It's understandable why he would prefer a contest of decibels rather than ideas, but that's not what he negotiated. Harris says she'll be at the originally appointed time and place. Trump can show up if he wants to, or he can give Harris a ton of free time on network television, all to herself. His choice.\n\nFollow this authorEugene Robinson's opinions\n\nFollow\n\nMeanwhile, Harris is on a roll. David Axelrod, former president Barack Obama's longtime political guru, warned his party Saturday against \"irrational exuberance,\" and of course he's right. But a measure of perfectly rational optimism, and even a bit of giddiness, is surely in order for Democrats.\n\nA month ago, in the wake of the Biden-Trump debate, polls showed the Democratic Party's prospects in free fall. Trump was opening a clear lead in the presidential race, with his longtime pollster boasting that Trump had so many pathways to the necessary 270 electoral votes that \"we literally stopped counting at 25.\" The hill Democrats needed to climb if they were to hold the Senate and win the House looked dauntingly steep.\n\nToday, it's a changed landscape. Trump's lead over Biden in the RealClearPolitics polling average, which was roughly three points when the president withdrew, has all but vanished. Harris trailed Trump by less than one point in Monday's RCP average; and the latest single high-quality poll, released Sunday by CBS News, had Harris ahead by a point.\n\nAnd now it is Harris, not Trump, who threatens to expand the electoral map. Georgia, for example, which Biden won by approximately 11,000 votes in 2020, seemed out of reach for the president this time. But Harris's support among African American voters, her campaign's deep pockets and her party's lavishly staffed ground game have put the state once again up for grabs. The CBS survey showed Harris just three points behind Trump in Georgia, which is within the poll's margin of error.\n\nAt a rally in Atlanta on Saturday, Trump seemed to go out of his way to help Harris win the state. He spent at least 10 minutes of a rambling 90-minute speech attacking two of the most popular Republican officials in the state, Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, for disobeying his command to \"find\" enough votes to overturn Biden's 2020 victory. The last time Trump threw this divisive tantrum, Georgia -- hardly blue; more like reddish-purple -- elected two Democratic senators.\n\nAs for the three \"blue wall\" states that Democrats believed Biden would have to win to defeat Trump, the CBS poll found Harris tied with Trump in Pennsylvania and Michigan and trailing him by one point in Wisconsin. The poll also found margin-of-error contests in Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina. No single poll should ever be taken as gospel, but trend lines do tell you something -- and right now, they're saying that Harris has momentum.\n\nTrump's cranky, sour mood may have to do with the fact that crowds at Harris's campaign rallies have been so enthusiastic and so big. Crowd size matters to him. A lot.\n\nHe and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), haven't yet come close to finding an effective way to attack Harris. Plan A, laughably, was claiming that a woman whose father is Black and whose mother was South Asian has no right to identify as Black. Plan B is yet to emerge.\n\nTrump's demand to unilaterally change the debate rules and format is nothing more than a weak attempt to reclaim the initiative. Axelrod said on CNN that this remains \"Trump's race to lose,\" and that is how Democrats should approach the campaign. Now, however, it is also Harris's race to win.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eugene_robinson@washingtonpost.com",

Since then, Harris has seen waves of enthusiasm and support for her White House bid, especially among young voters, who were previously thought to be disillusioned.\n\nThe momentum for Harris has also seen the vice president overtake Trump in the polls. According to FiveThirtyEight's live average polling tracker, Harris is 2 points ahead of Trump as of August 5 -- with 45.5 percent of the vote to Trump's 43.5 percent.\n\nThe Polling USA social media account, which aggregates national surveys, is also giving Harris an average 2-point lead over Trump in the polls, and RealClearPolitics shows Trump in second place for the first time all year.\n\nWhile Harris appears to be the leading candidate heading into November and Trump seems to be struggling to regain momentum, Sean Freeder, an assistant professor of political science at the University of North Florida, suggested it is still \"far too early\" to make any assumptions about the current polling.\n\nFreeder added that while the Trump campaign may be \"very worried\" about the polling shift in recent days, Harris' 2-point lead is \"far from insurmountable.\" He said there could be some major unexpected event that sees Trump's numbers improve.\n\n\"We can prove this to ourselves simply by looking backward to a four-week period in which a poor debate performance caused [Biden] to eventually abandon his campaign and the other presidential candidate was nearly assassinated,\" Freeder told Newsweek.\n\n\"We wouldn't have predicted these events in early June, and we therefore can't predict the next 90 days now,\" he continued. \"That said, Trump had an unusually weak opponent in Biden, given his own party's internal dissatisfaction, and it seems unlikely to me that Trump will again enjoy the kind of sustained positive polling he got pre-Harris.\"\n\nOver the next three months, a number of events that could prove decisive in the race are expected to unfold. These include Harris' choice of running mate, Trump's September sentencing in his falsifying business records case, and a potential debate between the two leading candidates.\n\nCarl Cavalli, a professor of political science at the University of North Georgia, said that any update between now and November could prove significant, as this is the period when large numbers of voters begin to truly focus on the election.\n\n\"As we've already witnessed, debates can be decisive. If Trump and Harris agree to engage in one, or if their vice presidential candidates do so, it could go a long way toward helping one side break out from what has been a very close race to date,\" Cavalli told Newsweek.\n\n\"Most Americans don't pay much attention to the race through the summer. As we hit Labor Day, a time after the conventions and when debates usually occur, more people will likely engage. And this year, that engagement will be a very different dynamic than we've seen so far,\" he continued.\n\nAn event occurring late in the campaign that can influence the outcome of an upcoming November election is so well established it already has a name: an \"October surprise.\"\n\nWhile Trump and his campaign are seemingly struggling to make their attack lines on Harris stick -- such as suggesting the vice president, whose mother is Indian and father is Jamaican, \"happened to turn Black\" in recent years for political gain -- Freeder said that a well-timed attack against Harris in mid-October could \"weaken\" her campaign.\n\nFreeder cited an October surprise that occurred during the 2016 election, when then-FBI Director James Comey reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server 11 days before that year's election against Trump. Freeder said this \"arguably cost\" Clinton the race.\n\nHe added, \"This is a race that either side could end up winning, but Trump's campaign now has to acknowledge they'll likely be running once more with the wind blowing against their sails instead of with them.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ewan_palmer@newsweek.com", "name": "Ewan Palmer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FiveThirtyEight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FiveThirtyEight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of North Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealClearPolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RealClearPolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Georgia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of North Georgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_surprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "October surprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Comey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Comey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labor Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Native Americans in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2443573/donald-trump-georgia.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=43c193df336d50a809dd3ca785385e02", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792426", "eventUri": "eng-9792426", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 428, "textEnd": 435}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 441, "textEnd": 448}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 927, "textEnd": 935}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Tropical Storm Debby has forced the postponement of a stop in another swing state, Georgia, and according to media reports also North Carolina.\n\nPennsylvania is part of the \"blue wall\" that carried Biden to the White House in 2020, alongside Michigan and Wisconsin. That was one of the main reasons many expected Harris to instead pick that state's governor, Josh Shapiro.\n\nAlso on the vice presidential shortlist had been former astronaut and current senator Mark Kelly, of Arizona, and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.\n\nTrump was riding high politically last month after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally, and then using the Republican convention to highlight his image of vigor against the physically frail Biden.\n\nBut with Biden's dramatic exit and Harris's fast start, he is scrambling to recalibrate.\n\nAt a rally last Saturday in Georgia, Trump called Harris a \"Marxist\" and a \"radical left freak,\" claiming she would cause an \"economic crash.\"\n\nThree days earlier, he shocked many when he told an audience of Black journalists that Harris had \"turned Black\" out of political expediency.\n\nWhere Biden often attacked Trump as a threat to democracy, given his unprecedented refusal to accept his loss in 2020, Harris's team has honed a sharper -- more meme-friendly -- line built around branding Trump and his vice presidential pick J.D. Vance \"weird.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the Harris campaign said Trump was \"scared\" to debate her after he turned down a previously scheduled televised debate on ABC, while saying he'd be ready to debate her on Fox News -- a network that has for years given him support.", "source": {"uri": "withinnigeria.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Within Nigeria"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The progressive governor with a history of winning over Republicans\n\nBut Tatishe Nteta, provost professor of political science at UMass Amherst and director of its poll, pointed to a key finding: a seven-point swing to the Democrat since January, when Trump led Joe Biden by four.\n\n\"For weeks after the first presidential debate in June,\" Nteta said, \"Democratic donors, prominent Democratic elected officials and members of the news media made the case that President Joe Biden faced long odds to defeat former President Donald Trump and called for Biden to step down.\n\n\"In the aftermath of Biden's historic decision to forgo his re-election campaign, it seems as if Biden's critics were indeed correct as his replacement, Vice-President Kamala Harris, has emerged as the frontrunner in the race for the White House.\n\n\"While there are still three months to go, the Harris campaign and the Democratic party must like their chances to maintain control of the White House and to send former President Trump to his second consecutive defeat in his quest to return to Pennsylvania Avenue.\"\n\nThere was also good news for Harris from The Hill, as the site's \"ultimate hub for polls, predictions and election results\" showed the Democrat with a positive favourabilty rating for the first time, after a steep climb since mid-July, when Biden stepped down.\n\nAs to be expected, August polls in the seven battleground states where the election is expected to be decided presented a more mixed picture.\n\nIn polls concluding in August, Public Policy Polling, a Democratic firm, found Harris up one in Georgia but down two on Trump in Arizona and down one in Pennsylvania. Trafalgar/Insider Advantage, a right-leaning operation, put Trump up two in Georgia.\n\nAccording to battleground averages maintained by the polling site FiveThirtyEight, Trump led Harris by four points in Georgia and two points in Arizona, with Harris up by two points Michigan, one in Pennsylvania and one and a half in Wisconsin.\n\nNorth Carolina polls collected by FiveThirtyEight but not averaged showed Trump up but with a shrinking lead, down from nine points in mid-July to two points in early August.\n\nThere was also good news for Harris in a solidly Democratic state, New York, where Trump showed signs of progress while Biden led the blue ticket. With Harris in place, Siena College found her up 14 points, 53%-39%.\n\nOn Monday, Nate Silver, founder of FiveThirtyEight and an influential voice among polling analysts, said Harris \"now has a real lead in national polls - about two points - and has also been ahead in most recent polls of\" Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\"\n\nConcerns about economic conditions should not be counted out, Silver said, on a day of Wall Street sell-offs and reports of recession fears. \"But the momentum in the polls outweighs it for now.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

When voters were asked who they would vote for in a head-to-head matchup between the Republican and Democratic candidates, both garnered 48 percent of the vote. Just 4 percent said that they were undecided.\n\nPennsylvania carries 19 Electoral College votes, making it a particularly important state as Trump and Harris compete to see who can earn 270 votes, the minimum needed to win the presidency.\n\nThe two major candidates were still tied when likely voters in Pennsylvania were given the option to offer their support to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or candidates from other parties. Trump and Harris both garnered 45 percent when voters were given a full ballot, while RFK Jr. received 4 percent of the vote and \"other\" garnered 2 percent.\n\nTrump does, however, hold a significant advantage when likely voters were asked if they approved of the performance of both of the candidates in office. While 51 percent said that they approved of Trump's performance as president, just 43 percent said that they approve of the job Harris has done as vice president. Only 41 percent said that they approve of President Joe Biden's performance in office.\n\nThe poll also asked likely voters about various messages about Harris in order to gauge their ability to persuade voters, finding that messaging on the economy, immigration, and crime could be the most effective.\n\n\"If you knew that each of the following were TRUE about Kamala Harris, please tell me whether it would make you MORE likely or LESS likely to vote for her for President,\" the poll asked respondents before listing off the different messages about the presumptive Democratic nominee.\n\nThe highest share of \"persuadable voters\" said their decision would be impacted when told \"Kamala Harris has called for raising trillions of dollars in new taxes through higher income taxes and payroll taxes\" and \"as D.A., Kamala Harris granted probation to a dangerous illegal immigrant felon who upon release went on to kill a father and his two sons.\"\n\nWhen presented with the information, 68 percent and 67 percent of persuadable voters said that their decision as to who they would vote for would be impacted, respectively.\n\nAnother 63 percent of persuadable voters said that their decision would be impacted when told that Harris supported policies that \"led to the record high inflation and rising prices that we have now for groceries, housing and gas prices,\" while 61 percent said that their vote would be impacted when it was explained to them that \"Kamala Harris supports abolishing ICE, the agency that arrests and deports rapists and murders.\"\n\nThe poll comes after Harris suddenly replaced Biden as the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee, seemingly in response to widespread concern about Biden's health.

JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate.\n\nLess than a week later, President Joe Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed Harris. She became the Democratic nominee on Aug. 5 without winning a single primary election, something that hasn't happened since 1968.\n\n\"[It's] like a giant jigsaw puzzle, with the pieces changing practically every day, or at least a couple times a week,\" Susan MacManus, a political scientist from Florida, told The Epoch Times.\n\nKen Kollman, a political science professor at the University of Michigan, made a similar comment.\n\n\"Things have gotten really scrambled,\" Kollman told The Epoch Times.\n\nDespite these unusual circumstances, the old rules of politics still apply, according to political experts. The winner will likely be the candidate who can do three things well: maintain their core constituents, present an issues-based appeal to independent voters, and turn out the vote on Election Day.\n\nHere's the status of the race to date, and what each side is doing to gain an advantage.\n\nPolling shows that the race is essentially tied at this point. Harris and Trump are each polling within the margin of error in national polls.\n\nAn Aug. 5 polling average compiled by FiveThirtyEight has the vice president up 1.7 percent nationally. A TIPP Insights poll, also released Aug. 5, shows Harris up 1 point.\n\nThe candidates are running close to each other in most of the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada, and North Carolina, which could determine the Electoral College vote.\n\nRecent polls have shown Harris with a slight lead in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and Trump leading in Arizona, Nevada, and North Carolina. Other polling shows a dead heat in Michigan and Georgia.\n\nHarris' entry into the race significantly changed the picture, as Trump had been leading Biden by several percentage points. However, the bump in polling could be a honeymoon effect based on her entry into the race, according to TIPP Insights.\n\nAnalysts agree that the race is still very much up for grabs. To negate Harris' momentum, Trump will have to settle on new messaging, experts told The Epoch Times.\n\nThe Trump campaign appears to be searching for new messaging now that Biden has left the race, according to Aaron Dusso, a professor of political science at Indiana University, Indianapolis.\n\n\"I think they were surprised, like most of us, that Biden chose to step aside,\" Dusso said. \"They weren't really prepared for that.\"\n\nTo regain traction, experts say the Trump campaign must move beyond personal attacks and general promises to mount an issues-based campaign.\n\nPersonality-based campaigning will benefit neither side, according to MacManus, adding that both candidates would be wise to address \"how they are going to solve a problem, and how their opponent is not.\"\n\nAmerican political history professor Jeff Bloodworth said the Trump campaign should focus on this question: \"Are you -- or the world -- better off\" under the Biden-Harris administration than you were during the Trump administration?\n\n\"That was the subtext of the Trump-Biden campaign. That should be the text of the Trump-Harris contest,\" said Bloodworth, who teaches at Gannon University in Erie, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"It's the economy,\" said Edwin Benton, a political science professor at the University of South Florida. \"Always, what's on the mind of the public is their pocketbook, economic issues.\"\n\nThere is evidence that the Trump campaign is shifting its message in that direction. A political action committee supporting the campaign has aired a series of ads tying Harris to high grocery prices, rising crime rates, and the surge of illegal immigrants.\n\nHarris has gained momentum in part because she is new to the race. Multiple experts said her greatest advantage may be her youth. At age 59, she entered a race in which age had been a significant handicap for her predecessor. She now appears as the fresh face running against Trump, who is 78.\n\nIn campaign speeches, Harris has presented herself as the candidate for a new generation.\n\n\"This campaign is about two very different visions for our nation: one focused on the future, the other focused on the past,\" she told rallygoers in Atlanta on July 30.\n\nThe obvious line of attack for the Trump campaign is to identify Harris with her predecessor, experts said.\n\n\"Her biggest liability is her link to the Biden administration, a pretty unpopular president,\" Kollman said.\n\n\"[Biden's] weaknesses are her weaknesses,\" Dusso said. \"Continue to tie those together.\"\n\nIn an email to The Epoch Times, Karoline Leavitt, national press secretary for the Trump campaign, said Harris must defend her support for the Biden record, including inflation, immigration, and foreign wars.\n\nThe Epoch Times requested comments from the Harris campaign but did not receive a reply by the time of publication.\n\nBoth candidates have issues they can win with, and both would do well to present their core issues in a problem-solution formula, pundits said.\n\nHarris' strongest issue is abortion access, which has become a winner for Democrats following the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"That, I think, has really been a major change in American politics,\" Kollman said. He noted that abortion access is now the single most important for Democrats -- and many Republicans -- in the way the pro-life cause was for decades.\n\nTrump holds a number of strong cards, experts said. Immigration continues to be a winning issue for Republicans, despite Harris' attempt to nullify it by pointing out that Trump opposed a bipartisan border security bill earlier this year, which went on to fail in the Senate twice.\n\nInternational affairs remain a strong point for Republicans also. According to Benton, the Biden administration's position on Ukraine and Israel has been confusing. On the one hand, the administration has advocated military aid to Ukraine and Israel. But it has attempted to moderate the effect by prescribing how the weapons should be used.\n\n\"Joe Biden and Harris tried to play at both ends, and you can't do that,\" Benton said.\n\nThe winning formula in politics remains the same, according to Dusso: \"Point to a problem, and say, 'I have a solution.'\"\n\nBoth campaigns have mounted efforts to rally voters in swing states. The Harris campaign has stated that it now has a network of staffed field offices in most swing states, and more than 500,000 volunteers focused on mobilizing voters, according to the campaign's battleground director, Dan Kanninen.\n\nThe Trump campaign's battleground initiative, Trump Force 47, has engaged tens of thousands of volunteers, Leavitt told The Epoch Times by email.\n\n\"We have paid staffers and volunteer-powered field programs in every battleground state, and they are expanding daily,\" she said.\n\nBoth campaigns have impressive fundraising totals. As of May 24, the Harris campaign had about $96 million on hand. The Trump campaign had a balance of $128 million.\n\nThe Harris campaign said it has raised $310 million in July. The Trump campaign reported $137 million raised in July.\n\nIn the end, the race may come down to which candidate can rally his or her core voters on Election Day. For Harris, that means rallying younger people, who are historically the least likely to vote.\n\nFor Trump, that means turning out rural voters, especially men, who are also infrequent voters, according to Kollman.\n\nLatino voters have been a historic demographic for Democrats but have been trending toward the Republican Party. Experts had mixed opinions on whether the Latino vote would shift decisively toward Trump or move back toward the Democrats.\n\nTrump has also made inroads among black voters, but the experts are uncertain whether that will produce enough movement, especially in swing states, to affect the election.\n\nBiden won a number of votes from disgruntled Republicans in the last election, according to Kollman. Harris has launched a campaign to round up those voters, but it's uncertain whether she'll inherit those who defected for Biden in 2020.\n\nDespite the relatively brief window remaining in this campaign, it will take time for the dust to settle after Harris' entry into the race.\n\n\"Everything's brand new,\" Dusso said, adding that it will take a couple of weeks to figure out where the polling will land after voters get used to Harris as a candidate.\n\nThe candidates now have less than three months to settle on the best issues and messaging to present to the voters.

There could be more war in the Middle East, further undercutting President Joe Biden's promise to restore normalcy after a turbulent Trump term. A recent Wall Street Journal poll found that 51% approve of Trump's time in the White House in retrospect. There are also new questions about what the border problems of most of the last four years mean for the risk of terrorism.\n\nThere are two ways to look at the race. One is that after weeks of euphoric coverage and renewed Democratic energy, Harris has effectively settled into a tie before Trump is done defining her for battleground state voters. The other is that Harris has managed to do in a little over two weeks what Biden was unable to do in months and the honeymoon could last long enough to see her through the election.\n\nOne Republican pollster told the Washington Examiner that it is actually good for the party to lose \"the false sense of a landslide,\" which is the word the Atlantic used to describe the kind of win Trump and his campaign believed they could secure against Biden before he dropped out.\n\n\"This is waking Republicans up,\" the pollster said. \"It's not going to be a cakewalk. We have to work for it.\"\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) complained of Republican \"overconfidence\" and the \"air of celebration\" at the GOP convention in Milwaukee, held before Democrats switched from Biden to Harris.\n\nBiden was unable to sustain any positive momentum in his abortive reelection campaign. Democrats were worried about whether he or his team were up to the challenge of beating Trump before the June 27 debate. That disastrous encounter removed all doubt for many Democratic insiders, sparking an unprecedented revolt against the sitting president and presumptive nominee.\n\nEnter Harris, an unpopular vice president whose first presidential campaign imploded in 2019. She has found herself having to jettison much of the platform she ran on during that bid, though unlike her initial pronouncements, the reversals have largely not come in her own voice.\n\nHarris's entrance has nevertheless been good enough to make the race more competitive than it has seemed in months. Harris is a better communicator than the 81-year-old Biden. Because there are no questions about her age and mental acuity, Harris can stick to tightly scripted events without incurring political damage. And this campaign will be shorter than normal.\n\nThe Trump campaign has been surprisingly slow to find its footing against Harris, even though Biden was left teetering on the edge for nearly a month and she was the most obvious, and most favorable, replacement. Republicans could have in theory faced a pair of Rust Belt governors instead. But all that could change soon.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nEven many Democratic operatives think this could just be \"irrational exuberance.\" Democrats lost hope in a close race in which Trump was slightly but consistently favored. Some progressive, black, and younger Democrats have come home, and nearly all of them are feeling better about their electoral prospects than when Biden was the candidate.\n\nWhether \"brat summer\" is as good as it gets or is the beginning of Harris permanently resetting the race remains to be seen. Harris may be peaking too soon, but for Democrats, that still beats hitting rock bottom in late June.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"},

A majority (51%) now see Donald Trump as too old to be president, and more than a third of voters doubt he would be able to serve a full four-year term.\n\nMorning Consult, in a new poll released Monday, offers additional good news for Vice President Harris, saying she has \"widened the trust advantage that Biden held on handling issues such as abortion (her biggest lead), climate change, education, health care and protecting American democracy, while Trump's advantage over Harris on gun policy, crime, the economy and foreign policy are smaller than they were for Biden.\"\n\n\"Not surprisingly, Harris' replacement of Biden has now erased the Democratic Party's age problem with the American electorate.

Instead, they center on perceptions of how Trump will behave -- similar to swing-state voters' worry that Trump is 'dangerous.'\"\n\nThe poll also shows that now only a slim 52% majority say Donald Trump is in good health, a six-point drop from before President Biden ended his campaign.\n\nGoing from a majority to a minority position, now just 48% say Trump is mentally fit, a drop of five points from 53%.\n\nBy comparison, 71% say Vice President Harris is in good health, 64% say she is mentally fit, and just 12% say she is too old.\n\nIn other categories Trump also lost ground.\n\nFor \"strong leader,\" Trump lost two points, now clocking in at 52%.\n\nAnd now 57% say Trump is \"reckless,\" up one point.\n\nREAD MORE: Can Kamala Harris Win Florida?

Tropical Storm Debby has forced the postponement of a stop in another swing state, Georgia, and according to media reports also North Carolina.\n\nPennsylvania is part of the \"blue wall\" that carried Biden to the White House in 2020, alongside Michigan and Wisconsin. That was one of the main reasons many expected Harris to instead pick that state's governor, Josh Shapiro.\n\nAlso on the vice presidential shortlist had been former astronaut and current senator Mark Kelly, of Arizona, and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.\n\nTrump was riding high politically last month after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally, and then using the Republican convention to highlight his image of vigor against the physically frail Biden.\n\nBut with Biden's dramatic exit and Harris's fast start, he is scrambling to recalibrate.\n\nAt a rally last Saturday in Georgia, Trump called Harris a \"Marxist\" and a \"radical left freak,\" claiming she would cause an \"economic crash.\"\n\nThree days earlier, he shocked many when he told an audience of Black journalists that Harris had \"turned Black\" out of political expediency.\n\nWhere Biden often attacked Trump as a threat to democracy, given his unprecedented refusal to accept his loss in 2020, Harris's team has honed a sharper -- more meme-friendly -- line built around branding Trump and his vice presidential pick J.D. Vance \"weird.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the Harris campaign said Trump was \"scared\" to debate her after he turned down a previously scheduled televised debate on ABC, while saying he'd be ready to debate her on Fox News -- a network that has for years given him support.", "source": {"uri": "nigerianeye.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nigerianeye"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Massachusetts Amherst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Beshear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Kentucky", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Kentucky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

The bulk of polls conducted since President Joe Biden pulled out of the election now show the vice president with a modest lead over Trump nationally and neck-and-neck in key battleground states.\n\nThe impending announcement of a running mate for Harris could inspire a new round of polling gains for the Democratic ticket, while the Democratic National Convention -- set to take place in Chicago from August 19 to August 22 -- may result in a further bump just weeks before early voting begins in some states.\n\n\"Presidential candidates typically enjoy a bounce after their convention, so Trump might be able to claw back some support after that headliner event,\" University of Kentucky political science professor D. Stephen Voss told Newsweek. \"But the excitement that Harris generated in late July and early August could be tougher to dampen.\"\n\n\"Generic negative advertising might not be able to do much,\" Voss added. \"The GOP will need strong opposition research.\"\n\nDan Lamb, senior lecturer at Brooks School of Public Policy at Cornell University, said in comments to Newsweek that Harris is \"winning the race to frame herself as a forward looking, energetic, former prosecutor,\" while \"Trump is struggling to settle on an effective line of attack.\"\n\n\"Harris's unerring performance in the last two weeks is inspiring a coalition of groups to believe that winning is possible,\" Lamb said. \"This self-reenforcing bandwagon effect can overcome ideological differences within an underdog's campaign. Barring a disruptive event, misstep, or revelation, I expect Harris's poll numbers to continue climbing.\"\n\nRegardless, with 90 days still to go until Election Day, others have warned that the Harris campaign could struggle to win over crucial swing voters if she is seen as too liberal, possibly erasing momentum that has been fueled by Democratic-base enthusiasm.\n\n\"Whether it lasts depends on two things -- on the Harris side, whether she can avoid sounding significantly more left than Biden,\" Syracuse University political science professor Grant Davis Reeher told Newsweek. \"I don't think the country has the appetite right now for a lot of new social programs, for more movement to the left culturally, and for significant new public spending.\"\n\n\"On the Trump side, it's the same question as always -- whether he can avoid alienating groups of voters that were beginning to take another look at him,\" he continued. \"And more to the point, whether he can avoid mobilizing them to turn out against him.\"\n\nReeher went on to suggest that the vice president's political future could also \"depend on the stock market remaining stable,\" pointing out that the global market has been spiraling downward in recent days following a worse-than-expected U.S. jobs report on Friday.\n\nEndorsements for Harris by pop-culture figures like Megan Thee Stallion, nearly every major Democratic politician and some politicians from outside her party -- such as former Republican Georgia Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan -- may be of limited value in persuading swing voters who are open to voting for Trump.\n\nHowever, her campaign remaining in the media spotlight and potentially awakening voters who might not otherwise participate in politics could be a much harder factor for Trump to overcome.\n\nWilliam Reno, professor and chair of the political science department at Northwestern University, argued that Harris may have a lasting advantage over Trump because she appeals to \"ordinary people who are otherwise inattentive to politics because they were so disgusted with what was on offer in both parties.\"\n\n\"Harris puts Trump on the defensive and runs the story now,\" Reno told Newsweek. \"My guess is she will continue an upward trend in the polls ... She won't convince Trump supporters but she can mobilize a portion of Americans that opted out when it seemed that the choice was an old weirdo heavily into makeup vs. a broken down old man.\"\n\nBeyond improvements in polling, momentum for Harris is evident in her campaign achieving a record-breaking fundraising haul in short order. The Harris campaign raised over $310 million in July, more than doubling the $138.7 million that the Trump campaign raised during the month.\n\nAn estimated 2 million individual first-time donors gave to Harris in July. The Trump campaign has not released information on the number of first-time donors contributing to the former president in July.\n\nHeading into August, the Harris campaign had a total of $377 million in cash on hand, which may include some funds left over from the now defunct Biden-Harris campaign. The Trump campaign had $327 million.\n\n\"The tremendous outpouring of support we've seen in just a short time makes clear the Harris coalition is mobilized, growing, and ready to put in the work to defeat Trump this November,\" Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aila_slisco@newsweek.com", "name": "Aila Slisco", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_campaigning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Negative campaigning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_vote", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing vote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Kentucky", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Kentucky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opposition research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornell University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Early voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

In an internal memo that the Trump-Vance campaign made public, Mr. Saler writes:\n\nThe latest CBS/YouGov poll of registered voters nationwide showing margin-of-error shifts in the national head-to-head ballot between President Trump and Kamala Harris is entirely the result of a methodological decision allowing ideology to change significantly, while maintaining weights on age, partisanship and race to make the survey appear not to have been manipulated. Without this manipulation, President Trump would be maintaining a 51-49 lead in their Aug. 4 survey.\n\nThere's a lot of interesting and potentially controversial stuff going on with this poll and how it estimates the results in the battleground states, but for today, let's unpack Mr. Saler's particular complaint. His contention is that the only reason the poll shows Ms. Harris doing so well is a \"methodological decision\" about what factors to hold steady and what factors to allow to shift from poll to poll, with the implication that there were choices made intentionally that \"manipulated\" the results. (A Trump campaign senior adviser, Brian Hughes, went further, calling it a \"national gaslighting campaign.\")\n\nWhenever we pollsters conduct a survey, we know that the sample of people we talk to may not exactly match up demographically with the broader population. As a result, we adjust our data to align with known benchmarks, a process known as weighting. The New York Times/Siena College poll, for instance, weights its results along a dozen dimensions, and that's just for understanding registered voters, to say nothing of the additional modeling that goes into the poll's results among the likely electorate.\n\nWeighting a survey by factors like age and race is quite standard and is a basic matter of good research practice. Weighting a political survey by party identification is also fairly common these days, though not without controversy and complication; while my age will always be a fact rooted in the year of my birth, I may wake up tomorrow and decide I am no longer a member of the political party with which I identified yesterday. Pollsters have robust and friendly debates over the best ways to keep a poll from over- or under-sampling people of a certain party. (And yes, when it comes to sampling, pollsters sometimes get it wrong.)\n\nIdeology (as opposed to party identification) is not a factor most pollsters hold to be constant. While I as a pollster can have good benchmarks for how old or how male or how Democratic an electorate is likely to be, ideology is an attitude that is arguably more fluid than even partisanship. The Trump campaign may very well be using ideology as a weight in its internal polling, as is its prerogative, but CBS News/YouGov isn't some strange outlier trying to \"manipulate\" its results by not holding ideology steady.\n\nIf a major change in the race (such as the rollout of a whole new major-party presumptive nominee) suddenly means that more progressive voters become fired up and engaged in the process, it would not be unusual to see a slightly higher number of liberals and progressives as likely voters.\n\nPollsters have an interesting challenge on their hands with the switch-up at the top of the Democratic ticket. It is entirely possible that some voters who had washed their hands of the entire process when faced with the choice between Mr. Trump and President Biden (and Robert Kennedy Jr.) are giving the race a second look now that Vice President Harris is the presumptive nominee. As an industry, we will have to be thoughtful about how we decide what a likely voter is and isn't in this new world.\n\nMr. Saler may be right that the poll shows a better result for Ms. Harris because it includes more liberals. But it's very likely that this is just a reflection of a political moment in time in which the electorate has shifted to be a little bit more liberal, and that at least in the short term, this is the reality the Trump campaign has to grapple with.\n\nFor what it's worth, the CBS News poll isn't exactly an outlier at this point. For instance, the notable G.O.P. polling firm Fabrizio, Lee and Associates -- home of the Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio -- put out polling Monday showing essentially the same result in the key state of Pennsylvania as the CBS News estimate: a tied race.\n\nOdds and Ends\n\nJD Vance and \"childless cat ladies\": Senator Vance's infamous phrasing may have turned out to be a messaging misstep, but the Pew Research Center finds a rising number of people below age 50 who say they're unlikely to have children, a figure that increased by 10 points between 2018 and 2023, to 47 percent. Among those who say they're unlikely, \"women younger than 50 are especially likely to say they just don't want to have children (64 percent vs. 50 percent of men in this group).\" Interestingly, in a separate poll from last year, Pew found that pet owners who aren't parents are more likely (55 percent) than pet owners who are parents (42 percent) to view a pet as being just as much a member of their family \"as a human member.\" At any rate, this essay by The Atlantic's Christine Emba beautifully examines the decline in desire for parenthood. I highly recommend it.\n\nWrestling with the numbers: With Hulk Hogan making waves last month at the Republican National Convention, I tried to catch a bit of SummerSlam this weekend and tuned in just long enough to see the famous YouTuber-turned-professional wrestler Logan Paul lose his match against LA Knight. As is my habit, I went to see what polling was out there on the intersection of wrestling and politics. While I didn't find much recent polling, I did think that this Gallup survey from 25 years ago was fascinating, including this finding: \"Not surprisingly, wrestling fans tend to be young males with high school educations who earn less than $30,000 annually -- and their political ideology tends to lean Democratic.\"\n\nThat may not have been surprising in 1999, but the last part of that statement would certainly be surprising in 2024, with Mr. Trump making frequent overt appeals to wrestling fans. The survey is also a reminder of how long we've had a wrestling-to-politics pipeline; that year, Jesse \"the Body\" Ventura was a guest referee at SummerSlam while he was also the sitting governor of Minnesota. (According to that Gallup poll, 47 percent of Americans found Mr. Ventura's participation to be \"appropriate.\")\n\nKristen Soltis Anderson is a contributing Opinion writer for The New York Times.

Tim Walz (D-MN). Her campaign will then embark on a campaign tour across five more key battleground states.\n\nIn the meantime, her opponent, former President Donald Trump, is only visiting one state, Montana, at the end of the week. Montana has safely voted for a Republican for president for decades, but it has a competitive Senate race this year between incumbent Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT) and challenger Tim Sheehy. The Harris campaign took little time to point out the candidate's differences in schedules.\n\nHarris was set to go to Savannah, Georgia, as well this week, but the event has been postponed due to Hurricane Debby. Here is Harris's schedule this week:\n\nPhiladelphia\n\nHarris is starting her campaign tour in Philadelphia, and she is set to campaign alongside her vice presidential pick, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN).\n\nPennsylvania is a key battleground state with the most electoral votes, 19, of all the swing states. It's seen as a must-win for either Trump or Harris. In 2016, Trump flipped the state red for the first time since 1988, while in 2020, Biden flipped the state blue once again by more than 80,000 votes.\n\nDetroit\n\nIn her first stop during this tour in the Midwest, Harris will visit Michigan on Wednesday. Michigan could be one of the trickier states for Harris to nab as more than 100,000 voted \"uncommitted\" over voting for Biden in the primary due to their dissatisfaction with his handling of Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nMichigan is currently a toss-up. In 2016, Trump narrowly flipped the state by a little more than 10,000 votes, but Biden safely won the state in 2020 by more than 150,000 votes.\n\nEau Claire, Wisconsin\n\nHarris is not making the mistake of former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and ignoring the state of Wisconsin while on the campaign trail. She began her campaign there two weeks ago in the Milwaukee suburb of West Allis, Wisconsin, and now she is headed to the more rural northwest portion of the state on Wednesday.\n\nWisconsin has a near-even split between voters registered as Democrats and Republicans. In 2020, Biden flipped the state blue by only 20,000 votes. In 2016, Trump flipped the state red by a little more than 27,000 votes.\n\nThe presidential race is expected to be close in Wisconsin yet again this year.\n\nBon Iver, a folk band from Eau Claire, will perform at the event.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nDurham, North Carolina\n\nWhile a Democratic president has not won North Carolina since former President Barack Obama's historic win there in 2008, Democrats have had their eye on the Tar Heel State. On Thursday, she will visit the state for the eighth time this year.\n\nAs her campaign tries to court the Generation Z vote, Harris's visit to Durham, which is in the Research Triangle (consisting of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Duke University, and North Carolina State University), highlights that effort.\n\nHarris has seemingly closed some of the polling gap from before Biden suspended his reelection bid. Trump previously led in North Carolina, 47.2% to Biden's 41.5%, according to a RealClearPolitics poll. A recent Bloomberg-Morning Consult poll, however, showed Trump leading Harris in the state, 48%-46%.\n\nPhoenix\n\nHarris is set to visit Phoenix on Friday.\n\nHarris and Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), who is running for Senate, both have the endorsements of many centrist Republicans and independents across the state of Arizona. As Harris visits Phoenix, she is endorsed by John Giles, the Republican mayor of Mesa, a Phoenix suburb that is Arizona's third-largest city.\n\nDuring the 2016 election, Maricopa County was the most populous county that voted for Trump, but it flipped blue for Biden in 2020. It is the population center of the state, with more than 60% of Arizonans living in Maricopa County.\n\nWhile the state was once a solidly Republican-leaning state, it has moved to the left in recent years with a notable blue wave during the 2022 election, which gave Arizona a Democratic governor, attorney general, and secretary of state as well as Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ).\n\nThe GOP once strongly held both of Arizona's Senate seats for years, but the party has not won a Senate race there since 2018. Biden won the state in 2020, which was the first time Arizona voters sent a Democrat to the White House since former President Bill Clinton in 1996.\n\nLas Vegas\n\nHarris will visit Las Vegas on Saturday to conclude her campaign tour. Trump is now tied with Harris in Nevada, 43%-43%, according to a recent Bloomberg-Morning Consult poll, and Harris appears to have a new enthusiasm in the state that Biden was not able to capture.\n\nNevada has consistently voted for Democratic presidential candidates in the last four elections.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nMore than 3,000 Nevada residents have signed up to volunteer for the Harris campaign, according to the Washington Post, and after Biden exited the race, Nevada's secretary of state reported an uptick in voter registration in the state, with 6,000 new Nevadans registering to vote in July.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"},

We have been very clear that Israel and the Israeli people and Palestinians are entitled to an equal amount of security and dignity.\"\n\nVP SHORT-LISTER SHAPIRO ON DEFENSE OVER ISRAEL AFTER DECADES-OLD COLLEGE PAPER SURFACES\n\nThe poll also comes just before Harris chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who was the only Jewish candidate in the running. The move prompted some to speculate that the choice was made as a result of Shapiro's lack of popularity with members of the Democratic Party, who have taken a more sympathetic approach to Palestinians since the war broke out in Gaza.\n\nNevertheless, Jewish voters have traditionally supported Democrat candidates for decades. According to an analysis by the American Enterprise Institute, Jewish voters have on average supported Democrats over Republicans by a margin of 71% to 26% since 1968.\n\nJewish voters supported Biden over Trump 68% to 30% in 2020, while in 2016 the same group chose Clinton over Trump by a margin of 71% to 26%.\n\nBut the poll wasn't all bad news for Harris, who overall solidified her lead over Trump among all likely voters in the state. Harris now leads Trump 53%-39% among likely New York voters, according to the Tuesday poll, a large improvement from the eight- to 10-point lead Biden had in previous versions of the poll.\n\nThe Siena College Research Institute poll was conducted between July 28 and Aug. 1 and surveyed 1,199 likely voters in New York, 8% of whom were Jewish; the poll has a margin of error of +/- 4.0 percentage points.\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more

In an internal memo that the Trump-Vance campaign made public, Mr. Saler writes:\n\nThe latest CBS/YouGov poll of registered voters nationwide showing margin-of-error shifts in the national head-to-head ballot between President Trump and Kamala Harris is entirely the result of a methodological decision allowing ideology to change significantly, while maintaining weights on age, partisanship and race to make the survey appear not to have been manipulated. Without this manipulation, President Trump would be maintaining a 51-49 lead in their Aug. 4 survey.\n\nThere's a lot of interesting and potentially controversial stuff going on with this poll and how it estimates the results in the battleground states, but for today, let's unpack Mr. Saler's particular complaint. His contention is that the only reason the poll shows Ms. Harris doing so well is a \"methodological decision\" about what factors to hold steady and what factors to allow to shift from poll to poll, with the implication that there were choices made intentionally that \"manipulated\" the results. (A Trump campaign senior adviser, Brian Hughes, went further, calling it a \"national gaslighting campaign.\")\n\nWhenever we pollsters conduct a survey, we know that the sample of people we talk to may not exactly match up demographically with the broader population. As a result, we adjust our data to align with known benchmarks, a process known as weighting. The New York Times/Siena College poll, for instance, weights its results along a dozen dimensions, and that's just for understanding registered voters, to say nothing of the additional modeling that goes into the poll's results among the likely electorate.\n\nWeighting a survey by factors like age and race is quite standard and is a basic matter of good research practice. Weighting a political survey by party identification is also fairly common these days, though not without controversy and complication; while my age will always be a fact rooted in the year of my birth, I may wake up tomorrow and decide I am no longer a member of the political party with which I identified yesterday. Pollsters have robust and friendly debates over the best ways to keep a poll from over- or under-sampling people of a certain party. (And yes, when it comes to sampling, pollsters sometimes get it wrong.)\n\nIdeology (as opposed to party identification) is not a factor most pollsters hold to be constant. While I as a pollster can have good benchmarks for how old or how male or how Democratic an electorate is likely to be, ideology is an attitude that is arguably more fluid than even partisanship. The Trump campaign may very well be using ideology as a weight in its internal polling, as is its prerogative, but CBS News/YouGov isn't some strange outlier trying to \"manipulate\" its results by not holding ideology steady.\n\nIf a major change in the race (such as the rollout of a whole new major-party presumptive nominee) suddenly means that more progressive voters become fired up and engaged in the process, it would not be unusual to see a slightly higher number of liberals and progressives as likely voters.\n\nPollsters have an interesting challenge on their hands with the switch-up at the top of the Democratic ticket. It is entirely possible that some voters who had washed their hands of the entire process when faced with the choice between Mr. Trump and President Biden (and Robert Kennedy Jr.) are giving the race a second look now that Vice President Harris is the presumptive nominee. As an industry, we will have to be thoughtful about how we decide what a likely voter is and isn't in this new world.\n\nMr. Saler may be right that the poll shows a better result for Ms. Harris because it includes more liberals. But it's very likely that this is just a reflection of a political moment in time in which the electorate has shifted to be a little bit more liberal, and that at least in the short term, this is the reality the Trump campaign has to grapple with.\n\nFor what it's worth, the CBS News poll isn't exactly an outlier at this point. For instance, the notable G.O.P. polling firm Fabrizio, Lee and Associates -- home of the Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio -- put out polling Monday showing essentially the same result in the key state of Pennsylvania as the CBS News estimate: a tied race.\n\nJD Vance and \"childless cat ladies\": Senator Vance's infamous phrasing may have turned out to be a messaging misstep, but the Pew Research Center finds a rising number of people below age 50 who say they're unlikely to have children, a figure that increased by 10 points between 2018 and 2023, to 47 percent. Among those who say they're unlikely, \"women younger than 50 are especially likely to say they just don't want to have children (64 percent vs. 50 percent of men in this group).\" Interestingly, in a separate poll from last year, Pew found that pet owners who aren't parents are more likely (55 percent) than pet owners who are parents (42 percent) to view a pet as being just as much a member of their family \"as a human member.\" At any rate, this essay by The Atlantic's Christine Emba beautifully examines the decline in desire for parenthood. I highly recommend it.\n\nWrestling with the numbers: With Hulk Hogan making waves last month at the Republican National Convention, I tried to catch a bit of SummerSlam this weekend and tuned in just long enough to see the famous YouTuber-turned-professional wrestler Logan Paul lose his match against LA Knight. As is my habit, I went to see what polling was out there on the intersection of wrestling and politics. While I didn't find much recent polling, I did think that this Gallup survey from 25 years ago was fascinating, including this finding: \"Not surprisingly, wrestling fans tend to be young males with high school educations who earn less than $30,000 annually -- and their political ideology tends to lean Democratic.\"\n\nThat may not have been surprising in 1999, but the last part of that statement would certainly be surprising in 2024, with Mr. Trump making frequent overt appeals to wrestling fans. The survey is also a reminder of how long we've had a wrestling-to-politics pipeline; that year, Jesse \"the Body\" Ventura was a guest referee at SummerSlam while he was also the sitting governor of Minnesota. (According to that Gallup poll, 47 percent of Americans found Mr. Ventura's participation to be \"appropriate.\")", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "YouGov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partisan_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Partisan (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaslighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Siena College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallup,_Inc.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gallup, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SummerSlam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SummerSlam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Will it matter in November?", "body": "DETROIT, MI -- Some of the latest polling averages show Michigan living up to its reputation as a \"swing state\" in the race for the presidency.\n\nWhile Republican Donald Trump led President Joe Biden in many polls before the Democrat exited the race last month, his replacement -- Vice President Kamala Harris -- now leads in one particular agency's polling average measuring Michigan residents' opinions.\n\nRealClearPolitics, a media agency that tracks and charts multiple national and state-specific polls, published a polling average this month that showed Harris leading Trump by 2 percentage points (48.3% for Harris vs. 46.3% for Trump) in Michigan. The numbers included data from four polls, collected as late as July 28.\n\nThat 2-point lead represented a swing in the Democrats' direction compared to the previous poll RealClearPolitics published, back when Biden was still a candidate.\n\nBased on seven polls and data collected largely between the Biden debate performance and his exit from the race, RealClearPolitics published a polling average that showed Trump leading Biden by 2.1 percentage points (44% for Trump vs. 41.9% for Biden) in Michigan.\n\nJulio Borquez, an associate professor of political science at University of Michigan-Dearborn, said he would not characterize the turnaround as a \"surge\" for Harris, though.\n\n\"It's not that she's gaining momentum or she's taking over the lead; I would say, things are just returning back to where they're supposed to be,\" Borquez said. \"That's probably the safest way to put it.\"\n\nBiden was losing favor with Michigan residents -- and plenty of voters elsewhere -- following a June debate performance that rattled Democrats.\n\n\"Biden's debate disaster resulted in an erosion of support, and Harris is doing so far a pretty good job in rebuilding that lost support,\" Borquez said. \"She's rebounded with young voters, she's rebounded with African-Americans, and you see a rebound in percentages of Democrats saying they are enthusiastic and that they intend to vote.\"\n\nBorquez said polling numbers for Trump have not moved much since Harris replaced Biden on the ticket.\n\n\"This is all action on the Democratic side,\" Borquez said of the polling trends. \"It's not as if Trump was inheriting a lot of Biden support. Most people have their minds made up about Donald Trump. What we saw (before Harris became the Democratic nominee) was because we haven't seen a presidential candidate bomb on national TV like that before.\"\n\nMany of the polling trends shown in Michigan extend to voters nationwide, where Harris closed the gap in the lead Trump previously built against Biden, the RealClearPolitics data showed.\n\nIn the last national polling average RealClearPolitics published before Biden's exit, Trump led the president by 3.1 percentage points.\n\nWith Harris now at the top of the ticket, Trump's RealClearPolitics national polling averages lead dropped to .7% against his Democratic opponent.\n\nBorquez said such polling data is valuable for showing trends but should not be viewed as an indicator of how constituents will respond in voting booths. After all, many polls during the 2016 presidential election cycle -- including polling averages published by RealClearPolitics -- showed Democrat Hilary Clinton leading Trump.\n\nThen Trump went on to win the presidency.\n\n\"I'm not a big fan of using polling results to predict how people will vote, but it can tell us what's happening right now,\" Borquez said. \"It's real easy to invest more in survey results than what is actually there. Polling is a tool in a toolbox, and as long as you use that tool for what it was intended for, you're OK.\"\n\nBorquez said polling averages between now and the general election could continue to sway back and forth, influenced by news-making developments relating to each candidate.\n\nBorquez said Harris choosing a running mate -- a decision her campaign said could be announced this week -- could be the next development to move the needle in polling data.\n\n\"There's going to be some short-term buzz, and depending on who (the running mate) is, Harris' numbers may go up a little or down a little,\" Borquez said. \"But, within a few weeks, other things will happen that will probably make (the running mate pick) a wash. There's a (Democratic) convention coming up, and then there may or may not be a debate, and who knows what else will happen that could produce some kind of uptick or downtick.\"\n\nThe RealClearPolitics polling data showing Harris leading Trump in Michigan comes as the Democrat prepares for her first campaign as a presidential candidate in the state.\n\nHarris will host a rally in Detroit on Wednesday, Aug. 7. Details about the event remain in the planning stages, including the time and venue, campaign officials said.\n\nSince Biden stepped out and Harris stepped in as the Democratic candidate, she has been on the campaign trail in key battleground states. Last week, Harris visited cities including Atlanta and Houston.\n\nWhile she has yet to visit Michigan as a presidential candidate, the vice president did campaign for Biden in Kalamazoo on July 17, five days before Biden bowed out in her favor.\n\nDetroit has served as a frequent stop for presidential candidates this year.\n\nThe week before Biden dropped out, he hosted a rally inside Detroit's Renaissance High School gymnasium. It was the president's third trip to Detroit in 2024 and one of his final campaign events before exiting the race.\n\nTrump last campaigned in Detroit in June.\n\nThe Republican last visited Michigan on July 21, when he hosted a rally in Grand Rapids.", "source": {"uri": "mlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mlive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

No Republican nominee has won that state since Richard Nixon in 1972, yet Donald Trump has campaigned there numerous times over the summer.\n\nI'm told Trump's been campaigning in a solidly blue state, because he believes he could win it. At that time, polls suggested he was on course to defeating Joe Biden. He believed he could expand the electoral map. But Biden dropped out on July 21. Trump's latest rally was last week. Why? I'm told it's because he hasn't adjusted to Kamala Harris yet.\n\nPerhaps, but perhaps this, too: Trump didn't adjust, because he never adjusts. He can't. He does not learn from successes (the 2016 election) or failures (2020). Trump is running the same campaign he ran the last two times. The chief difference is the degree of horror. While he wasn't openly dictatorial eight years ago, he's now telling voters to vote this time like it's their last time. After that, they won't have to vote again.\n\nI don't have hard evidence to back up this statement. (Yes, I do pay attention to politics, but not to everything political.) I just think it's plainly obvious. I do concede it didn't look that way as long as Joe Biden was in the race, and it didn't look that way, because the Washington press corps had made a fetish of the president's age. Little else could break through The Narrative, not even the plainly obvious observation that Doald Trump is running the same old campaign.\n\nI expect things to change now that Kamala Harris is the Democratic nominee. (It was made official this weekend when she secured enough delegates to no longer be the presumptive nominee.) As voters notice he's running the same old campaign, I hope they'll notice something else that was hard to see as long as the president was in the running.\n\nThe Republican presidential nominee is also an old man.\n\nIt wouldn't be unreasonable to expect voters to wake up, as they often do in the fall, to a new understanding: Oh yes, of course! Donald Trump is running the same old campaign, because he's also an old man! (As I'm writing this, Morning Consult, the polling firm, released the results of its latest survey, showing that 51 percent of respondents said Trump is too old to be president while 12 percent (!) said Harris is. We can expect that 51 percent to climb higher as long as the question is asked.)\n\nThe Harris campaign is encouraging that view, without being obvious about it, by using normal liberal rhetoric about a \"conservative\" opposition that wants to take us back to a time when women and racial and sexual minorities had few legal rights. With broader awareness of Trump's age, there's no need to mention his authoritarian tendencies. Of course he wants to take us back. He's an old man!\n\nHer campaign encourages that view also by framing the election as a choice, for voters, between \"freedom and chaos,\" with the subliminal understanding that a campaign like Harris' can adjust to changing circumstances for the purpose of securing greater freedoms for all while a campaign like Trump's only flounders. It bumbles around the country, as it has for eight straight years. Of course Trump can't let go of a blue state he has no hope of taking from Harris. He's an old man!\n\nWe tend to forget that Trump has been campaigning against Joe Biden since 2019 when, as president, he extorted the leader of a foreign country into a conspiracy to defraud the American people. He wanted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to say - not do, just say - his government was investigating Biden for corrupt acts while vice president. Trump wanted to smear Biden before his campaign started.\n\nIt didn't work, but since then, Trump hasn't really bothered trying to win elections. He hasn't bothered trying to expand his base of support to include highly coveted swing voters who determine the outcomes of presidential elections. For 2020, instead of increasing his share of the 2016 electorate (about 46 percent), he doubled down on it, growing his stake by less than a point. Instead of trying to win, he just declared himself the winner, thus paving the way for a failed J6 insurrection.\n\nInstead of trying in 2024, Trump did the same old same old. With the help of the GOP, rightwing media allies and, lest we forget, Russian operatives, he built an international apparatus by which to sabotage Joe Biden's public image. Over four years, rightwing discourse became totalizing in its orientation toward smearing Biden as too old, too weak, too feeble. Trump did what he has always done, and thanks to the Washington press corps and Democrats who are vulnerable to what the press corps thinks of them, it finally worked. Biden's public image, after June's Disaster Debate, was so irreparable he dropped out.\n\nBut it worked too soon. You could say Trump's smear job against the president climaxed prematurely, and now that the vice president has taken over, Trump doesn't know what to do after so many years of doing the same old same old. There's not enough time to establish a new context of bullshit to which the press corps can give the benefit of the doubt, and, in effect, erode Harris' support among those highly coveted swing voters as well as from inside the Democratic Party.\n\nTrump can't adjust, won't adjust. He's running the same campaign he ran the first two times.

Harris -- or Donald Trump?", "body": "Donald Trump and Kamala Harris may be rivals for the White House, but they're not exactly competing in the same race.\n\nHarris is running against Trump.\n\nTrump is running against everybody -- against her, against his fellow Republicans, against pro-lifers and Project 2025, and ultimately against the most formidable opponent of all: himself.\n\nElections are like word-association games or the conditioning used by scientists to get dogs salivating at the sound of a bell.\n\nVoters have an instant emotional reaction to candidates based on how they feel about the events they've been involved with.\n\nThis plays to Harris' advantage: like most vice presidents, she's been a non-entity, hardly more visible as VP than she was before Joe Biden put her on his ticket four years ago.\n\nHer earlier record as the most left-wing senator in the nation and a downright authoritarian attorney general of California might trouble voters, if they knew anything about it.\n\nThen again, knowing isn't enough -- images and emotional resonances are far stronger.\n\nTrump supporters know this:\n\nThey feel a surge of pride whenever they recall the image of Trump standing and raising his fist in defiance after an assassin's bullet came within an inch of ending his life.\n\nYet Trump has been a fixture of presidential politics, either in office or seeking it, for nine years now, and voters had formed long-term associations with his name well before the attempt to murder him.\n\nFor grassroots Republicans, those Pavlovian associations are overwhelmingly favorable, which is why few were prepared to listen to intellectual arguments about policy or electability from Ron DeSantis or any other rival in the primaries.\n\nOrdinary Americans have happy memories of Trump's years in the White House -- but they also recall the endless drama of the media's Russian collusion obsession, Trump's firing of the FBI director and the subsequent independent counsel investigation, two impeachment trials, and an inexhaustible supply of lesser controversies.\n\nThe Trump years were peaceful and prosperous, but they ended with COVID and riots, those of summer 2020 and at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThat mix of associations, good and bad, played well in comparison to the feelings President Biden brought out -- feelings of shame at the debacle that was withdrawal from Afghanistan, embarrassment at seeing the president's obviously impaired condition, anger over out-of-control inflation and illegal immigration, and anxiety about wars in Europe and the Holy Land that Biden was unfit to tackle.\n\nHarris, on the other hand, is an empty canvas.\n\nAnd all Trump's baggage -- an emotional burden on voters -- stands out vividly in contrast.\n\nEveryone, even Trump's supporters, has episodes from the Trump years they would rather forget.\n\nHarris is selling herself as a way to erase the painful memories and replace them with nothing but media-manufactured good feelings -- a sugar pill.\n\nHow does Trump counter that?\n\nNot by renewing his feud with Brian Kemp, the popular Republican governor of battleground Georgia, yet that's what Trump did at his Atlanta rally last Saturday.\n\nGeorgia is the only one of the five states that flipped from Trump to the Democrat between 2016 and 2020 that has a Republican governor today.\n\nWhen Trump won the crucial Rust Belt states of Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016, both had Republican governors, as did the most hotly contested Sun Belt state, Arizona.\n\nToday, those key pieces of the electoral map all have Democrats in their highest office -- putting Georgia at risk too is gratuitous.\n\nPro-lifers and movement conservatives have long felt conflicted about Trump, whose behavior and stated positions often don't align with their principles, even though his policies as president were greatly beneficial for their causes.\n\nThe Trump campaign has answered their unease by watering down the GOP's pro-life plank at the convention and denouncing the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 in the weeks afterward.\n\nWhile her friends in the media have rallied to Harris, creating a sense of not only Democratic unity but widespread enthusiasm for the blank slate VP, Trump's advisers have picked fights that weaken the right's morale.\n\nHarris might not entirely escape the gravitational suck of the Biden-Harris administration's record.\n\nAnd the stock market's troubles are bad for the incumbent party in the White House, even with Harris replacing Biden as the nominee.\n\nAn effective attack would also tie Harris in voters' minds to their feelings about California, once America's promised land of postwar prosperity, now losing population as the middle class flees an unaffordable single-party state whose Democrat-run cities are sunk in homelessness and crime.\n\nMake America great again, or make America California now?\n\nTrump can regain the momentum he's lost since the convention -- but only if he defines Harris in voters' minds, so he's running directly against her, not his party, his allies and himself.", "source": {"uri":

Election analyst Nate Silver's national poll aggregate now shows her leading Republican nominee Trump at 45.5% to 44.1%.\n\nWhen President Joe Biden withdrew from the contest on July 21, Trump had a 45.2% to 41.2% lead. But Harris has electrified the Democratic base and rattled her rival, who sparked a backlash for targeting her over her race, her intelligence and her laugh.\n\nREAD MORE: Kamala Harris issues stern five-word promise on Gaza to Israel's Netanyahu\n\nOn Tuesday, Harris named her running mate as 60-year-old Minnesota Governor Tim Walz - a former teacher and member of the US Army National Guard. He recently went viral in the States for attacking Trump and his running mate JD Vance as \" weird \".\n\nAlthough Walz does not have the same profile as other vice presidential hopefuls, he appeals to rural white voters, championing progressive policies such as free school meals and expanded paid worker leave. Walz, born and raised in small-town Nebraska, became a teacher, first in China, then in his home state before finally moving to Mankato, Minnesota, where he taught geography and coached the high school football team.\n\nHarris embarked on a five-day battleground tour on Tuesday. She will visit Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia and Arizona, making stops in North Carolina - where Biden lost by a slim margin in 2020 - and Nevada, where the Democrats won narrowly.\n\nIt is thought these seven states are likely to decide the election result on November 5. Trump, 78, consistently led 81-year-old Joe Biden in the polls before the President was forced to abandon his re-election bid after a disastrous debate performance in June. Since he stepped aside, Harris has wasted no time in closing the gap on her rival.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri":

We have been very clear that Israel and the Israeli people and Palestinians are entitled to an equal amount of security and dignity.\"\n\nVP SHORT-LISTER SHAPIRO ON DEFENSE OVER ISRAEL AFTER DECADES-OLD COLLEGE PAPER SURFACES\n\nThe poll also comes just before Harris chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who was the only Jewish candidate in the running. The move prompted some to speculate that the choice was made as a result of Shapiro's lack of popularity with members of the Democratic Party, who have taken a more sympathetic approach to Palestinians since the war broke out in Gaza.\n\nNevertheless, Jewish voters have traditionally supported Democrat candidates for decades. According to an analysis by the American Enterprise Institute, Jewish voters have on average supported Democrats over Republicans by a margin of 71% to 26% since 1968.\n\nJewish voters supported Biden over Trump 68% to 30% in 2020, while in 2016 the same group chose Clinton over Trump by a margin of 71% to 26%.\n\nBut the poll wasn't all bad news for Harris, who overall solidified her lead over Trump among all likely voters in the state. Harris now leads Trump 53%-39% among likely New York voters, according to the Tuesday poll, a large improvement from the eight- to 10-point lead Biden had in previous versions of the poll.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Siena College Research Institute poll was conducted between July 28 and Aug. 1 and surveyed 1,199 likely voters in New York, 8% of whom were Jewish; the poll has a margin of error of +/- 4.0 percentage points.\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.", "source": {"uri": "1010wcsi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "1010 WCSI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena_College_Research_Institute", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siena College Research Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Enterprise_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Enterprise Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://1010wcsi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WCSI-header.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792426", "eventUri": "eng-9792426", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-28", "dateEnd": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 3351, "textEnd": 3369}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

most formidable opponent of all: himself.\n\nElections are like word-association games or the conditioning used by scientists to get dogs salivating at the sound of a bell.\n\nVoters have an instant emotional reaction to candidates based on how they feel about the events they've been involved with.\n\nThis plays to Harris' advantage: like most vice presidents, she's been a non-entity, hardly more visible as VP than she was before Joe Biden put her on his ticket four years ago.\n\nHer earlier record as the most left-wing senator in the nation and a downright authoritarian attorney general of California might trouble voters, if they knew anything about it.\n\nThen again, knowing isn't enough -- images and emotional resonances are far stronger.\n\nTrump supporters know this:\n\nThey feel a surge of pride whenever they recall the image of Trump standing and raising his fist in defiance after an assassin's bullet came within an inch of ending his life.\n\nYet Trump has been a fixture of presidential politics, either in office or seeking it, for nine years now, and voters had formed long-term associations with his name well before the attempt to murder him.\n\nFor grassroots Republicans, those Pavlovian associations are overwhelmingly favorable, which is why few were prepared to listen to intellectual arguments about policy or electability from Ron DeSantis or any other rival in the primaries.\n\nOrdinary Americans have happy memories of Trump's years in the White House -- but they also recall the endless drama of the media's Russian collusion obsession, Trump's firing of the FBI director and the subsequent independent counsel investigation, two impeachment trials, and an inexhaustible supply of lesser controversies.\n\nThe Trump years were peaceful and prosperous, but they ended with COVID and riots, those of summer 2020 and at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThat mix of associations, good and bad, played well in comparison to the feelings President Biden brought out -- feelings of shame at the debacle that was withdrawal from Afghanistan, embarrassment at seeing the president's obviously impaired condition, anger over out-of-control inflation and illegal immigration, and anxiety about wars in Europe and the Holy Land that Biden was unfit to tackle.\n\nHarris, on the other hand, is an empty canvas.\n\nAnd all Trump's baggage -- an emotional burden on voters -- stands out vividly in contrast.\n\nEveryone, even Trump's supporters, has episodes from the Trump years they would rather forget.\n\nHarris is selling herself as a way to erase the painful memories and replace them with nothing but media-manufactured good feelings -- a sugar pill.\n\nHow does Trump counter that?\n\nNot by renewing his feud with Brian Kemp, the popular Republican governor of battleground Georgia, yet that's what Trump did at his Atlanta rally last Saturday.\n\nGeorgia is the only one of the five states that flipped from Trump to the Democrat between 2016 and 2020 that has a Republican governor today.\n\nWhen Trump won the crucial Rust Belt states of Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016, both had Republican governors, as did the most hotly contested Sun Belt state, Arizona.\n\nToday, those key pieces of the electoral map all have Democrats in their highest office -- putting Georgia at risk too is gratuitous.\n\nPro-lifers and movement conservatives have long felt conflicted about Trump, whose behavior and stated positions often don't align with their principles, even though his policies as president were greatly beneficial for their causes.\n\nThe Trump campaign has answered their unease by watering down the GOP's pro-life plank at the convention and denouncing the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 in the weeks afterward.\n\nWhile her friends in the media have rallied to Harris, creating a sense of not only Democratic unity but widespread enthusiasm for the blank slate VP, Trump's advisers have picked fights that weaken the right's morale.\n\nHarris might not entirely escape the gravitational suck of the Biden-Harris administration's record.\n\nAnd the stock market's troubles are bad for the incumbent party in the White House, even with Harris replacing Biden as the nominee.\n\nAn effective attack would also tie Harris in voters' minds to their feelings about California, once America's promised land of postwar prosperity, now losing population as the middle class flees an unaffordable single-party state whose Democrat-run cities are sunk in homelessness and crime.\n\nMake America great again, or make America California now?\n\nTrump can regain the momentum he's lost since the convention -- but only if he defines Harris in voters' minds, so he's running directly against her, not his party, his allies and himself.",

Tim Walz (D-MN). Her campaign will then embark on a campaign tour across five more key battleground states.\n\nIn the meantime, her opponent, former President Donald Trump, is only visiting one state, Montana, at the end of the week. Montana has safely voted for a Republican for president for decades, but it has a competitive Senate race this year between incumbent Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT) and challenger Tim Sheehy. The Harris campaign took little time to point out the candidate's differences in schedules.\n\nHarris was set to go to Savannah, Georgia, as well this week, but the event has been postponed due to Hurricane Debby. Here is Harris's schedule this week:\n\nHarris is starting her campaign tour in Philadelphia, and she is set to campaign alongside her vice presidential pick, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN).\n\nPennsylvania is a key battleground state with the most electoral votes, 19, of all the swing states. It's seen as a must-win for either Trump or Harris. In 2016, Trump flipped the state red for the first time since 1988, while in 2020, Biden flipped the state blue once again by more than 80,000 votes.\n\nIn her first stop during this tour in the Midwest, Harris will visit Michigan on Wednesday. Michigan could be one of the trickier states for Harris to nab as more than 100,000 voted \"uncommitted\" over voting for Biden in the primary due to their dissatisfaction with his handling of Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nMichigan is currently a toss-up. In 2016, Trump narrowly flipped the state by a little more than 10,000 votes, but Biden safely won the state in 2020 by more than 150,000 votes.\n\nHarris is not making the mistake of former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and ignoring the state of Wisconsin while on the campaign trail. She began her campaign there two weeks ago in the Milwaukee suburb of West Allis, Wisconsin, and now she is headed to the more rural northwest portion of the state Wednesday.\n\nWhile a Democratic president has not won North Carolina since former President Barack Obama's historic win there in 2008, Democrats have had their eye on the Tar Heel State. On Thursday, she will visit the state for the eighth time this year.\n\nAs her campaign tries to court the Generation Z vote, Harris's visit to Durham, which is in the Research Triangle (consisting of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Duke University, and North Carolina State University), highlights that effort.\n\nHarris seemingly has closed some of the polling gap from before Biden suspended his reelection bid. Trump previously led in North Carolina, 47.2% to Biden's 41.5%, according to a RealClearPolitics poll. A recent Bloomberg-Morning Consult poll, however, showed Trump leading Harris in the state, 48%-46%.\n\nHarris is set to visit Phoenix on Friday.\n\nHarris and Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), who is running for Senate, both have the endorsements of many centrist Republicans and independents across the state of Arizona. As Harris visits Phoenix, she is endorsed by John Giles, the Republican mayor of Mesa, a Phoenix suburb that is Arizona's third-largest city.\n\nDuring the 2016 election, Maricopa County was the most populous county that voted for Trump, but it flipped blue for Biden in 2020. It is the population center of the state with more than 60% of Arizonans living in Maricopa County.\n\nWhile the state was once a solidly Republican-leaning state, it has moved to the left in recent years with a notable blue wave during the 2022 election, which gave Arizona a Democratic governor, attorney general, and secretary of state as well as Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ).\n\nThe GOP once strongly held both of Arizona's Senate seats for years, but the party has not won a Senate race there since 2018. Biden won the state in 2020, which was the first time Arizona voters sent a Democrat to the White House since former President Bill Clinton in 1996.\n\nHarris will visit Las Vegas on Saturday to conclude her campaign tour. Trump is now tied with Harris in Nevada, 43%-43%, according to a recent Bloomberg-Morning Consult poll, and Harris appears to have a new enthusiasm in the state that Biden was not able to capture.\n\nNevada has consistently voted for Democratic presidential candidates in the last four elections.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nMore than 3,000 Nevada residents have signed up to volunteer for the Harris campaign, according to the Washington Post, and after Biden exited the race, Nevada's secretary of state reported an uptick in voter registration in the state, with 6,000 new Nevadans registering to vote in July.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Tim Walz is \"not a safe pick\" for Vice President Harris and doesn't appeal to centrists like Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro could.\n\nFormer President Trump has moved into the lead among Jewish voters in deep-blue New York.\n\nTrump garnered the support of 50% of likely Jewish voters in New York, according to a Siena Research Institute poll released Tuesday, a slight lead over Vice President Harris who garnered the selection of 49% of respondents.\n\nWhile the lead for Trump is slim, it marks a dramatic change from the former president's prospects against President Biden, who in June led Trump among likely Jewish voters, 52%-46%, in the state.\n\nHowever, the race has changed dramatically since the last poll, with Biden opting last month to drop out of the race and immediately endorse Harris, who quickly worked to secure the Democrat nomination.\n\nDEMOCRAT CALLS OUT LEFT'S 'STRONG UNDERCURRENT OF ANTISEMITISM' IN ATTACKS ON POTENTIAL VP PICK SHAPIRO\n\nHarris' journey to the top of the Democrat ticket comes as some supporters of Israel have worried that her support for the Jewish state has started to wane, with some arguing that she has distanced herself from the Biden administration since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas conflict in the Gaza Strip.\n\nHarris became the first administration official to call for an \"immediate cease-fire\" to the conflict in March, and she also became the first administration official to warn of \"consequences\" for Israel if it went ahead with a planned invasion of the Gazan city of Rafah in an interview with ABC News later that month.\n\nHarris has also faced questions about her relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, most notably after she appeared to dodge questions about whether the Israeli leader had become an \"obstacle to peace.\"\n\n\"I believe that we have got to continue to enforce what we know to be and should be the priorities in terms of what is happening in Gaza,\" Harris said in response. \"We've been very clear that far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. We have been very clear that Israel and the Israeli people and Palestinians are entitled to an equal amount of security and dignity.\"\n\nVP SHORT-LISTER SHAPIRO ON DEFENSE OVER ISRAEL AFTER DECADES-OLD COLLEGE PAPER SURFACES\n\nThe poll also comes just before Harris chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who was the only Jewish candidate in the running. The move prompted some to speculate that the choice was made as a result of Shapiro's lack of popularity with members of the Democratic Party, who have taken a more sympathetic approach to Palestinians since the war broke out in Gaza.\n\nNevertheless, Jewish voters have traditionally supported Democrat candidates for decades. According to an analysis by the American Enterprise Institute, Jewish voters have on average supported Democrats over Republicans by a margin of 71% to 26% since 1968.\n\nJewish voters supported Biden over Trump 68% to 30% in 2020, while in 2016 the same group chose Clinton over Trump by a margin of 71% to 26%.\n\nBut the poll wasn't all bad news for Harris, who overall solidified her lead over Trump among all likely voters in the state. Harris now leads Trump 53%-39% among likely New York voters, according to the Tuesday poll, a large improvement from the eight- to 10-point lead Biden had in previous versions of the poll.\n\nCLICK

Tim Walz as her running mate, both major parties have their tickets set for a 90-day sprint to Election Day. This campaign went through a massive reboot over the last three weeks, and the computer has finally finished whirring and resetting and updating a bunch of new software for various apps and programs.\n\nAmong the predictions I made in that column was that two things would most likely change with a new ticket for the Democrats: Interest in the election among all voters would increase, particularly among some key voter groups the Democrats are counting on, like young people and African Americans. And renewed interest in the new Democratic ticket might lessen the interest in the various third-party candidates. Those two developments alone would increase the variance in possible outcomes for November.\n\nEarly polling indicates a renewed interest in the campaign overall -- and it's not just polling. The fundraising has been a bigger boon than even the most optimistic Democrats anticipated. The various \"attention metrics,\" like TV ratings and social media trends, also show interest in the campaign is up near levels in 2008 and 2020, two of our higher interest/turnout elections of my lifetime. That's after having been down at unusually low levels before.\n\nAnd then there's the collapse of the third-party candidates. A Biden-Trump rematch was a perfect storm for a rise in the third-party presidential vote share. And at times, some polls showed the share of non-major-party voters hitting nearly 25%.\n\nThat is no longer the case, and I highly doubt we will see the combined third-party vote get into double digits. It has been especially fascinating to watch the collapse of support for Cornel West and Jill Stein, who are both running to the left of the Democrats and very aggressively on the issue of Gaza.\n\nAnd the new interest in the campaign, combined with more just plain weird information that the public is learning about Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has shown that what's left of his support may be folks who aren't persuadable for either major party. He might have simply cornered the \"gadfly\" market of American politics. I'm still expecting Kennedy to drop his campaign at some point and endorse Trump. He has all but hinted a Trump victory is his preferred outcome.\n\nAll of this means the country is basically where it has been since the 2000 election: deeply polarized and, essentially, evenly divided. Remember, five of the six presidential elections since 2000 have been decided by 5 percentage points or less, and it's likely this election will also be decided by 5 points or less. (Only five elections in the entire 20th century were decided by that small margin.)\n\nSo let's delve into what we don't know. Here are a series of questions to ponder as you try to figure out which way this election is leaning.\n\nLet's start off with this basic one: Is Harris winning right now? Or is Trump losing? Is it some combination of both?\n\nI've been highly cautious in answering the question about Harris' actual viability in this election. Until the country elects its first female president, there's always going to be some doubt about whether voters are ready to elect a female commander in chief. But it's clear that Trump has been completely thrown off his game, and right now, he's actively making unforced errors that could cost him this election.\n\nFrom his damaging decision to question Harris' mixed-race background -- at the National Association of Black Journalists, no less -- to the strategy-free sideswipe he made in Georgia against the state's popular GOP governor, Brian Kemp, it certainly appears as if Trump is off his game. On July 18, the night he delivered his convention acceptance speech, he was in cruise control. From surviving an assassination attempt to the surprising unity he projected at his convention to the feeble performance by Biden at a variety of public events, Trump knew how to win a rematch with Biden.\n\nBut he's not running against Biden anymore, and it's clear he is lamenting that more than any of us realized. Many people close to Trump have indicated to me how focused he was on avenging his defeat at Biden's hands in 2020. It really bothered him that he lost to someone who, in his mind, wasn't worthy of defeating him.\n\nThis is how those close to Trump explain his obsession with questioning the validity of 2020. He just can't accept that Biden beat him by being the anti-Trump -- less in your face, less erratic, less aggressive. To accept defeat by Biden is to accept that Trump's own worse instincts are what doomed him in 2020. And while I've pledged not to put Trump on the couch, he wouldn't be the first narcissist who can't accept rejection.\n\nBut it's not just losing Biden as an opponent that has rattled Trump -- it's having to run against a woman. It's worth noting how he seems to dial up his personal venom when he's questioned by a woman, whether it's a woman from his own party challenging him for the GOP nomination (see Carly Fiorina in 2016 and Nikki Haley in 2024), a woman from his own party questioning his commitment to the ideals of America and the Constitution specifically (see Liz Cheney) or women he has to deal with as his equals (think then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton and now Kamala Harris). Trump has a history of debating women who question him in the most demeaning and unappealing way.\n\nTrump already has a substance issue with many female voters when it comes to reproductive rights, but those personal attacks on Harris could truly backfire.\n\nNeither party used its VP pick to virtue signal to the disaffected middle. Now what?\n\nThat is the biggest known unknown of this campaign: who can appeal to what's left of the middle. If you worry about the progressive lean of the Democrats and you simultaneously are turned off by the MAGA lean of the Republicans, who do you end up voting for if neither party has made an overt attempt to appeal to you?\n\nNow, both campaigns will take issue with the idea that their vice presidential picks aren't appealing to some key swing-voting constituencies. Both campaigns cite the Midwestern roots of Vance and Walz as a way to appeal to voters in the crucial states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But the reality is that Walz isn't to the right of Harris and, clearly, Vance isn't to the left of Trump.\n\nA pick of either Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona or Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro would have been a clear virtue signal to the center by Harris, as both are to her political right within the confines of the Democratic Party, at least on a few key issues, including the border (Kelly) and school vouchers (Shapiro), just to name a few. Had Trump picked Haley or Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, the pick would have been viewed similarly, as a virtue signal to the center-right wing of the GOP.\n\nBut both campaigns went toward their bases, which is also an indication of where both campaigns see this election. They view it as a turnout election, not a persuasion election. In fact, my hunch is that Harris decided against any vice presidential pick who was going to cause any level of internal tension in the Democratic Party.\n\nIn the short term, one could understand that thinking. She has been the official party leader for about two weeks, and the last thing she needs is a series of ideological brushfires at her convention over Gaza, vouchers or immigration. It's why the Walz pick is already being seen as a \"do no harm\"-style VP selection.\n\n(I do wonder whether the Harris-Walz ticket is ready for the Trump-Vance campaign's intention to relitigate all things George Floyd with Walz -- and if it is, whether it sees that as a net positive or negative.)\n\nHere's the bottom line: Neither Trump nor Harris has many obvious opportunities to virtue signal to the middle. The VP picks were among the last of those opportunities. It appears we are headed for an October when both campaigns simply try to disqualify the other candidate with the skeptical middle and try to herd those voters to the ticket that least offends their sensibilities.\n\nOf course, this election may now play out in a number of ways. For instance, what if this election is simply 2016 in reverse?\n\nIn that scenario, the \"childless cat ladies\" attack line on Democratic voters by Vance is akin to the \"basket of deplorables\" attack Hillary Clinton made against Trump voters.\n\nBut Trump is also similar to Clinton in another way from 2016. Voters thought they already had a sense of what kind of presidency Clinton would conduct, just like they do now with Trump. In 2016, Trump was new and change, while Clinton was status quo. In 2024, Trump's status quo, and Harris is new and change.\n\nMany of us spend a lot of time analyzing politics as if it's complicated, and yet sometimes, politics isn't that complicated. If a majority of the country doesn't like the direction of the country, it is going to search for someone new. And while Trump isn't in office, he's not new. Harris may be Biden's vice president, but her election would signify something very new and different. Toss in concern about the massive upheaval Trump's Supreme Court nominees made by overturning Roe v. Wade and one can see a very straightforward and simple explanation for a Trump loss to Harris.\n\nA few other variables are poised to play some role in this campaign, and the extent is unclear. There's Trump's age: As Haley said a few times on the campaign trail, it's possible that the first party that ditches its 80-year-old standard-bearer would be rewarded, which could help Harris.\n\nThe world appears more unstable today than it did four years ago, and if concern over the direction of American foreign policy is more front and center in the fall, it's possible Trump's experience being president is seen as an asset to some undecided voters.\n\nAnd then there's the economy, which is both strong in some places (jobs) and weak in other places (cost of living). A decided negative turn on the nation's economic outlook in the next 60 to 90 days would also be more likely to benefit Trump.\n\nAltogether, what appeared to be an election in the mold of 1980, 1992 or 2020 -- the last three elections in which incumbent presidents lost -- is now on a different trajectory.\n\nThe race is still winnable for Trump, but it's a much tougher for path for him. Harris' path to victory is better than Biden's, but it's no sure thing, either. She's still got a lot of blanks to fill in with the American electorate. Vice presidents are both famous and unknown.\n\nHow she fills in those blanks in the next 30 days will go a long way in deciding whether she breaks the country's ultimate glass ceiling in about 90 days.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2000 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Here's what we're looking at this week:\n\nFor all the Democratic defections from President Biden and euphoria over Vice President Kamala Harris, there's an important unanswered question about whether Harris can do something that Biden got very, very right in 2020: Be appealing to independent, undecided and swing voters with a centrist message emphasizing normalcy and uniting the country.\n\nI think that message won Biden victory in the Electoral College. And a lot of Democrats are telling me two things right now: Harris will win the popular vote in November (thanks to strong margins in blue states), but it's far from clear if she will win the Electoral College vote. She's got to prove herself to those independent, undecided and swing voters in battleground states, or else she's not going to win the presidency. And for all the record fund-raising and meme excitement, Harris hasn't started indicating how she plans to do so.\n\nBlue America is undoubtedly fired up and closing the enthusiasm gap fast against Donald Trump, and that's a big deal -- it's what Democrats needed to do in Week 1 of the 15-week Harris presidential sprint. As we enter Week 2, I'll be watching today for signs of a swing-voter message from two star governors and possible Harris running mates -- Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan -- who are jointly campaigning for Harris in the Philadelphia suburbs. And I'll be keeping an eye on new Harris campaign ads and her next big event, in Atlanta on Tuesday.\n\nSo far, Harris has mostly been talking to friendly Democratic audiences. She is leaving it to surrogates to make her case in more challenging venues, as Pete Buttigieg did Sunday on Fox News, or speak most pointedly to swing voters and small-town Americans in purple and red areas, as Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota has.\n\nBiden, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton won the presidency because they made real attempts -- through policy ideas, speeches, campaign travel and, sometimes, criticism of their party or allies -- to show that they had a measure of independence, thought for themselves and, yes, were looking out for all Americans, not just team blue. Both Bushes broke with some in the G.O.P. too (most notably on taxes and then immigration). Now that Harris has fired up the base faster than perhaps even she expected, what will she do to go beyond that base?\n\nI'm really curious about what she says at her Atlanta event and where she plans to campaign in the days and weeks to come. And I'm also curious to see if she can really put Trump on the defensive over debating her; she could reach a lot of those swing voters through debates, as well as prosecuting the case that Trump is unfit to lead the country again. Making a serious proposal to Trump that they meet for one debate a week starting in September would take this historic election to a new level.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news",

A new UMass Amherst poll explains why | John L. Micek", "body": "These are rough days for the folks behind Project 2025.\n\nFirst, former President Donald Trump sought to distance himself from the conservative governing blueprint that would, among other things, eliminate the U.S. Department of Education, dismantle the civil service system, and impose sweeping restrictions on abortion rights.\n\nThen the top leader behind the project spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing Washington D.C. think-tank, announced he was leaving amid blowback from both Trump and Democrats who had transformed it into an effective fundraising tool.\n\nThe think-tank has vowed to soldier on, arguing that its \"collective efforts to build a personnel apparatus for policymakers of all levels -- federal, state, and local -- will continue,\" according to The Associated Press.\n\nHowever, if a new UMass Amherst poll is any indication, they might want to reconsider.\n\nBy broad margins, 1,000 nationwide respondents rejected most of the primary tenets behind the project, setting it up as a political loser with control of the White House and Congress on the line.\n\nThat same poll already pointed to trouble for the GOP, with Vice President Kamala Harris opening a 3-point lead over Trump in the less than three weeks since she's become the Democrats' de facto presidential nominee.\n\nHarris holds a 46%-43% lead over Trump in the poll conducted between July 29 and Aug. 1.\n\nAnd while that's still well within the poll's 3.8% margin of error, it nonetheless represents a 7-point swing from a January UMass poll that showed Trump with a 43%-39% lead over Biden.\n\n\"Harris's entry has really shaken up the presidential race,\" UMass pollster Jesse Rhodes said. \"Where Donald Trump was once heavily favored over Joe Biden, we now see Harris with a narrow lead. This appears to be driven by big shifts among young voters, African Americans, and Latinx Americans toward Harris. Moderates also appear to have shifted dramatically to Harris. The 2024 presidential election is still extremely close, but it's an entirely different race than it was a month ago.\"\n\nThe GOP's embrace of the Project 2025 agenda may be helping to drive that shift.\n\nFor instance, 51% of respondents said they'd oppose federal efforts to reduce civil rights protections for LGBTQ Americans.\n\nSeventy-two percent of respondents said they opposed reducing access to contraception. And nearly two-thirds, 64%, said they'd oppose getting rid of the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nThey also opposed, 56%-23%, cutting federal support for the research and development of renewable energy; and rejected, 68%-12%, firing thousands of federal employees and replacing them with political appointees only loyal to the sitting president.\n\nBut respondents were narrowly divided, 40%-39%, over ending federal policies that supported diversity, equity, and inclusion in education, employment, and housing.\n\nThey also backed 43%-34%, shutting down \"social media companies and internet sites that depict, or contain links to, depictions of pornography.\"\n\nA majority of the poll's respondents (53%) said they'd heard \"some\" or \"a lot\" about Project 2025, compared to a quarter who said they hadn't heard much, and 22% who said they'd never heard of it.\n\nRespondents to the new poll already view this November's election as a high-stakes contest, with nearly 9 in 10 of them saying it's extremely or very important to the nation's future.\n\nAnd in a polarized country, \"many voters also see this election as critical for particular groups of Americans who feel threatened by either party winning,\" UMass political scientist Ray La Raja said in a statement accompanying the polling memo.\n\n\"Sixty-nine percent say the election results are extremely or very important for the future of women, and 66% say the same about people of color,\" he continued.\n\n\"On the other side of the partisan divide, 49% say it is extremely or very important for the future of Christians, while 43% say the same about white people,\" he continued.\n\nReflecting national trends, Trump came into the poll with an image problem. The Republican nominee's pugnacious reputation is a \"hindrance - people know him well, and many don't like at least some of his qualities,\" Rhodes said.\n\nThus, it makes sense for Trump to try to distance himself from some of Project 2025's potentially more radioactive tenets. But he also has espoused trimming the ranks of the federal civil service and gutting the Education Department.\n\n\"I disagree with some of the things they're saying and some of the things they're saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal,\" Trump said last month, even though the project is peopled with some of his former top aides. \"Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them.\"\n\nDemocrats, for their part, are unwilling to let Trump -- or Republicans -- off that easily.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Project 2025 is Donald Trump's blueprint to enact widespread harm, impacting everyone who calls America home,\" U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-7th District, said in an email last month, repeating a familiar Democratic line of attack.\n\nThe plan was \"written by Trump allies for a future Trump presidency, and the resignation of its director doesn't change the fact that it is Trump's agenda,\" Pressley continued.\n\nAnd right now, at least, voters agree. And they don't like what they're hearing.\n\nA new national University of Massachusetts Amherst Poll has found that Vice President Kamala Harris has opened up a three-point lead over former President Donald Trump since becoming the de facto Democratic nominee following President Joe Biden's decision to step away from his re-election bid. Harris' 46-43 lead over Trump in the new poll, conducted July 29-Aug. 1, represents a seven-point swing from a January UMass Poll that found Trump with a 43-39 lead over Biden.", "source": {"uri":

Jamaal Bowman became the first Squad member to lose a Democratic primary this year. Rep. Cori Bush could be the second.\n\nBush, a Missouri Democrat, faces St. Louis prosecutor Wesley Bell in a primary today -- less than two months after Bowman lost to Democratic rival George Latimer in a Bronx-Westchester district.\n\nLike Latimer, Bell has benefitted from spending by AIPAC, a leading pro-Israel organization that supports primary challenges to left-leaning House members.\n\nPOLL VAULTING: Vice President Kamala Harris has a 14-point lead over former President Donald Trump in New York -- a far larger gap than President Joe Biden's shrinking advantage, a Siena College poll out today found.\n\nThe highly anticipated Siena poll -- the first statewide survey of voters since Biden ended his presidential campaign on July 21 and endorsed Harris -- suggests a rejuvenated race in New York.\n\nHarris' edge will give down-ballot Democrats a sigh of relief after months of Biden's eroding numbers in New York.\n\nDemocrats had nervously observed Biden's lackluster polling in this deep blue state for months, fretting over the potential impact on the party's House candidates with a half-dozen swing seats in play.\n\nHarris led Trump 53 percent to 39 percent among registered voters in the state in a head-to-head race, according to the poll.\n\nThat's an improvement of six points overall from Biden's matchup with Trump in June. And Harris is doing better than her boss in New York virtually across the board.\n\nSince Biden exited the race, Harris' numbers across key demographics have improved: 81 percent of Black voters in this poll, compared to 59 percent for Biden in June; and 40 percent of independent voters, more than Biden's 28 percent. (Trump drew 47 percent of independent voters).\n\nThe survey found a virtually even race between Trump and Harris in upstate counties and in the politically crucial New York City suburbs.\n\nBefore Biden dropped his bid for a second term, signs of trouble for Democratic House candidates ensued.\n\nDemocrats are trying to flip five Republican-held seats in the Hudson Valley, the Syracuse area and on Long Island.\n\nPrivate polling by Democratic-leaning labor unions and the campaigns themselves showed a surprisingly competitive presidential race between Biden and Trump within battleground House seats. (A Republican presidential candidate has not won New York since 1984.)\n\nOne Democrat working on a competitive House race and granted anonymity to speak bluntly said of Biden's decision to exit the race: \"Democrats rightly listened to the concerns of the American people, while Republicans doubled down on the cult of Trump.\"\n\nDemocrat Mondaire Jones, who is trying to reclaim his old Hudson Valley House seat in a challenge to Republican Rep. Mike Lawler, said Harris' entry into the race has created a new dynamic.\n\n\"I've already noticed the increase, the uptick in volunteerism and excitement,\" he said Monday. \"There's a whole bunch of organic events being planned and I'm going to be participating in as many as I can.\"\n\nLawler's campaign in response signaled issues will still matter in the race for the swing seat against Jones.\n\n\"Unfortunately, for him, the switch at the top of the ticket won't save him,\" Lawler campaign manager Chris Russell said. \"Hudson Valley voters don't want a radical 'defund the police,' open borders, tax-raising socialist like Mondaire as their congressman.\"\n\nDespite the good news, warning signs remain for Democrats -- and a clear silver lining for Republicans.\n\nVoters in New York are sour over the direction of the country, with 61 percent telling pollsters it is headed the wrong way.\n\nThey also remain frustrated on issues Republicans have sought to wield against Democrats, including Harris, this fall. Majorities of voters believe crime, the migrant crisis and the cost of living have worsened in New York over the last year, the poll found. -- Nick Reisman, with reporting from Emily Ngo\n\nIT'S TUESDAY: Got news? Send it our way: Jeff Coltin, Emily Ngo and Nick Reisman.\n\nYOU'RE INVITED! -- Join us for a special POLITICO Live event in NYC on Wednesday. What is the future for Social Security? New York Rep. Pat Ryan (D) will discuss the challenges and solutions lawmakers are considering for the aging benefit on which millions of retiring Americans and New Yorkers rely. We'll also talk with Jonathan Bowles, executive director of the Center for an Urban Future, Julietta Lopez of the Hispanic Federation and Stephen Miran of the Manhattan Institute, about Social Security's impact on New York, including the housing crisis. RSVP to attend here.\n\nWHERE'S KATHY? In New York City with no public schedule.\n\nWHERE'S ERIC? Delivering remarks at a flag-raising ceremony for Bolivia, then holding his weekly press conference. Later he'll speak and present proclamations at the 5th, 122nd, 34th, 47th and 107th precincts as well as Transit District 34.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: \"Maybe that's where I got my brain worm.\" -- Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s response to the New Yorker when asked about dumping a bear carcass in Central Park and posing with it. More below on the incident and its fallout.\n\nVEEPSTAKES FEVER: Harris is expected as early as this morning to announce her running mate, capping a whirlwind search and vetting process that has kept a reenergized Democratic Party on edge.\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg are among the contenders.\n\nAnd while swing-district Democrats in New York had distanced themselves from Biden when he topped the ticket, they've warmed to Harris and are making their VP preferences known.\n\nIn the Hudson Valley, frontline Democrat Rep. Pat Ryan told CNN recently, \"I am and have forever been a Pete Buttigieg fan. I think he has just knocked it out of the park in delivering on infrastructure. ... And he has just shown an ability to actually unify the country when that is just what people are desperately looking for.\"\n\nFarther south in the Hudson Valley, Jones, who is facing Lawler, said any of the names floated as potential running mates to Harris would be great, but he let slip a favorite.\n\n\"She's got an incredible bench,\" the Democratic former House member told Playbook. \"I think Shapiro would be a fantastic choice. She needs to win Pennsylvania to return to the White House and he is enormously popular in Pennsylvania.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in solidly Democratic Westchester County and the Bronx, Bowman, the progressive Dem who lost his primary to George Latimer, posted on social media, \"I believe that @Tim_Walz or @AndyBeshearKY would make excellent running mates for VP Harris. Both are dedicated public servants who prioritize jobs, childcare, and public schools, which is exactly what we need.\"\n\nHarris and her pick for a No. 2 -- whoever it may be -- are set to appear together at a Philadelphia rally ahead of a five-day barnstorming tour of seven battleground states. -- Emily Ngo\n\nHOT(EL) BEDS OF CRIME?: The Police Benevolent Association is endorsing the City Council bill to license hotels, saying it would \"enhance safety\" -- but hotel owners are pushing back, arguing crime fears at their sites are overblown.\n\nFirst in Playbook, a PBA letter to lead sponsor Council Member Julie Menin cites hotels as the location of more than 14,000 criminal complaints over the past five years -- and notes that's \"only a fraction\" of the 911 calls that don't result in charges.\n\nThe politically conservative rank-and-file union is aligning with the more liberal Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and the Hotel Trades Council to back the controversial bill. The influential union wants leverage for its workers in upcoming labor negotiations.\n\nMenin's legislation has 29 cosponsors, ranging from Democratic Socialist Alexa Avil\u00e9s to Republican Joann Ariola.\n\nWell-heeled opponents -- who have threatened a $20 million lobbying campaign to defeat the bill -- are using the same data to craft a contradictory safety argument.\n\nThe rate of complaints at hotels is about equal to that of supermarkets and fast food restaurants, and less than clothing stores, according to a memo shared with Playbook compiled by the Hotel Association of New York City, suggesting hotels are being unfairly targeted. Complaints rose along with the general crime rate in 2020 and 2021 but dropped last year to 2015 rates. That corresponded with a swath of hotels being taken off the market and converted to homeless shelters, however.\n\nAnd first in Playbook, the American Hotel and Lodging Association sent a letter to the five city DAs who endorsed the bill making the same points -- that there's no hotel crime wave, and further regulation would kill the industry. -- Jeff Coltin\n\nFOILED BY FOIL: The Adams administration has a bad habit of endlessly delaying Freedom of Information Law requests -- so maybe it's no surprise that Mayor Eric Adams attacked the New York City Campaign Finance Board for releasing a public document that made him look bad.\n\n\"I'm really disappointed this report was leaked,\" Adams said Monday about the draft audit report of his 2021 campaign that Gothamist reported was not leaked but in fact provided in response to a FOIL request.\n\nThe semi-independent NYCCFB declined to comment after Adams called it \"unfair\" that the draft was released before his campaign formally responded. The audit highlighted mountains of reporting errors that could result in nearly $3 million in penalties, but the campaign has the chance to address them.\n\nState records law says an agency \"may deny access\" to records based on a \"particularized and specific justification,\" but none of the listed exceptions would appear to apply to communications between the CFB and a campaign. -- Jeff Coltin\n\nMore from the city:\n\n-- The Adams administration has no new classes ready for disabled preschool-age students ahead of the next school year -- despite his promise to give them all spots. (POLITICO Pro)\n\n-- The wife of Tarik Sheppard, a top NYPD official with close ties to the mayor, was quietly hired to a six-figure job leading communications for DYCD. (New York Post)\n\n-- Outdoor dining will be decimated by new regulations, as just under 2,600 restaurants applied -- a nearly 80 percent drop from the program's peak. (Hell Gate)\n\n-- The identity of the correction officer who is named in 24 cases of alleged sexual abuse of woman detainees on Rikers Island is uncovered. (Gothamist)\n\nSOLITARY REPORT: State prison officials need to do a better job tracking their compliance with a law meant to limit the use of solitary confinement, a report by Inspector General Lucy Lang released Monday found.\n\nThe assessment of the law, known as the HALT Act, gave fodder for left-leaning criminal justice advocates who have decried how the state has implemented the measure.\n\nBut the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision pledged to improve its record keeping.\n\nLang's report found prison officials had trouble producing records that identify all people held in confinement since the law was enacted. Data was also lacking when it came to the duration of solitary confinement, out-of-cell recreation time and the verification of misbehavior reports.\n\nThe HALT Act was a key criminal justice law change won by Democratic lawmakers in 2021 -- part of a suite of reforms to the prison system.\n\n\"Modernizing DOCCS' recordkeeping systems is essential to enhance transparency and improve our ability, as well as that of other oversight bodies, to monitor compliance with HALT,\" Lang said.\n\nAgency spokesperson Tom Mailey referred Playbook to its response included in the report.\n\n\"While the department has established a long-term goal of delivering increased technology to staff, which would allow for more electronic record keeping, our housing units are not wired nor do they have connectivity to the DOCCS network, which we are beginning to explore, however, would be a costly and time-consuming endeavor,\" the department said.\n\nCriminal justice reform advocates have become increasingly impatient over what they believe has been a delay in the rollout of the requirements.\n\n\"Solitary confinement is torture,\" Jerome Wright, the co-director of the #HALTSolitary Campaign, said. \"It leads to psychosis, heart disease, self-harm, suicide, and death.\" -- Nick Reisman\n\nMore from Albany:\n\n-- Hochul is convening a global energy summit as the state's climate goals are being called into question. (Times Union)\n\n-- A charitable organization co-founded by Adams' brother auctioned off a dinner with the mayor during a Hamptons fundraiser over the weekend. (New York Post)\n\nFIRST IN NY PLAYBOOK -- After it was revealed on Sunday that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had dumped a dead bear in Central Park more than a decade ago, MoveOn launched a petition addressed to Mayor Eric Adams, Comptroller Brad Lander, Bragg, the City Council and NYPD demanding a city investigation. It calls for RFK Jr. to \"be fined and held responsible for any wasted resources originally spent by the NYPD investigating this incident and by the city for sanitizing the park and disposing of the bear cub.\"\n\nAs of Monday night, the petition has gotten almost 4,000 signatures. Bragg's office on Monday declined to comment on the incident.\n\nHe's not going to face charges from the state. CBS News reported that a \"spokesperson for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation told WCBS' John Doyle that RFK Jr. will not face charges in the 2014 incident, saying the investigation did not uncover sufficient evidence to determine if violations occurred. 'The statute of limitation was one year, which has long expired,' the spokesperson said.\" -- Daniel Lippman\n\nMAKING MOVES: Disha Banik is now head of partnerships, reports and comms for the U.N.

Himself?", "body": "(Editor's Note: The following opinion column does not constitute an endorsement of any political party or candidate on the part of Newsmax.)\n\nDonald Trump and Kamala Harris may be rivals for the White House, but they're not exactly competing in the same race.\n\nHarris is running against Trump.\n\nTrump is running against everybody -- against her, against his fellow Republicans, against pro-lifers and Project 2025, and ultimately against the most formidable opponent of all: himself.\n\nElections are like word-association games or the conditioning used by scientists to get dogs salivating at the sound of a bell.\n\nVoters have an instant emotional reaction to candidates based on how they feel about the events they've been involved with.\n\nThis plays to Harris' advantage: Like most vice presidents, she's been a non-entity, hardly more visible as VP than she was before Joe Biden put her on his ticket four years ago.\n\nHer earlier record as the most left-wing senator in the nation and a downright authoritarian attorney general of California might trouble voters, if they knew anything about it.\n\nThen again, knowing isn't enough -- images and emotional resonances are far stronger.\n\nTrump supporters know this:\n\nThey feel a surge of pride whenever they recall the image of Trump standing and raising his fist in defiance after an assassin's bullet came within an inch of ending his life.\n\nYet Trump has been a fixture of presidential politics, either in office or seeking it, for nine years now, and voters had formed long-term associations with his name well before the attempt to murder him.\n\nFor grassroots Republicans, those Pavlovian associations are overwhelmingly favorable, which is why few were prepared to listen to intellectual arguments about policy or electability from Ron DeSantis or any other rival in the primaries.\n\nOrdinary Americans have happy memories of Trump's years in the White House -- but they also recall the endless drama of the media's Russian collusion obsession, Trump's firing of the FBI director and the subsequent independent counsel investigation, two impeachment trials, and an inexhaustible supply of lesser controversies.\n\nThe Trump years were peaceful and prosperous, but they ended with COVID and riots, those of summer 2020 and at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThat mix of associations, good and bad, played well in comparison to the feelings President Biden brought out -- feelings of shame at the debacle that was withdrawal from Afghanistan, embarrassment at seeing the president's obviously impaired condition, anger over out-of-control inflation and illegal immigration, and anxiety about wars in Europe and the Holy Land that Biden was unfit to tackle.\n\nHarris, on the other hand, is an empty canvas.\n\nAnd all Trump's baggage -- an emotional burden on voters -- stands out vividly in contrast.\n\nEveryone, even Trump's supporters, has episodes from the Trump years they would rather forget.\n\nHarris is selling herself as a way to erase the painful memories and replace them with nothing but media-manufactured good feelings -- a sugar pill.\n\nHow does Trump counter that?\n\nNot by renewing his feud with Brian Kemp, the popular Republican governor of battleground Georgia, yet that's what Trump did at his Atlanta rally last Saturday.\n\nGeorgia is the only one of the five states that flipped from Trump to the Democrat between 2016 and 2020 that has a Republican governor today.\n\nWhen Trump won the crucial Rust Belt states of Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016, both had Republican governors, as did the most hotly contested Sun Belt state, Arizona.\n\nToday, those key pieces of the electoral map all have Democrats in their highest office -- putting Georgia at risk too is gratuitous.\n\nPro-lifers and movement conservatives have long felt conflicted about Trump, whose behavior and stated positions often don't align with their principles, even though his policies as president were greatly beneficial for their causes.\n\nThe Trump campaign has answered their unease by watering down the GOP's pro-life plank at the convention and denouncing the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 in the weeks afterward.\n\nWhile her friends in the media have rallied to Harris, creating a sense of not only Democratic unity but widespread enthusiasm for the blank slate VP, Trump's advisers have picked fights that weaken the right's morale.\n\nHarris might not entirely escape the gravitational suck of the Biden-Harris administration's record.\n\nAnd the stock market's troubles are bad for the incumbent party in the White House, even with Harris replacing Biden as the nominee.\n\nAn effective attack would also tie Harris in voters' minds to their feelings about California, once America's promised land of postwar prosperity, now losing population as the middle class flees an unaffordable single-party state whose Democrat-run cities are sunk in homelessness and crime.\n\nMake America great again, or make America California now?\n\nTrump can regain the momentum he's lost since the convention -- but only if he defines Harris in voters' minds, so he's running directly against her, not his party, his allies and himself.\n\nDaniel McCarthy, a recognized expert on conservative thought, is the editor-in-chief of Modern Age: A

Trump can still win it, but he seems intent on reminding people they do not like him.\n\nThis week at the National Association of Black Journalists, Trump confronted hostile questions and pushed back. The reporters, increasing enemies to anyone not on the left, do not matter. Trump, however, decided to double down on Harris not being a black American. After the event, at a rally, he put on a screen that Harris claimed to be the first Indian American in the Senate. So?\n\nHarris's mother is an Indian immigrant. Harris' father descends from a family of slave owners in Jamaica. But all of that is a distraction. Trump loves to get distracted by distractions. Those distractions play well to his base, but not to anyone else. Every second spent arguing over just how black Kamala Harris is is a wasted opportunity not focused on Harris's record, her rush away from her former positions, the border situation she oversaw, the Afghan withdrawal, her coverup of Joe Biden's mental decline, etc. There are less than 100 days until the election and Trump may just lack the discipline to focus.\n\nThe concern, of course, is that if Trump craters, he can also hand the House of Representatives to the Democrats and help the Democrats keep the Senate. Senate Democrats are increasingly vocal they want to abandon the filibuster, which would allow unchecked opportunities to progressively transform America. The election is bigger than Trump, but explaining that to Trump is an impossible task.\n\nFor a month, Trump showed remarkable discipline. As Joe Biden cratered after the debate and Democrats panicked, Trump kept his mouth shut. Democrats stewed. When Trump spoke during that time, he stayed focused. After getting shot, Trump even let the Democrats descend into crazy conspiracy land over whether or not he got shot. He let the madness play out on the left.\n\nThen, he snapped out of the discipline. On impulse and pressure from his son, he picked J.D. Vance, perhaps the weakest possible pick for Vice President. Then he gave a long and rambling and undisciplined speech at the Republican National Committee that many Americans gave up on and tuned out. Once the Democrats turned to Harris, Trump was fully back to a campaign with no real message. Given the choice between a man they know they hate and a woman they don't know, Americans will go with the unknown. So make Harris known and do it quickly.\n\nRemarkably, Democrats have been able to define Vance faster than the GOP can define Harris. There is no use screaming about how unfair the media is. They always have been unfair and even in their unfairness, Trump was beating Biden.\n\nTrump can still win. He just might still win. He has a path to victory that is still more expansive than Harris' path. The polling, for now, is back where it was before the June debate. The vice presidential pick will fade in consequence. But there are less than 100 days. Every aspect of the campaign needs to be disciplined and polished, but the Republicans seem to have been completely surprised by a Harris swap that every Republican was predicting in February.\n\nHarry Sisson is a progressive TikTok influencer. Until the moment Biden got out, Sisson insisted there was nothing wrong and everyone he knew would be voting for Biden. In the face of disaster, Sisson has insisted the light at the end of the tunnel was the sun, not a fast-approaching train. Too many Trump supporters are becoming like Sisson. Yes, Trump can win. But not everything he does is helpful. Doubling down on Harris' race instead of her record is a boneheaded move the Harry Sissons of the right might savor but everyone else knows is a distraction with a ticking clock counting down to early voting.", "source": {"uri": "heraldextra.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Americans", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Americans"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Black_Journalists", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Association of Black Journalists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filibuster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

According to Survey USA, Harris earns the support of 48% of likely voters while Trump earns the backing of 45%.

According to Theodoridis, 66% of Democrats say they are more enthusiastic about voting in November now that Harris is the presumptive nominee.\n\nThe Survey USA results which also show Harris in the lead, found some intricate demographic differences in likely voter opinions. Former President Trump leads among men by 12 points while Harris leads among women by 18 points, revealing an overall 30-point gender gap.\n\nThe findings track with other recent surveys that show Harris with a narrow lead, albeit one within most polls' margin of error.

Taking to his social media platform, Truth Social, on Monday right before Harris announced her running mate, Trump wrote, \"Food is now at an all time high because of Kamabla/Biden INCOMPETENCE.\" He also went on to refer to Harris as \"Kambala\" in other posts.\n\nThe nickname has incited backlash on social media, with users labeling it as racist. One user criticized Trump's juvenile approach to politics, while another suggested that his strategy might only appeal to a racist demographic. The use of this moniker is seen by some as an attack on Harris's Indian heritage. Trump had sparked controversy last month when he disclosed that he doesn't care if he mispronounced the name of his political rival.\n\nIn addition to the nicknames, Trump and his allies have been accused of using race-gender-patriotism-childless tropes against Harris. They have deliberately mispronounced her name and labeled her a \"nasty woman,\" echoing past attacks against strong female figures like Hillary Clinton. Furthermore, they have scrutinized her dating history and questioned her qualifications, despite Harris's extensive public office experience.\n\nMeanwhile, many recent polls have shown the vice president pulling ahead of Trump in the fight for the White House. Harris led Trump by three points, 48%-45%, according to SurveyUSA; Morning Consult put Harris up four points, 48%-44%; YouGov and CBS News made it a one-point Harris lead, 50%-49%; and University of Massachusetts Amherst put Harris up three, 46%-43%.\n\nHarris is vying for the Oval Office, with Tim Walz of Minnesota as her running mate.

The trip also marks her seventh visit to the commonwealth this year and the 17th since she was sworn in as vice president in 2021.\n\nDuring the event, Harris will introduce her running mate, although it still remains unclear who that will be. She has reportedly narrowed her choice down to two candidates: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nThe Harris campaign is touting enthusiasm in Pennsylvania, saying that more than 33,000 people have signed up to volunteer for the campaign in the commonwealth in just the last 15 days, according to a news release signed by Jack Doyle, Pennsylvania communications director. The campaign has nearly 300 staffers across 36 offices, including in swing counties like Erie, Luzerne, and Northampton. The campaign said it is also working to make inroads in historically Republican areas in Union, Lancaster and York counties.\n\nThe campaign also said that Harris is \"barnstorming\" Pennsylvania while former President Trump, her main opponent in November's election, is \"struggling to keep up.\" It said Trump's campaign \"lags far behind in the infrastructure needed to win with just three offices in Pennsylvania\" and has \"shown he doesn't want these voters.\"\n\nTrump survived an assassination at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 and said he would return there for another rally in the future. He held a rally in Harrisburg last week.\n\nThe vice president is looking to show a contrast between herself and the former president in Pennsylvania, with her campaign saying she is \"fighting for our freedoms, democracy and an economy that provides everyone the opportunity to not just get by, but get ahead\" while \"Trump's toxic Project 2025 agenda would take our country backward by enacting a national abortion ban, raising costs for the middle class, and giving Trump virtually unchecked power.\"\n\nProject 2025 is a controversial initiative organized by conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation that was authored by a number of conservatives, including some former Trump administration officials.\n\nThe initiative offers right-wing policy recommendations for Trump should he win the presidency, including replacing civil service employees with Trump loyalists, abolishing the Department of Education, criminalizing pornography, eliminating DEI programs, cutting funding for Medicaid and Medicare, rejecting abortion as health care and infusing the government with Christian values.\n\nTrump has sought to distance himself from the initiative, which has been criticized as being an authoritarian and Christian nationalist plan that would undermine civil liberties, saying he knows nothing about it, that parts of it are \"absolutely ridiculous and abysmal\" and that its backers are on the \"radical right.\"\n\nThis is the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, giving states the power to make their own laws on abortion access. The Harris campaign cited polling showing that a majority of Pennsylvania voters support some abortion access.\n\n\"Vice President Harris will ensure women have the power to make decisions about their own bodies once again,\" her campaign said in a news release. \"That contrast will be front and center here\" in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Harris campaign also said the Trump administration killed more than 275,000 jobs in Pennsylvania, including thousands of manufacturing jobs, and oversaw record-high unemployment.\n\nIt said Harris and President Biden inherited an economy \"left in shambles\" by Trump but that she helped create more than half a million jobs in Pennsylvania and capped prescription drug costs for millions of Pennsylvania residents on Medicare.\n\nTouting her previous experience as a prosecutor in California, Harris' campaign said she is committed to keeping communities safe and locking up dangerous crooks, criminals and predators. The campaign said the murder rate in Pennsylvania, particularly Philadelphia, soared during the Trump administration while Harris \"has taken on the gun lobby and helped bring a historic drop in violent crime.\"\n\n\"If Trump gets a second term, he will once again cozy up to the NRA and make it easier for weapons to get into the hands of convicted criminals,\" the campaign said in the news release.\n\nThe campaign also highlighted the electoral losses Trump and his endorsed candidates have suffered in Pennsylvania in 2018, 2020 and 2022. The campaign pointed to Trump's loss to Biden in 2020, as well as Republican Mehmet Oz's 2022 loss to now-Democrat Sen. John Fetterman and Republican Doug Mastriano's 2022 loss to now-Democrat Gov. Shapiro.\n\n\"Republicans, too, lost ground in every corner of the Commonwealth as reproductive freedom and protecting our democracy were front and center for voters,\" the Harris campaign said in the news release. \"And reasonable Republicans across the commonwealth continue to reject Trump, with more than 158,000 people voting against Trump in the Pennsylvania Republican primary, nearly two months after Nikki Haley dropped out of the race.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

There is a noticeable split by county: Nassau County residents give Harris a 3-percentage point lead while Suffolk gives Trump a 14-point edge.\n\nIn a statewide poll, Harris quickly has pulled in support where Biden had been lagging, Siena pollster Don Levy said. Whereas Biden led Trump by 8 points statewide in June, Harris has jumped to a 14-point lead (53%-39%) in a Siena poll conducted separately, but simultaneously with the Island poll.\n\nThe statewide change is highlighted among suburban voters, which combines Long Island and the Hudson Valley: In June, Trump had a 13-point lead over Biden. Now, Harris and Trump are dead even at 47%.\n\nThe Newsday/Siena poll also asked Long Islanders their views on some key issues, finding they strongly support approving a statewide \"equal rights amendment,\" banning smartphones in schools and amending a law that capped state and local tax deductions on federal tax returns.\n\nThe poll also found a widening split -- by county -- over a casino proposed for the former Nassau Coliseum: Nassau residents oppose a casino by 7 percentage points, while their Suffolk neighbors support it by 22 points.\n\nThe survey of 507 likely voters in Nassau and Suffolk counties was conducted July 28 to Aug. 1. The margin of error is 6.1 percentage points, meaning the answers to any one question could vary higher or lower by that amount.\n\nNassau and Suffolk counties are running more in favor of Republicans than New York state as a whole.\n\nTrump has a 6-point lead over Harris in a head-to-head match. When Siena asked about minor-party candidates, the margin remained the same.\n\nAmong the others, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. received 7% support; Jill Stein of the Green Party, 2%; and Libertarian Chase Oliver, 1%.\n\nBy gender, Long Island men favored Trump over Harris, 58%-36%. Women favored Harris, 53%-43%.\n\nBy race, whites favored Trump, 53%-41%. All others favored Harris, 59%-39%.\n\nIra Calderon, 63, said he supports the Republican on the issues of the economy and the border.\n\n\"Personalities aside, [Trump's] policies blow away the policies of the Democrats,\" said Calderon, a Melville independent who generally supports Republicans.\n\nHarris supporters have their list of issues, too.\n\n\"Human rights, women's rights, climate change, gun safety. And abortion rights -- that's the top one,\" said Barbara Donato, 51, a Bohemia Democrat. \"Harris is going to reinstate abortion rights so everyone can get safe abortions.\"\n\nIn earlier Siena polls, Biden's lead over Trump in New York had steadily declined to the point where Republicans believed they could be within striking distance of winning the state for the first time in decades.\n\nThe entry of Harris has changed the momentum, Levy said.\n\n\"It jumps out at you, for sure,\" Levy told Newsday. \"For months, you were seeing Biden with a 12-point lead [statewide], then falling to 10 points to 8 points . . . But clearly it is a significant boost for the Democrats to go from 8 to 14.\"\n\nLevy said Trump's support stayed relatively flat. The difference in margin is because Harris is pulling back support \"from voters who had strayed from Biden.\"\n\n\"The voter who voted for Biden before but was now saying I don't know or I want someone else\" is voicing support for Harris, the pollster said.\n\nThe shift is best seen among Democratic voters and independents, Black people and women.\n\nIn June, Biden had the support of 75% of Democrats surveyed. Now, Harris has the support of 86%.\n\nAmong independents, Trump led Biden by 17 points. He's still ahead, but his margin over Harris is 7 points.\n\nRepublican votes haven't changed much; support for Trump runs in the mid- to high-80s.\n\nAmong women, whereas 51% in New York state supported Biden in June, 64% now say they support Harris.\n\nHarris is favored by 81% of Black voters; Biden's support was down to 59% in the previous Siena survey.\n\nNassau residents continue to oppose the idea of a casino at the old Nassau Coliseum: 51% opposed, 44% favor. The margin is unchanged from a November survey.\n\nIn contrast, favor among Suffolk residents grew from a modest 6 points last fall to 22.\n\n\"I believe New York is 40 years behind the times and we should have had casinos out here and in New York City,\" said Sean Marsar, 82, a Bethpage Republican. \"It's the future. It's the revenue . . . And it'll be a place for my wife to go, now and then.\"\n\nAlso, Long Islanders, by 65% to 26%, strongly favor a proposed \"equal rights amendment\" on the New York ballot this fall. Democrats said it would enshrine abortion rights and LGBT protections in the state constitution. Republicans have said it is unnecessary and could allow transgender females to compete in women's athletics.\n\nLong Islanders favor banning students from having smartphones in classrooms, 59% to 33%\n\nDonato, a former high school and now elementary teacher, supports a ban in the classroom, but said students should have access at, say, lunch time.\n\n\"I really saw the change\" when schools began allowing smartphones, she said, adding: \"From the teachers' point of view, I love the ban.\"\n\nIslanders also want some sort of restoration of the ability to deduct state and local taxes from federal taxes: 46% said all should be deductible, the way it was before Trump enacted a tax overhaul as president. Thirty-eight percent said the current deduction limit should be doubled to $20,000, and 12% said the current $10,000 limit should be kept.\n\nOn another issue, Gov. Kathy Hochul delayed the launch of \"congestion pricing,\" a proposal to hike tolls for driving into Manhattan by as much as $15 for certain areas and times to encourage mass transit use. About 70% of Islanders said it should be scrapped permanently, while 21% should it should be implemented.\n\nIn her reelection bid, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has a huge statewide lead -- 56% to 33% -- over Republican challenger Mike Sapraicone. On the Island, the margin is smaller: 49%-43% in favor of Gillibrand.\n\nNassau voters had a slightly negative view of Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman: 27% favorable, 29% unfavorable. Most (58%) said they didn't know Blakeman or had no opinion. Yet by a 48%-39% tally, they said the county was on the right track.\n\nIn contrast, Suffolk voters scored County Executive Edward P. Romaine better: 23% favorable, 15% unfavorable, 62% don't know/no opinion. Yet by a 44%-41% mark, more voters said the county was on the wrong track.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsday", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Newsday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Siena"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Siena"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassau_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nassau County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nassau County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suffolk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Suffolk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassau_Coliseum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nassau Coliseum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siena College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Rights_Amendment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equal Rights Amendment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Valley", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hudson Valley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Trump supporters know this:\n\nThey feel a surge of pride whenever they recall the image of Trump standing and raising his fist in defiance after an assassin's bullet came within an inch of ending his life.\n\nYet Trump has been a fixture of presidential politics, either in office or seeking it, for nine years now, and voters had formed long-term associations with his name well before the attempt to murder him.\n\nFor grassroots Republicans, those Pavlovian associations are overwhelmingly favorable, which is why few were prepared to listen to intellectual arguments about policy or electability from Ron DeSantis or any other rival in the primaries.\n\nOrdinary Americans have happy memories of Trump's years in the White House - but they also recall the endless drama of the media's Russian collusion obsession, Trump's firing of the FBI director and the subsequent independent counsel investigation, two impeachment trials, and an inexhaustible supply of lesser controversies.\n\nThe Trump years were peaceful and prosperous, but they ended with COVID and riots, those of summer 2020 and at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThat mix of associations, good and bad, played well in comparison to the feelings President Biden brought out - feelings of shame at the debacle that was withdrawal from Afghanistan, embarrassment at seeing the president's obviously impaired condition, anger over out-of-control inflation and illegal immigration, and anxiety about wars in Europe and the Holy Land that Biden was unfit to tackle.\n\nHarris, on the other hand, is an empty canvas.\n\nAnd all Trump's baggage - an emotional burden on voters - stands out vividly in contrast. Everyone, even Trump's supporters, has episodes from the Trump years they would rather forget.\n\nHarris is selling herself as a way to erase the painful memories and replace them with nothing but media-manufactured good feelings - a sugar pill.\n\nHow does Trump counter that? Not by renewing his feud with Brian Kemp, the popular Republican governor of battleground Georgia, yet that's what Trump did at his Atlanta rally last Saturday.\n\nGeorgia is the only one of the five states that flipped from Trump to the Democrat between 2016 and 2020 that has a Republican governor today.\n\nWhen Trump won the crucial Rust Belt states of Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016, both had Republican governors, as did the most hotly contested Sun Belt state, Arizona.\n\nToday, those key pieces of the electoral map all have Democrats in their highest office - putting Georgia at risk too is gratuitous.\n\nPro-lifers and movement conservatives have long felt conflicted about Trump, whose behavior and stated positions often don't align with their principles, even though his policies as president were greatly beneficial for their causes.\n\nThe Trump campaign has answered their unease by watering down the GOP's pro-life plank at the convention and denouncing the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 in the weeks afterward.\n\nWhile her friends in the media have rallied to Harris, creating a sense of not only Democratic unity but widespread enthusiasm for the blank-slate VP, Trump's advisers have picked fights that weaken the right's morale.\n\nHarris might not entirely escape the gravitational suck of the Biden-Harris administration's record.\n\nAnd the stock market's troubles are bad for the incumbent party in the White House, even with Harris replacing Biden as the nominee.\n\nAn effective attack would also tie Harris in voters' minds to their feelings about California, once America's promised land of postwar prosperity, now losing population as the middle class flees an unaffordable single-party state whose Democrat-run cities are sunk in homelessness and crime.\n\nMake America great again, or make America California now?\n\nTrump can regain the momentum he's lost since the convention - but only if he defines Harris in voters' minds, so he's running directly against her, not his party, his allies and himself.\n\nContent created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

I was finishing work on this newsletter when Vice President Kamala Harris leaked that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will be her running mate in the November election. I never thought I would write this, but for the last 15 days Harris and the Democrats have done everything right! The avuncular, good-humored Walz. with a progressive record of getting stuff done, will unite the party and win over blue-collar voters in the Upper Midwest that Harris needs to win. Fans of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who lost out, will get him for (probably) six more years in Harrisburg, where he can build a track record for 2032 when he'll be just 59, same age Harris is now.\n\nIf someone forwarded you this email, sign up for free here.\n\nFor a guy who got famous running casinos (and occasionally running them into the ground), Donald Trump seems like he'd be a lousy poker player. The election is almost here and the Republican nominee has been dealt a terrible hand -- steep drops in crime and migrant border crossings, and a strong economy despite this week's wobble -- and yet Trump is doubling down, even as the Dems' new deal of Kamala Harris has upped the ante.\n\nAnd last week in Harrisburg, Trump gave away his whole game with what poker watchers call \"a tell.\"\n\nHours earlier, the 45th and wannabe 47th president was in Chicago, in a rare and often heated Q-and-A session with three African American woman reporters on a stage before the annual confab of the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ). In a stunning moment that instantly went viral, Trump responded to a question about his attacks on his newly minted fall rival, Vice President Kamala Harris by questioning her racial background.\n\n\"I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now, she wants to be known as Black,\" Trump told the NABJ. He pronounced the word \"Black\" like it had two or maybe three syllables, a verbal blackboard screech in case you weren't paying attention. \"So, I don't know, is she Indian or is she Black?\"\n\nThe attendees gasped or laughed awkwardly at the absurdity, since Harris has embraced the heritage of both her Black Jamaican father and Indian mother since birth, and attended an historically Black university, Howard. long before Trump knew about her. Was this a gaffe from a 78-year-old candidate prone to weird off-topic rambles? Or was this the new strategy from a GOP campaign caught flat-footed as Harris seamlessly replaced President Joe Biden on the ticket?\n\nIt was strategy.\n\nMore than 600 miles east in the Pennsylvania capital, as MAGA diehards filed into the Farm Show complex arena, a slide show on the big screen showed a 2016 headline from the Business Insider: \"California's Kamala Harris becomes the first Indian-American US Senator.\" Wow, how nice of Team Trump to salute his opponent's barrier-busting achievement. Wait, no....actually the campaign was amplifying the new message from Chicago -- the ludicrous, false suggestion that Harris didn't really claim to be Black until she could benefit politically.\n\nMoments later, one of Trump's closest associates, his criminal attorney Alina Habba, took the stage in Harrisburg. After mispronouncing \"Kamala,\" as Trump himself and many of his surrogates frequently do, Habba proclaimed, energetically: \"I'm going to speak to you, Miss Harris! I am a strong woman, a mom, a lawyer, and an American. And unlike you, Kamala, I know who my roots are! I know where I come from!\" Yes, Habba comes from two parents who -- just as with Harris -- are immigrants, who fled religious persecution as Catholics in Saddam Hussein's Iraq just before Habba was born in 1984. That might have undermined her message: that a Black woman of South Asian descent who proudly rose to become a U.S. senator and vice president is somehow not who she says it is.\n\nBut with the November election less than 100 days away, Trump just slammed all of his cards on the table. He doesn't even have a pair of 2s. Just the race card. Just a plan to never let a day pass without reminding voters that none of the previous 45 presidents (Cleveland twice) looked remotely like Harris. To convince as many as 81 million voters that they are \"the real Americans,\" that no one would ever be confused about their race or their background.\n\nIt's hard to say what's more depressing: that playing the combo of the race card and the gender card is pretty much what elected Trump in 2016, when something as silly as constant doubt about a nothingburger scandal around Hillary Clinton's private email server was really their backdoor way for voters to channel their doubts about electing a woman, and to take out their anxieties with furious chants of \"Lock her up!\" Or that it might just work again in 2024, even after millions of voters from the segregated 1950s have been replaced with Gen Z young adults who either went to school with people who look like Harris -- and Habba -- or who look like them themselves.\n\nHarris has been the Democratic candidate for a remarkable two weeks in which she has electrified a Democratic Party long depressed over Biden's prospects, while packing arenas, raising hundreds of millions of dollars, and benefitting from massive Zoom calls of voters pledging even more dollars or to knock on doors. Yet all that energy has merely pulled the vice president into a dead heat. There's still a 50% chance that Trump's toxic ramblings could return him to the Oval Office.\n\nIt seems like Wednesday's conscious decision to play the race card came after 10 days of Harris momentum and the growing realization that this is all he's got. Trump's never been an issues guy, but crime and unauthorized border crossing are way down in 2024 and even the economy doesn't feel the potent weapon it was a year ago. Trump hasn't even thought up a good nickname for Harris! But he can fib to voters that she just now claims to be \"Buh-lack.\" He probably hopes this new Big Lie about Harris' identity will even peel of some Latino and, yes, Black voters.\n\nNo one -- not even the often risible Trump -- makes it to the lofty perch of the presidency without some kind of special power. In his case, it's the diabolical ability of the huckster to tell regular folks that everything might look OK but really there is trouble right here in River City, that something not quite American is in the air and that he alone can fix it. After a couple of pointless flirtations with more conventional politics, Trump realized around 2012 that baseless questions about Barack Obama's birth certificate were really a vehicle for voters to express their unease with a Black president, and he has never stopped peddling this brand of Trump Vodka that intoxicates voters' very worst instincts.\n\nBiden became the only politician so far to defeat Trump with this 2020 mantra that \"this is not who we are,\" implying that his sometimes buffoonish, sometimes dangerous presidency was a betrayal of Gettysburg, Omaha Beach, Selma and the spirit of 1776. But Trump knows that America is also Wilmington, Tulsa, the KKK and the 3/5ths Compromise, and he's is gambling on that America to put him over the top. We'll see. Team Harris is betting that the 2020s is a whole new game, and that in this one the race card can be easily trumped.\n\nQuestion: Do we just not care anymore that Supreme Court Justices go on Fox News and offer their thoughts on policy issues that might end up before them?? -- a tweet from @asharangappa_ that was forwarded by reader @theolddelewis on X/Twitter\n\nAnswer: It was kind of lost in the endless veep speculation, but the question refers to Justice Neil Gorsuch, who went on the highly partisan Fox News Channel for an unusual free-ranging TV interview that included his negative comments on President Joe Biden's recent call for major reforms at the High Court. Those would include term limits for justices like Gorsuch, named by Donald Trump in 2017. Gorsuch warned liberal reformers to \"be careful\" -- a shocking threat from a jurist who, as Rangappa, a former FBI agent, noted might later rule on the legality of the proposed reforms. I believe that SCOTUS members should continue to speak on the broad judicial issues facing America in appropriate forums, but Gorsuch's comments on a specific bill, on Fox, were wildly inappropriate. It's exactly why Congress needs to pass a real code of ethics for the High Court that Gorsuch and the others are resisting.\n\nThis may or may not shock you, but not a single respondent to an informal poll initiated by this Pennsylvania-based newsletter thought that Pennsylvania's governor, Josh Shapiro, should be the Democrats' pick for vice president (although one writer endorsed him for attorney general in a Harris administration). My informal tally of the readers who used \"veep pick\" as subject line (otherwise, I'm not able to find it) put up six votes for Tuesday's pick Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, four for Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, two for Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and one for Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear. Joe Sundeen wrote that Walz \"has savaged [JD] Vance with humor (the originator of the weird meme), facts, and a record of governing that would reassure moderates...\" Kelly backer Merle Savedow spoke for many by saying \"Shapiro has too much baggage.\"\n\n\ud83d\udceeThis week's question: Now that Harris has finally made her pick of Walz, who would you put up there with JD Vance as the worst VP candidates of all time? Who would you rate the best? For a chance to be featured in my newsletter, email me your answer. Please put \"Best/worst VPs\" in the subject line.\n\nWhen your obsession is 1960s/'70s U.S. history, the last 11 years have been a non-stop spree of 50th anniversary parties (this, this, and this meant a lot). Thursday marks the end of this era with a biggie: a half-century since Richard Nixon announced he was resigning the presidency. I was a 15-year-old dork who'd inhaled every twist and turn of Watergate, just devoured the new book All the President's Men at the village pool, and saw that day's rumors that Nixon was about to become the first (and still only) U.S. president to resign as the political equivalent of the 1969 moonwalk. My dad was in Atlanta on business, but several of my mom's friends swung by to pour a drink as we watched on a small black-and-white TV that marked a not very prosperous decade. I watched the speech, then a canned Nixon bio film (probably prepared in case he got shot like so many others in that era) and only went to bed when \"The Star Spangled Banner\" came on around 2 a.m. or so. I wanted to never forget Aug. 8, 1974 -- and I never have.\n\nEven as a teen, I understood that America was forever changed. But changed...for good? The story that we told ourselves in order to live was that taking down Nixon (and criminally convicting most of his \"men\") was the imperfectly happy ending to \"the Long Sixties,\" the best justice obtainable for the crimes of Vietnam, Kent State, and the killing of everyone from RFK Sr. to Fred Hampton. It was pretty to think so, but the exposure of a criminal enterprise run from the White House to bug, burglarize, and play dirty tricks on Nixon's political enemies should have sparked some type of political revolution. Yet few rose to meet the moment. There were other stunning revelations about what the CIA, FBI, and other agencies had been up to, but the reforms to address them were tepid and, over time, ineffectual. Campaign finance reform? You know how that worked out. Gerald Ford's September 1974 pardon of Nixon was a clue that actually, yes, maybe the president actually is above the law.\n\nWatergate, the pardon, and the fall of Saigon and everything else that went haywire in Nixon's America engendered a massive distrust of government and eventually other institutions that has lasted to this day. Young people mostly decided you couldn't change the world but you could ironically make fun of it on shows like Saturday Night Live, which launched in October 1975. The sliver who did dream of making things better were convinced by All the President's Men's Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein that you could do it with a keyboard. Yes, we were that naive.\n\nIt took six short years for Americans to decide what we really wanted was a kinder, gentler version of Nixonian hubris. Ronald Reagan was a genial and optimistic actor who knew to stand on the right marks while making the rich richer and the poor poorer. The problems of Vietnam were solved by reinventing a military that could kill the enemy with robots instead of drafting young men. But the most consequential decision in the days that followed Watergate was turning our anger into cynicism instead of action -- the national zeitgeist that a demagogue like Donald Trump would inevitably exploit. The dream of Aug. 8, 1974 was more of an illusion than an idealistic teenager could ever have imagined.\n\nLike most folks, I usually try to block out, or forget, what the worst of what dealing with the pandemic was like. Today, with another presidential campaign underway, there's a lot of focus on nutty things that Donald Trump said or did in 2020. I was interested, then, to find this piece from four years ago today that didn't exactly absolve Trump, but noted the overlapping crises of capitalism and bad governance that ran much deeper than the 45th president were really what made COVID-19 worse for the underprivileged. I wrote: \"If America changes only at the top in January and not from top to bottom, if there isn't a mass movement to get rid of 'killer' hospitals and soul-crushing schools and overstuffed prisons and the systemic racism that undergirds all of them, then our nation will have learned nothing from our near-death experience.\" Read the rest: \"2020 defeated America because of Americans, not just

List of Important States in the 2024 Presidential Election", "body": "2024 Presidential Election Minnesota: Minnesota, the home of the Twins, Timberwolves, Vikings, and Wild, has suddenly gained even more notoriety in politics after Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris included state governor Tim Walz on her ticket. There are a lot of different reasons for this, but one of the main ones is probably that this is one of the places that will probably determine who becomes president in January of next year.\n\nIt's safe to say that we could probably predict with some degree of certainty how some US states will vote. Pollsters concur that the states that will determine the outcome of the election are Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin; Minnesota is also regarded as one, despite its Democratic leanings. That may no longer be a topic of discussion due to the Walz ruling.\n\nList of Congress Democrats Call on Joe Biden to End Election Campaign\n\nDepending on its size, each state receives a varied amount of weight under the US Electoral College system. With 29 of the 538 swing votes available nationwide, Florida is the most valuable of the swing states. In contrast, Wyoming has a value of only three. Ten electoral votes are held by Minnesota.\n\nLocated near the western edge of the Great Lakes, Minnesota has historically been a Democratic state; the last Republican to win there was Richard Nixon in 1972. Democrats have won a lot, but their triumphs have always been narrow; since 2008, there have been no double-digit margins. The margin of victory for Hillary Clinton in 2016 was only 1.5 percentage points, but in 2020, Biden increased it to more than 7 points.\n\nHarris' choice might energize the Democratic base and increase her appeal in the Midwest.\n\nA Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll conducted at the end of July, following Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race, showed that Kamala Harris had gained an edge over Republican nominee Donald Trump in six of seven key swing states.\n\nWhat Would a Kamala Harris Presidency Mean for Student Loan Holders? Potential Forgiveness Plans\n\nThe poll revealed that Harris led Trump by 11 percentage points in Michigan. In Arizona, Wisconsin, and Nevada, she was slightly ahead by 2 points. Trump held a 4-point lead over Harris in Pennsylvania and a 2-point lead in North Carolina. In Georgia, the candidates were tied.\n\nCompared to earlier polling with Biden, Trump's lead in Wisconsin over Harris has decreased, indicating a shift in voter sentiment in that state.", "source":

Vance in the firing line and acres of newsprint celebrating Joe Biden's decision to step aside, the Trump campaign couldn't believe its luck when Kamala Harris finally plumped for Tim Walz, a governor little known outside his home state of Minnesota.\n\nInsiders say it gives them the chance to get back on offense after weathering a difficult two weeks.\n\n'Thank you,' was Donald Trump's two-word verdict on Truth Social.\n\nBehind the scenes, his allies could not hide their jubilation that Harris picked a governor with a liberal voting record from a state that has been solidly Democratic since 1972.\n\nThey quickly went on the attack, chewing over his voting record and the way that Minnesota was rocked by Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris announced Tuesday that Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota will be her running mate. The decision cheered Trump allies who have been on the back foot\n\nTheir fear had been that she would lock up the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania by plumping for its centrist governor, Josh Shapiro.\n\n'Instead of picking the candidate with charisma and a moderate record, Kamala caved to the Hamas caucus and picked a charisma black hole with a long record of supporting extreme liberal policies and a history of being close to China,' said a source close to the Trump campaign, before making a comparison with Hillary Clinton's losing 2016 ticket.\n\n'Walz is Tim Kaine all over again, he adds nothing to the ticket.'\n\nThe Trump campaign needed a fillip.\n\nAfter making the running all year, building potentially decisive leads in several swing states, it suddenly found itself under fire.\n\nTrump may have survived an assassination attempt and brought the party together at its convention in Milwaukee, but the good times ended when Biden finally announced his decision to step aside last month.\n\nThat decision did not usher in weeks of Democratic infighting as they had hoped. Instead Democrats united behind Vice President Harris, and turned its attention to Vance, the MAGA loyalist selected as Trump's running mate.\n\nHis busy history of fiery TV interviews and incendiary social media posts provided fodder for attack ads and negative headlines.\n\nTrump allies said they were shocked that Harris did not pick Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro\n\nTrump himself responded with a two-word post on his Truth Social website\n\nMeanwhile money poured into Harris from donors who had been reluctant to back Biden. Even the polls turned her way.\n\nAn average maintained by the FiveThirtyEight statistics site now puts her in the lead over Trump by 45.5 percent to 43.5 percent.\n\nDavid Urban, a Trump confidant whose base is Pennsylvania, said the real race begins now and described it as 'political malpractice' for Harris not to pick Shapiro.\n\n'He was the best political athlete in this draft class,' said Urban, who has known the governor for years.\n\nRather than a running mate who could help win the most important state in this year's contest, he said she had picked 'the progressives' wet dream.'\n\nAnd she had provided the Trump campaign with perfect chance o draw a line under the two weeks of missed opportunities and turbulence since Biden stepped aside.\n\n'Today ends marks the end of that period,' he said. 'Today begins reality for the now Harris-Walz ticket, the most progressive ticket in the United States since maybe Mondale-Ferraro.'\n\nThat pairing lost in a landslide to Reagan-Bush in 1984.\n\nVance himself was back on offense Tuesday, showing a spring in his step after two weeks of defending his own record.\n\n'They make an interesting tag team because Tim Walz allowed rioters to burn down Minneapolis in the summer of 2020, and the few that got caught, Kamala Harris helped bail them out of jail,' he told reporters traveling with him on his plane, Trump Force Two.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Donate today\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has a 14-point lead over former President Donald Trump among likely voters in New York, according to a Siena College poll released on Tuesday that shows the new Democratic candidate gaining ground over her Republican rival.\n\nIn the first public survey of likely New York voters taken since President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid last month, 53% of respondents said they back Harris, compared to 39% who support Trump.\n\n\"The change at the top of the Democratic ticket has had a noticeable, while not dramatic, effect on the horse race,\" Siena pollster Steve Greenberg said in a statement.\n\nTrump's numbers held steady since the previous Siena poll, conducted in late June. But Harris' showing surged compared to Biden, with new support coming primarily from Democratic and independent voters. Her 14-point lead is still notably smaller than Biden's margin of victory in the state in 2020.\n\nIn June, Siena found that Biden had just an eight-point lead over Trump among registered voters in New York, leading Republicans to wonder aloud whether the deep-blue state could go red for the first time since Ronald Reagan won in a national landslide in 1984.\n\nThe swing toward Harris could have a significant effect on down-ballot races, which will help determine which party takes control of the U.S. House of Representatives after the November election.\n\nCrucially for Democrats, the new poll showed Harris picking up support in the New York City suburbs, where Democrats and Republicans are battling over a handful of marginal districts that tipped the House to GOP control in 2022. In a head-to-head race, Harris is running even with Trump in the suburbs, 47-47%, according to Siena. That's a significant change from the college's June poll, whose results showed Trump crushing Biden in the same region, 48-35%.\n\nHarris' statewide lead over Trump shrinks slightly, to 49-37%, when Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and minor-party candidates are included, according to Siena. Kennedy, who is in the midst of an ongoing trial over his Westchester County residency that could knock him off the New York ballot, has support from 7% of likely New York voters polled.\n\nThe Democratic Party in New York has long relied on its presidential candidates to run up the score at the top of the ticket. That can create a trickle-down effect for the party's candidates down the ballot.\n\nThis year, Republican Reps. Anthony D'Esposito and Nick LaLota are facing stiff challenges from Democrats Laura Gillen and John Avlon, respectively, on Long Island. In the Hudson Valley, Republican Rep. Michael Lawler is facing a challenge from Democratic former Rep. Mondaire Jones, while Republican Alison Esposito is running against Democratic Rep. Pat Ryan.\n\nHarris' 14-point lead in the latest Siena poll trails what other Democratic candidates have put on the board in previous election cycles. In 2020, Biden defeated Trump by 23 percentage points in New York, which was slightly higher than Hillary Clinton's 22-point margin of victory in the state in 2016.\n\nSiena polled 1,199 likely New York state voters by phone from July 28 through Aug. 1, taking a representative sample designed to mimic the state's electorate across political party, gender, ethnicity, age and other attributes.

According to Survey USA, Harris earns the support of 48% of likely voters while Trump earns the backing of 45%. According to Umass Amherst, the vice president has a 46% to 43 % lead over the GOP candidate; in January, the same pollster found Trump leading President Joe Biden by 43% to 39%.\n\n\"The Harris campaign and the Democratic Party must like their chances to maintain control of the White House and to send former President Trump to his second consecutive defeat in his quest to return to Pennsylvania Avenue,\" Tatishe Nteta, co-director of the UMass Amherst poll, said in a statement.\n\n\"Harris' entry into the race has electrified Democrats,\" added UMass Amherst co-director Alexander Theodoridis. According to Theodoridis, 66% of Democrats say they are more enthusiastic about voting in November now that Harris is the presumptive nominee.\n\nThe Survey USA results which also show Harris in the lead, found some intricate demographic differences in likely voter opinions. Former President Trump leads among men by 12 points while Harris leads among women by 18 points, revealing an overall 30-point gender gap.\n\nThe findings track with other recent surveys that show Harris with a narrow lead, albeit one within most polls' margin of error.

It's awfully hard to construct an electoral map where Harris wins without it. A presidential ticket runs up to two percentage points better in the vice-presidential nominee's home state. And Shapiro was well-positioned to grab all of that since he has a 55 percent job approval rating and drew the support of 64 percent of independents and 16 percent of Republicans in his last race. Hence, Shapiro gets you Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania puts you on the doorstep of victory.\n\nThat's...a really good case. So, for Harris to go with Walz instead, there must have been other things on her mind. Of course, we can't know for sure, but we can read between the lines and make some pretty darn good deductions about what those are.\n\nDeduction number one: Pennsylvania is on track. When election forecaster Nate Silver recently projected Harris' chances in each state, he gave her only a 47 percent chance of winning Pennsylvania.\n\nBut that was five days ago, a lifetime in a 2024 election that has been lived inside a time warp worthy of a Christopher Nolan movie, where historic events barely get their moment in the sun before being supplanted by something else. In less than a week, Harris has gained substantial polling ground both nationally -- where she's risen by more than two points -- and in Pennsylvania, where she's risen by a point and a half and is now in the lead. And that's just in the public polls that we can see. The Harris campaign is privy to far more data.\n\nThat's not to say that the race in Pennsylvania is sewed up, but it is safe to presume that the Harris campaign is feeling much better about it right now. Indeed, if Harris had had to make this choice a week ago, the outcome might have been different. The fact that the Shapiro-helps-deliver-Pennsylvania case was no longer decisive means that the Keystone State must be looking a lot more solid. And that is good news for Democrats.\n\nDeduction number two: Walz is a weirdly good messenger. The message setup for Democrats couldn't be better in this race. Kamala Harris is a skilled, veteran prosecutor who has the chance to make the case of a lifetime against a convicted felon, serial fraudster, and adjudicated rapist who has ended up in court more than 4,000 times. And incredibly, a significant proportion of swing voters will be learning about all of this for the first time. Which is why Harris recently previewed a \"prosecutor-versus-the-perp\" narrative that had Democratic operatives drooling with anticipation.\n\nBut there's a catch-22. Political scientists have identified an ingrained bias against female candidates where voters have a hard time simultaneously seeing them as both warm and tough. And the more that women -- and particularly Black women -- use the kind of \"dominant language\" that, say, a former prosecutor attacking a convicted felon needs to use, the more that voters view them as \"less likable.\"\n\nIn other words, Kamala Harris is eminently qualified to make one of the great political cases of all time, but the best strategy for her is probably to have someone else do a lot of the lifting.\n\nEnter a politician who proved that he can go viral on attack, and make a single word soar 28 percent in Google searches with his line about Trump and Vance being \"weird.\" The book on Walz up to that moment was that he was an eyes-glazingly dry pol who gave off major dad vibes, while Shapiro was a polished former Attorney General who could wage deft verbal warfare.\n\nWalz must have made that column at least a tie by proving that he can shiv with a smile.\n\nThree: Consolidation is the straightest line to winning. Part of Shapiro's appeal was the brute force pathway to winning for Democrats: holding just the three \"Blue Wall\" states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, which gets them exactly the necessary 270 electoral votes.\n\nBut there's another way of looking at the math.\n\nSince President Biden dropped out of the race and Harris became the de facto nominee, she's risen 4.6 percentage points in polling averages, while Trump has fallen 1.8 points in that time. But the bulk of Harris' rise comes at the expense of third-party candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who has fallen 3.3 percent.\n\nWhat's going on? Consolidation. Harris is clawing back Democratic-leaning voters who were uncomfortable with Biden. According to Democratic polling firm Change Research \"Movement in Harris's direction is coming primarily from Kennedy supporters, those who didn't want to vote for any of the candidates on offer, and undecided voters\" and is fueled by the core Democratic constituencies of \"women, young voters, and voters of color.\"\n\nTo be sure, much of the swell of progressive opposition to Shapiro in recent days was unfair. Shapiro's position on the Israel-Hamas war is virtually the same as Walz's. His support for some school voucher programs didn't stop the teachers' unions from endorsing him. And his support for fracking is the same as liberal darling Sen John Fetterman's (D-PA). Besides, the whole point of trying to win moderates or Pennsylvanians is to have some positions that appeal to moderates and Pennsylvanians.\n\nBut the progressives might still have a point, too. They argued that keeping the consolidation momentum going is the most important winning ingredient, and that Walz does more to unify the Democratic base and keep grabbing back the Kennedy-curious than Shapiro. It is definitely true that Trump has done nothing in the past four years to win over new voters. So, it is plausible to say that re-assembling the Biden coalition, which Harris is well on the way to doing and which Walz advances, is the right move here. And again, it is highly likely that the Harris campaign had internal polling to back that up.\n\nFinally, let's not forget that Walz has a long, tested track record of winning in a tough, rural swing district and overperforming in a lean-blue state. So, it's not as if he's some lefty base-appeal play only.\n\nAll in all, picking him may not have been the obvious move.

Keeping the love going has been tougher.\n\nMs. Harris has surged past former President Donald Trump in polling as voters take a fresh look at the Democratic nominee, but her campaign is well aware that she was in a similar position in 2019 as she sought the presidential nomination. She squandered a July polling surge of support among primary voters by running a cautious campaign in a crowded field.\n\nAvoiding caution will be critical this year, said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center in Boston.\n\n\"The lesson that Harris must learn from 2019 is to accelerate her momentum with methodical granular campaign operations -- not assume her momentum is a wave she can easily ride indefinitely,\" he told The Washington Times. \"Her advisers may opt to protect a polling lead, but at some critical point in the next three months, she may have to follow her gut and abandon the advice of the older White guys who are currently consulting on her campaign.\"\n\nThe 2019 campaign was different for plenty of reasons, and the chaos of a lengthy and particular Democratic race contributed to Ms. Harris' collapse. She struggled to distinguish herself in a primary field with several other minority candidates and ideological choices, from Sen. Bernard Sanders on the left to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden.\n\nNow, she is in a three-month sprint to Election Day and faces just one opponent, Mr. Trump. She started the race with massive built-in support from committed Democrats. Her task now is to win and hold middle-of-the-road voters.\n\nSEE ALSO: Kamala Harris picks Tim Walz as her running mate, hopes to cash in on his Midwestern appeal\n\nIn conversations with political operatives and analysts about her primary campaign, two themes emerged: She was too cautious and was ill-served by her campaign team, which didn't have a national reach and was consumed by conflicts.\n\n\"The challenge is going to be internal rivalry and navigating the different elements of the Democratic Party and what that looks like,\" said David McCuan, a political scientist at Sonoma State University who has tracked Ms. Harris for years.\n\nYouGov/Economist polling showed Ms. Harris hovering at about 7% support among Democratic primary voters in June 2019, squarely in the middle tier. She seized a big opening in a primary debate where she zinged Mr. Biden, the front-runner, for his history of supporting segregationist policies that hurt Black children.\n\n\"That little girl was me,\" she said, delivering a rare one-line gem.\n\nBy early July, she had doubled her polling to 14% and was suddenly in the top tier. By August, her support slid to 8% and continued dropping. She bottomed out at 4% in late November and withdrew from the race on Dec. 3, 2019, well before the first primaries.\n\n\"Harris' July move was a blip, and she did virtually nothing to coordinate/connect the progress she had made and to build on her momentum,\" Mr. Paleologos said in an email. \"In fact, she became more cautious and would equivocate on nearly every major issue frustrating Democratic voters who saw other Democrats who were articulating crisper messages.\"\n\nRepublicans are expecting a repeat performance.\n\n\"Remember, in the 2020 Democrat primary, Harris dropped out a month before the first vote was even cast,\" Sen. J.D. Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, told supporters at a campaign rally in Nevada. \"She was so unpopular she polled in the single digits even among Democrats her entire campaign.\"\n\nMr. McCuan said Republicans shouldn't count on a collapse.\n\nHe said Ms. Harris has proved to be remarkably resilient in politics. She ousted the incumbent in San Francisco's 2002 district attorney's race. Running for attorney general in 2010, she quickly cleared the field of some key Democratic opponents and won a tough race against Republican Steve Cooley, the district attorney in Los Angeles.\n\nShe won California's open Senate seat in 2016 before pursuing her presidential campaign. Mr. Biden revived her ambitions by picking her as his running mate. Last month, after Mr. Trump chased Mr. Biden from the race, he anointed her as his successor.\n\n\"From attorney general to Senate, she learns on the fly how to be a better candidate,\" Mr. McCuan said. \"That gives her some momentum, some space, some visibility and some confidence.\"\n\nHe said the \"short runway\" of a three-month campaign gives her less time to wear thin. Plus, she was able to start fresh in areas that weren't working for Mr. Biden.\n\n\"That makes her really problematic if you're Donald Trump and Republicans,\" he said.\n\nMr. McCuan said he would watch how Ms. Harris handles looming flash points. She must be more nimble than the Biden team, he said.\n\nHe said she appears to have a good start with her early change of position on fracking.\n\nIn her ill-fated 2020 campaign, she supported the controversial oil extraction process. Now, according to her campaign, she has backed off the ban as she tries to court voters in swing-state Pennsylvania.\n\nMs. Harris also won plaudits from her party for her announcement Tuesday of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. Democrats saw it as a safe move that had some appeal to all corners of the Democratic coalition.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_dinan@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Stephen Dinan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hispanic whites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suffolk University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoma_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sonoma State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouGov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racial segregation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fracking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cooley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Cooley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

The poll showed Kamala Harris up by the barest of margins, but doing dramatically better than Joe Biden had been before he decided to step aside and endorse the vice president. The Donald Trump campaign team has cried foul over the poll conducted by CBS and YouGov and its results released Sunday. It has also been accused it of being manipulative. The poll showed Kamala Harris up by the barest of margins, but doing dramatically better than Joe Biden had been before he decided to step aside and endorse the vice president. Giving details of the opinion poll, CBS said that Kamala Harris has a 1-point edge nationally, President Joe Biden never had it, rather he was down by 5 points when he pulled out of the race. It also said that Harris and Donald Trump are tied across the collective battleground states.\n\nHowever, the Donald Trump campaign has said that the findings of the poll were the results of some funny math by pollsters and they do not reflect reality. Slamming the poll results, it said that the latest CBS/YouGov poll of registered voters nationwide showing margin-of-error shifts in the national head-to-head ballot between President Trump and Kamala Harris is entirely the result of a methodological decision allowing ideology to change significantly while maintaining weights on age, partisanship, and race to make the survey appear not to have been manipulated.\n\nAlso Read : How much is Snoop Dogg getting paid at the Olympics as a promotional figure?\n\nIt said further that of 3,092 registered voters contacted, only 35.5% identified themselves as conservatives, compared to 30.3% moderate voters and 30.2% liberal leaners, it was unfairly skewed to the left. Trump campaign's senior adviser Brian Hughes said the survey showed that the \"fake news media\" is trying its best to \"help dangerously liberal Kamala hide her record of economic failure and soft on crime policies.\"\n\nHowever, another survey conducted by I&I/TIPP shows Kamala Harris up by one point in a head-to-head matchup and by two points in a race including third-party alternatives, both within the 2.9-point margin of error.\n\nAlso Read : One Piece Chapter 1123: See release date, time, how to watch and what to expect\n\nWhat has the CBS/YouGov poll shown?\n\nThe CBS/YouGov poll showed Kamala Harris up by the barest of margins, but doing dramatically better than Joe Biden had been before he decided to step aside and endorse the vice president.\n\nWhat has Donald Trump's campaign said about the CBS/YouGov poll?\n\nThe Donald Trump campaign has said that the findings of the poll were the results of some funny math by pollsters and they do not reflect reality.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "YouGov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fake news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112327746,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-65434,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792426", "eventUri": "eng-9792426", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

It's been less than a month since Vice President Kamala Harris jumped from the understudy of the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket to the starring role. Now, polls show her tied with Republican nominee Donald Trump, and in some cases ahead, marking a heady turnaround for once-demoralized Democrats who now sense a chance to banish Trump for good.\n\nAnd just like that, the \"Trump trade\" has lost all momentum. The Trump trade is a set of investment choices premised on Trump winning a second presidential term, and, just as important, his party capturing both houses of Congress for complete Republican control of government. That would allow Trump to enact his agenda with minimal opposition from Democrats.\n\nThe basic premises for the Trump trade are that Trump would slash regulation, raise tariffs on imports, keep taxes low or cut them further, and ignore the mushrooming national debt. Higher tariffs are inflationary and might force the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher than they would be otherwise. So higher rates are core to the Trump trade. The economy might grow a bit faster once it mounts that inflationary hurdle. The national debt is a wild card because nobody's sure when the market will start to balk at unprecedented amounts of federal debt. But whenever that happens, rates are likely to go higher still.\n\nIf there's one single company that embodies the Trump trade, it's Trump's own -- Trump Media & Technology Group, which goes by the ticker DJT. Trump Media, whose main product is the Truth Social network, is almost a pure-play bet on Trump's election odds. If he wins, it could breathe life into a second-rate social network that has barely any revenue, since Trump will once again be the focus of world attention, routinely making news through his own posts on Truth Social. But if Trump loses, his political career will be mostly over, and Truth Social, puny compared with competitors such as Facebook and X, will have little reason to exist.\n\nSo how's DJT doing? Not so great. After going public in March, the stock peaked at $66. Then it tanked in the midst of Trump's New York business fraud trial, bottoming at $22 in mid-April. It yo-yoed after that, regaining ground as polls showed Trump widening his lead against Biden, even after Trump's convictions in New York. Since Biden withdrew on July 21 and Harris became the heir apparent, however, the stock has mostly fallen. It's now at $27, down 59% from the March peak and just $5 above the April bottom.\n\nOther Trump trades are less direct but still in retreat. Market watchers began spotting signs of the Trump trade in mid-July, when Biden was at his nadir and Trump's election odds in betting markets peaked at around 66%. Around that time, economist David Rosenberg of Rosenberg Research wrote that \"'Animal spirits' have taken on a whole new head of steam because of this growing feeling that Donald Trump is going to emerge victorious.\"\n\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\n\nThe S&P 500 stock index hit its last record high on July 16, driven in part by the prospect of Trump winning the election with a Republican Congress that would keep all the Trump tax cuts from 2017 in place and maybe cut business taxes a bit more. Cryptocurrencies rallied, in part because Trump had turned from skeptic to believer, promising to treat crypto much more gently than Biden if elected. Some analysts also thought Trump 2.0 expectations were pushing rates higher than they would otherwise be, especially with the Fed poised to start cutting as early as September.\n\nThere were victims of the Trump trade too. In a July 16 interview, for instance, Trump suggested he might not intervene if China attacked Taiwan. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor, Taiwan's most important company, promptly fell 7%.\n\nNow, with Harris on a roll, Trump's election odds have dropped from the peak of 66% in mid-July to around 52%. Harris's election odds are 46%, with third-party candidates accounting for the rest. Harris's rally seems likely to continue for a bit longer, given that she hasn't yet enjoyed the \"convention bump\" that typically follows each party's nominating convention. The Democratic confab begins Aug. 19 in Chicago.\n\nMarkets, meanwhile, suddenly have a lot to price in other than Trump. New signs of a slowing economy and out-of-sync central bank policies helped trigger a recent sell-off that trimmed the S&P 500 by 5% in one week. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have given back all their summer gains. Interest rates have dropped sharply during the last two weeks, as if everybody has forgotten about the risk of Trumpflation. Taiwan Semiconductor hasn't fully recovered, but since Trump knocked down the stock in mid-July it has outperformed the broader tech sector, another sign of the Trump trade in reverse.\n\nIt's obviously an unpredictable election, so the Trump trade could return if Harris's momentum stalls or something else gives Trump a fresh boost. It's also possible a Harris trade could develop, based on the prospect of a Harris win with Democratic control of Congress. A month ago, a Democratic sweep looked like the least possible election outcome in 2024. Now, who knows?\n\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

Tim Walz (D-MN), on Tuesday and has visited the state six other times this year, including a Philadelphia town hall she attended in July.\n\nThe Democrats' ability to win the city is not in doubt. With a 7-to-1 voter registration advantage, Harris can count on a decisive victory here and in Pittsburgh, another blue stronghold, even as former President Donald Trump runs up the score in more rural parts of the state.\n\nBut Democrats are left guarding against two trends undermining their chances in November. In 2020, Philadelphia brought out the highest number of voters in two decades, fueled in part by the rise in mail balloting. Yet turnout has fallen substantially below expectations in elections since then, including during President Joe Biden's 2024 primary.\n\nAt the same time, 2020's numbers obscured a small but material improvement for Trump in Philadelphia. He picked up 17.9% support against Biden, compared to 15.4% four years earlier.\n\n\"Low turnout in Philadelphia has gone from irksome to concerning to troublesome to top of mind for Democratic politicos. It keeps them up at night,\" said Christopher Nicholas, a veteran GOP political consultant and the author of the PA Political Digest newsletter.\n\n\"Add to that inroads Donald Trump has made with minority men, and you can see why it's such a problem for them,\" Nicholas added.\n\nBiden nonetheless won the state in 2020 on the strength of his appeal to suburban voters, albeit by a single percentage point. Then, as now, Democrats believe they can win the outskirts of Philadelphia and other vote-rich areas on a message that emphasizes abortion access and frames Trump as a threat to democracy.\n\nRepublicans will also have to erase the improvements Democrats made in rural counties during the midterm elections.\n\nNonetheless, Democrats have voiced skittishness about the turnout in Philadelphia, given the crucial role it will play in the November election.\n\nHarris does not need to win Pennsylvania to become president, assuming she can pick up competitive states such as Georgia and Nevada. But it is the richest of all the swing states in terms of electoral votes and the top target of both Harris and Trump in terms of campaign advertising.\n\nHarris's path to the White House runs clearly through Pennsylvania. According to 270toWin's \"consensus\" Electoral College map, Harris has three winning combinations to the necessary 270 electoral votes and the presidency, whereas Trump has five pathways. The one \"must-win\" state for Harris in her trio of scenarios is the Keystone State.\n\nCombined, the Harris and Trump campaigns are spending more than twice as much on Pennsylvania than any other battleground, according to Axios.\n\nHer choice of Walz suggests a level of comfort that she can win Pennsylvania without Josh Shapiro, the state's popular Democratic governor, as her running mate. He was one of three names on her short list.\n\nBut victory in Philadelphia will require reversing a decline in voting that goes beyond presidential dynamics. Only 43% of city residents voted in the midterm elections, compared to 49% in 2018, while turnout was down in April's presidential primary.\n\nLast year's mayoral election represented a bright spot, reversing the trend of declining turnout for off-year elections, gains that were concentrated in whiter enclaves of the city.\n\nBut Harris will also have to overcome the enthusiasm gap seen with Biden, who dropped out of the presidential race two weeks ago following a disastrous debate performance. She does not have the \"Scranton Joe\" appeal that is credited with helping Democrats with Pennsylvania's white working class, but the president faced seemingly intractable skepticism from minority and progressive voters, two pillars of the traditional Democratic coalition.\n\nIn a visit to Philadelphia in May, Harris launched a black voter initiative with Biden to address the flagging support, though the Latino vote is also of concern. Trump's inroads in the city were due, in part, to a shift in predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods in North Philadelphia.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nHarris will need to stem those losses, both in Pennsylvania and nationally, if she hopes to become president. But Democrats believe they stand a better chance with a new ticket. She has tightened the polls with Trump since entering the race two weeks ago, including in the slate of battlegrounds she will visit over the next week.\n\nFollowing her Philadelphia rally, Harris will travel to Wisconsin and Michigan, the two other \"blue wall\" states that Trump won in 2016.

The trip also marks her seventh visit to the commonwealth this year and the 17th since she was sworn in as vice president in 2021.\n\nDuring the event, Harris will introduce her running mate, although it still remains unclear who that will be. She has reportedly narrowed her choice down to two candidates: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nThe Harris campaign is touting enthusiasm in Pennsylvania, saying that more than 33,000 people have signed up to volunteer for the campaign in the commonwealth in just the last 15 days, according to a news release signed by Jack Doyle, Pennsylvania communications director. The campaign has nearly 300 staffers across 36 offices, including in swing counties like Erie, Luzerne, and Northampton. The campaign said it is also working to make inroads in historically Republican areas in Union, Lancaster and York counties.\n\nIT'S OFFICIAL: VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS FORMALLY WINS THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION\n\nThe campaign also said that Harris is \"barnstorming\" Pennsylvania while former President Trump, her main opponent in November's election, is \"struggling to keep up.\" It said Trump's campaign \"lags far behind in the infrastructure needed to win with just three offices in Pennsylvania\" and has \"shown he doesn't want these voters.\"\n\nTrump survived an assassination at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 and said he would return there for another rally in the future. He held a rally in Harrisburg last week.\n\nThe vice president is looking to show a contrast between herself and the former president in Pennsylvania, with her campaign saying she is \"fighting for our freedoms, democracy and an economy that provides everyone the opportunity to not just get by, but get ahead\" while \"Trump's toxic Project 2025 agenda would take our country backward by enacting a national abortion ban, raising costs for the middle class, and giving Trump virtually unchecked power.\"\n\nProject 2025 is a controversial initiative organized by conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation that was authored by a number of conservatives, including some former Trump administration officials.\n\nThe initiative offers right-wing policy recommendations for Trump should he win the presidency, including replacing civil service employees with Trump loyalists, abolishing the Department of Education, criminalizing pornography, eliminating DEI programs, cutting funding for Medicaid and Medicare, rejecting abortion as health care and infusing the government with Christian values.\n\nTrump has sought to distance himself from the initiative, which has been criticized as being an authoritarian and Christian nationalist plan that would undermine civil liberties, saying he knows nothing about it, that parts of it are \"absolutely ridiculous and abysmal\" and that its backers are on the \"radical right.\"\n\n'NEVER TRUMPERS' COALESCE BEHIND DEM TICKET IN REPUBLICANS FOR HARRIS CAMPAIGN\n\nThis is the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, giving states the power to make their own laws on abortion access. The Harris campaign cited polling showing that a majority of Pennsylvania voters support some abortion access.\n\n\"Vice President Harris will ensure women have the power to make decisions about their own bodies once again,\" her campaign said in a news release. \"That contrast will be front and center here\" in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Harris campaign also said the Trump administration killed more than 275,000 jobs in Pennsylvania, including thousands of manufacturing jobs, and oversaw record-high unemployment.\n\nIt said Harris and President Biden inherited an economy \"left in shambles\" by Trump but that she helped create more than half a million jobs in Pennsylvania and capped prescription drug costs for millions of Pennsylvania residents on Medicare.\n\nTouting her previous experience as a prosecutor in California, Harris' campaign said she is committed to keeping communities safe and locking up dangerous crooks, criminals and predators. The campaign said the murder rate in Pennsylvania, particularly Philadelphia, soared during the Trump administration while Harris \"has taken on the gun lobby and helped bring a historic drop in violent crime.\"\n\n\"If Trump gets a second term, he will once again cozy up to the NRA and make it easier for weapons to get into the hands of convicted criminals,\" the campaign said in the news release.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe campaign also highlighted the electoral losses Trump and his endorsed candidates have suffered in Pennsylvania in 2018, 2020 and 2022. The campaign pointed to Trump's loss to Biden in 2020, as well as Republican Mehmet Oz's 2022 loss to now-Democrat Sen. John Fetterman and Republican Doug Mastriano's 2022 loss to now-Democrat Gov. Shapiro.\n\n\"Republicans, too, lost ground in every corner of the Commonwealth as reproductive freedom and protecting our democracy were front and center for voters,\" the Harris campaign said in the news release. \"And reasonable Republicans across the commonwealth continue to reject Trump, with more than 158,000 people voting against Trump in the Pennsylvania Republican primary, nearly two months after Nikki Haley dropped out of the race.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "landon_mion@foxnews.com", "name": "Landon Mion",

That's how to beat Vice President Kamala Harris -- with policy arguments, not gratuitous personal attacks.\n\nOver 90% of voters have made up their minds. The 2024 presidential election will be determined in a handful of battleground states by a few hundred thousand votes, and Ms. Harris' best chance of winning will be to consolidate Democratic women, successfully woo independent women and peel off a fraction of Republican women.\n\nRepublican politicians, TV commentators and radio talk show hosts who play the Willie Brown card ridicule the Harris cackle or demean Ms. Harris as a diversity, equity and inclusion hire, which will only advance her strategy. Such personal attacks build a misplaced sympathy for Ms. Harris, particularly when the invective comes from men -- like it or not, it's a Mars vs. Venus world.\n\nTo successfully woo swing women voters -- along with independents up for grabs and the traditional Black, brown and blue-collar portions of the Democratic base -- the best Republican strategy is to run hard on the Trump policy agenda. Polls tell us that on the top salient issues likely to move undecided voters, the Trump policy agenda provides huge leads.\n\nInflation tops pollsters' list. \"Bidenomics\" is behind it, and Ms. Harris has given it a full-throated endorsement. Former President Donald Trump runs away with the election on this issue alone -- voters vividly remember that in Trump's America, you didn't have to choose between food on the table, prescriptions you need and a roof over your head.\n\nThe border chaos is in a dead heat with inflation. Despite the efforts of the mainstream media to scrub this fact, President Biden did assign Ms. Harris in 2021 to serve as border czar. Yet a dangerous crew of murderers, rapists, drug cartels, human traffickers, terrorists and Chinese spies have swarmed into our country.\n\nAcross the Rio Grande, millions of illiterate illegal aliens have also flooded our labor markets, stealing jobs and depressing the wages of Black, brown and blue-collar Americans. As Mr. Biden's missing-in-action border czar, Ms. Harris owns this border chaos, and polls here give Donald Trump a double-digit lead.\n\nOn the crime issue, Ms. Harris helped lead the \"defund the police\" movement even as she cheered on violent protests in American cities by radical groups such as Black Lives Matter and Antifa. In contrast, Mr. Trump has the endorsement of every major law enforcement organization and enjoys double-digit leads in the polls.\n\nOn foreign policy, voters likewise remember Mr. Trump had four years in the White House free of conflict with China, Russia, North Korea and Iran because their leaders both fear and respect Trump. And Mr. Trump moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem in a show of support for Israel.\n\nIn contrast, Ms. Harris has ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket with the least foreign policy experience of any major party presidential candidate in the last 100 years. Under Biden-Harris, Russia invaded Ukraine, Hamas and Hezbollah attacked Israel, China is threatening Taiwan and North Korea has resumed its missile and nuclear weapons testing.\n\nThe one foreign policy issue Ms. Harris has infamously distinguished herself on is that of the war in the Gaza Strip, where she has sided with \"river to the sea\" Palestinian activists while all but snubbing Israel's president. The American electorate is watching, and it does not like what it sees from Ms. Harris.\n\nBeyond Mr. Trump's polling advantage on issues including the economy and inflation, illegal immigration, crime and foreign policy, there is also Ms. Harris' \"woke\" agenda. It runs strongly against the grain of Middle Americans, including many men and women in the traditional Democratic Party base.\n\nHere, parents are uncomfortable with (and often outraged by) K-12 \"woke\" indoctrination at the expense of reading, writing, and arithmetic. There is equal outrage at the participation of men in women's sports. There is also widespread bewilderment (and equal outrage) across America at how and why the Biden-Harris regime is facilitating gender surgery on children.\n\nAs a further twist, in what can only be described as a twisted version of \"prison reform,\" Ms. Harris is also on record fervently supporting gender reassignment operations for men in federal prisons. No wonder Ms. Harris garnered the most liberal voting record in the Senate during her tenure there.\n\nThe one polling issue where Ms. Harris leads is abortion. This issue, however, runs significantly behind inflation and the economy, the border chaos, foreign policy and crime as salient to most swing voters.\n\nOf note, Ms. Harris' view on abortion is far more extreme than that of Mr. Biden. If Republicans more effectively message that extremism, Ms. Harris' polling advantage should narrow or even disappear. Here, even mainstream Democrats oppose the ate-term abortions supported by Ms. Harris.\n\nGiven this polling chessboard, it is indeed the Trump policy agenda, stupid. If Republicans are smart, they will follow this advice. To lose this election is to lose this country.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_navarro@washingtontimes.com",

President Biden and Vice President Harris supported a bipartisan solution led by Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma. It was on track until Trump and MAGA allies killed the legislation to let the problem continue for political talking points.\n\nTrump sleepwalked on his promise to invest in infrastructure, although he did give us a few \"infrastructure weeks.\" Biden and Harris delivered on infrastructure, with investments in locks and dams, airports, highways, bridges, trains, broadband, etc. throughout our nation. Biden and Harris also secured a huge investment in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nTrump says that climate change is a hoax, and he remains oblivious to the challenges presented by it. Biden and Harris tackled the issue head-on with billions of dollars of investments in clean energy, environmental justice initiatives and more.\n\nTrump railed against Obamacare while never proposing a health care alternative. Biden and Harris brought millions of Americans health care coverage, capped the costs of insulin and secured lower drug prices for millions of Medicare recipients.\n\nTrump enacted an inflationary and deficit-inducing tax cut primarily for the rich.

Biden's performance, in particular, was so disastrous that, as I also mentioned at the time, Democratic operatives were reported to have immediately begun calling for him not to seek re-election.\n\nBut Biden was resolute and deter\u00admined to stay in the race. During that time, there was an assassination attempt on Trump. Days after, Trump would appear on stage at the Republican National Convention (RNC) to complete the formality and accept the nomination from the party.\n\nBiden would then drop the unexpected news that he had indeed deci\u00added not to seek re-election and would instead support his Vice-President, Kamala Harris, as the Democratic nominee to take on Trump. I've secret\u00adly admired the US for its ability to turn even something as mundane as politics into entertainment. You can have your House of the Dragon, this \"season\" of the US presidential election has been my number one thing to watch this summer.\n\nAway from the compelling spectacle of how the US presidential race unfolds, there are two major lessons offered by Biden and Harris. While US politics is in shambles at the moment, indicated by the level of political violence we've seen already, these lessons can be applied to our political context to make us better.\n\nUntil July 21 when Biden announced that he would not continue his bid for re-election, all signs pointed towards his determination to fight what seemed to be a losing battle against Donald Trump. A Pew Research Centre survey of US adults conducted from July 1-7 revealed Trump was leading the presidential race 44% to 40% over Biden. Democratic donors and party members did everything but throw Biden under the bus by repeatedly calling for him to step down.\n\nBiden didn't have to give up power. The structure of internal party politics in the US is different from ours. This is partly why Donald Trump has been able to stamp his authority on the Republican party. As the incumbent, Biden was the presumptive Democratic nominee. Among his many progressive policies on climate change, transportation infrastructure, health, education and green energy during this first, and what we know will be his only term, Biden's decision to not seek re-election could go down as equally progressive.\n\nWe don't see this often in politics. Look to the United National Congress (UNC) where Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar has repeatedly decided to hold on to power despite consecutive losses to the People's National Movement (PNM); and at Cabinet ministers such as Fitzgerald Hinds who, as the longest serving Minister of National Security, continues to hold onto power despite failing on his mandate to effectively fight crime.\n\nIn addition to the obvious gender and racial dynamics that distinguish Harris from Biden, Harris is also signi\u00adficantly younger, 59 years old compared to the 81-year-old Biden. She therefore immediately energised not just the party but also young people when Biden stepped aside.\n\nWithin hours of Biden's announcement, memes, emojis and three words from a pop star (\"Kamala IS brat\") changed the prospect of another Trump presidency. It's too early to know if the Gen Z hype around Harris will translate into votes and ultimately her victory. But this much is certain -- Harris has been able to achieve what Biden couldn't: excitement and hope for the future.\n\nFollowing Biden's announcement, vote.org, the largest non-profit, non-partisan voting registration platform in America, revealed that of the 38,500 new voters who registered, 83% were from people aged 18-34.\n\nIf Kamala Harris becomes the next president, her victory should be partly attributed to Biden's bravery, as well as his self-awareness that maybe he was, in fact, too old to seek re-election. Harris has since breathed new life into the Democratic party. During the 24 hours that immediately followed Biden's announcement, Harris received US$81 million in campaign donations.\n\nI can't speak for young people in Trinidad and Tobago and their pers\u00adpective on politics. It is possible that the youth arms of both the UNC and PNM are satisfied with their respective leaders. So I speak for myself when I say our current political status quo neither gets me excited nor hopeful that the next government formed after the 2025 general election will be any different from what has already existed. Harris has shown young people have the capacity to be excited about poli\u00adtics, but they -- we -- need a reason to get excited.\n\nOur politicians should take note of Biden's difficult but necessary decision, as well as Kamala's ability to energise the party and young voters. It may not be a natural response by politicians to give up power -- after all, their career is spent chasing it. Biden attempted to hold on to power until he recognised that his attempts were holding the party and the country back.\n\nOur politicians would do well to likewise recognise when their inability to give up power does more harm than good. As for the Kamala-mania, her ability to immediately draw in young voters is a sign that politics must enter a new phase -- a phase that addresses the concerns of young people.\n\n-- Author Jarrel De

She can thank the media for that.", "body": "The effort between Democrats and the media to create a political star out of Kamala Harris has gone shockingly well.\n\nAfter President Joe Biden finally threw in the towel last month on his presidential bid, the refurbishing campaign began in earnest.\n\nIn a couple of weeks, Harris has gone from a generally disliked, ineffective flop of a vice president to a progressive champion who has miraculously united and excited her Democratic Party just ahead of its national convention in Chicago.\n\nThe momentum of her campaign increased Tuesday when she announced her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim \"one person's socialism is another person's neighborliness\" Walz.\n\n(Yes, Walz really said that last week on the \"White Dudes for Harris\" fundraiser call.)\n\nHarris' choice of Walz indicates she's confident enough to go with a far-left progressive from a state that's not really in play.\n\nShe's also managed to steal the spotlight from former President Donald Trump, who just weeks ago survived an assassination attempt that's become old news rather quickly.\n\nWhy segregate campaign fundraisers? 'White women' and 'white dudes' pledge their allegiance to Kamala Harris. Talk about weird.\n\nOne of Harris' favorite refrains is the phrase, \"What can be, unburdened by what has been.\"\n\nPerhaps she repeated it enough that it came true. The vice president suddenly seems completely unburdened by the negativity that has overshadowed her tenure in the White House.\n\nHarris' ability to completely redefine herself in a matter of weeks seems tied to her teleprompter. Her campaign team has not let her go far from it. And for good reason.\n\nA brief unscripted response to reporters at last week's prisoner swap celebration between the United States and Russia, that finally led to the homecoming of Americans like journalist Evan Gershkovich, is a great example.\n\nIn what should have been a simple answer to deliver, Harris said in part the following: \"This is just an extraordinary testament to the importance of having a president who understands the power of diplomacy, and understands the strength that rests in understanding the significance of diplomacy and strengthening alliances. This is an incredible day.\"\n\nThis harkens back to what Harris is known for doing when she's off teleprompter - stringing together nonsensical word salads.\n\nAnd it's why Harris has so far limited her appearances to rallies and events where she's safely on script and can control the narrative.\n\nSince becoming the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Harris has not held formal news conferences or interviews where she could face tough questions. And the news media hasn't put any pressure on her to do so.\n\nHarris even skipped the National Association of Black Journalists convention last week, although she - the first Black woman and first Asian American presidential nominee of a major party - had been invited.\n\nCriticize him all you want, but Trump also was invited and actually showed up, even though he certainly knew it wouldn't be a friendly audience (it wasn't).\n\nBad-idea Biden strikes again: His terrible Supreme Court reforms would hurt our democracy\n\nHarris' limited public appearances and friendly media coverage have allowed her to create a new persona.\n\nHer unfavorability rating had spiked for much of the past year and half (with a 17-point gap as of early July between those who had an unfavorable and favorable opinion of her). That gap has miraculously shrunk by more than 10 points since Biden dropped out.\n\nI have to wonder if she can keep it up. Can the honeymoon last until Election Day? Won't voters remember what she's really like?\n\nAri Fleischer, former press secretary for President George W. Bush, thinks the mainstream media's distaste for Trump will push them to keep painting Harris in a positive light.\n\n\"I've been around the MSM for a long time and I've never seen them so passive,\" he recently observed on X. \"If you thought they were in the tank for Pres. Obama, it's nothing compared now to their desire to defeat Trump and help Harris. They should be roasting Harris for hiding and refusing to do interviews. Instead, they're in on it. If it helps her win, it's more than fine with the MSM.\"\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app?

That didn't go so well for him, but it was revealing to say the least.\n\nHarris was able to avoid the primaries and the vetting that comes with that process. She owes it to the American people to let us see for ourselves who she really is.\n\nAnd the media should do their job and make sure she does.\n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

What Do the Polls Really Say?", "body": "This is an interesting situation. As Kamala rises in the polls, the stock market declines. Are the two linked? Probably not, but who knows?\n\nAs of today, the Kamala bounce seems to be real. A Morning Consult poll from early this month has Harris up by 4 over Trump. This is a massive poll of 11,000+ registered voters, supposedly giving it more credibility. But what would be more convincing would be a more targeted poll of likely voters. One key takeaway from this poll is that Kamala's popularity may have peaked at 50% and is now moving down.\n\nIn what might be a case of polling schizophrenia, a recent Rasmussen Reports poll has Trump ahead by 4. At nearly the same time, a more recent survey from Scott Rasmussen's RMG Research showed that Kamala was up by 4. Figure that out.\n\nClearly, Democrats were in a state of panic regarding Joe Biden. Now that that crisis has passed and they have a candidate who can speak undemented though circular English, almost every leftist organization is in a state of verbal orgasmic euphoria. But is this the result of irrational enthusiasm? Plugged-in Democrat David Axelrod seems to think so and warned his party that \"it is absolutely Trump's race to lose right now.\"\n\nSo Axelrod's message to freaked out Trump-supporters is to get a grip. Remember that the Real Clear Politics polling average of a five-way race has Kamala up by just a fraction. On this date in 2016, the RCP average had Hillary up by almost 7.\n\nTrump's support in swing states appears to have declined. But that would be expected, considering that Biden dropped out of the race and Trump's polling bumps from the convention and the attempted assassination are fading. Let's take a look.\n\nIn Arizona, Trump is up by 2 in the RCP average, based on the strength of just two polls. An Emerson poll had Trump up by 8 on Jul. 23, followed by Morning Consult five days later, with Harris up by 4. I am not buying a 12-point swing in less than a week. In the FiveThirtyEight average, Trump is up by almost 2. Here, the Morning Consult poll with Harris at 4 was followed by two other polls showing Trump ahead.\n\nAt the FiveThirtyEight average for Georgia, Morning Consult has the race tied. Two other polls show roughly the same. Trump's lead of 0.8 is based on polls taken just a few days earlier. The RCP average has Trump at 1.7, again on the strength of two polls taken before Jul. 28.\n\nBoth polling averages have Harris ahead in Michigan. The RCP average has her up by 2.7, and the FiveThirtyEight average has her up by 2. Both results are due to a Morning Consult poll where the numbers flip from Trump up by a point or two to Harris up by 12 within two to four days. Seriously? This is a poll where 71% said the country was on the wrong track. I find it hard to believe that voters in Michigan hate Trump so much that they will back a San Francisco socialist. Sorry, not buying it.\n\nIn Nevada, we have confusion. The RCP average isn't really an average. It is just the Morning Consult state poll showing a tie. There is no FiveThirtyEight average. There is just a list of polls showing Trump ahead by varying amounts, with the Morning Consult poll showing a tie. If I do a realistic average of post-Joe drop-out polls, I get Trump +1.\n\nIn North Carolina, we have more of the same. The only poll for the RCP average is -- you guessed it -- a Morning Consult poll with Trump up by 1. Again, there is no number for the FiveThirtyEight average; it is just a list. If I do another post-Joe average of the polls, I get Trump +2.\n\nFinally, the RCP average in Wisconsin has Trump ahead by a fraction. The FiveThirtyEight average has Harris up by 1.6. If you are having difficulty figuring out how they calculated that number, please remember that FiveThirtyEight uses a weighted averaging technique based on accuracy estimates. Speaking of accuracy, I want to remind everyone that FiveThirtyEight had Biden over Trump by more than 8 points in Wisconsin in 2020. Joe won by less than a point.\n\nOne of the inherent drawbacks of public opinion polls is most news and polling organizations have a left or left-of-center bias. This means their inclination is to lean toward or support left-wing ideologies linked to the Democrat party. I don't want to pick on any particular organization and claim that it is deliberately biased because that is difficult to prove. However, even if bias is not deliberate, it sometimes creeps in. This is why Republicans usually do better than predicted in presidential election years.\n\nThe problem with reading polls right now is that there has been a significant amount of political change in a short time. Joe Biden's approval numbers had been underwater since the military pulled out of Afghanistan in 2021. His poll numbers got worse after his recent debate with Trump, whereas Trump's soared. Trump also benefited from the Republican Convention and his narrow escape from death at the hands of a would-be assassin. Now that Biden has been replaced with Harris, the pendulum has swung the other way. This has nothing to do with Kamala being a stand-alone candidate. It is simply the fact that she is not Biden.\n\nDuring the next few weeks, the left-wing media blitz will likely hold sway until after the Democrat Convention. Harris could rise even farther in the polls.\n\nUnfortunately for her, she can rise only so far. Prices for gasoline, food, and rent remain a challenge for over half the population. Immigration and crime are still serious issues. Unemployment could become an issue.\n\nI'm sure there are a lot of Democrats and probably some independents who are thrilled to have a woman running for president. But that is not an overly persuasive issue. It is still crime and the economy, stupid! So it is still Trump's game to lose.\n\nThe key thing is to take the poll numbers with a grain of salt.", "source": {"uri": "americanthinker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Thinker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FiveThirtyEight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FiveThirtyEight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealClearPolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "RealClearPolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Consult", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morning Consult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Axelrod_(political_consultant)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Axelrod (political consultant)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmussen_Reports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rasmussen Reports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Schizophrenia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Vance in the firing line and acres of newsprint celebrating Joe Biden's decision to step aside, the Trump campaign couldn't believe its luck when Kamala Harris finally plumped for Tim Walz, a governor little known outside his home state of Minnesota.\n\nInsiders say it gives them the chance to get back on offense after weathering a difficult two weeks.\n\n'Thank you,' was Donald Trump's two-word verdict on Truth Social.\n\nBehind the scenes, his allies could not hide their jubilation that Harris picked a governor with a liberal voting record from a state that has been solidly Democratic since 1972.\n\nThey quickly went on the attack, chewing over his voting record and the way that Minnesota was rocked by Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.\n\nTheir fear had been that she would lock up the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania by plumping for its centrist governor, Josh Shapiro.\n\n'Instead of picking the candidate with charisma and a moderate record, Kamala caved to the Hamas caucus and picked a charisma black hole with a long record of supporting extreme liberal policies and a history of being close to China,' said a source close to the Trump campaign, before making a comparison with Hillary Clinton's losing 2016 ticket.\n\n'Walz is Tim Kaine all over again, he adds nothing to the ticket.'\n\nThe Trump campaign needed a fillip.\n\nAfter making the running all year, building potentially decisive leads in several swing states, it suddenly found itself under fire.\n\nTrump may have survived an assassination attempt and brought the party together at its convention in Milwaukee, but the good times ended when Biden finally announced his decision to step aside last month.\n\nThat decision did not usher in weeks of Democratic infighting as they had hoped. Instead Democrats united behind Vice President Harris, and turned its attention to Vance, the MAGA loyalist selected as Trump's running mate.\n\nHis busy history of fiery TV interviews and incendiary social media posts provided fodder for attack ads and negative headlines.\n\nMeanwhile money poured into Harris from donors who had been reluctant to back Biden. Even the polls turned her way.\n\nAn average maintained by the FiveThirtyEight statistics site now puts her in the lead over Trump by 45.5 percent to 43.5 percent.\n\nDavid Urban, a Trump confidant whose base is Pennsylvania, said the real race begins now and described it as 'political malpractice' for Harris not to pick Shapiro.\n\n'He was the best political athlete in this draft class,' said Urban, who has known the governor for years.\n\nRather than a running mate who could help win the most important state in this year's contest, he said she had picked 'the progressives' wet dream.'\n\nAnd she had provided the Trump campaign with perfect chance to draw a line under the two weeks of missed opportunities and turbulence since Biden stepped aside.\n\n'Today ends marks the end of that period,' he said. 'Today begins reality for the now Harris-Walz ticket, the most progressive ticket in the United States since maybe Mondale-Ferraro.'\n\nThat pairing lost in a landslide to Reagan-Bush in 1984.\n\nVance himself was back on offense Tuesday, showing a spring in his step after two weeks of defending his own record.\n\n'They make an interesting tag team because Tim Walz allowed rioters to burn down Minneapolis in the summer of 2020, and the few that got caught, Kamala Harris helped bail them out of jail,' he told reporters traveling with him on his plane, Trump Force Two.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Vance in the firing line and acres of newsprint celebrating Joe Biden 's decision to step aside, the Trump campaign couldn't believe its luck when Kamala Harris finally plumped for Tim Walz, a governor little known outside his home state of Minnesota . Insiders say it gives them the chance to get back on offense after weathering a difficult two weeks.\n\n'Thank you,' was Donald Trump 's two-word verdict on Truth Social. Behind the scenes, his allies could not hide their jubilation that Harris picked a governor with a liberal voting record from a state that has been solidly Democratic since 1972.\n\nThey quickly went on the attack, chewing over his voting record and the way that Minnesota was rocked by Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. Their fear had been that she would lock up the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania by plumping for its centrist governor, Josh Shapiro.\n\n'Instead of picking the candidate with charisma and a moderate record, Kamala caved to the Hamas caucus and picked a charisma black hole with a long record of supporting extreme liberal policies and a history of being close to China ,' said a source close to the Trump campaign, before making a comparison with Hillary Clinton 's losing 2016 ticket. 'Walz is Tim Kaine all over again, he adds nothing to the ticket.'\n\nThe Trump campaign needed a fillip. After making the running all year, building potentially decisive leads in several swing states, it suddenly found itself under fire. Trump may have survived an assassination attempt and brought the party together at its convention in Milwaukee, but the good times ended when Biden finally announced his decision to step aside last month.\n\nThat decision did not usher in weeks of Democratic infighting as they had hoped. Instead Democrats united behind Vice President Harris, and turned its attention to Vance, the MAGA loyalist selected as Trump's running mate. His busy history of fiery TV interviews and incendiary social media posts provided fodder for attack ads and negative headlines.\n\nMeanwhile, money poured into Harris from donors who had been reluctant to back Biden. Even the polls turned her way. An average maintained by the FiveThirtyEight statistics site now puts her in the lead over Trump by 45.5 percent to 43.5 percent.\n\nDavid Urban, a Trump confidant whose base is Pennsylvania, said the real race begins now and described it as 'political malpractice' for Harris not to pick Shapiro. 'He was the best political athlete in this draft class,' said Urban, who has known the governor for years.\n\nAnd she had provided the Trump campaign with perfect chance to draw a line under the two weeks of missed opportunities and turbulence since Biden stepped aside. 'Today ends marks the end of that period,' he said. 'Today begins reality for the now Harris-Walz ticket, the most progressive ticket in the United States since maybe Mondale-Ferraro.'\n\nThat pairing lost in a landslide to Reagan-Bush in 1984. Vance himself was back on offense Tuesday, showing a spring in his step after two weeks of defending his own record. 'They make an interesting tag team because Tim Walz allowed rioters to burn down Minneapolis in the summer of 2020, and the few that got caught, Kamala Harris helped bail them out of jail,' he told reporters traveling with him on his plane, Trump Force Two.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Tim Walz.\n\nDemocratic voters waited outside Temple's Liacouras Center on Tuesday afternoon for a chance to see Vice President Kamala Harris and her newly announced running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, surging with a newfound energy missing from the Democratic base just weeks earlier.\n\nThose in the line, which snaked around the sports arena, expressed enthusiasm to vote Democrat this fall, a marked departure from the dread and resignation many say they felt before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race on July 21. Several wore Harris tees and pins emblazoned with punchy quips from the Democratic nominee, like her challenge to the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump: \"Say it to my face.\"\n\nPassing drumlines elicited cheers from the crowd, recording iPhones in hand. One woman patrolled the sidewalk draped in a Harris flag, trailing behind her like a superhero cape.\n\nThose gathered for the rally praised Harris as confident, honest and a fighter. They readily admitted they were worried before Harris became the leading Democratic contender. Biden's much-criticized performance in the June 27 debate against Trump was frequently invoked as a source of fear and even a reason to sit the election out.\n\n\"Six weeks ago, I was in a state of despair,\" said Delores White, an 81-year-old from Camden. \"'Cause everyone was saying Trump was going to win. Trump thought he was going to win. That's why he picked JD Vance. And now we're in a different territory, a different era. We have hope.\"\n\nJuan Mancera, a 23-year-old from Norristown, said: \"In the very beginning with Biden, I wasn't really going to vote. So now with Kamala, I'm very happy with that decision.\"\n\nVoters in line seem on board with Walz, too. White, a retired teacher, appreciates his background in education. Walz's viral attack line against the Republicans -- \"they're weird\" -- is also resonating with the base, with many praising the departure from past Democratic messaging.\n\n\"I think it's great,\" said Evelyn Hittner, a 47-year-old from Flemington. \"I really think we got to abandon when they go low, we go high. I think we got to fight in the gutter. They're very weird people, and I think we should point out that they're very strange.\"\n\nHittner's friend Joanie Shah, a 42-year-old Philly native, thinks it can go even further.\n\n\"I want (Harris) to dig into Trump,\" Shah said. \"I think it's time. He's good at dishing it out. Let's see if he can take it.\"\n\nThough speculation prior to the Tuesday morning announcement suggested Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was the front-runner to be Harris' running mate, some, like Mancera, expressed reservations over his stance on the war in Gaza. Others are happy he's staying in Harrisburg.\n\n\"He's a good governor,\" Hittner said. \"He is the new governor in Pennsylvania, I feel like they should keep their Democratic governors because they are swing (states).\"\n\nWhite said, \"I was leaning toward Shapiro, but Walz is probably a better pick. He can influence Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania up north. ... He can talk to them.\"\n\nReproductive rights and gun control were top issues for the people in line. Younger voters like Mancera and those too young to participate in this election -- like Hittner's 15-year-old daughter Chelsea -- also said a ceasefire in Gaza was a priority. Regardless of their reasons for voting for Harris, however, her supporters at Temple believe she can win. Not just Pennsylvania or New Jersey, but the electoral college. For them, the alternative is unconscionable.\n\n\"We cannot lose this election because of Project 2025,\" White said. \"What Trump has in store for us would just be a complete nightmare....Republicans want to control our voting, which would take our voice away.\"", "source": {"uri": "phillyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PhillyVoice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Trump of Republican Party\n\nProf M R Dua\n\nPERHAPS first time in over 250-year independent history of the United States of America, presidential election on November 5, 2024, will be a unique and an unparalleled happening for multiple reasons. This hi-fi electoral contest for choosing America's 47 president will or could lead to electing a woman the first time. And if elected, a woman, actually daughter of immigrant parents, could be the nation's first woman commander-in-chief, and the most powerful political leader of the world, occupying the world's most powerful seats of power, the White House and the Oval Office. But that only if it can happen. And that's a very big IF!\n\nMeanwhile, Kamala Harris's Republican Party's formidable rival, former President Donald J. Trump, a convicted felon, with 34 criminal and 14 serious business fraud cases waiting trial in various American courts. But Trump will be a veritable 'faux-populist juggernaut,' waiting in wings to defeat anyone who dares to impede his path to second term in the nation's most coveted, the White House. Trump is a master accuser and is abundantly knowledgeable of his rival's frailties, Kamala Harris's numerous weaknesses and flaws as a working vice-president of Joe Biden, such as her unsatisfactory faulty handling of border immigrant crisis. In fact, the entire GOP- the US grand old party - is set to pounce upon Kamala Harris's many fallible pronouncements at home and abroad. Though Harris has ignored 'several critical issues that could put her in shakier political ground that her opponents are ready to tie to her...' But as one of her supporters put it, 'after Harris entered presidential race, mems returned to the Left.'\n\nHowever, Donald Trump is not going let her go free; he is said to be ready with bags full of wild allegations against the Biden-Harris administration's numerous imperfections and flaws in handling the nation's economy, immigration, national defence and security, foreign policy, particularly international armed conflicts in Israel and middle east, 24-month-long Ukraine imbroglio vis-a-vis China-Russia-US deteriorating relations. Also, Trump has most often lashed out at the Biden administration's tackling taxation and trade policies, inflation and several labour unions' multiple demands.\n\nDonald Trump is accustomed to using malicious language and often resorts to vicious words. He has been reported calling Kamala Harris 'radical-leftist lunatic.' Trump's tendency is to make personal attacks against female rivals...which was also noticed during the Trump campaign against Hillary Clinton during the 2016 Trump campaign. 'Kamala is worse than Joe...she is a radical lunatic, she is against Crypto...Markets are skyrocketing because they're expecting Trump to become president again.\n\nIn a newspaper report on a church meeting of a Floria group, \"Believers Summit -- Turning Point Action'', Trump minced no words and directly addressed priests and pasters: \"Vote just this time. If you voted me into office in November, you'll never need to vote again...Christians, get out and vote...just this time...You won't have to do it anymore... You know what? Four more years ...It'll be fixed; it will be fine...my beautiful Christians, I am a Christian. I love you, Christians. You got to get out and vote...In four years, you don't have to vote again. We'll have it fixed so good you are not going to have to vote.''\n\nAddressing an election rally recently he said that if Kamala 'shape herself as a progressive politician, she can wrest the future from the MAGA (Make America Great Again) moment, connect with working class voters, she can make a difference.' He said his advice to the Democrat leaders is to attend working class workers' grievances which are not 'cared for'. Speaking at a campaign rally, he cautioned MAGA workers that 'if Democrats come to power everyone of you will be gone...they will be vicious.'\n\nMeanwhile, as soon as Donald Trump Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio to be his 2024 vice presidential running mate, poll observers have pointed to Vance's political past being a leading critic of Republican presidents' policies, like the Ronald Reagan-George Bush era. Finally, as the campaigns of both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump pick up momentum, the coming nearly 100 will hopefully see election debates between both candidates. (Kamala Harris is yet to be officially named as Democratic Party candidate which will be done at the D.N.C. -- Democratic National Convention- between August 19-20 at Chicago.)", "source": {"uri": "greaterkashmir.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Greater Kashmir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "editorial_desk@greaterkashmir.com", "name": "Editorial Desk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commander-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_Point_Action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turning Point Action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

He took to Truth Social to slam his Democratic opponent, calling the 1,000-point plunge \"The Great Kamala Crash Of 2024.\"\n\nIn reality, it's difficult to make the case that a president or vice president is responsible for major moves in the stock market. And economists warned against making too much of two bad days.\n\n\"The first thing I'd say is, 'what crash?' \" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"Stock prices go up, they go down, they go all around.\"\n\nZandi said the sell-off was the result of investor nervousness over possible slowing of the U.S. economy. Critics fear the Federal Reserve may have waited too long to lower interest rates, after a long period of increases to try to get inflation under control.\n\nWhile stock prices dropped about 10% from their record high a few weeks ago, sparking unease among investors and anyone with a 401(k) retirement plan, \"they're still up 15% from where they were a year ago and a lot, lot more than they were when Biden took office,\" Zandi said.\n\nEven so, the decline on Wall Street could help Trump. While Vice President Kamala Harris has closed the gap with Trump nationally and in most swing states, poll after poll show the economy is a top concern among voters and a majority trust Trump on the issue more than President Joe Biden, and now, more than Harris. Steve Koczela, president of the MassINC Polling Group, said Trump benefits from a historic advantage Republicans have -- at times without merit -- when it comes to the economy.\n\n\"It's not the case that Republican presidents have necessarily done better on the economy, but there is this stable perception among more voters that Republican presidents do better on the economy,\" Koczela said. \"At the moment, Trump is clearly benefiting from that.\"\n\nThat's true despite multiple signs that the economy is actually doing pretty well. The Harris campaign touts robust job growth over the past three-and-a-half years and the lowest unemployment rate in a half century. Also, inflation is way down since it peaked during the pandemic.\n\nStill, many Americans are feeling the burden of higher prices, and Harris is noting that in campaign speeches. At a recent appearance in Atlanta, she said, \"To keep our middle class strong, families need relief from the high cost of living so that they have a chance -- not just to get by -- but to get ahead.\"\n\nFor his part, Trump blames concern about the economy, including inflation, on Democrats, and it's a potent talking point among his followers. Daren Smith of Plastow, New Hampshire, at a Trump rally this winter, said he was upset about high prices and complained that inflation will shrink the spending power of his retirement account.\n\n\"Everything you worked for is going away,\" he said.\n\nSmith said he feels the weight of higher prices every day, and he's not alone. Zandi, the economist, said that while inflation has cooled, prices on necessities, including groceries, rent and gasoline, are as much as 25% higher than they were a few years ago.\n\n\"So, I think people are still feeling the sting of those higher prices,\" he said.\n\nDespite Trump's claims that he can \"fix\" inflation, Zandi says the Federal Reserve has the responsibility to set interest rates, not presidents. Trump has not said what concrete moves he would take to tackle higher prices.\n\nStill, high prices are real -- people feel them -- and they're providing a potent issue for Trump, according to Amy Walter with the Cook Political Report. She believes the economy looms large in the presidential race; while Harris has pulled even with Trump, Biden was running several points ahead of him at this point in the election four years ago.\n\n\"What is it that is preventing her from being where Biden was in 2020?\" Walter said. \"I'd argue that it's worries about the economy.\"\n\nIn response, she said, Harris and the Democrats are trying to build a case against Trump, \"that he and his temperament are a central problem -- that Trump himself is only going to look out for the wealthiest and for himself.\"\n\nIn other words, if the election comes down to a referendum on the economy, it's advantage Trump. If Democrats can make this a referendum on Trump, they believe they could win.", "source": {"uri": "wbur.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBUR 90.9 mHz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zandi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zandi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/401(k)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "401(k)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moody's_Analytics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moody's Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cook County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cook County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24217525175071-1000x684.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792426", "eventUri": "eng-9792426", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

Harris-Walz versus Trump-Vance, and the sprint is on. The race is moving fast. And to get a sense of where things stand, we have a new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll out today, and it shows Vice President Harris slightly ahead, nationally (ph), over former President Trump. NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro is here to give us the latest numbers and what Harris' running mate could mean for the race. Hey, Domenico.\n\nDOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.\n\nCHANG: OK, so it seems like some of the Harris momentum that people are talking about is reflected in these numbers, right? Is his choice of Tim Walz going to further build on that momentum, do you think?\n\nMONTANARO: It's possible, and Democrats are hoping for it. It's clearly aimed at candidates in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, where the race is now tied. And if Harris wins those states, she'll probably win the presidency. Walz is also a PR pick. In fact, you know, he called the attack on former President Trump and his vice presidential pick, J.D. Vance, \"bizarre,\" as everyone on the Democratic side seems to be saying these days. He was there on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"\n\n(EXCERPT FROM THE TV SHOW \"MORNING JOE\")\n\nTIM WALZ: I think we're going back to the basics, to breaking away from this division. We don't like what's happened, where we can't even go to Thanksgiving dinner with our uncle because we're in this weird, pointless fight.\n\nJOE SCARBOROUGH: (Laughs).\n\nWALZ: And I think bringing people together is true. These guys are just...\n\nMONTANARO: You hear him say these guys are just weird, and the host, Joe Scarborough, mocks him toward the end. Democrats are hoping that Walz's folksy side - as heard in this speech - can appeal to white, centrist voters in the upper Midwest and win the debate over which party and which policies are more normal.\n\nCHANG: Yeah, but Walz also has a progressive record as governor. Could that hurt the Harris-Walz ticket as they try to appeal to more moderate voters?\n\nMONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, Republicans are certainly going to attack his policies and probably his tenure as governor of Minnesota, especially after the police killing of George Floyd. Republicans have tried to use the chaotic scenes that followed Floyd's killing as examples of Democratic governance - to try to win over white suburban voters who fear crime.\n\nIt's funny, though. There's, quote, \"moderate in policy,\" and then there's moderate in tone. And a lot of what turns voters off, as you hear quite often, is less about policy than it is about tone. And Walz is certainly someone who tries to turn down the heat. He champions progressive policies - there's no doubt about that - and goes on the attack. But he does it with the kind of carefree style that Vice President Harris clearly loved.\n\nHe's careful not to alienate rural voters that Democrats have struggled with. He's pretty confident that he's got the balance right, given that he grew up in rural Nebraska and won in a Republican-leaning district. He's also there to be a sort of Harris validator, someone from the Midwest who trusts her and can show that she's not the \"California liberal\" that Republicans want her to be.\n\nCHANG: This poll, Domenico, was just released, but it was conducted the weekend before Walz nominated Harris. But what changes did this poll reveal?\n\nMONTANARO: Yes, we've seen more momentum in Harris' favor. She's now ahead of Trump 51-48. That's up four points from last month. Importantly, she maintains that lead even when we've given people more choices than the two major party candidates.\n\nHer rise is actually being fueled by black voters and women, particularly college-educated white women and those who identify as independents. Those groups all have about 20 points more support for Harris than they did a few weeks ago. And young voters, black voters, Latino voters all say they're much more enthusiastic about voting. And, you know, for a Democratic candidate, that's huge.\n\nHowever, I must point out that with voters under 45, Harris is not doing as well as she would like at this point, and we will see whether she makes progress in that area or not.\n\nCHANG: Does our poll tell us anything about what people might think about Harris' choice?\n\nMONTANARO: There's going to be a big competition to define him on this ticket, because 71 percent of Americans say they have no opinion of Tim Walz at this point. His counterpart, J.D. Vance, though, seems to be breaking the first rule of being a vice president, which is to do no harm. Our poll found that 55 percent of independents have an unfavorable opinion of him, which is not a good thing for him. So the next couple of weeks are going to be really crucial for this Democratic ticket.\n\nCHANG: That's Domenico Montanaro from NPR. Thank you, Domenico.\n\nMONTANARO: You're welcome.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 NPR. All rights reserved.

But the fresh vibe in Philadelphia was striking because it emerged after one of the darkest chapters of modern US politics.\n\nAmericans have experienced a Trump presidency that threatened to tear the country apart, suffered through a pandemic that killed more than a million citizens and endured grinding years of economic insecurity caused by inflation and high grocery prices. For most of this year, the former president has promised a second presidency of retribution. President Joe Biden, meanwhile, had been delivering searing warnings that his rival was tarnishing the very soul of America, even as the haunting signs of the president's advancing age became increasingly painful to watch.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, the last GOP primary challenger standing against Trump, used to predict that the first party to ditch its old, White male presidential candidate in 2024 would get a massive boost. While Harris is yet to prove she can alter the fundamentals of a race against Trump, she's proving Haley's point, bringing some unexpected sunshine to an election year.\n\n\"We both believe in lifting people up, not knocking them down,\" Harris said of her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Walz. \"Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it?\" the vice president asked before adding, \"We both know the vast majority of people in our country have so much more in common than what separates them.\"\n\nThis message is a mirror image of Trump's political method, which relies on tugging at the fault lines of US society for political gain.\n\nWalz rammed home the point, as if anyone in the packed arena filled by roaring cheers had missed it. \"Thank you for bringing back the joy,\" he told his new boss, as he riffed through a series of dad jokes about Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, showing why the Harris team thinks he'll be a hit in the Blue Wall battleground states that will decide the election.\n\nTwo visions for voters to consider\n\nThe new Harris-Walz double act struck a stunning contrast.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, Democrats dreaded Biden's small and glum campaign events when the 81-year-old president's stumbles revived memories of his disastrous Atlanta debate performance.\n\nNow, they have a candidate and a running mate who can draw a massive crowd, inspire the base and project vigor and hope in a way that will take the battle to Trump over the frenetic last three months of the campaign.\n\nMultiple rallygoers Tuesday expressed delight at the extraordinary twist in their fortunes at an event that conjured flashbacks to Barack Obama's hope-and-change rallies of 2008, especially when the crowd chanted \"Yes We Can\" when Harris pledged to save the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"I couldn't be more delighted,\" said Karla D'Alessio, from Hatfield, Pennsylvania. \"I wish all elections were 100 days,\" she added, referring to the truncated race to November with a suddenly dynamic Democratic ticket.\n\nGini George, who was born in Mumbai and especially identifies with Harris' South Asian heritage, glowed with happiness and said, \"I love it,\" when asked about the new Harris-Trump matchup. She also praised Walz for his early defense of LGBTQ rights. Both women expressed reverence for Biden's decision to step aside and allow his party to finally pass the torch.\n\nThe optimism, laughter and positive energy in Philadelphia on Tuesday felt like a different planet from the dystopian dirge of Trump rallies, which devolve into festivals of personal vengeance for a candidate who has tripled down on the American carnage mantra of his first inaugural address.\n\n\"We are a nation in decline, we are a failing nation,\" Trump said at a typical event in Manchester, New Hampshire, in January, portraying the US as a hellscape of energy shortages, drug-infested cities, out-of-control immigration and crime. He added: \"We are a nation that has lost its confidence, its willpower and its strength. We are a nation that has lost its way.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump reinforced his favorite conceit - that if Americans don't vote for him, they won't have a country anymore, reacting to the vice president's running mate pick with a warning that hardly seemed apt, given Walz's Minnesota nice manner. \"TIM WALZ WILL UNLEASH HELL ON EARTH! He's already pulling in MILLIONS to WIPE MAGA OUT,\" the ex-president said in a fundraising email.\n\nThe risks ahead of Harris\n\nAmerica now has a choice between the former president's nightmarish vision of national decline that only a strongman can fix and Harris' optimistic vow that America is still a land of aspiration.\n\nBut that dichotomy also points to a huge risk for Harris.\n\nRunning a campaign rooted in hopefulness and good cheer at a time when many Americans feel demoralized and tired could backfire. After all, years of decaying economic security exacerbated by high inflation and elevated grocery prices during the Biden administration created the kind of conditions in which Trump's populist demagoguery can prosper. If the vice president misjudges the national mood, her campaign could come across as oblivious to the concerns of many voters. It was noticeable, for instance, that while Harris pledged to bring down prices and fight for the middle class, her speech on Tuesday was light on details of exactly how she would alleviate the economic stress that many people are feeling.\n\nWithout solutions, Harris' hope-fueled speeches could become bromides by repetition, especially if Trump has more accurately judged America's collective psyche than she has. Harris is, after all, a key part of an unpopular administration - which, for all its success in passing sweeping legislation that could revive US manufacturing and overhaul the country's infrastructure, has not been able to convince millions of Americans of the reality of the country's relatively strong economic rebound after the pandemic.\n\nTuesday's rally proved the vice president can draw a crowd and work it -- to great theatrical effect. But her most significant assignment in the next two months will come in convincing Americans she can meet building crises at home and abroad -- as evidenced by a stock market plunge on the eve of her running mate selection and fears the Middle East is on the precipice of a wider war.\n\nStill, in a race likely to be decided across the three battleground states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, Walz may be able to reach rural voters that the California Democrat can't. While the Minnesota governor is not going to help her beat Trump in his rural heartlands, any trimming of the ex-president's margins there could complement Harris' expected high turnout among inner city minority voters and suburban women.\n\nWalz praised Harris as a prosecutor, a senator and a vice president who had dedicated her life to serving her country while arguing that Trump only served himself.\n\nThe symbolism of reassurance was strong. A plainspoken, White, Midwestern dad, football coach and high school teacher who reached the rank of command sergeant major in the Army National Guard was vouching for the values and patriotism of a running mate who is being demeaned by Trump as a racial chameleon and out of the American cultural and political mainstream.\n\nIronically, given the events of the last two weeks, Walz is serving a similar role that then-vice presidential nominee Biden played for future President Obama in 2008.\n\nWalz is sure to reprise his endorsement at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in a couple of weeks -- and on pretty much every day until Election Day as he and Harris set off on an exhausting journey.\n\n\"We have 91 days -- my God, that's easy. We'll sleep when we're dead,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_collinson@cnn.com", "name": "Stephen Collinson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temple University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Care_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Affordable Care Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_2008_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_inauguration_of_Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First inauguration of Franklin D.

Both women expressed reverence for Biden's decision to step aside and allow his party to finally pass the torch.\n\nThe optimism, laughter and positive energy in Philadelphia on Tuesday felt like a different planet from the dystopian dirge of Trump rallies, which devolve into festivals of personal vengeance for a candidate who has tripled down on the American carnage mantra of his first inaugural address.\n\n\"We are a nation in decline, we are a failing nation,\" Trump said at a typical event in Manchester, New Hampshire, in January, portraying the US as a hellscape of energy shortages, drug-infested cities, out-of-control immigration and crime. He added: \"We are a nation that has lost its confidence, its willpower and its strength. We are a nation that has lost its way.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump reinforced his favorite conceit - that if Americans don't vote for him, they won't have a country anymore, reacting to the vice president's running mate pick with a warning that hardly seemed apt, given Walz's Minnesota nice manner. \"TIM WALZ WILL UNLEASH HELL ON EARTH! He's already pulling in MILLIONS to WIPE MAGA OUT,\" the ex-president said in a fundraising email.\n\nThe risks ahead of Harris\n\nAmerica now has a choice between the former president's nightmarish vision of national decline that only a strongman can fix and Harris' optimistic vow that America is still a land of aspiration.\n\nBut that dichotomy also points to a huge risk for Harris.\n\nRunning a campaign rooted in hopefulness and good cheer at a time when many Americans feel demoralized and tired could backfire. After all, years of decaying economic security exacerbated by high inflation and elevated grocery prices during the Biden administration created the kind of conditions in which Trump's populist demagoguery can prosper. If the vice president misjudges the national mood, her campaign could come across as oblivious to the concerns of many voters. It was noticeable, for instance, that while Harris pledged to bring down prices and fight for the middle class, her speech on Tuesday was light on details of exactly how she would alleviate the economic stress that many people are feeling.\n\nWithout solutions, Harris' hope-fueled speeches could become bromides by repetition, especially if Trump has more accurately judged America's collective psyche than she has. Harris is, after all, a key part of an unpopular administration - which, for all its success in passing sweeping legislation that could revive US manufacturing and overhaul the country's infrastructure, has not been able to convince millions of Americans of the reality of the country's relatively strong economic rebound after the pandemic.\n\nTuesday's rally proved the vice president can draw a crowd and work it -- to great theatrical effect. But her most significant assignment in the next two months will come in convincing Americans she can meet building crises at home and abroad -- as evidenced by a stock market plunge on the eve of her running mate selection and fears the Middle East is on the precipice of a wider war.\n\nStill, in a race likely to be decided across the three battleground states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, Walz may be able to reach rural voters that the California Democrat can't. While the Minnesota governor is not going to help her beat Trump in his rural heartlands, any trimming of the ex-president's margins there could complement Harris' expected high turnout among inner city minority voters and suburban women.\n\nWalz praised Harris as a prosecutor, a senator and a vice president who had dedicated her life to serving her country while arguing that Trump only served himself.\n\nThe symbolism of reassurance was strong. A plainspoken, White, Midwestern dad, football coach and high school teacher who reached the rank of command sergeant major in the Army National Guard was vouching for the values and patriotism of a running mate who is being demeaned by Trump as a racial chameleon and out of the American cultural and political mainstream.\n\nIronically, given the events of the last two weeks, Walz is serving a similar role that then-vice presidential nominee Biden played for future President Obama in 2008.\n\nWalz is sure to reprise his endorsement at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in a couple of weeks -- and on pretty much every day until Election Day as he and Harris set off on an exhausting journey.\n\n\"We have 91 days -- my God, that's easy. We'll sleep when we're dead,\" he said.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

The ascension of Vice President Kamala Harris to the top of the ticket breathes new life into a dead campaign.\n\nMore: Republicans leave convention with sense of momentum | INSIDE THE STATEHOUSE\n\nBiden's decline, mentally and physically, assured a Democratic presidential defeat on Nov. 5, but also guaranteed the Democrats' loss of the U.S. Senate, as well as their hopes to wrest the majority of the House from the Republicans. The top of the ticket in a presidential year usually affects the results of down-ballot congressional races.\n\nThe national electorate is divided evenly right down the middle with 45% Democratic locked-in voters and a guaranteed 45% Republican voters. Therefore, the race between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump is all about turnout. It's turnout, turnout, turnout.\n\nIt does not matter how popular or what landslide numbers Trump gets in Alabama or how much Harris trounces Trump by in California, it is all going to boil down to which candidate's stalwart supporters turn out to vote in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia, Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nTrump and the Republicans came out of their successful GOP convention two weeks ago with a bump and a five-point lead. My guess is that when the Democrats end their convention in two weeks, Harris and Trump will be knotted at a dead even 45/45 in the six battleground states. The horse-race numbers will remain the same for the final two months leading up to the Nov. 5 election.\n\nIt will all depend on the enthusiasm and determination of the base of each team. Does the Trump conservative team vote enthusiastically as expected or does the liberal Democratic Harris team get its disciples to the polls? It will all boil down to turnout in six states. My guess is that the race will ultimately come down to Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nHarris is the best candidate that the Democrats could field. She perfectly reflects the heart and soul of the Democratic Party. She will energize this base vote, particularly African-American women. It will be close in November.\n\nBiden was in a diminished capacity when the Democrats ran him in 2020. They were able to hide him and not let people see him during that campaign year, and simply ran a campaign that was focused on voting against Trump.\n\nHowever, when Biden became president, he had to actually be seen and watched. It was apparent that he was not cognitively vital. Over the past two years, his condition has gotten progressively worse. This year, he has been on dramatic decline.\n\nIn recent months, there have been some very comical scenes. It would make for a reality comedy show. You will probably see a reel in future years entitled \"Old Joe Runs for President.\"\n\nThere are three scenes that stick out to me and would be his greatest hits. The first occurred at a D-Day event in France. You could tell that the European leaders were concerned and amused at Biden's diminished capacity and demeanor. They were lining up to take a picture with the other European leaders when, all of a sudden, old Joe starts wandering off toward a cliff and the Italian prime minister had to run grab him by the arm and bring him back.\n\nLater that month, they took Joe to a fundraiser in Hollywood with Liberal Elite, left-wing movie stars. He was on stage with Barack Obama. When the program came to an end, he stood there on the stage in one of his memorable stares into space. He stood there with mouth open and that blank look in his eyes that clearly said, \"Where am I? Where have they taken me?\"\n\nAfter four full minutes Biden staring frozenly into space, Obama took him by the arm and led him off the stage. The movie stars were probably thinking to themselves, \"I came here to give money to a presidential race and instead I'm contributing to a geriatric care fund.\"\n\nIndeed, Jill Biden has turned the White House into nothing more than the nation's most expensive nursing home.\n\nThe coup de gr\u00e2ce was the June 27 debate debacle. If everyone in the country did not know that Biden was out to lunch before, the 27 million people who watched that comedy show knew afterward. His incoherent ramblings and slurred incomprehensible mumblings were bad and revealed that he probably did not know where he was.\n\nThe saddest thing was that as Jill Biden helped him off the stage, she told him he did a good job.", "source": {"uri": "eu.tuscaloosanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Knoxville News Sentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_flowers@eu.tuscaloosanews.com", "name":

Trump has already installed many Republican election officials in swing states who are at his bidding and unlikely to certify election results when the results don't favour Trump. His declared plan to \"fix\" the system to secure his dictatorship, should be heeded by our policymakers. The rest of the world needs contingency planning to compensate for Trump's withdrawal from the battle against climate change, or we are truly doomed. Barry Laing, Castle Cove\n\nPeter Hartcher has stated the obvious ignored by almost all. Months before the 2020 US presidential election, Donald Trump made it clear that he would not accept defeat. Few, if any, predicted this. He continues with his Big Lie that he won that election. The choice before Americans now is dictatorship or civil war. The Orange One will trash the Constitution or the nation. Britain's race riots suggest that Trump will not need to order his MAGA army onto the streets. Social media disinformation will do the job. Dave Lee, Annandale\n\nI doubt the Harris team is under any illusions or taking anything for granted. They know the Republicans will play dirty. Much of mainstream media in the US and the likes of Sky News in Australia continue to distort the facts about the US election. Objective commentators are up against the powerful pro-Trump forces in the media, but are doing their best to counteract their misrepresentations. Some reputable pollsters are painting a more optimistic picture of Kamala Harris's progress. Harris is already gaining support beyond her base, and bear in mind she has only been on the campaign trail for a few weeks. Trump is looking rattled and comes across as a tired old salesman, peddling an outdated product. He has less chance of increasing support beyond his base than does Harris. Meanwhile, responsible news outlets are working overtime to increase awareness of Trump's plans to take control of the White House at any cost. The Democrats have every reason to be optimistic about the outcome of the election, but the US must be prepared for violence if Trump loses. Graham Lum, North Rocks\n\nHartcher provides realistic analysis of Kamala Harris's chances of winning the US presidential election. However, to suggest the possibility that Donald Trump could \"claim power illegally, by force\" should he lose the election is fanciful. With the US Constitution having executive, legislative and judicial branches, a coup d'\u00e9tat by Trump is impossible. Does anyone seriously believe Trump would be able to override the US armed services, the FBI, the Department of Justice, the US Congress, the governors of 50 states and the National Guard, not to mention a majority of voters who would have voted against him? Riley Brown, Bondi Beach\n\nYour report comments on the number of Trump's once-staunch supporters who left during his 90-minute meandering speech in Atlanta, Georgia (\"Trump left rattled by size of Harris' crowds\", August 8). These supporters are not the only Republicans who are deserting Trump: some respected Republicans are also turning against him. He is becoming so \"crazy\", incoherent, and \"weird\" that those who once ardently supported him now recognise that he is a danger to their country. It is to be hoped that this realisation is acted upon at the ballot box. The future of America, and the world, may depend on it. Douglas Mackenzie, Deakin (ACT)\n\nTwo great articles in the Herald: Peter Hartcher's and Charlotte Mortlock's (\"TikTokers love Kamala\", August 6). Each shows the risks that believing the hype surrounding Harris does not equate with a victory for her. In a world of insidious social media and unreasoned opinion miscast as fact creating false equivalences, there remains the danger that Trump will emerge as the next US President from an electoral system that is neither fair nor democratic. Let's not forget that the world believed that Hillary Clinton would win in 2016.

Looking at the six battleground states he won in 2020 -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- he was trailing substantially in the polls in all of them other than (occasionally) Michigan and Wisconsin throughout much of 2024. From both the point of view of state polling and the kind of following he had nationally, it was increasingly clear that Biden's strategy for winning depended on sweeping the so-called \"Blue Wall\" states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and avoid stumbling in any of the non-battleground blue states (e.g., New Hampshire, Virginia and Minnesota, all states with shaky Biden poll performances this year) or in the Second Congressional District of Nebraska, which, like the 1st District of Maine, casts its own individual electoral vote. Wins in these states plus the one Nebraska district added up to the bare minimum of 270 EVs.\n\nThis scenario left Biden no margin for error at all, and persistently troublesome polling in Pennsylvania (where Donald Trump led by 4.4 percent in the FiveThirtyEight averages prior to Biden's withdrawal from the race) made the \"Blue Wall\" strategy look fraught.\n\nNow that Kamala Harris is the Democratic nominee, the path to 270 EVs looks smoother and wider. She leads in the FiveThirtyEight polling averages in all three \"Blue Wall\" states: by two points (45.1 - 43.1 percent) in Michigan; by one point (45.5 - 44.5 percent) in Pennsylvania; and by 1.6 percent (46.1 - 44.6 percent) in Wisconsin. That's good. But what's even better is her improvement over Biden's showing in the Sun Belt battleground states his campaign was all but writing off. When he dropped out, Biden was trailing Trump in the FiveThirtyEight averages in Georgia by 5.9 percent. Harris trails by 0.7 percent (45.8 - 45.2 percent). Biden trailed in Arizona by 5.5 percent; Harris trails by 1.8 percent (45.8 - 44.0 percent). And Biden trailed in Nevada by 5.8 percent. While FiveThirtyEight hasn't posted averages for Harris-versus-Trump in Nevada, the Bloomberg/Morning Consult tracking poll shows her actually leading in the state by two points (47 - 45 percent). Harris's Rust Belt improvements don't seem puzzling, moreover, given her generally improved performance among the under-30, Black and Latino voters who are particularly important in these states.\n\nWhat does this mean strategically? For one thing, Team Trump is going to have to play defense in Sun Belt states that looked like a lock earlier in the year. But more importantly, Harris now has potentially multiple paths to 270 electoral votes. Let's say she loses Pennsylvania, arguably Democrats' weakest link in the \"Blue Wall.\" That's 19 EVs. But she could more than make up for such a loss by carrying the suddenly very competitive states of Georgia (16 EVs) and Nevada (6 EVs), giving her a total of 273 EVs and the White House. So Harris does not necessarily have to go for broke in Pennsylvania as a \"must-win\" state if for some reason Trump pulls ahead there as he did earlier against Biden.\n\nIn more than one way, this is a new presidential race.", "source": {"uri": "nymag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NYMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ed_kilgore@nymag.com", "name": "Ed Kilgore", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Whatever people think of Harris politically is how they will view Walz, offering little room for this ticket to grow past its base.\n\nFunny enough, I had a similar opinion about Sen. JD Vance of Ohio when Trump chose him as his successor. In the face of principled GOP objections to Trump, MAGA decided to stick to what it knows and ignore the rest of us.\n\nAs much as the parties want to point out they are different from each other, they certainly are the same when it comes to how they view this election: It's divisive.\n\nWith Walz as VP pick, Harris doubles down on her far-left plans. Republicans must use this.\n\nIt seems that both Trump and Harris view this election as one that will be determined by how much of their own party base they can rally to get out and vote, not by how broad an appeal they can generate.\n\nWhile the Trump campaign has softened stances on some policy issues, most notably abortion, to expand the party base, his choice of Vance revealed that he had no interest in drawing votes from the anti-Trump wing of the Republican Party.\n\nThe same goes for Harris in her choice of Walz. While Harris had ample opportunity to choose a vice presidential candidate who could bridge her appeal to moderates who are not fans of her or Trump, she instead chose a progressive extremist closely aligned with her politically.\n\nBoth parties are bound to see vicious attack ads on their choice for running mate from their rivals, but the choices themselves have already made these a nonfactor. The only people who are truly going to be swayed on such avenues of attack are those who are undecided, a small population that both parties have made clear they have no interest in swaying.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app?

However, moderates would have been attracted to somebody like Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who enjoys high approval ratings even in that hotly contested state.\n\nBoth sides are simply continuing the trend of increasingly polarized presidential elections.\n\nWhere do Gen Z conservatives go? Young Republicans against Trump are left without a political home. MAGA can't be it.\n\nThe extreme differences between the two offer little ground for agreement between supporters of both sides. In a time of escalating political violence, fueling the fires of polarization does little to assure Americans that their leaders have any interest in cooling tensions. Neither party is interested in unifying the country, and the VP race is the perfect example of that apathy toward the most important task at hand.\n\nVoters have little choice but to abstain from voting if they are dissatisfied with the choices presented. The \"lesser of two evils\" choices will only continue if people continue to allow them.\n\nAmerican politics are extremely polarized, which is impacting how we interact with each other. Neither Democrats nor Republicans seem all that concerned about bridging such divides, however. Now, voters have to decide.\n\nDace Potas is an opinion columnist for USA TODAY and a graduate of DePaul University with a degree in political science.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our USA

It's kind of plateauing, whereas Kamala Harris her sentiment is actually increasing through time.\n\nAnalysis by Permutable AI tracks sentiment around Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. It shows how Harris has seen a surge in positive headlines since Joe Biden announced he was stepping aside from the election race and his party rallied behind his vice president\n\n'And it's not only increasing. We saw an explosion in volumes for the past two or three weeks.'\n\nHis company's AI technology provides real-time 'sentiment analysis' of thousands of companies.\n\nSwitching it to look at the two candidates in the US election was simple, he said.\n\nThe algorithm assigns a score of 0 (negative) to 100 (most positive) for each headline associated with their name.\n\nFor Harris, recent negative headlines contained suggestions that it was bad for the party to change candidate so late in the race, or that her policies or values were unknown.\n\nFor example, this headline in the Arizona Daily Sun scored only four points: 'Bad policies, not gender, will cost Kamala Harris the presidency.'\n\n'Kamala Harris focusing on final contenders for her VP pick, sources say' (CBS News) was judged neutral, scoring 50 points.\n\nAnd a New York Times headline, 'Kamala Harris Rapidly Picks Up Democratic Support as 2024 Race Is Reborn,' scored a whopping 97 points.\n\nThe tudy looked at 130,231 headlines in 550 news outlets over the past three months and graded headlines on a score of 0-100 for Donald Trump and Kamala Harris\n\nThis headline, on a Newt Gingrich opinion piece for Fox News, scored 75 points in the analysis\n\nThis headline in the New York Times was worth a whopping 97 points\n\nA plot of the results reveals that Harris has generally maintained a higher score than Trump for the past three months, even though he generated a much higher volume of traffic.\n\nHe surged when a sniper's bullet grazed his ear at a rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nBut his lead was short-lived. When Biden stepped aside and his party quickly fell into line before Harris, her sentiment rating exploded, quickly overtaking Trump's score.\n\n'She maintains a comfortable lead in terms of sentiment,' said Chan.\n\n'And the volumes will be here to stay. We expect there to be persistent volume because she is now the leader of the party.'\n\nThe data also reveal how news outlets view the candidates and how their headlines tend to favor one or the other\n\nThe analysis can also be used to identify which news organizations give which candidates an easier ride.\n\nIt is no great surprise to see that Harris fares well with the New York Times (with a sentiment score of about 55 to her opponent's 49) while Trump gets a 49 with Fox News, compared with his opponent's score of less than 46.\n\nThe overall results reflect a good two weeks for Harris.

And during that time, she has not granted any interviews or held press conferences, setting a new precedent for candidate access to the press in an unprecedented election cycle.\n\nHarris has had a honeymoon period of sorts. The legacy media has showered her candidacy with glowing coverage from immediate comparisons of Barack Obama's political rise to reframing her word salads as meme royalty. She has tightened polls against former President Trump. And the honeymoon will likely continue with the selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as running mate and the upcoming DNC convention, where candidates historically receive a bump in the polls.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, she has avoided scrutiny.\n\nThe opposite had happened to her ex-running mate, President Biden, particularly in the days leading up to his exit from the race. Following his disastrous debate performance, the legacy media began scrutinizing the White House over Biden's health, his polling took a hit and Democrats launched an intense, unprecedented pressure campaign to remove him from the top of the ticket.\n\nNY TIMES EDITORIAL BOARD URGES KAMALA HARRIS TO 'DO BETTER' THAN BIDEN IN TAKING QUESTIONS FROM REPORTERS\n\nStunningly, Biden was quicker to grant an interview during a terrible news cycle than Harris has in the much more favorable news cycle she is currently experiencing, speaking with ABC's George Stephanopoulos eight days after his frail debate showing that scrambled the 2024 race. Subsequent interviews and rallies didn't undo the damage, and he dropped out of the race on July 21.\n\nEven Harris was far more accessible to the media in the aftermath of Biden's debate, making appearances on MSNBC, CNN and ABC to push the \"bad night\" narrative.\n\nWHY NOW? MEDIA OUTLETS LARGELY QUIET ON TIMING OF SUDDEN CRACKDOWN OF KAMALA HARRIS' 'BORDER CZAR' LABEL\n\nBoth Harris and Trump have been on the campaign stump during their newly-formed match-up, but only Trump has been doing interviews, most notably at the National Association of Black Journalists' annual conference in Chicago where he sparred with the panelists. Harris didn't attend.\n\nInstead, the media has heard from a plethora of high-profile Harris supporters. One of her top surrogates, Transportation Secretary and former VP contender Pete Buttigieg, has done at least 10 interviews hyping her candidacy and attacking the Trump-Vance ticket over the two weeks since Harris became the presumptive nominee.\n\nRepublican vice presidential pick JD Vance, who hopes to become the next vice president himself, specifically called out Harris as having a \"basement strategy\" on Tuesday and urged reporters to hold her more accountable.\n\n\"This is a person who has been a presumptive Democrat nominee for 16 days. She hasn't taken a single real question from a reporter,\" he said. \"The American people deserve to get to know the people who want to lead them, and I think it's shameful for Kamala Harris, but increasingly for the media, that she is taking a basement strategy of running from reporters instead of getting in front of them and answering tough questions about her record and letting the American people know who she is.\"\n\nIn the 17 days since she launched her campaign, Harris has not faced any questions about her knowledge of Biden's mental decline, how she would handle the ongoing escalation in the Middle East, the growing concerns of a recession, her record as \"border czar,\" the revelations surrounding Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff's extramarital affair during his first marriage, and the myriad far-left positions she embraced during her 2020 presidential bid, several of which her campaign has quietly tried addressing through reversal statements to the press.\n\n\"As long as she is getting so much favorable press coverage, there is no need for her to take the risks associated with doing unscripted press interactions,\" DePauw University journalism professor Jeffrey McCall told Fox News Digital. \"Harris has shown repeatedly over her political career that she's just not very good at speaking in extemporaneous situations. She is known for her word salads and unserious style.\"\n\n\"After all, Biden ran an unaccountable basement campaign in 2020, the media went along with it, and he got elected,\" he added.\n\nPerhaps her team has concluded the risk of doing interviews is too high. Many point to her damning 2021 exchange with NBC's Lester Holt when she famously said, \"And I haven't been to Europe,\" as she was pressed about not visiting the southern border after being appointed by Biden to address the root causes of the migrant crisis.\n\nPOLLING GURU NATE SILVER CHANGES HIS PREDICTION FROM TRUMP ELECTORAL VICTORY TO 'TOSS-UP'\n\nLast week, she raised eyebrows while speaking on the tarmac following the emotional return of Evan Gershkovich, Paul Whelan and Alsu Kurmasheva, three Americans freed from Russia as part of a historic prisoner swap.\n\n\"This is just extraordinary testament to the importance of having a president who understands the power of diplomacy, and understands the strength that rests in understanding the significance of diplomacy and strengthening alliances,\" Harris said in the unscripted moment.\n\nThe calls from news organizations for Harris to take their questions are few and far between.\n\nThe New York Times editorial board urged Harris to \"do better\" than Biden in engaging with reporters, something Biden scarcely did in comparison to his predecessors.\n\n\"President Biden has rarely granted the news media permission to ask questions on behalf of the American people, and on the rare occasions he did, his team sometimes sent scripted questions. It left him poorly prepared for the campaign trail and for confronting his opponent. Mr. Trump, too, rarely takes questions. Ms. Harris has the chance to do better,\" the Times editorial board wrote last month.\n\nCNN HOST SAYS HARRIS HAS 'EXPLAINING TO DO' OVER HER PAST LEFT-WING AGENDA\n\nBut beyond the Times' tepid plea, there has been almost no demand by the media for Harris to speak to journalists. Versus Media podcast host Stephen L. Miller suspected it's because no journalist \"wants to be the one seen by their colleagues\" as ultimately helping Trump win the election by creating the media event where Harris falters under pressure.\n\n\"This is their atonement for what they see were mistakes they made in 2016 with Hillary Clinton and her emails,\" Miller told Fox News Digital.\n\nOn Tuesday, Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer suggested other media outlets need to cover Harris' refusal to answer questions.\n\n\"We can't be the only media company that talks about it,\" Hemmer said on \"America's Newsroom.\"\n\n\"Sixteen days she has gone without a significant interview,\" Hemmer continued. \"I mean, is it possible that she runs the clock until Chicago? That'd be extraordinary. And then you'd have to ask yourself, 'What are you hiding? And what's your team hiding from?'\"\n\nHowever, not everyone thinks Harris needs to grant interviews. At least not now.\n\n\"Voters want to pick a winner, and Kamala Harris most looks like a winner when she draws thousands at a rally, not when she's having an interview with Lester Holt,\" said Democratic strategist Christopher Hale.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHale, who is spearheading \"Catholics for Kamala,\" told Fox News Digital there hasn't been a political setback for her to avoid interviews, pointing to her rising favorability since her campaign launch.\n\n\"The only way it'll hurt her is if the press corps start writing about how she isn't doing an interview. It would need to seep into public consciousness that she's avoiding a sit down,\" Hale said. \"What she's doing now is working, so I would keep doing it until it doesn't.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_wulfsohn@foxnews.com",

Vice President Kamala Harris apparently has momentum. Donald Trump was leading Joe Biden by three points. Now, he's leading Harris by less than one point.\n\nHowever, Harris is hiding from serious interviews and tough questions. She has avoided the media for two weeks now. Of course, she did go on RuPaul's Drag Show. That was really important to her, and that's very revealing. But it's starting to look like Harris is repeating Biden's 2020 basement strategy.\n\nA few weeks ago, Donald Trump had significant leads over Joe Biden in Arizona (6 points), Georgia (4 points), and North Carolina (5 points). We were told that Trump lost the first two states. But this time he was leading in all three and well on his way to reelection.\n\nNow Axios is reporting that with Harris as the Democrat nominee, all three states are toss-ups. Trump leads Harris in Arizona by 3 points. His lead in Georgia is down to 1 point. And the latest poll in North Carolina gives Trump a narrow 2-point lead.\n\nGiven the fraud we know is happening, this is disturbing news. If Trump loses any of those three states, it is really difficult to come up with a plausible way for him to win the White House.\n\nIf Trump sweeps those three states, which he must do, the race likely comes down to Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Trump has to win at least one of those three states to prevail.\n\nPennsylvania was looking good, but Harris has cut Trump's lead in half. If she picks Governor Josh Shapiro as her running mate, that could take Pennsylvania off the table.\n\nA lot has changed in two weeks. But there are still 90 days left. And there will be several more twists and turns. In fact, one of those twists may be happening right now. (See next item.)\n\nMarket Madness\n\nAs you know, Wall Street was shocked by Friday's report that job creation fell far short of expectations. In addition, the unemployment rate, which was supposed to remain flat, jumped by 5%. The effect on the markets was dramatic. Tech stocks, the most vibrant part of our economy, were hit the hardest.\n\nThat rout continued yesterday. Monday morning, the market opened with massive losses. The Dow Jones fell as much as 1,200 points and finished with a loss of 1,033 points. The Japanese stock market fell 12%, the Nikkei's worst day in 37 years.\n\nThe bottom line is that there are storm clouds in the markets, and no one understands why.\n\nAt the same time, multiple countries, including Britain, France, and the United States, are telling their citizens to get out of Lebanon any way they can. An attack against Israel by Iran is believed to be imminent, and Hezbollah in Lebanon is expected to participate in the attack.\n\nYou can make a strong case that all these threatening headlines are the direct results of Biden/Harris policies.\n\nTheir runaway spending that massively increased our debt resulted in an explosion of inflation, which has crushed family budgets everywhere. That necessitated a rise in interest rates to deliberately slow down the economy. Many experts believe the Federal Reserve kept interest rates too high for too long, and we may now be on the way to a recession.\n\nProfessor Jeremy Siegel, who is almost always upbeat on the stock market, is so concerned that he said on CNBC yesterday that the Federal Reserve needs to hold an emergency meeting now to announce a 0.75% cut in interest rates and do it again in September. He believes we are on the cusp of an economic disaster.\n\nOn the geopolitical scene, the Biden/Harris position has been one of weakness, as we have regularly outlined in this daily report. The disastrous retreat out of Afghanistan. Allowing a communist Chinese spy balloon to fly over the country. The failure to rebuild America's military as we face multiple threats all over the world.\n\nIt is inconceivable to me, with all these things happening, that Kamala Harris could be headed to the White House. Certainly, none of those things will improve under a Harris administration.\n\nRestraining Justice\n\nYou will recall that President Biden recently announced a plan to fundamentally transform the Supreme Court. The left is furious that there is one branch of government they don't control, and they intend to bring the court to heel.\n\nBut the Constitution created the Supreme Court as a separate and co-equal branch of government. It is not supposed to be subservient to the other branches of government. Nor is it supposed to be a rubber stamp for the left's radical agenda.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Sunday, Justice Neil Gorsuch was asked about Biden's scheme to transform the court. He wisely refused to get drawn into the presidential race by directly criticizing Biden's proposal. But he did say this:\n\n\"I have one thought to add: It is what the independent judiciary means - what does it mean to you as an American? It means that when you are unpopular, you can get a fair hearing under the law and under the Constitution. If you are in the majority, you don't need judges and juries to hear you and protect your rights. You are popular!\n\n\"It's there for the moments when the spotlight is on you when the government is coming after you. And don't you want a ferociously independent judge and a jury of your peers? Isn't that your right as an American? And, so, I just say, be careful.\"\n\nJustice Gorsuch also discussed his new book, \"Over Ruled: The Human Toll of Too Much Law.\" He warned about the explosion of new laws and regulations, saying:\n\n\"Some professors say that there are now so many federal laws on the books, crimes, that every American over the age of 18 commits one felony a day. [Since] 1970 to present, we've seen maybe a doubling in the number of federal crimes on the books ... and that's just the tip of the iceberg because federal agencies have been busy, too.\"\n\nTune In To Family Talk\n\nPlease tune in to Dr. James Dobson's Family Talk radio show. On today's broadcast, I talk with Dr. Owen Strachan, senior director of the Dobson Culture Center, about the issues confronting the church and our country today, as well as the need for Christians to be fully engaged in the battle for Faith, Family, and Freedom.\n\nYou can find station listings here.

But the fresh vibe in Philadelphia was striking because it emerged after one of the darkest chapters of modern US politics.\n\nAmericans have experienced a Trump presidency that threatened to tear the country apart, suffered through a pandemic that killed more than a million citizens and endured grinding years of economic insecurity caused by inflation and high grocery prices. For most of this year, the former president has promised a second presidency of retribution. President Joe Biden, meanwhile, had been delivering searing warnings that his rival was tarnishing the very soul of America, even as the haunting signs of the president's advancing age became increasingly painful to watch.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, the last GOP primary challenger standing against Trump, used to predict that the first party to ditch its old, White male presidential candidate in 2024 would get a massive boost. While Harris is yet to prove she can alter the fundamentals of a race against Trump, she's proving Haley's point, bringing some unexpected sunshine to an election year.\n\n\"We both believe in lifting people up, not knocking them down,\" Harris said of her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Walz. \"Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it?\" the vice president asked before adding, \"We both know the vast majority of people in our country have so much more in common than what separates them.\"\n\nThis message is a mirror image of Trump's political method, which relies on tugging at the fault lines of US society for political gain.\n\nWalz rammed home the point, as if anyone in the packed arena filled by roaring cheers had missed it. \"Thank you for bringing back the joy,\" he told his new boss, as he riffed through a series of dad jokes about Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, showing why the Harris team thinks he'll be a hit in the Blue Wall battleground states that will decide the election.\n\nTwo visions for voters to consider\n\nThe new Harris-Walz double act struck a stunning contrast.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, Democrats dreaded Biden's small and glum campaign events when the 81-year-old president's stumbles revived memories of his disastrous Atlanta debate performance.\n\nNow, they have a candidate and a running mate who can draw a massive crowd, inspire the base and project vigor and hope in a way that will take the battle to Trump over the frenetic last three months of the campaign.\n\nMultiple rallygoers Tuesday expressed delight at the extraordinary twist in their fortunes at an event that conjured flashbacks to Barack Obama's hope-and-change rallies of 2008, especially when the crowd chanted \"Yes We Can\" when Harris pledged to save the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"I couldn't be more delighted,\" said Karla D'Alessio, from Hatfield, Pennsylvania. \"I wish all elections were 100 days,\" she added, referring to the truncated race to November with a suddenly dynamic Democratic ticket.\n\nGini George, who was born in Mumbai and especially identifies with Harris' South Asian heritage, glowed with happiness and said, \"I love it,\" when asked about the new Harris-Trump matchup. She also praised Walz for his early defense of LGBTQ rights. Both women expressed reverence for Biden's decision to step aside and allow his party to finally pass the torch.\n\nThe optimism, laughter and positive energy in Philadelphia on Tuesday felt like a different planet from the dystopian dirge of Trump rallies, which devolve into festivals of personal vengeance for a candidate who has tripled down on the American carnage mantra of his first inaugural address.\n\n\"We are a nation in decline, we are a failing nation,\" Trump said at a typical event in Manchester, New Hampshire, in January, portraying the US as a hellscape of energy shortages, drug-infested cities, out-of-control immigration and crime. He added: \"We are a nation that has lost its confidence, its willpower and its strength. We are a nation that has lost its way.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump reinforced his favorite conceit - that if Americans don't vote for him, they won't have a country anymore, reacting to the vice president's running mate pick with a warning that hardly seemed apt, given Walz's Minnesota nice manner. \"TIM WALZ WILL UNLEASH HELL ON EARTH! He's already pulling in MILLIONS to WIPE MAGA OUT,\" the ex-president said in a fundraising email.\n\nThe risks ahead of Harris\n\nAmerica now has a choice between the former president's nightmarish vision of national decline that only a strongman can fix and Harris' optimistic vow that America is still a land of aspiration.\n\nBut that dichotomy also points to a huge risk for Harris.\n\nRunning a campaign rooted in hopefulness and good cheer at a time when many Americans feel demoralized and tired could backfire. After all, years of decaying economic security exacerbated by high inflation and elevated grocery prices during the Biden administration created the kind of conditions in which Trump's populist demagoguery can prosper. If the vice president misjudges the national mood, her campaign could come across as oblivious to the concerns of many voters. It was noticeable, for instance, that while Harris pledged to bring down prices and fight for the middle class, her speech on Tuesday was light on details of exactly how she would alleviate the economic stress that many people are feeling.\n\nWithout solutions, Harris' hope-fueled speeches could become bromides by repetition, especially if Trump has more accurately judged America's collective psyche than she has. Harris is, after all, a key part of an unpopular administration - which, for all its success in passing sweeping legislation that could revive US manufacturing and overhaul the country's infrastructure, has not been able to convince millions of Americans of the reality of the country's relatively strong economic rebound after the pandemic.\n\nTuesday's rally proved the vice president can draw a crowd and work it -- to great theatrical effect. But her most significant assignment in the next two months will come in convincing Americans she can meet building crises at home and abroad -- as evidenced by a stock market plunge on the eve of her running mate selection and fears the Middle East is on the precipice of a wider war.\n\nStill, in a race likely to be decided across the three battleground states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, Walz may be able to reach rural voters that the California Democrat can't. While the Minnesota governor is not going to help her beat Trump in his rural heartlands, any trimming of the ex-president's margins there could complement Harris' expected high turnout among inner city minority voters and suburban women.\n\nWalz praised Harris as a prosecutor, a senator and a vice president who had dedicated her life to serving her country while arguing that Trump only served himself.\n\nThe symbolism of reassurance was strong. A plainspoken, White, Midwestern dad, football coach and high school teacher who reached the rank of command sergeant major in the Army National Guard was vouching for the values and patriotism of a running mate who is being demeaned by Trump as a racial chameleon and out of the American cultural and political mainstream.\n\nIronically, given the events of the last two weeks, Walz is serving a similar role that then-vice presidential nominee Biden played for future President Obama in 2008.\n\nWalz is sure to reprise his endorsement at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in a couple of weeks -- and on pretty much every day until Election Day as he and Harris set off on an exhausting journey.\n\n\"We have 91 days -- my God, that's easy. We'll sleep when we're dead,\" he said.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

The second is 47, Donald Trump's current percentage in the polls and the number of the California proposition that will bedevil her run.\n\nAs to her general standings in the national polls, she is - so far - doing a bit better against Trump than the remains of Joe Biden did before his fellow Democrats unceremoniously chucked him on the cart:\n\nShe has also shifted the momentum in a few key swing states - whether or not that is due to people actually loving her and her policies or is more the result of the \"new car smell\" effect is not yet clear.\n\nHarris will win California, just as Biden would have - the question is by how much. In 2020, Biden beat Trump by a margin of two to one and Hillary Clinton did almost as well. In 2022, and before, statewide Democrats averaged 57.7% of the vote (except for one race in which Republican Lanhee Chen ran a perfect campaign and still only nibbled four points off that number.)\n\nHarris, though, is a known quantity in California which will both help and hurt her. What will specifically hurt is the presence of Proposition 36 on the ballot, the roll-back of the disastrous \"reforms\" of Prop 47. The state, and the nation, will be reminded that she played a key role in its passage by writing alternate reality ballot title and summary for 47.\n\nHarris, then state Attorney General, dubbed Prop. 47 as the \"Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act.\"\n\nShe may just as well have titled it the \"Everyone Gets a Cute Puppy Act\" for all the relation to reality her title had to the actual contents of Prop 47.\n\nProp 47 may well have passed without Harris' interference, but there is no question that she is in part responsible for the massive increase in crime and drug use in the state. And Prop. 36's much needed and very popular reforms could give voters pause: Why am I voting for Harris for president when I'm voting for a proposition to undo the damage she did to California?\n\nAnother drag on Harris may be the way she became the nominee. There are definitely grumbling Democrats, angry that their Biden votes were tossed aside and that the party had cleared the way for him in the first place all the while knowing his mental state was getting worse and worse. As its beneficiary, Harris will be seen as having taken part in that sordid process.\n\nNote - as to the complaint that the Democrats ignored the \"democracy\" they say Trump will destroy, it was - holding nose - legal. In the end, the party can pick whomever it wants, however it wants. To paraphrase mid-20th century songstress Lesley Gore, \"it's their party and they'll lie if they want to.\"\n\nEither way, Harris will take the state but the question of the margin of victory could be psychologically extremely important and this is where 48 and 49 come into play.\n\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton won the national popular vote while losing the electoral vote to Trump, a fact she reminds everyone of on every possible occasion (but do not call her an \"election denier.\")\n\nIt is a true statement, but still an extremely misleading one. Clinton won the popular vote by about 2.9 million votes nationwide. Her margin of victory over Trump in California was 4.2 million votes.\n\nWhat that means is that she technically won the popular vote, but really lost it by about 1.3 million votes in the rest of the country.\n\nA similar scenario played out in 2020. In Biden's popular vote victory, 5 million of his 7 million vote margin came from, again, California. Toss is New York for another 2 million more votes for Biden, and that's more than the total margin.\n\nBut in the rest of the country, Trump won. Twice.\n\nIn other words, Trump won both the 48 and the 49 state popular vote counts. And that's why the electoral college was created: to make sure massive states would not be able to run roughshod over smaller states when it came to picking the president.\n\nWhile not technically mattering, after each election the media drilled into the public's head that Trump lost the popular vote, therefore he wasn't really president, etc.\n\nThat's why the California margin is important.\n\nThere have yet to be released California polls on the Trump/Harris contest, but in previous Trump/Biden polls, Biden was getting only about 55% of the vote, about 8 points less than he got in 2020.\n\nHarris will most likely do better than 55%, but any margin slimmer than Biden's jeopardizes he chance to claim popular vote winner, no matter how the electoral count ends up. And, if Trump wins but Harris gets more votes, the same tired claims of a whiff of illegitimacy will be rolled out for yet another four years.\n\nAnd that won't be good for anyone.\n\nAuthor Recent Posts Thomas BuckleyThomas Buckley is the former mayor of Lake Elsinore, CA, a Senior Fellow at the California Policy Center, and a former newspaper reporter.

But one poll, three months out, counts for little.\n\nHarris might expect another poll bump on Tuesday after her appearance with her running mate, who has been named by US sources hours before the rally as Tim Walz, governor of Minnesota.\n\nBut more significant is the news from Wall Street, which appears to confirm that the Harris honeymoon is over.\n\nBig share price falls across the board have followed imploding AI stocks and weaker-than-expected US July job figures.\n\nLast month, the economy gained just 114,000 jobs, and unemployment rose to 4.3 per cent from 4.1 per cent, largely because of an influx of job seekers re-entering the workforce.\n\nNaturally, Trump didn't need an invitation to attack President Biden and Harris over the negative economic news.\n\n\"Stock markets are crashing, jobs numbers are terrible, we are heading to World War III, and we have two of the most incompetent 'leaders' in history,\" the former president and Republican presidential nominee wrote in a post on Truth Social. \"This is not good.\"\n\nTrump's love of using share prices as a gauge of economic health is crude - and highly selective. He fails to mention that the S&P 500 is still 15 per higher over the past year, and up 30 per cent since Biden's inauguration. Several of the market's biggest drops ever took place during Trump's presidency, in the early days of the pandemic, when he botched the response to appalling and deadly effect.\n\nRepublicans have begun howling about the \"Kamala crash\" - and are likely to continue if the share slide grows, and the job figures get worse.\n\n\"Harris will announce her running mate and then progress to the DNC [Democratic National Convention], where she and the party really need to craft a strong message and meaningful set of talking points about the economy,\" says Todd Landman, an American political scientist at Nottingham University. \"The economic woes combined with the volatile geopolitical challenges make for a very difficult period in the campaign.\"\n\nTo be clear, the latest figures are hardly disastrous, and jobs are being created - but far more slowly than in recent months. The speed of the change has surprised some economists. In June, the economy added 179,000 jobs, while in May, it added 216,000.\n\n\"Stock fluctuations do not translate immediately to the kitchen table, but a looming recession can have profound effects on jobs and household income levels,\" says Landman. He notes that the US Federal Reserve will have to be careful in contemplating any rate cuts, as these could lead to a rise in inflation.\n\nAccording to another politics pundit, Patricia Crouse at the University of New Haven: \"The economy is usually always the number one issue for voters. If Trump's campaign people can get him to pivot to that, it could be a winning issue for him. We all remember James Carville's paraphrased quip, 'It's the economy, stupid', during the Clinton/Bush campaign and how successful that was.\"\n\nThe danger to Harris is underlined by how the Biden administration was already under fire by many voters on its economic record when most key indicators were going in the right direction.\n\nA year ago, more than 40 per cent of US voters who backed Biden in 2020's presidential election thought the economy had deteriorated since, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found.\n\nBiden had reason to feel peeved. His predecessor Trump grew the national debt by 33 per cent, with huge tax cuts for the rich. Under Biden, the debt had increased by less than 9 per cent despite him having to deal with the effects of a pandemic (made worse by Trump) and huge investment to boost US productivity. Under Biden, employment levels have risen significantly.\n\nUntil last month, the good news appeared to continue, with inflation falling to 3.1 per cent.\n\nBut many voters are having none of it. It appears that inflation - the immediacy of having to pay more for everyday things - is what sticks in Americans' minds and their craws.\n\nAfter high inflation is largely tamed, prices don't go down, they simply rise less quickly, so the damage is done.\n\nIn the 1990s, Yale University economics professor and Nobel Prize winner Robert Shiller found that inflation was associated with \"a tone of moral indignation\".\n\nUnfortunately for Harris, the politically damaging effects of inflation are being exacerbated by the fact that, for voters under the age of 45, it's a shocking, new phenomenon.\n\nFigures show how disposable income and therefore living standards are far lower than they were at their peak at the start of 2020 before the pandemic and Ukraine war, both of which contributed to the surge in inflation.\n\nAdam Quinn, a political scientist at Birmingham University, says the winner of this election is \"likely to inherit an economy that's set for some good years, having ridden out the wild Covid years better than any other\".\n\nMuch of that strength will come from Biden's decision to invest heavily in infrastructure and renewables.\n\nQuinn adds: \"That would be galling if it's Trump, of course.\n\n\"For Harris now, the challenge will be to try and claim shared credit for the Biden-Harris administration's successes without getting dragged down by association with the things people hated, like the surge in inflation after 2021.\n\n\"Polling suggests she may have a better shot at this than Biden did, though, so all to play for.\"", "source":

To cut through the noise, we're launching Campaign Context, a series providing clarity on the messages you're hearing from candidates on the campaign trail. We're digging past the politics and into the facts to provide you with the transparent, spin-free information you need to make informed decisions this election season.\n\nAUSTIN (KXAN) -- Just hours after Vice President Kamala Harris announced Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate Tuesday, Harris and Walz wasted no time appealing to battleground state voters by holding a rally in Philadelphia.\n\nREAD MORE: Campaign Context\n\nPennsylvania is widely considered a battleground state in the 2024 presidential election along with six other states -- Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona, Nevada and Georgia.\n\nAfter President Biden stepped aside in the race, KXAN wondered whether the Harris campaign would follow the same playbook used by Biden, so we reached out to Dr. Richard Pineda, a professor at University of Texas at El Paso. Pineda said there are a few key areas where Harris will likely adjust her strategy.\n\n\"In some of the traditional industrial states -- we're talking about Michigan and Pennsylvania -- I think that the vice president needs to really talk about the economic benefits that this administration has brought, especially on infrastructure development,\" Pineda said. \"I don't think that the president would not have done that, but I think that it's even more important for her to talk about her role in making those decisions and being a part of the conversation.\"\n\nPineda said South Carolina and Georgia could be in play for Democrats this election in part because virtually all polling shows Harris leads Trump among Black voters by a wide margin. A national polling average shows Harris leads with Black voters by 53.1 points (72.4 percent to 19.3 percent).\n\nPineda also said Harris has an opportunity to gain votes from women who identify as moderately conservative and \"who might be afraid of a four-year Trump term and the impact potentially on reproductive rights.\"\n\nAs for former President Trump's campaign, Pineda said a big shift in strategy is unlikely.\n\n\"On the Republican side, I don't necessarily see there's going to be much of a change,\" Pineda said. \"You've already heard some of the rhetoric. The former president is really good at using immigration and forcing that as an issue no matter where he goes, so I don't think that changes.\"\n\nWhile Trump isn't expected to make a significant shift in campaign strategy, Pineda did say he sees mounting pressure on Trump and his running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance, to talk more about how they plan to empower the middle class now that Harris is the Democratic nominee.\n\nTrump is set to travel to Montana on Friday, a state where he won almost 57% of the vote in 2020, followed by Colorado on Saturday. Harris and Walz will continue to target those battleground states -- hitting all seven in a campaign blitz over the next four days.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

I'm Bill Thomas, we've got some very urgent stories to get to, and here's what's going on.\n\nThe New York judge in charge of former President Donald Trump's criminal case has added some dates to the courtroom agenda, the Democrats have officially nominated their presidential candidate, and the vice president has chosen her running mate. Also, a popular social media platform is suing advertisers, and a Pakistani national has been charged with a murder plot against U.S. officials.\n\nIn a letter to Trump's legal team and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office, New York State Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan said that he will rule on the former president's motion for the judge to recuse himself next Monday, but so far, previous motions have been struck down by the judge and a state appeals court.\n\nMerchan also said that he'll decide, by Sept. 16, on a request submitted by Trump's attorneys. They asked that certain social media posts made by the former president, which were cited as evidence by prosecutors in the case, be covered by the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that found former presidents should enjoy immunity for their official acts.\n\nIn case you don't remember, in late May, Trump was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records. The case was in relation to payments that Trump authorized his former lawyer to make toward the end of his 2016 campaign to adult film star Stormy Daniels, in order for her to remain quiet about claims of an affair.\n\nThe former president has denied the affair took place and had pleaded not guilty to the charges, saying the case was politically motivated. His attorneys have said that he intends to appeal the jury's verdict.\n\nBy the way, Trump also faces cases in several other jurisdictions, although two of them are stalled. He has pleaded not guilty in those cases, as well.\n\nYou should also know that last month, a Florida federal judge dismissed a federal classified documents case against Trump, ruling that special prosecutor Jack Smith was not lawfully appointed by the Department of Justice.\n\nHarris and Trump are now deadlocked in a race that has taken presidential politics to a place we've never seen in the modern era.\n\nLet's break it down. Over the course of three days last month, Trump survived an assassination attempt, was formally nominated by his party, and named Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate.\n\nLess than a week later, President Joe Biden abruptly withdrew from the race and endorsed Harris. In fact, she became the Democratic nominee without winning a single primary election, something that hasn't happened since 1968.\n\nYet, despite these extraordinary circumstances, political experts say the old rules of politics will still apply: the winner will likely be the candidate who can maintain their base, present an issues-driven appeal to independent voters, and turn out the vote on Election Day.\n\nBy the way, current polling shows that the race is essentially tied. Harris and Trump are each polling within the margin of error in national polls. However, in the battleground states, recent surveys have shown Harris with a slight lead in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and Trump leading in Arizona, Nevada, and North Carolina.\n\nAs of today, Harris and Trump have less than three months to settle on the best issues and messaging to present to the voters, and the big election is coming up on Nov. 5.\n\nIt also kicks off a four-day battleground state tour that will take Harris and her new running mate to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Arizona, and Nevada.\n\nIn case you're not familiar with the Minnesota governor, he's 60 years old and began his career in the Army National Guard, serving for 24 years, before becoming a high school teacher in Mankato. Walz is a former congressman, who, while in the House, was the highest-ranking enlisted soldier to serve in Congress.\n\nWalz was elected governor of Minnesota in 2018 and while in office, advocated for free school meals for students, pushed to get Minnesota on 100 percent \"clean electricity\" by 2040, and expanded paid leave for workers.\n\nOther candidates that made the vice presidential shortlist included Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg.\n\nWalz is generally viewed as popular with Midwestern and union voters, and is sometimes highlighted for his military background. In case you weren't aware, Minnesota is one of the most reliably Democratic states in presidential elections, and it hasn't voted for a Republican in 52 years.\n\nX's CEO Linda Yaccarino says the complaint, which was filed in federal court in Texas, is also aimed at the World Federation of Advertisers and its members, including Mars, Orsted, and CVS Health. She said the illegal behavior of these organizations and their executives has cost X billions of dollars. By the way, GARM is commissioned by the World Federation of Advertisers, according to its website.\n\nYou should know that X, formerly Twitter, filed the lawsuit after it reviewed a recent investigation by the House Judiciary Committee. The committee found that GARM allegedly organized boycotts and other indirect tactics to target platforms, content creators, and news organizations it didn't like, in an effort to demonetize and limit certain choices for consumers. Members of the committee say they're trying to determine whether the current laws on the books are enough to deter anti-competitive collusion in online advertising.\n\nMusk also wrote about the lawsuit, describing his relationship with advertisers as \"a war\" after \"getting nothing but empty words\" two years after he took over the company.\n\nIn defense, GARM says it creates voluntary industry standards on brand safety and suitability, which media sellers and ad tech companies can voluntarily adopt, adapt, or reject.\n\nInteresting to note, that GARM was created in 2019 in order to curb the proliferation of \"dangerous, hateful, disruptive and fake content online.\"\n\nIt identified 46-year-old Asif Merchant, also known as \"Asif Raza Merchant,\" as part of a scheme that targeted public figures within the United States.\n\nAccording to court documents, Merchant arrived in the United States from Pakistan in April, after spending time in Iran, and allegedly looked to hire hitmen to carry out assassinations on American soil. Court documents state he used operational security measures, such as multiple cell phones and removing them during sensitive discussions, to avoid surveillance.\n\nDuring meetings in New York, Merchant outlined a plan involving multiple criminal schemes, including organizing protests as distractions, and the assassination plot. Merchant met with individuals in June that he believed to be hitmen, but who were actually undercover FBI agents, to arrange the logistics of the plot.\n\nIn the end, the DOJ says it took a coordinated effort involving multiple FBI field offices and the New York City Police Department, among other agencies, to take Merchant down.\n\nSo you know, he was arrested last month and is currently in federal custody in New York.\n\nThis arrest reinforces what the DOJ says is its commitment to thwarting Iran's ongoing efforts to retaliate against American officials, particularly in response to the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani. Soleimani was killed in Baghdad in January 2020, during the Trump administration.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland says that the Justice Department will spare no resources when it comes to disrupting people willing to do Iran's deadly bidding against U.S. citizens and that the DOJ will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to endanger America's national security.\n\nAnd with that, it looks like our time is just about up for today, so we're going to call it a wrap for the Wednesday edition of The Epoch Times News Brief.\n\nWhatever you have planned for today, when you're out and about, it would mean so much to us if you could tell some people you know about our program.

He is radically pro-abortion access, has called for an assault weapons ban and is weak on illegal immigration. He is a perfect candidate for Harris to appeal to her progressive base and for Republicans to go after.\n\nHowever, the choice reveals one thing about this election: Harris and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump have little interest in expanding their appeal to voters put off by their candidacy.\n\nWalz's appeal is broadly the same as Harris' as he shares the same progressive ideology. Whatever people think of Harris politically is how they will view Walz, offering little room for this ticket to grow past its base.\n\nFunny enough, I had a similar opinion about Sen. JD Vance of Ohio when Trump chose him as his successor. In the face of principled GOP objections to Trump, MAGA decided to stick to what it knows and ignore the rest of us.\n\nAs much as the parties want to point out they are different from each other, they certainly are the same when it comes to how they view this election: It's divisive.\n\nWith Walz as VP pick, Harris doubles down on her far-left plans. Republicans must use this.\n\nIt seems that both Trump and Harris view this election as one that will be determined by how much of their own party base they can rally to get out and vote, not by how broad an appeal they can generate.\n\nWhile the Trump campaign has softened stances on some policy issues, most notably abortion, to expand the party base, his choice of Vance revealed that he had no interest in drawing votes from the anti-Trump wing of the Republican Party.\n\nThe same goes for Harris in her choice of Walz. While Harris had ample opportunity to choose a vice presidential candidate who could bridge her appeal to moderates who are not fans of her or Trump, she instead chose a progressive extremist closely aligned with her politically.\n\nBoth parties are bound to see vicious attack ads on their choice for running mate from their rivals, but the choices themselves have already made these a nonfactor. The only people who are truly going to be swayed on such avenues of attack are those who are undecided, a small population that both parties have made clear they have no interest in swaying.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app?

However, moderates would have been attracted to somebody like Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who enjoys high approval ratings even in that hotly contested state.\n\nBoth sides are simply continuing the trend of increasingly polarized presidential elections.\n\nWhere do Gen Z conservatives go? Young Republicans against Trump are left without a political home. MAGA can't be it.\n\nThe extreme differences between the two offer little ground for agreement between supporters of both sides. In a time of escalating political violence, fueling the fires of polarization does little to assure Americans that their leaders have any interest in cooling tensions. Neither party is interested in unifying the country, and the VP race is the perfect example of that apathy toward the most important task at hand.\n\nVoters have little choice but to abstain from voting if they are dissatisfied with the choices presented. The \"lesser of two evils\" choices will only continue if people continue to allow them.\n\nAmerican politics are extremely polarized, which is impacting how we interact with each other. Neither Democrats nor Republicans seem all that concerned about bridging such divides, however.

The two political parties' delegates have made their respective nominations official. In less than 90 days, the electorate heads to the polls to make their voices heard.\n\nVice-President Harris and former president Donald Trump are now the embodiment of contrasting visions seeking to shape the trajectory and pathway of the nation. Theirs is now a fight for the future; a battle over ideas, values, and identity.\n\nGOP contender Trump, despite the denunciations, recriminations, and rejections, has already cast the die for his portrait of America under a second term. The controversial Project 2025, a 922-page policy prescription offers a clear, albeit frightening blueprint for a re-imagined federal government beginning in the year 2025 should Trump win in the fall.\n\nAuthored by many former senior officials and cabinet secretaries from the Trump Administration including Ken Cuccinelli, Dr. Ben Carson, and Peter Navarro, Project 2025 is described as \"...the opening salvo of the 2025 presidential transition...\" which offers clear mandates for \"White House offices, Cabinet departments, Congress, and agencies, commissions, and boards.\" A whole-of-government approach for re-orienting every lever of power to meet a conservative agenda.\n\nSuch highlights include:\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic presidential nominee Harris, while not as descriptive and definitive, is promising a continuation of many of the policies implemented and proposed under the Biden Administration. Such initiatives include the most recently proposed term limits on Supreme Court justices and restoring freedoms on abortion as the law of the land. A campaign still less than a month old, Harris' nascent candidacy is still taking shape as she seeks to further define herself and project her image of governance under a Harris administration.\n\nGone are the stale, minuscule fights over age and character defects that underscored the race between Biden and Trump. In its place, an ambitious, grandiose and ideological test that seeks to challenge, engage, and press voters to act. To choose between a dystopian world void of basic freedoms where certain people are locked out or prohibited from vying for the American Dream, or an expansion of the welfare state enlarging the social safety net for the nations most vulnerable.\n\nThe Vice-President's full-throated amplification of her role as a full governing partner of the Biden Administration presents both a defence and appeal to remain in power. The Harris campaign's unifying spirit, aspirational messaging, and historic fundraising gives Democrats what they hope is a capable warrior to match the deafening and raucous roar of the Trump maga-phone.\n\nAnalysis by Bruce J. Schulman, the William E. Huntington professor of History at Boston University, of the Biden/Trump rematch, succinctly underscored the potential changes to the U.S. political landscape if such a race had continued. He states:\n\n\"Over the course of U.S. history, presidential rematches have signaled momentous political upheavals by revealing instabilities in the electoral system and exposing tensions in the coalitions of the major parties. They tend to mark the end of an era -- the last contest before major changes either in the system for selecting presidents or structure of the parties.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the debate debacle, Trump's fascist impulses seemed to be on a glide path to ending 250 years of American democracy. All the while, an ethically bankrupt Supreme Court and a comically broken and dysfunctional Congress appearing completely powerless to stop the authoritarian vicissitudes creeping toward Washington.\n\nHowever, the groundswell of activism and enthusiasm powering the Harris candidacy is rapidly morphing into a movement that could be a potent bulwark against the fascist tentacles that, until just weeks ago, were poised to latch onto U.S. political power. Still, with Harris atop the ticket, Professor Schulman's prescient prognosis of change appears likely. Political and institutional realignment is afoot and both candidates are pushing to be the agent of that change.\n\nU.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris admires the crowd during a campaign rally, Tuesday, July 30, 2024, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/John Bazemore)\n\nAs a new candidate emerges, testing a nation's long-held notions around race and gender, another one remains committed to pushing the boundaries of the electorate's sensibilities of basic trust and control. A political tug-of-war playing out in real time over the direction and leadership of the country.\n\nEx-president Trump's MAGA base has shown remarkable resiliency, influence, and longevity in American politics. However, Vice-President Harris is building a phalanx of politically engaged and astute voters affectionately known as the \"K-Hive\" which the left hopes can match the MAGA dynamism.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Atlanta, Aug. 3, 2024 (AP Photo/John Bazemore)\n\nFor now, former president Trump and Vice-President Harris are not only on opposing sides, but also occupying different realms of political space.\n\nHarris, either by design or happenstance, has taken a page from the lofty ethereal and elevated positioning of former president Barack Obama's groundbreaking 2008 campaign. A campaign that moves to inspire young people; galvanize the politically ambivalent; and motivate the moribund.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, grounded in a reality permeated by fear; wrought with cynicism; and distrusting of the existing system of checks and balances. This is the fight being waged and the electorate is now, finally vested. For this is not just a fight for control or for change but more importantly, it is a fight for destiny.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [],

She can&#8217;t believe why", "text": "Equinox is a gym known for being a pioneer in the world of luxury gyms. According to the company\u2019s website, \u201cEquinox invented the premium health and fitness space and has continued to define it as the brand\u2019s global reach expands and it diversifies into new spaces, offerings, and categories.\u201d This \u2018premium\u2019 experience comes with a hefty price tag. Depending on where one lives and how many Equinox locations they would like accessible to them, an Equinox member can expect to pay anywhere from around $200 to $400 monthly to use the gym chain\u2019s facilities. While this price may imply a high-end experience, this isn\u2019t always the case, as internet users have previously noted. For example, one user showed an overcrowded pool at an Equinox location that appeared unclean, blasting the chain for charging people $400 to swim in it. Now, another internet user has sparked discussion after sharing her own Equinox experience. No water for non-members In a video with over 727,000 views as of Saturday, TikTok user Jean (@thesolomentality) says she went into an Equinox in New York City to buy a bottle of water. In a comment, she clarified that she had previously gone to a nearby deli but all of their available water was warm. What happened next surprised her. \u201cI just walked into Equinox, because I was so parched, to buy myself a water bottle,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI walk in and I just go, \u2018Hi, I just want to buy a water bottle.\u2019 They go, \u2018Are you a member?\u2019 I go, \u2018No.\u2019 They go, \u2018You need to be a member to buy a water bottle.\u2019\u201d Jean says that even the employees began to laugh at the absurdity of her situation. \u201cLike, I just can\u2019t comprehend,\u201d she states. \u201cWhy do I have to be a member to buy a water bottle?\u201d \u201cI guess Equinox doesn\u2019t want nor need my business,\u201d she concludes. @thesolomentality A humbling experience #nyc #equinox #exclusive \u266c original sound \u2013 Queen Jean Commenters share their thoughts In the comments section, some users revealed their disbelief that Jean would choose Equinox as a place to buy water, with a few noting the reasons why they would not sell her the water. \u201cTo be fair that\u2019s a wild choice to buy water,\u201d wrote a user. \u201cCan you go into sams or costco without a membership?\u201d asked another. \u201cThey charge your account for items. They don\u2019t us your CC or cash,\u201d offered a third. Others claimed that they\u2019ve purchased items from Equinox without a membership in the past, so the ability to buy things like water without a membership may vary by location. While some were critical of Jean\u2019s choice of store, it isn\u2019t unheard of in New York City; in fact, one woman previously went viral after claiming that she bought an Equinox membership solely to use their bathrooms. The Daily Dot reached out to Equinox via email and Jean via Instagram direct message. The internet is chaotic\u2014but we\u2019ll break it down for you in one daily email.

Grayson, an Illinois sheriff's deputy, has been charged with murder in the fatal shooting of a woman inside her home.\n\nBy John O'Connor, Associated Press\n\nWednesday, Aug. 7, 2024 | 4:31 p.m.\n\nSPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker called Wednesday for the resignation of the sheriff whose deputy fatally wounded Sonya Massey in her home last month after the Black woman called 911 for help.\n\nPritzker, a Democrat, said Republican Jack Campbell should step down because \"the sheriff has failed.\"\n\nSean Grayson, 30, faces three counts of first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct in the July 6 shooting death of Massey, 36. Campbell, who hired Grayson for the Sangamon County Sheriff's Department in May 2023, reiterated his intent Wednesday to stay in the job.\n\n\"He has failed to explain how he ended up hiring this deputy sheriff who has been fired from other departments,\" Pritzker said of Campbell at an event in Chicago. \"He failed to put forward reforms that clearly need to be made, training and other reforms and still has failed to meet with the Massey family.\"\n\nThere is no evidence Grayson was fired from any previous job.\n\nGrayson has come under scrutiny because -- prior to becoming a law enforcement officer -- he was kicked out of the Army a decade ago for the first of two drunken driving arrests within a year. His law enforcement career included six jobs in four years, during which he received some reviews that indicated he needed more training and had one disciplinary problem.\n\nGrayson was fired on July 17 for violating use-of-force standards by shooting Massey rather than taking non-lethal action when he felt threatened by a pan of hot water she was holding, according to authorities.\n\nThe sheriff signaled Wednesday that he would stay on the job.\n\n\"I was overwhelmingly elected to lead the sheriff's office through both good times and bad,\" Campbell said in a statement. \"I am fully prepared to continue leading my office and serving the residents of Sangamon County through this difficult period, ensuring we learn from this tragedy and work toward a better future.\"\n\nPritzker, who with Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton met with Massey's family two weeks ago, faulted Campbell for not sitting down with family members.\n\n\"At a minimum, listen to them, hear them, and then hopefully, take action,\" Pritzker said.\n\nCampbell said he has requested meetings with the family four times through family-designated intermediaries, but none has been accepted. He said he would still like to meet.\n\nAt an appearance Wednesday afternoon at the Illinois State Fair, Pritzker doubled down on his criticism of the sheriff. He said Campbell has refused to answer questions, despite the sheriff's office establishing a web page strictly for answering news media questions about the case and releasing documents and conducting a slew of 15-minute interviews with various media organizations last week.\n\nThe governor said Campbell should have talked to the chiefs of departments previously employing Grayson, but documents Campbell released show he did. And the state Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board certified Grayson for duty six times.\n\nPritzker also said the Massey family has said publicly that they would like to meet with Campbell.\n\n\"If he's reached out, he hasn't done a very good job because the Massey family hasn't had the meeting that they've asked,\" Pritzker said.\n\nAn emailed request for comment was sent to Ben Crump, the civil rights lawyer who is representing the Massey family.\n\nCampbell also said he is willing to modify hiring practices but because Sangamon County follows statewide standards, necessary changes should be made statewide.\n\n\"I just want to know and he has been unwilling to answer the questions -- if he'd been willing to do these things, then act, he's had a month,\" Pritzker said. \"There would be a lot less frustration, a lot more, perhaps a sense of safety. But none of that was done by the sheriff.\"\n\nCampbell said his office is gathering facts necessary \"to make intelligent decisions and to avoid making changes that are unlikely to lead to meaningful results.\"\n\n\"I have worked tirelessly to make all the facts available to the public as swiftly and transparently as possible,\" Campbell said.\n\nThe sheriff's office \"continues to grieve for Sonya Massey and her family,\" Campbell said. \"While our grief cannot compare to the pain of the family, our office is trying to heal from within -- all employees of the sheriff's office feel betrayed by one of their own.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Sophia Tareen contributed from Chicago.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "john_o_connor@lasvegassun.com", "name": "John O'Connor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayson,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grayson, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grayson, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Campbell County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Campbell County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangamon_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massey_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Massey family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

JB Pritzker calls for downstate sheriff to resign over handling of Sonya Massey case", "body": "CHICAGO -- In a strongly worded public rebuke of another elected government official in Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker and Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton have called on a downstate sheriff to resign over his handling of the death of Sonya Massey, who was shot and killed by one of his deputies.\n\nThe state's Democratic leaders said Republican Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell \"should have taken his leadership role more seriously\" in a release issued several hours after the governor said on Tuesday that he was \"disappointed\" at the answers Campbell had given as to why the deputy who killed Massey was hired.\n\n\"The sheriff has failed,\" Pritzker said at an unrelated news conference Wednesday. \"He has failed to explain how he ended up hiring this deputy sheriff who has been fired from other departments, he failed to put forward reforms that clearly need to be made ... And still has failed to meet with the Massey family.\"\n\nWhile Pritzker said failing to meet with the family was not necessarily a fireable offense, he added that it \"just seems outrageous to me. At a minimum, listen to them, hear them, and then, hopefully, take action.\"\n\nThe statement from Pritzker and Stratton said Campbell has had \"ample opportunity to respond with conviction and purpose to questions\" about his hiring of Deputy Sean Grayson, who was fired over the Massey killing and has been charged with murder.\n\nPritzker and Stratton noted that they had met with Massey's family and \"made a commitment to support them in working for justice.\"\n\n\"We join the Massey family in calling for Sheriff Campbell's resignation immediately so the Springfield and Sangamon County community can begin to rebuild and restore trust between citizens and the sheriff's department,\" the statement said.\n\nCampbell issued a lengthy response Wednesday morning reiterating his determination to stay in office and questioning the motivation behind calls for him to step down.\n\n\"Calls for my resignation are nothing more than political maneuvering during a tragic event and only hurt the good citizens of Sangamon County,\" Campbell said.\n\n\"I was overwhelmingly elected to lead the Sheriff's Office through both good times and bad. I am fully prepared to continue leading my office and serving the residents of Sangamon County through this difficult period, ensuring we learn from this tragedy and work toward a better future.\"\n\nCampbell also said he has made four requests to meet with the Massey family through intermediaries, but those requests have been \"rejected or not accepted.\"\n\nWithout being specific, Campbell also indicated that his office thinks the shooting was wrong. \" All employees of the Sheriff's Office feel betrayed by one of their own,\" he said. \"The one responsible is in jail and will never work in law enforcement again.\"\n\nMassey's killing has led to protests in Springfield, Chicago and across the country and renewed a national conversation over the use of deadly force by police against Black people.\n\nThe Sangamon County sheriff's office was the sixth Illinois police department Grayson had worked for in less than four years. Before he went into law enforcement, Grayson had two DUIs on his record in nearby Macoupin County.\n\nRecords show before the Sangamon County sheriff's office hired Grayson last year, the office spoke with some of the law enforcement agencies that previously employed him and those agencies questioned his abilities as an officer, saying he needed more training.\n\nGrayson was dating the daughter of one of his references, a former Sangamon County sheriff's deputy who spoke positively of him.\n\nIn statements released last week, Campbell defended the process for hiring Grayson and downplayed comments from previous employers saying Grayson \"needed more training.\"\n\n\"This is not unusual for deputies with Grayson's experience, and is standard procedure for Sangamon County deputies,\" Campbell said. \"Grayson was subsequently sent to a 16-week academy training, a requirement for all new and lateral transfer deputies in our office.\"\n\nIn his statement on Wednesday, Campbell said his office \"is willing to modify our hiring practices in order to prevent an incident like this from occurring again.\"\n\n\"We have used a process that we believe was consistent with statewide standards. If these standards are deficient, we would advocate a change at all necessary levels,\" he said.\n\nDeputies on July 6 responded to a 911 call about a possible prowler outside Massey's home in an unincorporated area outside of Springfield. When Grayson, who is white, and another deputy officer arrived, Massey, who was Black, took a few minutes to answer the door and appeared confused. Her family has said she had mental health issues.\n\nThe two officers said they didn't find anyone around her home. Inside, a conversation ensued over a pot of boiling water on Massey's stove.\n\nAccording to body camera footage, Massey said, \"Oh, I'll rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\" before Grayson angrily replied, \"You better (expletive) not. I swear to God. I'll (expletive) shoot you right in your (expletive) face.\"\n\nGrayson then demanded that Massey drop the pot before shooting her. The Sangamon County coroner's office said she died of a gunshot wound to the head.\n\nGrayson was ordered held in custody about two weeks after the shooting. He has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct.\n\nIn 2021, Pritzker signed into law a sweeping criminal justice reform measure, known as the SAFE-T Act, which included a provision meant to improve the state's police officer decertification process. While there's no indication the law will be changed further in light of Massey's killing, Illinois legislative leaders have indicated they're open to proposals.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pritzker praised the Illinois State Police \"who did the investigation (of Massey's shooting) in a very short 10 days.\"\n\n\"Maybe the silver lining, if there is a silver lining in this, is that someone is being held accountable, and yet we have much more to do,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.arcamax.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arcamax_publishing@m.arcamax.com", "name": "ArcaMax Publishing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

J.B. Pritzker (D) on Wednesday called for the sheriff of Sangamon County to resign after one of his deputies fatally shot Sonya Massey, a 36-year-old Black woman, last month.\n\nPritzker said Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell had not adequately explained why he hired ex-deputy Sean Grayson, who had worked at six departments in four years. The governor also noted that Campbell has not introduced reforms in his department after the shooting and said it was \"inexcusable\" that Campbell hadn't met with Massey's family.\n\nGrayson, 30, killed Massey last month inside her home while she was handling a pot of water. He was charged with first-degree murder, official misconduct and aggravated battery with a weapon on July 17. Campbell fired Grayson from the department the same day.\n\n\"A full month has passed since the murder of Sonya Massey. In that time Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell has had ample opportunity to respond with conviction and purpose to questions about his hiring of the perpetrator, Deputy Sheriff Sean Grayson, and about reforms he would propose for his department to avoid this from happening again,\" Pritzker said in a statement. \"The community remains in fear that calling the Sheriff's Office when they feel endangered will lead to another murder of an innocent resident.\"\n\n\"Rather than waiting for others to propose reform of the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office, Sheriff Campbell should have taken his leadership role more seriously,\" the governor's statement continued.\n\nIn his own statement on Wednesday afternoon, Campbell pushed back, calling Pritzker's comments \"political maneuvering\" during a tragic event. He said that all deputies in the sheriff's office \"feel betrayed by one of their own\" and that he had requested to meet with Massey's family on four separate occasions.\n\n\"The sheriff's office is willing to modify our hiring practices in order to prevent an incident like this from occurring again. However, before changes can be made, it is important to identify the problem,\" Campbell said.\n\n\"We have used a process that we believe is consistent with statewide standards. If these standards are deficient, we would advocate a change at all necessary levels.\"\n\nOn July 6, Grayson and another deputy responded to Massey's home after an emergency call about a possible prowler. Body-camera footage shows the two deputies questioning Massey outside of her home before eventually entering and asking for her identification.\n\nOnce inside her home, according to the footage, Grayson told Massey to turn off the stove because he did not want a \"fire to start.\" When Massey went into the kitchen to turn it off, she picked up a pot of water that had been on the burner. The other deputy moved backward, and Massey asked him what he was doing.\n\nThe deputy said he was moving \"away from her hot and steaming water,\" and stepped back.\n\n\"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\" Massey said.\n\nThe deputy appeared confused, and she repeated her statement. Grayson then drew his weapon and threatened to shoot her. \"You better fucking not, or I swear to God, I'll shoot you in your motherfucking face,\" Grayson told Massey while putting his hand on his weapon.\n\nMassey, still in the kitchen, said \"sorry\" and crouched down with the pot in her hand.

J.B. Pritzker called Wednesday for the resignation of the sheriff whose deputy fatally wounded Sonya Massey in her home last month after the Black woman called 911 for help.\n\nPritzker, a Democrat, said Republican Jack Campbell should step down because \"the sheriff has failed.\"\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nSean Grayson, 30, faces three counts of first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct in the July 6 shooting death of Massey, 36. Campbell, who hired Grayson for the Sangamon County Sheriff's Department in May 2023, reiterated his intent Wednesday to stay in the job.\n\n\"He has failed to explain how he ended up hiring this deputy sheriff who has been fired from other departments,\" Pritzker said of Campbell at an event in Chicago. \"He failed to put forward reforms that clearly need to be made, training and other reforms and still has failed to meet with the Massey family.\"\n\nThere is no evidence Grayson was fired from any previous job.\n\nGrayson has come under scrutiny because -- prior to becoming a law enforcement officer -- he was kicked out of the Army a decade ago for the first of two drunken driving arrests within a year. His law enforcement career included six jobs in four years, during which he received some reviews that indicated he needed more training and had one disciplinary problem.\n\nGrayson was fired on July 17 for violating use-of-force standards by shooting Massey rather than taking non-lethal action when he felt threatened by a pan of hot water she was holding, according to authorities.\n\nThe sheriff signaled Wednesday that he would stay on the job.\n\n\"I was overwhelmingly elected to lead the sheriff's office through both good times and bad,\" Campbell said in a statement. \"I am fully prepared to continue leading my office and serving the residents of Sangamon County through this difficult period, ensuring we learn from this tragedy and work toward a better future.\"\n\nPritzker, who with Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton met with Massey's family two weeks ago, faulted Campbell for not sitting down with family members.\n\n\"At a minimum, listen to them, hear them, and then hopefully, take action,\" Pritzker said.\n\nCampbell said he has requested meetings with the family four times through family-designated intermediaries, but none has been accepted. He said he would still like to meet.\n\nAt an appearance Wednesday afternoon at the Illinois State Fair, Pritzker doubled down on his criticism of the sheriff. He said Campbell has refused to answer questions, despite the sheriff's office establishing a web page strictly for answering news media questions about the case and releasing documents and conducting a slew of 15-minute interviews with various media organizations last week.\n\nThe governor said Campbell should have talked to the chiefs of departments previously employing Grayson, but documents Campbell released show he did. And the state Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board certified Grayson for duty six times.\n\nPritzker also said the Massey family has said publicly that they would like to meet with Campbell.\n\n\"If he's reached out, he hasn't done a very good job because the Massey family hasn't had the meeting that they've asked,\" Pritzker said.\n\nAn emailed request for comment was sent to Ben Crump, the civil rights lawyer who is representing the Massey family.\n\nCampbell also said he is willing to modify hiring practices but because Sangamon County follows statewide standards, necessary changes should be made statewide.\n\n\"I just want to know and he has been unwilling to answer the questions -- if he'd been willing to do these things, then act, he's had a month,\" Pritzker said. \"There would be a lot less frustration, a lot more, perhaps a sense of safety. But none of that was done by the sheriff.\"\n\nCampbell said his office is gathering facts necessary \"to make intelligent decisions and to avoid making changes that are unlikely to lead to meaningful results.\"\n\n\"I have worked tirelessly to make all the facts available to the public as swiftly and transparently as possible,\" Campbell said.\n\nThe sheriff's office \"continues to grieve for Sonya Massey and her family,\" Campbell said. \"While our grief cannot compare to the pain of the family, our office is trying to heal from within -- all employees of the sheriff's office feel betrayed by one of their own.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Sophia Tareen contributed from Chicago.", "source": {"uri": "clickorlando.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WKMG"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@clickorlando.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "john_o_connor@clickorlando.com", "name": "John O'Connor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayson,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grayson, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grayson, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Campbell County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Campbell County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massey_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Massey family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangamon_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

JB Pritzker called on Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell to resign Wednesday over his handling of the fatal officer-involved shooting of Sonya Massey - a request Campbell dismissed as \"political maneuvering during a tragic event.\"\n\n\"We join the Massey family in calling for Sheriff Campbell's resignation immediately so the Springfield and Sangamon County community can begin to rebuild and restore trust between citizens and the sheriff's department,\" Pritzker and Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton said in a joint statement.\n\nOn July 6, former deputy sheriff Sean Grayson responded to a report of a prowler at Massey's home. Bodycam footage from another deputy showed Massey saying she rebuked Grayson, and the former deputy threatening the 36-year-old Black woman. Grayson asked Massey to remove a pan of water from a burner on the stove. Grayson moved away from the steaming water.\n\n\"Sonya turned to face me holding the pot. I did not know the type of liquid that was boiling,\" Grayson wrote in his report three days after the incident.\n\n\"I advised Sonya to put the boiling liquid down. Sonya stated (she) was going to rebuke me in the name of Jesus. She stated this twice. I interpreted this to mean she was going to kill me.\"\n\nThe encounter ended with Grayson shooting Massey in the head and failing to render aid. Massey's family has said that Sonya Massey struggled with mental health issues.\n\nGrayson, a 30-year-old deputy who has since been fired, was indicted by a grand jury on July 17 on three counts of first-degree murder and one count each of aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct in connection with the shooting. Grayson has entered a not guilty plea and was denied pretrial release, according to court records.\n\nThe sheriff's office has come under scrutiny after it was disclosed that Grayson was discharged from the Army for serious misconduct and a history of driving under the influence yet still managed to get employed since 2020 by six Illinois law enforcement agencies - at three of them, as a part-time officer, employment records show.\n\n\"A full month has passed since the murder of Sonya Massey. In that time Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell has had ample opportunity to respond with conviction and purpose to questions about his hiring of the perpetrator, Deputy Sheriff Sean Grayson, and about reforms he would propose for his department to avoid this from happening again,\" Pritzker and Stratton said.\n\n\"The community remains in fear that calling the Sheriff's Office when they feel endangered will lead to another murder of an innocent resident,\" Pritzker and Stratton said.\n\nIn a statement, Campbell said his office \"continues to grieve for Sonya Massey and her family\" and that deputies in his office \"feel betrayed by one of their own.\"\n\n\"The Sheriff's Office is willing to modify our hiring practices in order to prevent an incident like this from occurring again. However, before changes can be made, it is important to identify the problem,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Calls for my resignation are nothing more than political maneuvering during a tragic event and only hurt the good citizens of Sangamon County. I was overwhelmingly elected to lead the Sheriff's Office through both good times and bad,\" Campbell said.\n\nPritzker and Stratton also criticized Campbell for not meeting with Massey's family, saying his \"refusal to meet with a grieving family face to face when one of your Sheriff's Deputies killed their innocent mother, sister and daughter is inexcusable.\"\n\nCampbell, in his statement, said his four requests to meet with the family have been \"rejected or not acacepted.\"\n\n\"I am still willing to meet with the family,\" the sheriff said.\n\nCNN has reached out to an attorney for the Massey family for comment.\n\nDeputy 'needed more training'\n\nCampbell has said no law enforcement agencies reported problems with Grayson before he was hired in Sangamon County, though previous employers had commented he \"needed more training.\" Grayson received 16 weeks of academy training, according to Campbell.\n\nGrayson's personnel file included \"references from people I know well,\" the sheriff said after the shooting, adding those \"insights are invaluable in making informed hiring decisions.\"\n\nThe former deputy was discharged from the US Army in 2016 due to \"misconduct (serious offense),\" according to a Department of Defense document included in Grayson's personnel file during his time at the Kincaid Police Department in Illinois. The personnel file was obtained by CNN affiliate KSHB.\n\nGrayson was charged with two DUI misdemeanor offenses in Illinois' Macoupin County - one in 2015 and the other in 2016, court records show.\n\nThe ex-deputy acknowledged the DUI charges when he applied to be an officer at Auburn Police Department in Illinois in 2021. He worked there from July 2021 to May 2022. CNN's review of Grayson's records there did not reveal any major problems or disciplinary issues.\n\nIn May 2022, Grayson started working at the Logan County Sheriff's Office in Illinois, records show. He wrote the sheriff a brief letter detailing his \"terrible decision to drink and drive.\"\n\nGrayson's letter also said he lost his driving privileges for one year after pleading guilty to his second DUI, in 2016.\n\nA background check was performed prior to Grayson's hiring in Sangamon County, Campbell said. Prior DUI convictions \"are not disqualifying criteria for a deputy,\" Campbell said.\n\nGrayson did not appear to have disciplinary issues as an Auburn officer but records from the Logan County Sheriff's Office recommended he take \"high stress decision making classes.\" The records said Grayson failed to slow down after his boss called off a vehicle pursuit. Grayson was driving about 110 mph before striking a deer, according to the records.\n\nA Logan County chief deputy wrote that Grayson \"failed to show due caution while driving through stop intersections.\" Grayson's supervisor \"terminated the pursuit\" and the deputy turned off his emergency lights, the report stated. But Grayson \"continued at a high rate of speed (110/55 mph zone) prior to striking the deer.\"\n\nAudio recordings that appear to coincide with Logan County's internal review of the incident captured the chief deputy admonishing Grayson for describing it inaccurately in his report despite previous orders to check for accuracy.\n\nA spokesperson for the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office has said the agency did not receive a complete disciplinary report from Logan County about Grayson, including his reprimand for an inaccurate report of the traffic incident.\n\nLogan County Sheriff Mark Landers told CNN in a statement that his office did not \"receive a formal or informal written request for Sean Grayson's personnel file and/or any disciplinary reports relating to Sean Grayson.\"\n\n\"Additionally, no member of the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office spoke to any member of my command staff about Sean Grayson prior to him leaving our employment,\" Landers said.\n\nGrayson's attorney Daniel Fultz has declined comment.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

JB Pritzker calls on Sangamon County Sheriff to resign over shooting death of Sonya Massey", "body": "CHICAGO (CBS) -- Gov. JB Pritzker is calling on a downstate Illinois sheriff to resign over his handling of the shooting death of Sonya Massey, who was killed by a sheriff's deputy who has since been fired and charged with murder.\n\nAt an unrelated event on Wednesday, Pritzker said he and Lt. Gov. Julianna Stratton have called on Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell to resign because, \"He has failed to explain how he ended up hiring this deputy sheriff\" who shot and killed Massey.\n\nThe video above is from a previous report.\n\nPritzker also criticized Campbell for not yet meeting with the Massey family since she was killed.\n\n\"I'm not saying that's a fireable offense to not meet with the family, but that just seems outrageous to me. At a minimum, listen to them, hear them, and then hopefully take action,\" Pritzker said.\n\nThe governor called Massey's death a \"terrible tragedy.\"\n\n\"A woman who called police to get help, asked them to protect her, was instead killed by the deputy sheriff - and if you watch the video, in a horrific fashion,\" Pritzker said.\n\nThe governor said he and Stratton have met with the Massey family to discuss ways the state might help prevent something like this from happening again.\n\nCampbell has defended his decision to hire Sean Grayson, the deputy who shot and killed Massey early on Saturday, July 6, at her house outside Springfield. He shot her when she checked on a pot of boiling water in her own kitchen while saying, \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\"\n\nGrayson was fired from the Sangamon County Sheriff's office and has been charged with first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm, and official misconduct in Massey's death. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nMeanwhile, his past has raised new questions over the decision to hire him in the first place. Before he was fired from the Sangamon County Sheriff's office, Grayson had worked for six law enforcement agencies in four years.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pritzker said he was \"disappointed\" with the answers Campbell has given for hiring Massey.\n\n\"How did the sheriff end up hiring this person -- must have known their background, must have. I mean, no one hires somebody without checking out the hiree's background,\" Pritzker said.\n\nDespite two previous DUIs and a discharge from the U.S. Army in 2016 for serious misconduct, Grayson was hired by the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office. Grayson also had a disciplinary file that included accusations of bullying behavior and abuse of power, records obtained by CBS News show.\n\nTwo of the six law enforcement agencies for which Grayson had worked since 2020 said he needed more training, while a third said he \"did not demonstrate good officer safety skills.\" But Campbell said Grayson had more training than most officers.\n\n\"He was certified to work in Illinois,\" said Campbell. \"He had to pass all the required testing. He was drug tested and, and he passed a psychological evaluation.\"\n\nCampbell said the two DUIs in Grayson's past were not a \"red flag.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Campbell County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Campbell County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayson,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grayson, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grayson, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangamon_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Pritzker says sheriff whose deputy killed Sonya Massey should resign", "body": "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker on Wednesday said the sheriff whose deputy fatally shot Sonya Massey had failed at his job and should resign.\n\nSangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell has resisted calls to resign, telling NBC News in an interview last week that Sean Grayson, the deputy who killed Massey in her home in Springfield last month, was solely responsible for her death.\n\nMassey called 911 early on the morning of July 6 to report a suspected prowler. Grayson and another deputy, who has not been identified, responded, and Grayson shot and killed Massey in an exchange over a pot of water.\n\nGrayson said in a report written three days after the shooting that he feared \"great bodily harm\" or death because Massey twice said, \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\" He said she later threw boiling hot water toward him. At the time she was shot, Massey is blocked from view in body camera footage released by the Illinois State Police, which conducted an independent investigation. Prosecutors have said the use of force was not justified.\n\n\"I called for the sheriff's resignation because the sheriff has failed,\" Pritzker told reporters at a bill signing Wednesday.\n\n\"He has failed to explain how he ended up hiring this deputy sheriff who has been fired from other departments,\" Pritzker also said, misstating that Grayson had been terminated more than once. \"He failed to put forth reforms that clearly need to be made -- training and other reforms.\"\n\nGrayson worked for six law enforcement agencies in central Illinois in four years. Nearly two weeks after Massey's killing, he was fired from the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office and charged with first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct last month. He has pleaded not guilty and is jailed without bond.\n\nGrayson joined the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office in May 2023, after short stints as a part-time officer at three small police departments, and full-time positions at one police department and two sheriff's offices, according the Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board. Those records show he sometimes worked two part-time jobs at once.\n\nWhile personnel records provided to NBC News by four of those departments do not include any complaints or disciplinary action against Grayson, he was admonished by superiors at the Logan County Sheriff's Office, where he worked immediately before he became a sheriff's deputy in Sangamon County. Grayson disobeyed an order to halt a high-speed chase that ended in him striking a deer, which violated department policy, according to a disciplinary report in his personnel file. Other records from Logan County also show he had been reprimanded over inaccuracies in his police reports, among other things.\n\nCampbell has said that he was not aware of documented issues with Grayson's performance at previous agencies.\n\n\"He had been hired by five other agencies prior to ours, certified by the state of Illinois six times, including us, to work as a police officer,\" Campbell said last week.\n\nAccording to Grayson's personnel file from Sangamon County, two of the six law enforcement agencies said he needed more training, while a third said he \"did not demonstrate good officer safety skills.\"\n\nGrayson's employment history, as well as two DUIs he pleaded guilty to in 2015 and in 2016 -- the first of which led to his discharge from the Army, have led Massey's family and many others to question how he was allowed to work in law enforcement.\n\nA handful of Sangamon County Board members are pushing a referendum that would allow voters to decide in November whether Campbell should remain in office. In order for it to get on the ballot, the referendum would have to pass at the board's next meeting next week.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pritzker also faulted Campbell for not having met with Massey's family, while also making clear that he did not believe that alone was a fireable offense. Still, he said it seemed outrageous to him.\n\n\"At a minimum, listen to them, hear them, and then, hopefully, take action,\" Pritzker said, adding that the lieutenant governor also called for Campbell to resign.\n\nPritzker said he had met with Massey's family and promised them he would look at ways to prevent anyone else from being killed under the same circumstances.\n\nCampbell said Wednesday that he had requested to meet with the Massey family through intermediaries designated by the family on four separate occasions. Ben Crump, the civil rights attorney who is representing Massey's family, did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\n\"My requests have been rejected or not accepted,\" said Campbell, a Republican who has been sheriff since 2018. \"I am still willing to meet with the family.\"\n\nAnd he again said that he would not resign.\n\n\"Calls for my resignation are nothing more than political maneuvering during a tragic event and only hurt the good citizens of Sangamon County,\" he said in a statement.\n\nWithout naming him, Campbell reiterated his assertion that it was Grayson alone who was responsible for Massey's death and said that he agreed with Pritzker that there are still questions that need to be answered. He said his office is willing to modify its hiring practices \"to prevent an incident like this from occurring again.\"\n\n\"However, before changes can be made, it is important to identify the problem,\" Campbell said. \"We have used a process that we believe was consistent with statewide standards. If these standards are deficient, we would advocate a change at all necessary levels.\"\n\nHe added: \"I am committed to working with our community and elected leaders to improve not only the Sheriff's Office but also hiring standards on a statewide level to prevent a state agency from certifying a similar law enforcement officer six different times in the future.\"\n\nPritzker said Massey's killing was a terrible tragedy \"that never should happen anywhere in the United States, let alone in the state of Illinois or in Sangamon County.\"\n\nHe said Massey had been killed \"in horrific fashion,\" citing the body camera video.\n\n\"I just can't get past the idea that we have to do more to protect people,\" he said, adding that a lot had already been done.\n\nPritzker credited the Illinois State Police with investigating Massey's killing in less than two weeks, which he described as a \"fulsome endeavor\" that involves a lot of interviews.\n\nPritzker said he spoke to a Black elected official in Illinois shortly after Massey's killing to get her perspective and she told him that, even though there was progress to be made, in years past \"there never would have been an investigation, there wouldn't have been a body cam, no one would have known what really happened.\"\n\n\"And that may be the silver lining, if there is a silver lining in this, is that someone is being held accountable,\" Pritzker said. \"And yet we have much more to do.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayson_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grayson County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grayson County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Campbell County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Campbell County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangamon_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massey_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Massey family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Gov. Juliana Stratton said in a joint statement.\n\nOn July 6, former deputy sheriff Sean Grayson responded to a report of a prowler at Massey's home. Bodycam footage from another deputy showed Massey saying she rebuked Grayson, and the former deputy threatening the 36-year-old Black woman. The encounter ended with Grayson shooting Massey in the head and failing to render aid.\n\nGrayson, a 30-year-old deputy who has since been fired, was indicted by a grand jury on July 17 on three counts of first-degree murder and one count each of aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct in connection with the shooting. Grayson has entered a not guilty plea and was denied pretrial release, according to court records.\n\nThe sheriff's office has come under scrutiny after it was disclosed that Grayson was discharged from the Army for serious misconduct and a history of driving under the influence yet still managed to get employed since 2020 by six Illinois law enforcement agencies - at three of them, as a part-time officer, employment records show.\n\n\"A full month has passed since the murder of Sonya Massey. In that time Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell has had ample opportunity to respond with conviction and purpose to questions about his hiring of the perpetrator, Deputy Sheriff Sean Grayson, and about reforms he would propose for his department to avoid this from happening again,\" Pritzker and Stratton said.\n\n\"The community remains in fear that calling the Sheriff's Office when they feel endangered will lead to another murder of an innocent resident,\" Pritzker and Stratton said.\n\nIn a statement, Campbell said his office \"continues to grieve for Sonya Massey and her family\" and that deputies in his office \"feel betrayed by one of their own.\"\n\n\"The Sheriff's Office is willing to modify our hiring practices in order to prevent an incident like this from occurring again. However, before changes can be made, it is important to identify the problem,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Calls for my resignation are nothing more than political maneuvering during a tragic event and only hurt the good citizens of Sangamon County.

Campbell, who hired Grayson for the Sangamon County Sheriff's Department in May 2023, reiterated his intent Wednesday to stay in the job.\n\n\"He has failed to explain how he ended up hiring this deputy sheriff who has been fired from other departments,\" Pritzker said of Campbell at an event in Chicago. \"He failed to put forward reforms that clearly need to be made, training and other reforms and still has failed to meet with the Massey family.\"\n\nThere is no evidence Grayson was fired from any previous job. And Pritzker did not elaborate on what \"training and other reforms\" Campbell should have implemented since the killing.\n\nGrayson has come under scrutiny because -- prior to becoming a law enforcement officer -- he was kicked out of the Army a decade ago for the first of two drunken driving arrests within a year. His law enforcement career included six jobs in four years, during which he received some reviews that indicated he needed more training and had one disciplinary problem.\n\nGrayson was fired on July 17 for violating use-of-force standards by shooting Massey rather than taking non-lethal action when he felt threatened by a pan of hot water she was holding, according to authorities.\n\nThe sheriff signaled Wednesday that he would stay on the job.\n\n\"I was overwhelmingly elected to lead the sheriff's office through both good times and bad,\" Campbell said in a statement. \"I am fully prepared to continue leading my office and serving the residents of Sangamon County through this difficult period, ensuring we learn from this tragedy and work toward a better future.\"\n\nPritzker, who with Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton met with Massey's family two weeks ago, faulted Campbell for not sitting down with family members.\n\n\"At a minimum, listen to them, hear them, and then hopefully, take action,\" Pritzker said.\n\nCampbell said he has requested meetings with the family four times through family-designated intermediaries, but none has been accepted. He said he would still like to meet.\n\nHe also said he is willing to modify hiring practices but because Sangamon County follows statewide standards, necessary changes should be made statewide.\n\nThe sheriff's office \"continues to grieve for Sonya Massey and her family,\" Campbell said. \"While our grief cannot compare to the pain of the family, our office is trying to heal from within -- all employees of the sheriff's office feel betrayed by one of their own.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Sophia Tareen contributed from Chicago.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Bodycam footage from another deputy showed Massey saying she rebuked Grayson, and the former deputy threatening the 36-year-old Black woman. The encounter ended with Grayson shooting Massey in the head and failing to render aid.\n\nGrayson, a 30-year-old deputy who has since been fired, was indicted by a grand jury on July 17 on three counts of first-degree murder and one count each of aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct in connection with the shooting. Grayson has entered a not guilty plea and was denied pretrial release, according to court records.\n\nThe sheriff's office has come under scrutiny after it was disclosed that Grayson was discharged from the Army for serious misconduct and a history of driving under the influence yet still managed to get employed since 2020 by six Illinois law enforcement agencies - at three of them, as a part-time officer, employment records show.\n\n\"A full month has passed since the murder of Sonya Massey.

However, before changes can be made, it is important to identify the problem,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Calls for my resignation are nothing more than political maneuvering during a tragic event and only hurt the good citizens of Sangamon County.

Reader discretion is advised.\n\nSPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker called Wednesday for the resignation of the sheriff whose deputy fatally wounded Sonya Massey in her home last month after the Black woman called 911 for help.\n\nPritzker, a Democrat, said Republican Jack Campbell should step down because \"the sheriff has failed.\"\n\nSean Grayson, 30, faces three counts of first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct in the July 6 shooting death of Massey, 36. Campbell, who hired Grayson for the Sangamon County Sheriff's Department in May 2023, reiterated his intent Wednesday to stay in the job.\n\n\"He has failed to explain how he ended up hiring this deputy sheriff who has been fired from other departments,\" Pritzker said of Campbell at an event in Chicago. \"He failed to put forward reforms that clearly need to be made, training and other reforms and still has failed to meet with the Massey family.\"\n\nThere is no evidence Grayson was fired from any previous job. And Pritzker did not elaborate on what \"training and other reforms\" Campbell should have implemented since the killing.\n\nGrayson has come under scrutiny because -- prior to becoming a law enforcement officer -- he was kicked out of the Army a decade ago for the first of two drunken driving arrests within a year. His law enforcement career included six jobs in four years, during which he received some reviews that indicated he needed more training and had one disciplinary problem.\n\nGrayson was fired on July 17 for violating use-of-force standards by shooting Massey rather than taking non-lethal action when he felt threatened by a pan of hot water she was holding, according to authorities.\n\nThe sheriff signaled Wednesday that he would stay on the job.\n\n\"I was overwhelmingly elected to lead the sheriff's office through both good times and bad,\" Campbell said in a statement. \"I am fully prepared to continue leading my office and serving the residents of Sangamon County through this difficult period, ensuring we learn from this tragedy and work toward a better future.\"\n\nIn this file photo Illinois Gov.

J.B. Pritzker calls for downstate sheriff to resign over handling of Sonya Massey case", "body": "In a strongly worded public rebuke of another elected government official in Illinois, Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton have called on a downstate sheriff to resign over his handling of the death of Sonya Massey, who was shot and killed by one of his deputies.\n\nThe state's Democratic leaders said Republican Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell \"should have taken his leadership role more seriously\" in a release issued several hours after the governor said he was \"disappointed\" at the answers Campbell had given as to why the deputy who killed Massey was hired.\n\n\"To date, Sheriff Campbell has yet to even meet with the Massey family. The refusal to meet with a grieving family face to face when one of your Sheriff's Deputies killed their innocent mother, sister and daughter is inexcusable. Rather than waiting for others to propose reform of the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office, Sheriff Campbell should have taken his leadership role more seriously,\" Pritzker and Stratton said in their joint statement.\n\nThe statement said Campbell has had \"ample opportunity to respond with conviction and purpose to questions\" about his hiring of Deputy Sean Grayson, who was fired over the Massey killing and has been charged with murder.\n\nPritzker and Stratton noted that they had met with Massey's family and \"made a commitment to support them in working for justice.\"\n\n\"We join the Massey family in calling for Sheriff Campbell's resignation immediately so the Springfield and Sangamon County community can begin to rebuild and restore trust between citizens and the sheriff's department. We will continue to keep the Massey family in our prayers,\" the statement said.\n\nCampbell has previously said he would not resign following the shooting. He could not be reached for comment Wednesday morning.\n\nMassey's killing has led to protests in Springfield, Chicago and across the country and renewed a national conversation over the use of deadly force by police against Black people.\n\nThe Sangamon County sheriff's office was the sixth Illinois police department Grayson had worked for in less than four years. Before he went into law enforcement, Grayson had two DUIs on his record in nearby Macoupin County.\n\nRecords show before the Sangamon County sheriff's office hired Grayson last year, the office spoke with some of the law enforcement agencies that previously employed him and those agencies questioned his abilities as an officer, saying he needed more training.\n\nGrayson was dating the daughter of one of his references, a former Sangamon County sheriff's deputy who spoke glowingly of him.\n\nIn statements released last week, Campbell defended the process for hiring Grayson.\n\n\"Normally, I seek such references and give more credence to those from individuals I trust and know to have integrity,\" Campbell said. \"Their insights are invaluable in making informed hiring decisions.\"\n\nCampbell also downplayed comments from previous employers saying Grayson \"needed more training.\"\n\n\"This is not unusual for deputies with Grayson's experience, and is standard procedure for Sangamon County deputies,\" Campbell said. \"Grayson was subsequently sent to a 16-week academy training, a requirement for all new and lateral transfer deputies in our office.\"\n\nDeputies on July 6 responded to a 911 call about a possible prowler outside Massey's home in an unincorporated area outside of Springfield. When Grayson, who is white, and another deputy officer arrived, Massey, who was Black, took a few minutes to answer the door and appeared confused. Her family has said she had mental health issues.\n\nThe two officers said they didn't find anyone around her home. Inside, a conversation ensued over a pot of boiling water on Massey's stove.\n\nAccording to body camera footage, Massey said, \"Oh, I'll rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\" before Grayson angrily replied, \"You better (expletive) not. I swear to God. I'll (expletive) shoot you right in your (expletive) face.\"\n\nGrayson then demanded that Massey drop the pot before shooting her. The Sangamon County coroner's office said she died of a gunshot wound to the head.\n\nGrayson was ordered held in custody about two weeks after the shooting. He has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct.\n\nIn 2021, Pritzker signed into law a sweeping criminal justice reform measure, known as the SAFE-T Act, which included a provision meant to improve the state's police officer decertification process. While there's no indication the law will be changed further in light of Massey's killing, Illinois legislative leaders have indicated they're open to proposals.", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_gorner@chicagotribune.com", "name": "Jeremy Gorner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massey_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Massey family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayson_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grayson County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grayson County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Campbell County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Campbell County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangamon_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Legislator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

(AP) -- Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker called Wednesday for the resignation of the sheriff whose deputy fatally wounded Sonya Massey in her home last month after the Black woman called 911 for help.\n\nPritzker, a Democrat, said Republican Jack Campbell should step down because \"the sheriff has failed.\"\n\nSean Grayson, 30, faces three counts of first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct in the July 6 shooting death of Massey, 36. Campbell, who hired Grayson for the Sangamon County Sheriff's Department in May 2023, reiterated his intent Wednesday to stay in the job.\n\n\"He has failed to explain how he ended up hiring this deputy sheriff who has been fired from other departments,\" Pritzker said of Campbell at an event in Chicago. \"He failed to put forward reforms that clearly need to be made, training and other reforms and still has failed to meet with the Massey family.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nThere is no evidence Grayson was fired from any previous job. And Pritzker did not elaborate on what \"training and other reforms\" Campbell should have implemented since the killing.\n\nGrayson has come under scrutiny because -- prior to becoming a law enforcement officer -- he was kicked out of the Army a decade ago for the first of two drunken driving arrests within a year. His law enforcement career included six jobs in four years, during which he received some reviews that indicated he needed more training and had one disciplinary problem.\n\nGrayson was fired on July 17 for violating use-of-force standards by shooting Massey rather than taking non-lethal action when he felt threatened by a pan of hot water she was holding, according to authorities.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe sheriff signaled Wednesday that he would stay on the job.\n\n\"I was overwhelmingly elected to lead the sheriff's office through both good times and bad,\" Campbell said in a statement. \"I am fully prepared to continue leading my office and serving the residents of Sangamon County through this difficult period, ensuring we learn from this tragedy and work toward a better future.\"\n\nPritzker, who with Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton met with Massey's family two weeks ago, faulted Campbell for not sitting down with family members.\n\n\"At a minimum, listen to them, hear them, and then hopefully, take action,\" Pritzker said.\n\nCampbell said he has requested meetings with the family four times through family-designated intermediaries, but none has been accepted. He said he would still like to meet.\n\nHe also said he is willing to modify hiring practices but because Sangamon County follows statewide standards, necessary changes should be made statewide.\n\nThe sheriff's office \"continues to grieve for Sonya Massey and her family,\" Campbell said. \"While our grief cannot compare to the pain of the family, our office is trying to heal from within -- all employees of the sheriff's office feel betrayed by one of their own.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Sophia Tareen contributed from Chicago.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker called Wednesday for the resignation of the sheriff whose deputy fatally wounded Sonya Massey in her home last month after the Black woman called 911 for help.\n\nPritzker, a Democrat, said Republican Jack Campbell should step down because \"the sheriff has failed.\"\n\nSean Grayson, 30, faces three counts of first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct in the July 6 shooting death of Massey, 36. Campbell, who hired Grayson for the Sangamon County Sheriff's Department in May 2023, reiterated his intent Wednesday to stay in the job.\n\n\"He has failed to explain how he ended up hiring this deputy sheriff who has been fired from other departments,\" Pritzker said of Campbell at an event in Chicago. \"He failed to put forward reforms that clearly need to be made, training and other reforms and still has failed to meet with the Massey family.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Chicago man gets 103 years for 2020 shooting death of a Bloomington man\n\nThere is no evidence Grayson was fired from any previous job.\n\nGrayson has come under scrutiny because -- prior to becoming a law enforcement officer -- he was kicked out of the Army a decade ago for the first of two drunken driving arrests within a year. His law enforcement career included six jobs in four years, during which he received some reviews that indicated he needed more training and had one disciplinary problem.\n\nGrayson was fired on July 17 for violating use-of-force standards by shooting Massey rather than taking non-lethal action when he felt threatened by a pan of hot water she was holding, according to authorities.\n\nThe sheriff signaled Wednesday that he would stay on the job.\n\n\"I was overwhelmingly elected to lead the sheriff's office through both good times and bad,\" Campbell said in a statement. \"I am fully prepared to continue leading my office and serving the residents of Sangamon County through this difficult period, ensuring we learn from this tragedy and work toward a better future.\"\n\nPritzker, who with Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton met with Massey's family two weeks ago, faulted Campbell for not sitting down with family members.\n\n\"At a minimum, listen to them, hear them, and then hopefully, take action,\" Pritzker said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nCampbell said he has requested meetings with the family four times through family-designated intermediaries, but none has been accepted. He said he would still like to meet.\n\nAt an appearance Wednesday afternoon at the Illinois State Fair, Pritzker doubled down on his criticism of the sheriff. He said Campbell has refused to answer questions, despite the sheriff's office establishing a web page strictly for answering news media questions about the case and releasing documents and conducting a slew of 15-minute interviews with various media organizations last week.\n\nThe governor said Campbell should have talked to the chiefs of departments previously employing Grayson, but documents Campbell released show he did. And the state Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board certified Grayson for duty six times.\n\nPritzker also said the Massey family has said publicly that they would like to meet with Campbell.\n\n\"If he's reached out, he hasn't done a very good job because the Massey family hasn't had the meeting that they've asked,\" Pritzker said.\n\nAn emailed request for comment was sent to Ben Crump, the civil rights lawyer who is representing the Massey family.\n\nCampbell also said he is willing to modify hiring practices but because Sangamon County follows statewide standards, necessary changes should be made statewide.\n\n\"I just want to know and he has been unwilling to answer the questions -- if he'd been willing to do these things, then act, he's had a month,\" Pritzker said. \"There would be a lot less frustration, a lot more, perhaps a sense of safety. But none of that was done by the sheriff.\"\n\nCampbell said his office is gathering facts necessary \"to make intelligent decisions and to avoid making changes that are unlikely to lead to meaningful results.\"\n\n\"I have worked tirelessly to make all the facts available to the public as swiftly and transparently as possible,\" Campbell said.\n\nThe sheriff's office \"continues to grieve for Sonya Massey and her family,\" Campbell said. \"While our grief cannot compare to the pain of the family, our office is trying to heal from within -- all employees of the sheriff's office feel betrayed by one of their own.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Sophia Tareen contributed from Chicago.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Pritzker Urges Sangamon County Sheriff To Resign", "body": "Sonya Massey, a Black woman from Illinois, was fatally shot in her home by a former deputy after reporting a suspected prowler to 911, and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker called on the Sangamon County sheriff to resign due to his \"failed\" response to Massey's case.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We're launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day's headlines. Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nDuring a Wednesday press conference for a bill signing, Pritzker said Massey died in \"a horrific fashion,\" adding more has to be done to protect people. Though he gave credit to the Illinois state police for doing the investigation in 10 days, he criticized Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell and called for his resignation. Pritzker claimed the sheriff failed to explain how Grayson was hired even though he had been fired from several other police departments. Pritzker also said Campbell \"failed\" to put forward reforms for police training, adding Campbell still hasn't met with the Massey family to discuss Massey's case.\n\nThe Sangamon County Coroner's Office released the results from Sonya Massey's final autopsy, which confirm she died from a gunshot wound to the head, NBC News reports. The bullet reportedly entered under her left eye, perforated a carotid artery and exited from the back of her neck. Massey also had minor blunt force injuries on her right leg, according to the autopsy. \"Why this is so significant is that it confirms that deputy Sean Grayson shot in a downward trajectory,\" Crump said during a news conference Friday following the release of the report. \"[These] autopsy findings coupled with the video, where we see her ducking, [and] says, 'Sorry, sir, sorry,' he shot when she's making the motion coming up. That's how you get the downward trajectory, and you see on the video, his arms, he aims down.\"\n\nThe footage shows Grayson and another deputy searching Massey's property and noticing a car with a broken window before knocking on the door. Massey opens the door and lets the deputies in after a brief conversation about the car. Massey offered to give the deputies some documents, but Grayson noticed the stove was on and ordered her to turn it off. Massey then goes to turn off a pot of boiling water and picks up the pot, causing Grayson to tell her to stay \"away from the boiling water.\" Massey responds \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\" and Grayson tells her \"you better f -- not before I f -- shoot you in the f -- face.\" He then raises his gun and points it at her and yells at Massey to \"drop the f -- pot!\" Massey then appears to duck and apologize before three shots are heard. After a few seconds, one of the deputies says \"shots fired\" and calls for emergency medical services. \"Dude, I'm not taking f -- boiling water to the f -- head,\" Grayson then says. \"And look, it came right to our feet, too.\" Moments after the shooting, Grayson talks to another law enforcement official. \"She had boiling water and came at me with boiling water,\" he says in the video. \"She said she was going to rebuke me in the name of Jesus and came at [me] with boiling water.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris condemned the killing of Massey in a statement Tuesday, saying she \"deserved to be safe,\" adding she and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff are \"grieving her senseless death.\" Biden also issued a statement Monday: \"Sonya called the police because she was concerned about a potential intruder,\" he said. \"When we call for help, all of us as Americans -- regardless of who we are or where we live -- should be able to do so without fearing for our lives.\" Both Biden and Harris commended the actions of the Springfield State's Attorney's Office and called on Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which was drafted in 2021 after the 2020 police shooting of Floyd in Minneapolis. \"Sonya Massey was concerned for her safety and called law enforcement to her home for protection,\" Pritzker said in a statement issued July 17. \"Like all Illinoisans, she deserved that protection. Instead, innocent and unarmed, she was gunned down by an officer of the law.\"\n\nGrayson worked for six different law enforcement agencies over the span of four years, according to the Associated Press. He worked part-time positions in Illinois for the Pawnee Police Department, the Kincaid Police Department and the Virden Police Department in 2020 and 2021. He then worked for the Auburn Police Department full time until May 2022 before moving on to another full-time position with the Logan County Sheriff's Office.

Keck, USA TODAY\n\nUpdated August 7, 2024 at 8:10 PM\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton are formally calling for Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell to resign, expressing frustration with how the sheriff has responded to the shooting death of Sonya Massey.\n\nMuch scrutiny has been placed on Campbell, who hired former Deputy Sean P. Grayson in May 2023 despite his two prior DUI convictions. Grayson has been charged by a grand jury with three counts of first-degree murder after shooting Massey in her own home on July 6.\n\nCampbell \"has failed to explain how he ended up hiring this deputy sheriff who has (resigned) from other departments,\" the governor said at an unrelated press conference in Chicago Wednesday morning. \"He has failed to put forward reforms that clearly need to be made.\"\n\nIn a statement, Pritzker said he was calling for Campbell's resignation \"so the Springfield and Sangamon County community can begin to rebuild and restore trust between the citizens and the sheriff's department.\"\n\nMore: Illinois Gov. Pritzker criticizes sheriff for hiring deputy who fatally shot Sonya Massey\n\nPritzker said it was \"outrageous\" that Campbell had yet to meet with the Massey family in the month since the murder.\n\nThe sheriff, who has reiterated his intent to stay on the force, said in a statement he has tried to meet with the family four times, but was rejected each time.\n\nCampbell said he would still like to have a meeting.\n\n\"The Sheriff's Office is willing to modify our hiring practices in order to prevent an incident like this from occurring again. However, before changes can be made, it is important to identify the problem,\" the sheriff said in the statement.\n\n\"We have used a process that we believe was consistent with statewide standards. If these standards are deficient, we would advocate a change at all necessary levels.\n\n\"I was overwhelmingly elected to lead the Sheriff's Office through both good times and bad. I am fully prepared to continue leading my office and serving the residents of Sangamon County through this difficult period, ensuring we learn from this tragedy and work toward a better future.\"\n\nCampbell also said he believes calls for his resignation are politically motivated.\n\n\"We need to unite and heal. The one responsible is in jail and will never work in law enforcement again. Calls for my resignation are nothing more than political maneuvering during a tragic event and only hurt the good citizens of Sangamon County.\"\n\nPatrick M.

J.B. Pritzker 'disappointed' with sheriff's answers on hiring of deputy who shot Sonya Massey", "body": "Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday said he's \"disappointed\" with the answers he's hearing from a downstate sheriff over why his agency hired the deputy who shot and killed 36-year-old Sonya Massey in her Springfield-area home.\n\nThe shooting of Massey last month by former Sangamon County sheriff's Deputy Sean Grayson has led to protests in Springfield, Chicago and across the country and renewed a national conversation over the use of deadly force by police against Black people.\n\nGrayson has been fired and charged with murder in Massey's killing, and the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the shooting.\n\nAt an unrelated news conference on Tuesday, Pritzker criticized the information being released about the shooting from Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell, who at a public meeting in Springfield last week said his office \"failed Sonya's family and friends\" but that he wouldn't resign.\n\n\"The way in which this deputy sheriff was hired, the background, should have been ... taken into account. The way he was hired is an enormous question mark that still needs to be made transparent. How did the sheriff end up hiring this person, must have known their background, must have,\" Pritzker said, without naming Campbell.\n\n\"I mean, no one hires somebody without checking out the hiree's background, and so I have a lot of questions, and I'm so far disappointed with the answers that I'm hearing from the sheriff,\" the governor said. \"But I think that the community is reacting the way that I think is appropriate, protesting, making their voice heard, asking for change.\"\n\nThe Sangamon County sheriff's office was the sixth Illinois police department Grayson had worked for in less than four years, according to records from the Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board. Court records also show that in the last decade, but before he went into law enforcement, Grayson has two DUIs on his record in nearby Macoupin County.\n\nCampbell on Tuesday did not respond to a request for comment on Pritzker's remarks.\n\nIncluded in Grayson's personnel records provided by the Kincaid Police Department, where he worked part time, is a document showing that he was discharged from military service for serious \"misconduct.\" The Associated Press, citing a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, reported that one of Grayson's DUIs led to his discharge from the Army in 2016.\n\nWhen Grayson applied to be a Sangamon County sheriff's deputy, a psychologist who evaluated him said the job candidate \"appears to be a suitable fit for the position\" and \"likes structure and routines.\" But the psychologist also said Grayson \"scored low on the cognitive assessment.\"\n\n\"It will take him longer to learn, process and apply new material when compared to others,\" the psychologist indicated.\n\nRecords also show the Sangamon County sheriff's office spoke with other law enforcement agencies in the Springfield area where Grayson had worked, and that those agencies questioned his abilities as an officer.\n\nA co-worker of Grayson's at the Logan County sheriff's office indicated that Grayson \"is a good deputy but he believes he needs more extensive training,\" according to the records.\n\nOne of Grayson's references, according to the records, was a former Sangamon County deputy whose daughter is dating Grayson. The former deputy \"highly\" recommended Grayson, describing him as \"a mellow, non-confrontational person who has good communication skills.\"\n\nIn statements released last week, Campbell addressed Grayson's hiring.\n\n\"Normally, I seek such references and give more credence to those from individuals I trust and know to have integrity,\" Campbell said. \"Their insights are invaluable in making informed hiring decisions.\"\n\nCampbell also downplayed comments from prior employers saying Grayson \"needed more training.\"\n\n\"This is not unusual for deputies with Grayson's experience, and is standard procedure for Sangamon County deputies,\" Campbell said. \"Grayson was subsequently sent to a 16-week academy training, a requirement for all new and lateral transfer deputies in our office.\"\n\nAccording to the records, Campbell also said that \"no other law enforcement agency reported problems with Grayson before we hired him,\" though during his time with the Logan County sheriff's office, in 2022, Grayson got into a high-speed chase in the city of Lincoln before hitting a deer. According to one of his supervisors, Grayson \"failed to show due caution while driving through stop intersections.\"\n\nThe records showed that supervisor interviewed Grayson after the incident and indicated there were discrepancies between Grayson's report and the video, and recommended more training.\n\nDeputies on July 6 responded to a 911 call about a possible prowler outside Massey's home in an unincorporated area outside of Springfield. When Grayson, who is white, and another deputy officer arrived, Massey, who is Black, took a few minutes to answer the door and appeared confused. The two officers said they had not found anyone around her home. Inside, a conversation ensued over a pot of boiling water on Massey's stove.\n\nAccording to body camera footage, Massey said, \"Oh, I'll rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\" before Grayson angrily replied, \"You better (expletive) not. I swear to God. I'll (expletive) shoot you right in your (expletive) face.\"\n\nGrayson pointed his gun at her, asking her to drop the pot of water. Massey said \"I'm sorry\" and ducked, according to the footage, and Grayson soon after fired three shots at her. According to the Sangamon County coroner, Massey, whose family indicated she had mental health issues, died of a gunshot wound to the head.\n\nGrayson was ordered detained in custody about two weeks after the shooting. He pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct.", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_gorner@chicagotribune.com", "name": "Jeremy Gorner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "olivia_olander@chicagotribune.com", "name": "Olivia Olander", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayson_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grayson County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grayson County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Campbell County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Campbell County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangamon_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Psychologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Chicago man gets 103 years for 2020 shooting death of a Bloomington man\n\n\"To date, Sheriff Campbell has yet to even meet with the Massey family,\" Pritzker and Stratton said. \"The refusal to meet with a grieving family face to face when one of your Sheriff's Deputies killed their innocent mother, sister and daughter is inexcusable.\"\n\nGrayson was terminated by the sheriff's office last month and charged with first-degree murder in Massey's killing. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nCampbell, a Republican who has served as sheriff since 2018, placed blame for Massey's death squarely at the feet of Grayson and has said on several occasions in recent weeks that he will not step down. He reiterated that message on Wednesday.\n\n\"Calls for my resignation are nothing more than political maneuvering during a tragic event and only hurt the good citizens of Sangamon County,\" Campbell said in a statement.\n\n\"I was overwhelmingly elected to lead the Sheriff's Office through both good times and bad,\" Campbell said. \"I am fully prepared to continue leading my office and serving the residents of Sangamon County through this difficult period, ensuring we learn from this tragedy and work toward a better future.\"\n\nCampbell added that he has requested through intermediaries the opportunity to speak with Massey's family four separate times, but they have been \"rejected or not accepted\" in each instance.\n\n\"I am still willing to meet with the family,\" Campbell said.\n\nHe noted his office \"is willing to modify our hiring practices in order to prevent an incident like this from occurring again.\"\n\nGrayson responded to a 911 call from Massey about a suspected prowler on July 6.\n\nBody camera footage of the incident, released by authorities last month, showed the shooting took place after an exchange over a pot of boiling water.\n\nMassey, according to footage, said \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\"\n\nGrayson then said, \"You better (expletive) not. I swear to God. I'll (expletive) shoot you right in your (expletive) face.\"\n\nMassey ducked and apologized before Grayson fired his gun, killing the Springfield woman.\n\nThe incident has made national and international headlines as the latest example of an unarmed Black person dying at the hands of a law enforcement officer.\n\nThough Grayson was quickly stripped of his police powers, fired and arrested, there has been scrutiny on Campbell for hiring him in the first place.\n\nState law enforcement records show Grayson worked at six Central Illinois police agencies in four years. He was also convicted of two DUI charges in Macoupin County, occurring in August 2015 and July 2016.\n\nGrayson's work history turns up examples that raised red flags, including factual discrepancies in his reports of a 2022 police chase while working with the Logan County Sheriff's Office. He was admonished for a slew of policy violations in that case.\n\nLeaders of law enforcement agencies that formerly employed Grayson told Campbell's department that, among other things, he \"needs more training\" and \"did not demonstrate good officer safety skills.\"\n\nRecords from the Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board show Grayson took a course called \"Officer Stress Management\" in July 2022, and again in June -- a month before Massey's death.\n\nContact Brenden Moore at brenden.moore@lee.net.

JB Pritzker and Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton are formally calling for Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell to resign, expressing frustration with how the sheriff has responded following the Sonya Massey fatal shooting.\n\nMuch scrutiny has been placed on Campbell, who hired now former Deputy Sean P. Grayson in May 2023 despite having two DUI convictions. Grayson has been charged by a grand jury with three counts of first-degree murder and shooting and killing Massey in her own home on July 6.\n\n\"(Campbell) has failed to explain how he ended up hiring this deputy sheriff who has been fired from other departments,\" the governor said at an unrelated press conference in Chicago Wednesday morning. \"He has failed to put forward reforms that clearly need to be made.\"\n\nIn a statement calling for the resignation, Pritzker said he was calling for Campbell's resignation \"so the Springfield and Sangamon County community can begin to rebuild and restore trust between the citizens and the sheriff's department.\"\n\nMore: Illinois Gov. Pritzker criticizes sheriff for hiring deputy who fatally shot Sonya Massey\n\nPritzker said it was \"outrageous\" that Campbell had yet to meet with the Massey family in the month since the murder.\n\nThe sheriff, who once again stated his intent to stay on the force, said in a statement he has tried to meet with the family four times, but he has been rejected each time.\n\nCampbell said he would still like to have a meeting.\n\n\"The Sheriff's Office is willing to modify our hiring practices in order to prevent an incident like this from occurring again. However, before changes can be made, it is important to identify the problem,\" the sheriff said in a statement.\n\n\"We have used a process that we believe was consistent with statewide standards. If these standards are deficient, we would advocate a change at all necessary levels.\n\n\"I was overwhelmingly elected to lead the Sheriff's Office through both good times and bad. I am fully prepared to continue leading my office and serving the residents of Sangamon County through this difficult period, ensuring we learn from this tragedy and work toward a better future.\"\n\nCampbell also said he believes calls for his resignation are politically motivated.\n\n\"We need to unite and heal. The one responsible is in jail and will never work in law enforcement again. Calls for my resignation are nothing more than political maneuvering during a tragic event and only hurt the good citizens of Sangamon County.\"\n\nThis story will be updated.\n\nContact Patrick M.

JB Pritzker and Lt. Governor Juliana Stratton on Wednesday became the latest to call on Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell to resign, calling his actions in part \"inexcusable\" in the wake of the shooting death of Sonya Massey.\n\nMassey, an unarmed Black woman, was shot in the head by Deputy Sean Grayson in the early morning hours of July 6 after she'd called 911 for help about a suspected prowler outside her Springfield home.\n\n\"Today, we join the Massey family in calling for Sheriff Campbell's resignation immediately so the Springfield and Sangamon County community can begin to rebuild and restore trust between citizens and the Sheriff's Department,\" Pritzker and Stratton said in a joint statement released Wednesday morning. \"We will continue to keep the Massey family in our prayers.\"\n\nPritzker and Stratton criticized Campbell for not taking the job seriously enough and noted the Department of Justice is investigating the sheriff's office for its role in Massey's death. They said in the past month the sheriff had ample opportunity to respond with proposed reforms to calm the community's fears that calling the sheriff's office will lead to another murder of a resident.\n\n\"The sheriff has failed,\" Pritzker said at a news conference Wednesday. \"He has failed to explain how he ended up hiring this deputy sheriff who has been fired from other departments. He failed to put forward reforms that clearly need to be made, training and other reforms.\"\n\nIn a statement responding to Pritzker and Stratton, Campbell defended his work as an elected official while expressing support for Massey's family. Campbell said he still does not believe he needs to resign.\n\n\"We need to unite and heal,\" Campbell said. \"The one responsible is in jail and will never work in law enforcement again. Calls for my resignation are nothing more than political maneuvering during a tragic event and only hurt the good citizens of Sangamon County.\"\n\n\"I was overwhelmingly elected to lead the Sheriff's Office through both good times and bad,\" Campbell's statement continues. \"I am fully prepared to continue leading my office and serving the residents of Sangamon County through this difficult period, ensuring we learn from this tragedy and work toward a better future.\"\n\nAlso in the statement, Pritzker and Stratton reprimanded the sheriff for refusing to meet with Massey's family, with Pritzker calling it \"outrageous\". Both of them have already met with the family to discuss the legislative changes they can make.\n\nCampbell said he's reached out to meet with Massey's family on \"four separate occasions\". A source close to the family confirmed to WGN's Nexstar sister station WCIA at least two attempts by the sheriff to meet with Massey's loved ones, but they could not speak to the other two attempts.\n\nGrayson, the deputy, was charged with three counts of first-degree murder, but pleaded not guilty. He was fired by Campbell minutes after being charged.\n\nFull statement from Gov. Pritzker & Lt. Gov. Stratton\n\n\"A full month has passed since the murder of Sonya Massey. In that time Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell has had ample opportunity to respond with conviction and purpose to questions about his hiring of the perpetrator, Deputy Sheriff Sean Grayson, and about reforms he would propose for his department to avoid this from happening again. Suspicion has grown, leading to inquiries by the U.S. Department of Justice and calls for other independent investigations. The community remains in fear that calling the Sheriff's Office when they feel endangered will lead to another murder of an innocent resident.\n\nTo date, Sheriff Campbell has yet to even meet with the Massey family. The refusal to meet with a grieving family face to face when one of your Sheriff's Deputies killed their innocent mother, sister and daughter is inexcusable. Rather than waiting for others to propose reform of the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office, Sheriff Campbell should have taken his leadership role more seriously.

Massey spoke to the officers and Grayson told her to turn off her stove, where there appeared to be water boiling. Massey said \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\" and Grayson told her \"you better f -- not before I f -- shoot you in the f -- face.\" Massey ducked and apologized before three shots were fired, and an autopsy later confirmed she died from a gunshot wound to the head.\n\nGrayson was fired from the sheriff's office and was indicted by a grand jury on July 17. He has pleaded not guilty to three counts of first-degree murder, and one count each of official misconduct and aggravated battery with a firearm, NPR Illinois reported. After the shooting, news broke that Grayson had a series of short stints at other police departments and had two drunk driving convictions, one of which led to him being kicked out of the Army -- which law enforcement experts told the Associated Press should have raised questions in the hiring process.

Campbell, who hired Grayson for the Sangamon County Sheriff's Department in May 2023, reiterated his intent Wednesday to stay in the job.\n\n\"He has failed to explain how he ended up hiring this deputy sheriff who has been fired from other departments,\" Pritzker said of Campbell at an event in Chicago. \"He failed to put forward reforms that clearly need to be made, training and other reforms and still has failed to meet with the Massey family.\"\n\nInterim superintendent of St. Louis Public Schools left previous job under fire Letter: If Biden's age was so concerning, why isn't Trump's age?

And Pritzker did not elaborate on what \"training and other reforms\" Campbell should have implemented since the killing.\n\nGrayson has come under scrutiny because -- prior to becoming a law enforcement officer -- he was kicked out of the Army a decade ago for the first of two drunken driving arrests within a year. His law enforcement career included six jobs in four years, during which he received some reviews that indicated he needed more training and had one disciplinary problem.\n\nGrayson was fired on July 17 for violating use-of-force standards by shooting Massey rather than taking non-lethal action when he felt threatened by a pan of hot water she was holding, according to authorities.\n\nThe sheriff signaled Wednesday that he would stay on the job.\n\n\"I was overwhelmingly elected to lead the sheriff's office through both good times and bad,\" Campbell said in a statement. \"I am fully prepared to continue leading my office and serving the residents of Sangamon County through this difficult period, ensuring we learn from this tragedy and work toward a better future.\"\n\nPritzker, who with Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton met with Massey's family two weeks ago, faulted Campbell for not sitting down with family members.\n\n\"At a minimum, listen to them, hear them, and then hopefully, take action,\" Pritzker said.\n\nCampbell said he has requested meetings with the family four times through family-designated intermediaries, but none has been accepted. He said he would still like to meet.\n\nHe also said he is willing to modify hiring practices but because Sangamon County follows statewide standards, necessary changes should be made statewide.\n\nThe sheriff's office \"continues to grieve for Sonya Massey and her family,\" Campbell said. \"While our grief cannot compare to the pain of the family, our office is trying to heal from within -- all employees of the sheriff's office feel betrayed by one of their own.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Sophia Tareen contributed from Chicago.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Included in the reports is an account from Grayson, who now faces three counts of first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct in Massey's death. The former deputy is being held without bond while awaiting trial.\n\n\"While on scene, I was in fear Dep. (redacted) and I were going to receive great bodily harm or death. Due to being in fear of our safety and life, I fired my duty weapon,\" Grayson wrote in his field case report.\n\nGrayson's report detailed his account of what happened when Grayson and a fellow Sangamon County deputy were called to Massey's home.\n\n\"I approached the house and knocked on the door multiple times. I could see someone moving around inside the residence, but no one would open the door,\" Grayson wrote.\n\nAfter Massey, 36, came to the door, Grayson asked her a few questions, according to bodycam video of the exchange reviewed by ABC News. The then-deputy wrote in his report that \"it seemed as if Sonya's mind was all over the place and not able to focus or have a conversation. Sonya stated she was doing OK and had taken her medicine.\"\n\nOnce inside the home, the unnamed deputy who was with Grayson checked the home for a possible intruder while Grayson spoke with Massey. While talking to Massey, Grayson said he heard a crackling noise, then noticed a large metal pot of \"unknown liquid\" on the stove. He asked the other responding deputy to turn the stove off before a fire started in the residence, according to the report.\n\nThat is when Massey, who'd been sitting on the couch, went to the kitchen to turn off the stove, the video shows. She grabbed the large pot and walked toward the sink, acting as if she was going to pour out the water in the sink, according to Grayson.\n\n\"With both hands on the pot, Sonya turned to face me holding the pot,\" the deputy wrote. \"I feared Sonya was going to throw boiling liquid on to us, causing great bodily harm to or death\"\n\n\"I advised Sonya to put the boiling liquid down. Sonya stated she was going to rebuke me in the name of Jesus. She stated this twice,\" Grayson wrote. \"I interpreted this to mean she was going to kill me.\"\n\nAt that point, Grayson said he drew his weapon and pointed it at Sonya, giving her verbal commands to drop the pot of boiling liquid. Upon seeing his weapon, Massey crouched down. Body camera video of the incident recorded Massey repeatedly apologizing to the deputies.\n\n\"Sonya stood up from a crouched position, grabbing the pot, raising it above her head and throwing the boiling substance at me. I was in imminent fear of getting boiling liquid to my face or chest, which would have caused great bodily harm or death,\" Grayson wrote in his report.\n\n\"I fired my duty weapon in Sonya's direction. I observed Sonya fall to the ground behind the counter,\" Grayson said.\n\nA review of Grayson's body camera footage, case report, use of force report, as well as evidence from the unnamed attending deputy who was present during the incident, concluded that Grayson had violated SCSO policies and procedures.\n\nThe internal investigation, conducted by the Sangamon County Sheriff's Department Division of Professional Standards, found Grayson had violated policy by immediately escalating to deadly force, citing that \"body camera video shows that the inappropriate escalation of force set in motion a series of events that led to Deputy Grayson shooting the decedent in the head,\" despite Massey's \"non-aggressive behavior.\"\n\nThe department also found that Grayson did not abide by the Sheriff's Office Standard of Conduct after his body camera recorded statements made by him that violated policy, including calling Massey by expletives, and saying, \"I'm not even going to waste my med stuff then,\" after bringing his medical kit and not providing aid to Massey.\n\nGrayson also violated the department's policy and procedures for providing medical aid and response when he discouraged his fellow attending deputy from providing aid to Massey, saying, \"nah, headshot dude; she's done,\" \"let her just, there is nothing we can do,\" and letting approximately 3 minutes, 40 seconds go by between the time Massey was shot and when Grayson brought in his medical kit, according to the investigation.\n\nAdditionally, Grayson was found to be in violation of policy by not having activated his body camera until after shooting Massey, as well as insubordination after refusing to answer questions during his internal affairs interview.\n\nSean Grayson's attorney declined ABC News' request for comment.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sabina_ghebremedhin@abcnews.go.com", "name": "Sabina Ghebremedhin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "davi_merchan@abcnews.go.com", "name": "Davi Merchan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayson,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grayson, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grayson, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangamon_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malfeasance_in_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malfeasance in office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legislator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery (crime)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Use of force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deadly force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Death"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Used_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Used Equipment", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/3c860d6c-60b3-4b3b-aa73-221b66c4daf4/Sonya-Massey-1-ht-jm-240729_1722283390761_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797231", "eventUri": "eng-9797231", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 466, "textEnd": 472}], "sentiment": -0.4666666666666667, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

He shot her when she checked on a pot of boiling water in her own kitchen while saying, \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\"\n\nGrayson was fired from the Sangamon County Sheriff's office and has been charged with first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm, and official misconduct in Massey's death. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nMeanwhile, his past has raised new questions over the decision to hire him in the first place.\n\nDespite two previous DUIs and a discharge from the U.S. Army in 2016 for serious misconduct, Grayson was hired by the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office. Grayson also had a disciplinary file that included accusations of bullying behavior and abuse of power, records obtained by CBS News show.\n\nTwo of the six law enforcement agencies for which Grayson had worked since 2020 said he needed more training, while a third said he \"did not demonstrate good officer safety skills.\" But Campbell said Grayson had more training than most officers.\n\n\"He was certified to work in Illinois,\" said Campbell. \"He had to pass all the required testing. He was drug tested and, and he passed a psychological evaluation.\"\n\nCampbell said the two DUIs in Grayson's past were not a \"red flag.\"\n\nPritzker did not join the calls for Campbell to resign, but such calls have been growing for some time.\n\nLast week, Sangamon County Board member Sam Cahnman (D-18th) said he will introduce a resolution to have a referendum added to the ballot in November -- simply asking voters whether Campbell should resign.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayson_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grayson County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grayson County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Campbell County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Campbell County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangamon_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military discharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Driving under the influence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battery (crime)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_of_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abuse of power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/08/06/6dc16a58-f58f-45cc-966a-62e9bb598d6c/thumbnail/1200x630/19c7c0ed286aaae3e7f5fe6b99ae51a1/gov-jb-pritzker-0806.png?v=33116e4d892fab6878b5c06299369826", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797231", "eventUri": "eng-9797231", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 417, "textEnd": 423}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later.\n\nThe Illinois sheriff's deputy accused of fatally shooting Sonya Massey while responding to her 911 call claimed he fired on the unarmed woman in her home because he feared for his life, according to newly released sheriff's reports.\n\nIn a narrative of the July 6 shooting filed with the Sangamon County Sheriff's Department, ex-deputy Sean Grayson said Massey's statement, \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\" after she took a pot off the stove at his order, was perceived as a threat to kill him. He claimed he feared \"great bodily harm or death\" because she had a pot of boiling water, and he alleged that Massey threw it at him after he drew his gun.\n\nPreviously released body-camera footage showed Grayson draw his gun after her comment and shout at Massey that he would shoot her in the \"f -- ing face.\" The camera's view of Massey is then blocked.\n\nRevealing new details, Sangamon County authorities also confirmed that the deputies and dispatchers on duty didn't know about Massey's prior interactions with authorities or that her mother had told a 911 dispatcher the day before that her daughter was having a mental breakdown. The county 911 director said in a statement that their system is not set up to link calls or create alerts about people.\n\nMassey's death has prompted protests around the country and renewed criticism of how police respond to Black communities and to people experiencing mental health issues. Grayson, 30, is charged with first-degree murder and has pleaded not guilty. His attorney, Daniel Fultz, declined to comment Tuesday.\n\nThe new reports, released by the county Monday, add to the still-emerging picture of Grayson's actions and sketch a fuller picture of how the county's law enforcement responded to the \"shots fired\" call from Massey's house. They come after personnel records released last week showed that Grayson had been flagged by superiors for inaccuracy and impulsive decision-making.\n\nThe sheriff's office concluded that Grayson's use of force was inappropriate and that he \"unnecessarily escalated\" the situation, according to termination documents released last week.\n\n\"When Deputy Grayson pointed his firearm at the decedent, she was not making any aggressive movements, only talking,\" Sangamon County Sheriff's Chief Deputy Anthony Mayfield wrote in a letter notifying a county board of Grayson's July 17 firing. \"[H]is failure to communicate or use a less than lethal alternative led to the death of Ms. Massey.\"\n\nGrayson refused to answer questions during his department's internal investigation into his conduct following the shooting, his superiors noted, and made five other policy violations on July 6, including that he did not turn on his body camera until after the shooting and did not try to give her first aid.\n\nThe now-former deputy was responding to a 911 call from Massey about a prowler and talked with her for about 20 minutes before the shooting. Records released last week showed that local law enforcement had interacted with Massey the day before, as she faced mental health struggles.\n\nAn autopsy concluded that Massey, 36, died from a gunshot wound to her head, after a bullet entered beneath her eye and went out the back of her neck. She had two teenage children.\n\nBen Crump, the attorney representing her family, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe deputy's report\n\nThe case files released Monday by the Sangamon County Sheriff's Department include incident reports from Grayson and eight other responding deputies.\n\nIn his report, Grayson wrote that Massey had a pot of \"unknown\" liquid boiling on the stove that she was going to pour into the sink. In the body camera recording, Grayson referred to the pot's contents as \"hot, steaming water\" and said he was moving away from it after she took it off the burner. He said in the narrative that he feared she would \"throw boiling liquid on to us.\"\n\n\"Sonya stated that she was going rebuke me in the name of Jesus. She stated this twice,\" Grayson wrote. \"I interpreted this to mean she was going to kill me.\"\n\nMassey said the phrase, which is used in some Black communities to dismiss an idea or call for Jesus' protection, after Grayson suggested he didn't want to get burned.\n\nAfter Grayson shouted at Massey, she ducked and apologized, the footage shows. He drew his gun and threatened to shoot her.\n\nIn Grayson's account, he alleged that Massey, who was then blocked from the camera's view, stood up, raised the pot above her head and threw its contents at him before he fired. He said he fired his weapon \"due to being in fear of our safety and life.\"\n\nA sergeant who responded after the shots were fired said Grayson told him when he arrived at the house that Massey came at him with boiling water.\n\nAnother deputy said Grayson \"was visibly shaken up\" when he arrived. The deputy said he took Grayson to his patrol car and sat with him, advising him not to speak about what had happened, until receiving orders to take Grayson to the hospital.\n\nGrayson had previously been flagged at least a handful of times for impulsive decision-making and filing inaccurate reports, according to personnel records released by some of Grayson's employers. Over two years, Grayson moved between five law enforcement agencies, sometimes doing simultaneous part-time work, working his way to become a full-time deputy in Logan County, Ill., in 2022. He was hired in Sangamon County in 2023.\n\nIn two instances logged in his disciplinary file at the Logan County Sheriff's Office, Grayson once filed an inaccurate report and another time filed a report that was disputed by a woman he'd arrested. About seven months into his employment, the department's chief deputy warned Grayson he was at risk of having his credibility doubted by prosecutors and told Grayson, \"I'm calling you on your integrity,\" according to a recording of the conversation.\n\nHe also recommended Grayson take \"high-stress decision-making classes,\" along with other training. About four months later, as Grayson pursued the deputy job in Sangamon County, a psychological assessment during the hiring process noted that Grayson \"knows he can move too fast at times\" and \"needs to slow down to make good decisions.\" Overall, however, he wrote that Grayson appeared to be a suitable fit for the job.\n\nPrior warning\n\nFamily and other critics have questioned why the two deputies who knocked on Massey's door just before 1 a.m. July 6 were seemingly unaware of her interactions with authorities the day before.\n\nBoth a police officer and a sheriff's deputy had visited her that day, according to law enforcement records; in addition to the 911 call in which her mother said Massey was having a breakdown, her 17-year-old son also said he told law enforcement officers that afternoon she was struggling mentally.\n\nSangamon County 911 Director Chris Mueller said that information wasn't readily available to dispatchers when Massey called back in the middle of the night.\n\nLinking calls to each other \"is not something that can be readily researched,\" especially given dispatchers' shift changes and the speed with which deputies need to respond to emergency calls, he said in a statement posted to the county's website Monday. In addition, one of the calls on July 5 didn't occur at Massey's house and was handled by the Springfield Police Department, Mueller said.\n\nDispatchers in the county don't have the ability to put an alert on an address unless a resident requests one for themselves, he said.\n\n\"Neither 911 nor law enforcement have the credentials needed to place a label of any kind of mental health issue on any individual, let alone an alert,\" Mueller said.\n\nRandolph McLaughlin, a civil rights attorney and law professor at Pace University, said the department should have a protocol in place for calls from people in mental health crises.\n\n\"Whoever sent those cops to her house should have put on an alert -- this is an 'emotionally disturbed person' call,\" McLaughlin said in an interview last week with The Post. \"Maybe if they had done that, additional resources would've been sent -- not just a cop to see if there's a prowler, but maybe an officer with some mental health training, maybe a social worker.\"\n\n\"If you realize this is a person who has a mental health crisis,\" he added, \"you're going to respond in a much different way.\"\n\nJonathan Edwards contributed to this report.",

(AP) -- Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker called Wednesday for the resignation of the sheriff whose deputy fatally wounded Sonya Massey in her home last month after the Black woman called 911 for help.\n\nPritzker, a Democrat, said Republican Jack Campbell should step down because \"the sheriff has failed.\"\n\nSean Grayson, 30, faces three counts of first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct in the July 6 shooting death of Massey, 36. Campbell, who hired Grayson for the Sangamon County Sheriff's Department in May 2023, reiterated his intent Wednesday to stay in the job.\n\n\"He has failed to explain how he ended up hiring this deputy sheriff who has been fired from other departments,\" Pritzker said of Campbell at an event in Chicago. \"He failed to put forward reforms that clearly need to be made, training and other reforms and still has failed to meet with the Massey family.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Chicago man gets 103 years for 2020 shooting death of a Bloomington man\n\nThere is no evidence Grayson was fired from any previous job. And Pritzker did not elaborate on what \"training and other reforms\" Campbell should have implemented since the killing.\n\nGrayson has come under scrutiny because -- prior to becoming a law enforcement officer -- he was kicked out of the Army a decade ago for the first of two drunken driving arrests within a year. His law enforcement career included six jobs in four years, during which he received some reviews that indicated he needed more training and had one disciplinary problem.\n\nGrayson was fired on July 17 for violating use-of-force standards by shooting Massey rather than taking non-lethal action when he felt threatened by a pan of hot water she was holding, according to authorities.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe sheriff signaled Wednesday that he would stay on the job.\n\n\"I was overwhelmingly elected to lead the sheriff's office through both good times and bad,\" Campbell said in a statement. \"I am fully prepared to continue leading my office and serving the residents of Sangamon County through this difficult period, ensuring we learn from this tragedy and work toward a better future.\"\n\nPritzker, who with Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton met with Massey's family two weeks ago, faulted Campbell for not sitting down with family members.\n\n\"At a minimum, listen to them, hear them, and then hopefully, take action,\" Pritzker said.\n\nCampbell said he has requested meetings with the family four times through family-designated intermediaries, but none has been accepted. He said he would still like to meet.\n\nHe also said he is willing to modify hiring practices but because Sangamon County follows statewide standards, necessary changes should be made statewide.\n\nThe sheriff's office \"continues to grieve for Sonya Massey and her family,\" Campbell said. \"While our grief cannot compare to the pain of the family, our office is trying to heal from within -- all employees of the sheriff's office feel betrayed by one of their own.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Sophia Tareen contributed from Chicago.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

We failed Sonya's family and friends.\"\n\nOne of those board members pushing for the advisory referendum, Sam Cahnman, said Tuesday that \"the best way to find out what the electorate wants is through an election.\"\n\nCahnman said although the vote would be advisory, \"the Jack Campbell I know is an honest, dedicated public servant, and I believe he would heed the will of the voters.\" Also sponsoring the resolution were Marc Ayers, Tony DelGiorno, Kevin McGuire, and Gina Lathan.\n\nTwenty of the county board members are Republicans with eight Democrats. There is one vacancy, though that seat will need to be filled by a Republican.\n\nThe county board would have to pass the referendum at its Aug. 13 meeting for it to get on the ballot.\n\nAsked whether he thinks Campbell should resign, Pritzker emphasized he wants more transparency in the hiring process.

J.B. Pritzker issued his strongest rebuke of the Sangamon County Sheriff Wednesday, a day after the one-month anniversary of Sonya Massey's death. The governor called the shooting of Massey, a Black woman in her home by a white former deputy \"horrific.\"\n\nBut then he turned his attention again to Sheriff Jack Campbell. \"I called for the sheriff's resignation because the sheriff has failed,\" Pritzker said. Just a day earlier, he said Campbell had not answered questions, such as why former Deputy Sean Grayson was hired, despite questions about his military and work history with other law enforcement.\n\n\"He failed to put forward reforms that clearly need to be made...training and other reforms. And still has failed to meet with the Massey family. That just seems outrageous to me. At a minimum, listen to them, hear them and then hopefully take action,\" Pritzker said.\n\nCampbell issued a statement moments later.\n\n\"On four separate occasions, I have requested to meet with the Massey family through intermediaries designated by the family. My requests have been rejected or not accepted. I am still willing to meet with the family.\" he said.\n\nThe governor mentioned a Black lawmaker shared with him that in years past, there wouldn't have been an investigation or body camera footage released and they wouldn't have known what happened.\n\n\"The silver lining in this, if there is a silver lining, is that someone is being held accountable. Yet, we have much more to do,\" the governor said.\n\nPritzker mentioned he met with Massey's family recently and some ideas for legislation were discussed, but he gave no details. \"I promised them we would look at every avenue to determine how we might prevent this from happening to anyone ever again.\"\n\nPritzker also said Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton has also called for Campbell to step down.\n\nCampbell said he is willing to work with the community and elected leaders to improve the department.\n\n\"However, before changes can be made, it is important to identify the problem,\" Campbell responded. \"We have used a process that we believe was consistent with statewide standards. If these standards are deficient, we would advocate a change at all necessary levels. We are working diligently to gather all the facts in order to make intelligent decisions and to avoid making changes that are unlikely to lead to meaningful results.\"\n\n\"We need to unite and heal,\" the sheriff continued. \"The one responsible is in jail and will never work in law enforcement again. Calls for my resignation are nothing more than political maneuvering during a tragic event and only hurt the good citizens of Sangamon County. I was overwhelmingly elected to lead the Sheriff's Office through both good times and bad. I am fully prepared to continue leading my office and serving the residents of Sangamon County through this difficult period, ensuring we learn from this tragedy and work toward a better future.\"\n\nAn effort among some Sangamon County Board members would add a non-binding referendum on Campbell's job performance to the fall ballot.

However, when Grayson and his partner arrived at the Springfield home, the atmosphere became tense over a pot of boiling water. Massey went into her kitchen to grab the pot and brought it over to the sink, per body camera footage. The officers, who were standing in the living room, stepped back, and Massey asked, \"What are you doing?\"\n\nOne officer responded that he was stepping away from her \"hot steaming water.\"\n\nIn response, Massey said, \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\" twice to the officers. Almost immediately, Grayson threatened to shoot her \"in her face\" and drew his firearm. Massey ducked below the sink with the pot in hand. At some point, the water from the pot splashed across the floor and Grayson shot at her three times, striking her fatally shot in the face.\n\nIn Grayson's field report released by authorities Monday, he claimed that he felt threatened by Massey's last words.\n\nRead more from The Associated Press:\n\n\"Sonya turned to face me holding the pot. I did not know the type of liquid that was boiling,\" Grayson wrote in his report three days after the incident. \"I advised Sonya to put the boiling liquid down. Sonya stated (she) was going to rebuke me in the name of Jesus. She stated this twice. I interpreted this to mean she was going to kill me.\"\n\nUpon hearing the religious admonition, Grayson then drew his pistol and barked commands to \"drop the (expletive) pot.\" Massey ducked behind the counter, rose up and appeared to grab the pan again before diving for cover. Grayson said he stepped toward and around the counter to keep Massey in sight, wary that she might have a hidden weapon.\n\n\"As I approached the cabinet, Sonya stood up from a crouched position, grabbing the pot, raising it above her head and throwing the boiling substance at me,\" Grayson reported. \"I was in imminent fear of getting boiling liquid to my face or chest, which would have caused great bodily harm or death.\"\n\nMassey's father, James Wilburn, previously told CBS Mornings he believed Massey rebuked Grayson in fear for her life or as a result of a premonition. He called Grayson an \"emissary\" of Satan.\n\nThe field report was completed three days after Grayson was placed on administrative leave following the shooting.

Right before she was shot, Massey had gotten up to remove a pot of hot water from the stove and said, \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\"\n\nAccording to Grayson's field report, reviewed by PEOPLE, the former deputy believed Massey's words were a threat.\n\n\"I interpreted this to mean she was going to kill me,\" Grayson wrote. \"I drew my weapon and pointed it at Sonya.\"\n\nGrayson wrote that he felt \"imminent fear\" that Massey was going to throw the pot of boiling liquid at him when he fired the shot.\n\nIn the body-camera footage, reviewed by PEOPLE, it is not clear if Massey did intend to throw the pot at Grayson or his partner. When the shot was fired, Massey is not seen on camera.\n\nGrayson, who was hired in May 2023, was indicted on charges of first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct on July 17 and has since pleaded not guilty.

Pritzker criticizes sheriff for hiring deputy who fatally shot Sonya Massey", "body": "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker on Tuesday criticized Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell for hiring the sheriff's deputy who fatally shot Sonya Massey in her kitchen after she called for help last month.\n\n\"I have a lot of questions and I'm so far disappointed with the answers that I'm hearing from the sheriff,\" the governor said during a news conference in Chicago. \"How did the sheriff end up hiring this person? (He) must have known their background, must have. I mean, no one hires somebody without checking the hirees' background.\"\n\nSean P. Grayson, who was fired after shooting Massey in the face, faces first-degree murder charges. He pleaded not guilty to the charges in Sangamon County Court on July 18 and remains in custody.\n\nGrayson's personnel files released last week by the county included testimony from one of his former police chiefs saying, \"he needed more training\" and also documented the two DUI convictions he had received in 2015 and 2016.\n\nThe records revealed he also scored \"low\" on his cognitive assessment as part of his psychological evaluation but met the acceptable standards for being hired.\n\nCampbell hired Grayson in May 2023 after serving in the Logan County Sheriff's Department and other Springfield-area police departments. His decision to hire Grayson has prompted an attempt to put an advisory referendum on the November ballot asking whether Campbell should stay in office.\n\nThe push comes from five Democrats on the Republican-majority county board and would not require the sheriff to step down if the voters approved it. Campbell has been steadfast in not leaving his office.\n\n\"I was elected sheriff to lead this office and protect the people of the county through good times and bad and certainly we're going through a rough time right now,\" Campbell told the The State Journal-Register, part of the USA TODAY Network, last week. \"For me to abandon the sheriff's office now would be irresponsible.\"\n\nHe added: \"We're certainly suffering, and the community is suffering, and I want to be here to help lead out of this situation that we're in.\"\n\nCampbell, a Republican, has been sheriff since 2018 and is next up for election in 2026. He admitted the department \"failed the community. We failed Sonya. We failed Sonya's family and friends.\"\n\nOne of those board members pushing for the advisory referendum, Sam Cahnman, said Tuesday that \"the best way to find out what the electorate wants is through an election.\"\n\nCahnman said although the vote would be advisory, \"the Jack Campbell I know is an honest, dedicated public servant, and I believe he would heed the will of the voters.\" Also sponsoring the resolution were Marc Ayers, Tony DelGiorno, Kevin McGuire, and Gina Lathan.\n\nTwenty of the county board members are Republicans with eight Democrats. There is one vacancy, though that seat will need to be filled by a Republican.\n\nThe county board would have to pass the referendum at its Aug. 13 meeting for it to get on the ballot.\n\nAsked whether he thinks Campbell should resign, Pritzker emphasized he wants more transparency in the hiring process. Last week, U.S. Rep. Nikki Budzinski, D-Springfield, told reporters in Springfield she was still looking for more information before she could call for his resignation.\n\nContact Patrick M.

Should Campbell resign?\n\nPritzker: Look, what happened to Sonya Massey should never happen to anyone ever again. And honestly, I have seen so much tragedy just over the course of my governorship. Think about George Floyd. Think about Breonna Taylor. Think about the, the many names of people, Sonya Massey included, who have been killed in similar circumstances by an officer of the law. We need to hold people accountable. I'm very proud of the work that the Illinois State Police did in investigating this quickly and bringing it to the state's attorney so that the deputy sheriff could be charged, and was charged, in fact, with three counts of murder appropriately so.\n\nThe way in which this deputy sheriff was hired, the background should have been taken into account. The way he was hired is an enormous question that still needs to be made transparent.\n\nHow did the sheriff end up hiring this person? Must have known their background. Must have. No one hires somebody without checking out the hiree's background. And so I have a lot of questions. And I'm so far disappointed with the answers that I'm hearing from the sheriff. But you know, I think that that the community is reacting the way that I think is appropriate, protesting, making their voice heard, asking for change.

Wes Wooden.\n\nGrayson's partner, the one who attempted to render aid to Massey but was dissuaded from doing so, is back at work but has not been cleared to return to patrol.

The Black woman was shot and killed in her home July 6by a white former deputy following a 9-1-1 call to report a possible prowler.\n\nThat former deputy, Sean Grayson, has been charged with three counts of First Degree Murder and remains held in custody. He has been fired from the department.\n\nBut that hasn't stopped Massey's family and others from calling for Campbell to resign. He has admitted the department failed, but said he has no plans to leave office.\n\nNow, a group of county board members is pushing for an advisory referendum on Campbell. The board has until Aug. 19 to agree or the referendum won't make the fall ballot.\n\n\"I agree with Massey family attorney Ben Crump, who when asked if Campbell should resign, said \"that is up to the electorate,\" said 18th District Democrat Sam Cahnman.\n\nCampbell's term as sheriff won't end until 2026. The ballot initiative would be non-binding, so Campbell, 60, would not be forced to leave no matter the outcome.\n\n\"The Jack Campbell I know is an honest, dedicated public servant and I believe he would heed the will of the voters,\" Cahnman said.\n\nMuch of the anger directed at Campbell has been over the hiring of Grayson, despite concerns about his job performance at other law enforcement agencies and a discharge for serious misconduct on his military record. Campbell has defended the hiring process.\n\n\"There was no indication that anything in his background would lead to a violent event like that,\" the sheriff said. Some experts disagree.\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker weighed in on Campbell Tuesday at an unrelated news conference. \"Look, what happened to Sonia Massey should never happen to anyone ever again,\" he said. \"The way in which this deputy sheriff was hired...the background should have been taken into account. I mean, no one hires somebody without checking out the hire's background. And so, I have a lot of questions and I'm so far disappointed with the answers that I'm hearing from the sheriff.\"\n\nCo-sponsors of the county board resolution include Cahnman, Tony Del Giorno, Marc Ayers, Gina Lathan and Kevin McGuire.\n\n\"The world is watching,\" Cahnman said. \"I implore my fellow board members let the people speak on this very important issue.\"", "source": {"uri": "wglt.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "wglt.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Campbell_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jack Campbell (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-1-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "9-1-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangamon_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_supervisors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Board of supervisors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Crump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Crump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Grayson, who is white, pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct stemming from the incident.\n\nBut for activists organizing around Massey's death, Grayson's charges are not enough to satisfy their calls for justice.\n\n\"There is something wrong with policing in the state of Illinois,\" the Rev. Al Sharpton, whose National Action Network helped organize Tuesday's rally, said.\n\nSharpton, who spent Monday with President Joe Biden discussing the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, renewed his calls on Congress to pass a version of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which was introduced in 2021.\n\nBut the longtime civil rights activist said while that bill is stalled in Congress, Illinois should act on similar legislation.\n\n\"We've got Black faces in high places in Illinois. Well, stand up and do something,\" Sharpton said. \"We didn't elect you to give us a press release. We want justice, we want fairness, we want equality. And if you can't do the job, then step back and let some people with some backbone step up and do what needs to be done.\"\n\nSharpton called on Illinois officials to enact more police reforms through a \"Sonya Massey Law,\" a name echoed in chants from the crowd throughout Tuesday evening's rally.\n\n\"In this law we need to make it illegal for police to be switching districts,\" Sharpton said.\n\nThis proposal comes, in part, from Grayson's work history. The 30-year old worked in six law enforcement agencies over four years before Massey's death.\n\nPrior to joining the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office, he worked in Logan County, where he disregarded orders during a high-speed chase and faced at least one misconduct complaint.\n\nSome measures outlined in the George Floyd Act are mirrored in Illinois' Safety, Accountability, Fairness and Equity-Today, or SAFE-T, Act, such as body camera requirements, a ban on chokeholds and expansions to police misconduct databases.\n\nWhile that law, which sparked significant opposition from Republicans in the years since its passage, has been amended several times, some want further reform.\n\nChicago-based civil rights lawyer Antonio Romanucci, who worked on the George Floyd case, said Tuesday that the Democratic National Convention in Chicago will provide activists an opportunity to lobby Gov. J.B. Pritzker and legislative leaders at the state Capitol to amend the SAFE-T Act.\n\nSpecifically, he advocated for instituting a waiting period for officers transferring between departments to allow for \"proper vetting.\"\n\n\"We want to fix this hole,\" Romanucci said. \"The SAFE-T Act is flawed.\"\n\nSenate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, defended the SAFE-T Act in a statement Wednesday, but said he would consider new ideas in response to Massey's death.\n\n\"We took steps to address this in the SAFE-T Act by requiring law enforcement to report misconduct violations when an officer is terminated or when an officer resigns under investigation of criminal offenses,\" he said. \"However, our work is not done, and I am open to any ideas for legislative action to prevent a tragedy like this from ever happening again.\"\n\nJaclyn Driscoll, a spokesperson for House Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch, D-Hillside, said Grayson \"should not have been an officer of the law given his track record.\"\n\n\"It is the responsibility of our police and sheriff's departments to utilize the tools this law provides,\" Driscoll said. \"With that said, Speaker Welch remains committed to responsible reform and refinements of the SAFE-T Act to ensure no family has to endure the same pain and suffering that Sonya Massey's is right now.\"\n\nRomanucci also pointed blame for Massey's death at Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell and called on him to resign. Massey's father, James Wilburn also called on Campbell to step down.\n\nCampbell attended a listening session facilitated by the U.S. Department of Justice on Monday, where he apologized and said his department \"failed\" Massey, her family and the community. He also said he did not plan to resign.\n\n\"He wanted to ask our forgiveness,\" Wilburn said. \"Anyone else in my family can forgive him, but I'm not. Because he has my baby's blood on his hands. He's got to go.\"\n\nWilburn indicated that if Campbell didn't resign and if no one else ran against him, he would take matters into his own hands and try to unseat Campbell, who was first elected to his position in 2018, and reelected in 2022.\n\n\"I'm not announcing my candidacy yet,\" Wilburn said. \"But I will. But I will.\"\n\nMassey's family is being represented by Ben Crump, dubbed by Sharpton as the \"attorney general for Black America.\" Crump has risen to national prominence in recent years after he began representing families of Black people killed by law enforcement officers, including George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake, Daunte Wright and others.\n\nThe rally Tuesday was the latest in a growing list of marches, rallies and protests held in response to Massey's death.\n\nActivist groups declared Sunday, July 28, a \"day of mourning\" for Massey and groups held events in New York, Los Angeles and St. Louis among other locations. In Springfield, around 300 people gathered at Comer Cox Park with the Massey family as part of the nationwide demonstrations.\n\nOn Saturday, Chicago saw a rally calling for police reform and a downtown march attended by hundreds. That march was organized in response to Massey's death as well as the deaths of two Black men - Samuel Sharpe Jr. and D'Vontaye Mitchell - in Milwaukee earlier this month. That group also wants Congress to pass reforms initially introduced in 2021.\n\n\"The murder of Sonya Massey is one of the most horrific police killings I've ever seen,\" Frank Chapman, one of the organizers of Saturday's protest and longtime left-wing activist, said in a statement last week. \"And just like Congress refused to pass an anti-lynching bill for a hundred years, they are refusing to pass the George Floyd bill now.\"\n\nAndrew Campbell contributed reporting to this story.\n\naadams@capitolnewsillinois.com", "source": {"uri": "chronicleillinois.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chronicle Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rick_hibbert@chronicleillinois.com", "name": "Rick Hibbert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAFE-T_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAFE-T Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Sharpton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Sharpton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangamon_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_Justice_in_Policing_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd Justice in Policing Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Action_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Action Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery (crime)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_County,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Campbell County, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Campbell County, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Chris_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emanuel Chris Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

(NEXSTAR) -- There was a funeral. There have been constant rallies and calls for change. The case has gotten international attention.\n\nNow, one month after Sonya Massey was shot by a Sangamon County Sheriff's Deputy, her family hosted a vigil back at her home on Hoover avenue where it all happened.\n\n\"We just tried to plan this (candlelight vigil) for her, because we haven't had one for her yet,\" Shadia Massey, Sonya's cousin said.\n\nThe vigil packed the small street. Her family, who is still processing it all, said the support has helped them a long these thirty days, but their path towards healing will go much longer.\n\n\"The community has been awesome and great for us, with us being together, and not just the Massey family having to do this by ourselves,\" Massey said.\n\nThe mission though hasn't changed. The family, along with activists and community organizers, are still calling for reform.\n\n\"I think change is going to happen, regardless of if (Sheriff Campbell) wants it or not,\" Teresa Haley, President of Visions 1908 said. \"It needs to happen in order for out community to heal.\"\n\nWith one month behind them, the family says they are still focused on that goal.\n\n\"We just want her name to stay out there. We are not letting this go. We will make sure justice is served,\" Massey said.\n\nPritzker weighs in on how Campbell has handled the case\n\nGovernor J.B. Pritzker was asked if Campbell should resign. So far, Campbell has had four county board members, all of who are democrats, call for his resignation, and the family of Sonya Massey has also called for his resignation.\n\nBut Campbell says he is staying put.\n\nPritzker avoided saying whether Campbell should keep his job, but he did make it clear he hasn't been happy with the way the county has handled this case.\n\n\"How did the sheriff end up hiring this person?\" Pritzker said Tuesday. \"Must have known their background. Must have. No one hires somebody without checking out the hire's background. And so I have a lot of questions. And I'm so far disappointed with the answers that I'm hearing from the sheriff. But you know, I think that that the community is reacting the way that I think is appropriate, protesting, making their voice heard, asking for change.\"\n\nSpringfield Police head into National Night Out aiming to rebuild relationships\n\nSpringfield Police Chief Ken Scarlette knows his department didn't hire Sean Grayson. But he acknowledged that Grayson's actions caused severe damage to the relationship between the community and all law enforcement in the community.\n\n\"It may not be my fault... for what transpired, but we will bear the shame and guilt for what a fellow law enforcement officer did in our community,\" Scarlette said at a Springfield City Council Meeting last week.\n\nThe weight of that carried over into National Night Out, an annual event for the department which became one of the first community outreach events the department and city solely sponsored since Massey's death.\n\nScarlette said events like these will continue to be more important as they look to rebuild relationships with the community.\n\n\"I think that is what we have to do, I think our agency has done that with events that have happened nationally,\" Scarlette said.\n\nCity Aldermen helped facilitate the national night out events. Ward 5 Alderwoman Lakeisha Purchase said she plans to continue holding events like this to help the community meet officers and learn about their roles and policies.\n\nBut she also said she knows it's time for some difficult conversations to be had in the city.\n\n\"We already come out, so all we have to do is continue to continue to be positive, and we also to have to have some uncomfortable conversations,\" Purchase said. \"I am not going to sit here and pretend like everything is good. There are some uncomfortable conversations that we have to have.\"\n\nPurchase said she plans to have another community forum with law enforcement leaders in the near future.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massey_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Massey family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_County,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Campbell County, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Campbell County, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Hoover", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Herbert Hoover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_organizing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Community organizing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlelight_vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Candlelight vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangamon_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

J.B. Pritzker called Wednesday for the resignation of the sheriff whose deputy fatally wounded Sonya Massey in her home last month after the Black woman called 911 for help.\n\nPritzker, a Democrat, said Republican Jack Campbell should step down because \"the sheriff has failed.\"\n\nSean Grayson, 30, faces three counts -- first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct -- in the July 6 shooting death of Massey, 36. Campbell, who hired Grayson for the Sangamon County sheriff's office in May 2023, reiterated his intent Wednesday to stay in the job.\n\n\"He has failed to explain how he ended up hiring this deputy sheriff who has been fired from other departments,\" Pritzker said of Campbell at an event in Chicago.\n\nThere is no evidence Grayson was fired from any previous job.\n\nAt an appearance Wednesday afternoon at the Illinois State Fair, Pritzker doubled down on his criticism of the sheriff. He said Campbell has refused to answer questions, despite the sheriff's office establishing a web page strictly for answering reporters' questions about the case, releasing documents and conducting a slew of 15-minute interviews with various media organizations last week.\n\nThe governor said Campbell should have talked to the chiefs of departments previously employing Grayson, but documents Campbell released show he did.\n\n4 hotel workers charged for role in death\n\nMADISON, Wis. -- Prosecutors charged four Milwaukee hotel employees Tuesday with being a party to felony murder in connection with D'Vontaye Mitchell's death.\n\nCharged were hotel security guard Todd Erickson; front desk worker Devin Johnson-Carson; bellhop Herbert Williamson; and security guard Brandon Turner. If convicted, they each would face up to 15 years and nine months in prison.\n\nReached by telephone Tuesday evening, Erickson referred a request for comment to his attorney, Michael Steinle, who didn't return voicemail or email messages.\n\nIt was unclear if any of the other three employees had attorneys. Online court records didn't list any for them Tuesday evening. A telephone listing for Williamson had been disconnected, and The Associated Press could not immediately locate phone numbers or other contact information for Johnson-Carson or Turner.\n\nThe Milwaukee County District Attorney's office said in a news release arrest warrants were issued for all four employees. The office and the Milwaukee Police Department did not immediately respond to emails inquiring if the employees were arrested or had attorneys.\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint, the four employees dragged Mitchell out of the Hyatt Hotel June 30 after Mitchell entered a woman's bathroom and held him on his stomach for eight or nine minutes.\n\nAn autopsy showed that Mitchell was morbidly obese and ingested cocaine and methamphetamine, the complaint said.\n\nThe county medical examiner determined that Mitchell died of \"restraint asphyxia.\" He may have lived if the employees allowed him to turn onto his side, the medical examiner said, according to the complaint.\n\nDeAsia Harmon, Mitchell's widow, said Tuesday the decision was a relief. But she questioned why it took weeks.\n\nAimbridge Hospitality, which manages the hotel, said previously several employees involved in Mitchell's death have been fired.\n\nSmall plane crashes mid-takeoff; 4 killed\n\nFour people were killed when a small airplane crashed Tuesday in Oklahoma City, local authorities said.\n\nThe plane crashed about 1:30 p.m. at Sundance Airport, a small airport on the outskirts of the city, according to Oklahoma City Fire Capt.

He has said he feared for his safety when he and his partner responded to Massey's call for help in the early morning hours of July 6, since Massey was holding a pot of boiling water and he was concerned she would fling the water at the officers. Whatever a jury ultimately decides, most who've seen the video have concluded that the shooting was unnecessary at the very least. That Grayson is white and Massey was Black raises racial discrimination questions that we face all too often in violent police interactions with the public.\n\nThe charges rapidly brought against Grayson no doubt helped keep the public outrage from being expressed violently on the streets, as has been the case with some past police shootings. But the after-the-fact finger-pointing by many, including Gov. J.B. Pritzker, has obscured the practical lesson that police departments around the state -- indeed around the nation -- can and should take from this brutal event.\n\nThe Sangamon County sheriff's office is far from the only department struggling to recruit officers and thus prone to making poor hires. With policing under more public pressure and scrutiny than any time we can remember, particularly in diverse, Democratic Party-controlled states like ours, the profession clearly isn't nearly as enticing as it used to be, even with early retirement, good salaries and generous pensions on offer. The Chicago Police Department, for one, is short about 2,000 officers.\n\nThe temptation for these departments, then, is to skimp on the background checks and vetting that are necessary to weed out the unsuitable but can hamper recruiting. There were plenty of red flags available on Grayson, including a 2015 citation for driving under the influence and a record of working for five different police forces in the three years before Sangamon hired him in May 2023. At a bare minimum, an applicant bouncing around that many departments in such a short period of time ought to compel a police chief interested in hiring him to call the chiefs of those other departments for an honest assessment rather than relying on applicant-provided references.\n\nThe public has an interest in fully staffed police departments. But there's an even greater public interest in taking every step possible to ensure those on the force are truly qualified and well trained. Better to be undermanned than to run the risk of employing officers prone to losing their cool in tense moments, flaws that carry with them potentially fatal consequences. Sonya Massey's tragic death is a cautionary tale for police chiefs everywhere.\n\nThat brings us to the matter of the police chief in this case, Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell. Campbell has defended the process he undertook when hiring Grayson, saying he followed normal procedures, but has allowed there are changes he'll make going forward.\n\n\"My standard is now that 'I want you to figure out a way not to hire this person,'\" Campbell told Illinois Public Media News. By that, we took him to mean that every applicant will be scrutinized as thoroughly as possible. If that's what he meant, we agree.\n\nCampbell's explanations haven't been good enough so far, though, for Pritzker and the Sangamon County Democratic Party. Both have called for the Republican sheriff to resign.\n\nIn addition to finding Campbell's rationale for hiring Grayson to be unconvincing, Pritzker criticized the sheriff for failing to meet with Massey's family, something Campbell said he's tried to do. Clad in a bright yellow shirt as he unveiled the traditional butter cow at the state fair on Wednesday, the governor spent more than 15 minutes explaining why he thought Campbell had to go. It was an odd setting to talk on such a serious subject, but kudos to Pritzker for making himself available to reporters despite the backdrop. Thus far, Campbell, who isn't up for reelection until 2026, has rebuffed the calls to step down.\n\nIt's relatively easy, of course, for the Democratic governor to castigate a Republican sheriff in a case that has garnered national headlines and reflects poorly on the state. It wasn't hard to detect the whiff of politics in the harsh criticism of a GOP officeholder by a governor with national aspirations (and demonstrated prospects) who needs to appear as tough as possible responding to a horrific police shooting within the state's capital city.\n\nWe'd be a bit less cynical had Pritzker, for example, been as critical when his appointees to the Illinois Prisoner Review Board failed so starkly earlier this year to keep convicted domestic abuser Crosetti Brand behind bars, freeing him (despite numerous red flags) to allegedly kill the 11-year-old son of an ex-girlfriend as she was attacked as well and badly injured. Pritzker asked two of those appointees, including the board chair, to resign. But when it came to his own appointees, who failed every bit as badly as Campbell did with similarly fatal consequences, the governor publicly expressed nothing like the outrage he leveled at the sheriff.\n\nSangamon County is dominated by Republicans at the local level. To date, as far as we've seen, no local GOPers have called on Campbell to leave.\n\nIf Campbell resigned over this tragic lapse, that would be an appropriate acceptance of responsibility. But he's an elected official answerable to the voters of the county, not Gov. Pritzker. If he chooses to stick to the path of attempting to improve the office's personnel management and regaining the public trust as he runs again, the voters of that county will be able to decide two years from now on his ongoing suitability.", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "editorial_board@chicagotribune.com", "name": "Editorial Board", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayson_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grayson County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grayson County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangamon_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sangamon County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Campbell County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Campbell County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racial discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

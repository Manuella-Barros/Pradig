Eden Garrity, 31, was pushing a trolley as the Thomas Cook flight from Cuba to Manchester passed through a violent Atlantic hail storm. The plane suddenly thrust up 500ft, slamming Eden into the ground and snapping her leg in several places. She couldn\u2019t walk for the next two months and underwent a number of operations as well as intense rehabilitation. Eden was left with nerve damage and is no longer able to stand up for long periods, which means she can\u2019t return to her much-loved job as an air steward. She has received a six-figure payout that will help her financially, but she says it can\u2019t make up for the fact she\u2019s lost her dream career. She said: \u2018It has left me bitter, I\u2019m resentful for it. It\u2019s just frustrating. It was the best job in the world and I feel like I\u2019ve lost a piece of my personality. Eden\u2019s leg in a cast and brace after the incident (Picture: Eden Garrity/SWNS) \u2018You see people you\u2019re friends with and they\u2019re travelling in the skies and I\u2019m not, I\u2019m forever grounded. I\u2019ll never be able to fly for work again. \u2018I feel lost, I\u2019ve got a family and a son and it is great, but I\u2019m very restricted in terms of what I can do. I miss making memories, seeing different countries. \u2018If not for the accident I\u2019d have been able to fly in the future and it\u2019s horrible. \u2018I appreciate the payout but it doesn\u2019t bring back what I\u2019ve lost.\u2019 Eden, from Leigh in Greater Manchester, lay on the floor of the plane in agony for an hour after the incident, as they waited for the turbulence to stop. The back row of seats was then cleared and she was able to lay down there until they landed in Manchester seven hours later. \u2018The doctor said it was like a sledgehammer hitting the bottom of my foot,\u2019 she said. Eden working on board a flight in 2019, before the accident (Picture: Eden Garrity/SWNS) \u2018Six passengers lifted me up and over to lay me across three seats at the back of the plane and the ambulance was waiting at the airport for me.\u2019 Eden had broken her fibula in five places, her tibia once, fractured the side of her foot and cracked her ankle bone. She needed surgery to insert screws and metal plates inside her leg, as well as a huge external metal brace. Eden said the flight had taken a detour of around 100 miles to avoid bad weather conditions as it crossed the Atlantic in August 2019. But Eden says she and other crew members had not been made aware of the risk of turbulence either during the journey, or at the pre-flight staff briefing. She said: \u2018Usually if we\u2019re going to have some turbulence they tell us before the flight and let us know what the plans are. She says she feels lost not doing what she loves (Picture: SWNS/Eden Garrity) \u2018For example, they might say \u2018we\u2019re going to put the seatbelt signs on\u2019 or \u2018we\u2019re not going to release you\u2019. While Thomas Cook\u2019s insurers denied responsibility for her injuries, Eden has received an undisclosed compensation care package worth six figures. Injury law expert Neil Richards, who represented Eden, said: \u2018The circumstances surrounding the incident in which Miss Garrity sustained her injuries should have been foreseen. \u2018The issue of inflight safety, especially when working in certain geographical regions including the Caribbean, carries a known health and safety risk. Mr Richards, from Thompsons Solicitors, added: \u2018Turbulence also represents an obvious and serious danger to all those onboard, and especially to airline staff who are required to work in and around the cabin in such environments.\u2019 Eden had to have screws and metal plates inserted (Picture: SWNS/Eden Garrity) As of yesterday, 43 people, including Brits, were still in hospital after a Singapore Airlines flight plunged 6,000ft during turbulence, throwing passengers out of their seats. Out of those, 22 suffered spinal injuries and six had brain and skull injuries. One British passenger, Geoffrey Kitchen, 73, died of a suspected heart attack during the terrifying ordeal. Meanwhile, a dozen people were injured when a Qatar Airways flight from Doha to Dublin hit turbulence while flying over Turkey this morning. Six passengers and six crew members were injured during the flight, which landed safely as scheduled just before 1pm. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

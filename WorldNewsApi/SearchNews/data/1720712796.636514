The independent candidate has overturned predictions, placing himself after the two major parties, conservative DISY and left-wing AKEL. Exit polls from public broadcaster, CyBC, place him third with an estimated 15.7-18.3% of the vote. Similar results are echoed in the exit poll for Alpha TV channel. Fidias, the son of a Greek Orthodox priest, with no formal studies or academic credentials, has built a career on TikTok and YouTube, amassing hundreds of thousands of followers. His English-language YouTube channel boasts 2.6 million subscribers since he began posting in 2019. He shot to fame by embarking on a mission to hug Elon Musk. Months ago, when announcing his intention to run for the European Parliament, Panagiotou appeared in a video wearing three ties, a jacket, and\u2026 shorts. He candidly admitted from the outset that he knew nothing about politics or the European Union but vowed to ask questions, read, and learn within a few months. \u201cI am 23 years old and I have never voted in my life, and I said to myself one night that if I never vote and I never take an interest, the same nerds are always going to be in power, and I said \u2018enough!\u2019\u201d he said. In the lead-up to Sunday\u2019s elections, Fidias, who served in the Cypriot army\u2019s Underwater Demolition Command admitted that he used to back far-right ELAM. \u201cI heard somewhere that if you are not satisfied with things around you and you want them to change, you have to be the change,\u201d he said on the occasion. \u201cWhy did I choose to be independent? Because I can\u2019t fit into molds. Because I want you to know that I have no party interests to serve.\u201d Upon hearing the first exit polls\u2019 results on Sunday night he said \u201cWe have achieved a miracle\u201d. He touted his predicted election as \u201can important day, not only for Cyprus but possibly also for the entire world.\u201d The 24-year-old credited his victory to the power of social media. \u201cThis is maybe the first time a completely independent candidate has been elected, without having any relation whatsoever with a political party, but with social media as his only weapon, and nothing else.\u201d He added that the election results should ring alarm bells to the political establishment. He urged traditional politicians to leave behind their conflicts and remember they are serving the people and not their own interests. Shortly after the exit polls, he posted a video on TikTok announcing he would hold \u201cCyprus\u2019s largest-ever party\u201d and asked his followers to pick the location. @fidiaspanayiotou \u266c original sound \u2013 Fidias Panayiotou Read more", "summary": "In a surprising turn of events, 24-year-old, social media star Fidias Panagiotou is projected to come in third place in Cyprus&#8217;s European Parliament elections, according to exit polls.

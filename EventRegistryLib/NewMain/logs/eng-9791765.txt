Japan's Nikkei 225 crashed more than 12%, Europe's Stoxx lost 2.17%, and the Nasdaq is down 3.8% on Monday after sinking 3.6% last week.\n\nNow, economists are calling on the Federal Reserve to cut rates as soon as possible -- with some warning it may be too late to avoid a recession.\n\nJeremy Siegel, professor emeritus of finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and senior economist at WisdomTree, told CNBC on Monday the Fed should institute an emergency rate cut of 75 basis points immediately. He also thinks the Fed should cut rates another 75 basis points at the September policy meeting.\n\nThat would lower the fed funds rate to a range of 3.75%-4% from the current level of 5.25%-5.5%, which is the highest rate in 23 years.\n\n\"The fed funds rate right now should be somewhere between 3.5% and 4%,\" Siegel told CNBC. \"The market knows so much better than the Fed, so they've got to respond.\"\n\nWhile an emergency rate cut isn't unprecedented, it would be unusual -- and it's mostly happened during severe economic downturns. There were two emergency rate cuts in 2008 during the Great Financial Crisis, one in January and one in October. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were also two emergency rate cuts in March 2020.\n\nSiegel said he has \"very simple logic\" for his position on calling for an emergency Fed rate cut. At the June meeting, the Fed's survey of economic projections showed that policymakers see the fed funds rate eventually settling at 2.8% over the long term. Those projections also assume the unemployment rate will be 4.2% over the long term with inflation at 2%.\n\n\"Well, on Friday, we blew across the employment number. We're at 4.3%,\" Siegel said. \"As far as inflation, we're at 2.5%. Those are the two targets explicitly mentioned by the Federal Reserve. And how much have we moved the fed funds rate? Zero. That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.\"\n\nWhen asked whether he thought the market would rip higher or fall, Siegel insisted the market would respond positively. \"It rips. It welcomes it, absolutely, because it's far behind the curve right now,\" he told CNBC.\n\nNot only that, but Siegel believes the market will react \"badly\" if the Fed doesn't step in before its September meeting. \"If they're going to be as slow on the way down as they were on the way up -- which, by the way, was the worst policy error in 50 years -- then we're not in for a good time with this economy.\"\n\nSimilarly, Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan, said in a note on Friday that \"there's a strong case\" to cut before the Fed's September meeting, though he thinks the first one will come next month.\n\nOther economists and finance professionals believe, however, that an emergency rate cut -- especially one as drastic as Siegel is calling for -- would do more harm than good.\n\n\"This would be a radical move which would create more panic,\" Bill Miles, an economics professor at Wichita State University, told Fortune. \"Yes, unemployment has risen, but the labor market is still in decent shape, and inflation is still not quite down to where the Fed would like. The September meeting is less than a month away, and signaling a 50-basis-point cut at [that] meeting would be the best policy response.\"\n\nMatt Willer, managing director for capital markets at investment firm Phoenix Capital Group Holdings, also said emergency rate cuts are a \"sign of panic\" to markets.\n\n\"The next meeting isn't all that far off in the scope of things, and the Fed typically won't bow to markets for this exact reason,\" Willer told Fortune. \"If we have waited too long to lower rates, I'm not convinced that an emergency cut would be the proactive solution anyway.\"\n\nAnd while Siegel is calling for a bigger cut, he acknowledged it's an unlikely outcome.\n\n\"They're not going to do 75 [basis points],\" he said. However, \"don't think that the Fed knows something,\" he added. \"Since when has the Fed known anything about the economy?\"", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sydney_lake@fortune.com", "name": "Sydney Lake", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Siegel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Siegel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wharton_School", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wharton School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emeritus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emeritus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikkei 225"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007\u20132008_financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2007\u20132008 financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wichita State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fortune (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-465693684-e1722885360687.jpg?resize=1200,600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 1324, "textEnd": 1334}], "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Here's what financial experts are saying", "body": "Can the U.S. economy continue chugging along with interest rates at the highest level in two decades? It's a question rattling throughout financial markets following July's weak jobs report and the subsequent global sell-off in equities.\n\nAfter its meeting last week, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates at 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent. July's jobs report was released shortly after the meeting, showing slower growth than expected and an uptick in the unemployment rate to 4.3 percent. That's the highest unemployment rate since October 2021, though it's still a historically low figure. What followed was a global frenzy in the stock markets. As of Monday, Japan's Nikkei dropped more than 12 percent, while U.S. stock markets fell by more than 2.5 percent.\n\nMany financial experts and investors anticipate the Fed will cut interest rates in its September meeting. However, with that meeting seven weeks away, some economists are now speculating that the Fed could announce an emergency rate cut before then due to growing recession fears. Bankrate's Second-Quarter Economic Indicator Survey found there's a 32 percent chance the economy will be in a recession by this time next year.\n\nHere's what the experts are saying about the potential for an eighth emergency rate cut.\n\nWill the Fed make an emergency rate cut?\n\nWith recession fears on the rise, many economists and financial experts are divided on whether the Fed will implement an emergency rate cut before its next meeting in September.\n\nFor most of the past two years, the Fed has hiked interest rates to control the pace of inflation that has bedeviled consumers since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those rate hikes have driven inflation downward, from 9.1 percent in June 2022 to 3 percent in June 2024. The central bank is now wrestling with the question of when to reverse course. If it keeps rates elevated for too long, it could push the economy into recession.\n\nMark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, says the U.S. economy is \"not even close to the sort of crisis developments that would motivate the Fed to cut rates between meetings.\"\n\nIn order for the Fed to make a move like that, Hamrick says that markets would need to seize up to the point where businesses and consumers would have extremely limited access to cash and borrowing money, similar to what was seen early in the COVID-19 pandemic and during the 2007-2008 financial crisis.\n\n\"It can be argued that the current level of their benchmark rate is overly restrictive and needs to come down,\" Hamrick says. \"That's why expectations are high that a September rate cut is likely.\"\n\nHowever, two prominent economists say that stock market turmoil could be enough reason for an emergency Fed rate cut. Paul Krugman, a Nobel laureate in economics and a New York Times Opinion columnist, wrote on X that he wasn't anticipating an inter-meeting rate cut from the Fed because it would incite more panic, but with the already-high level of panic among investors, he says there may be a \"real case for an emergency cut soon.\"\n\n\"So, even though I've been arguing for rate cuts - 50 in September for sure - I wasn't calling for an inter-meeting cut, because that might signal panic,\" Krugman wrote on X. \"But since we may be seeing a panic anyway, that argument loses its force.\"\n\nJeremy Siegel, an economist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, voiced concerns over the Fed's recent decision to keep interest rates steady and called for a 75-basis-point emergency cut in the Fed funds rate during an interview with CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" Siegel also predicts another 75-basis-point cut at the Fed's September meeting.\n\n\"We've gone 90 percent toward the target on the inflation rate,\" he said in the interview. \"We've overshot the target on unemployment [4.2 percent]. Those are the two targets explicitly mentioned by the Federal Reserve. How much have we moved the Fed funds rate? Zero.\"\n\n\"The concern of the Fed doing an emergency cut or stepping in too hard is now going to worry people even further, in a way that isn't necessarily going to be helpful,\" Hunt said in the interview. \"These markets need to stabilize.\"\n\nIn a CNBC \"Squawk Box\" interview, Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee wouldn't say whether the central bank would make an emergency rate cut, but he did acknowledge that the Fed has been in a \"restrictive posture\" regarding its monetary policy. He emphasized that the Fed will step in if the economy starts to deteriorate.\n\n\"You only want to be that restrictive if there's fear of overheating. The data to me does not look like overheating,\" Goolsbee said in the interview. \"It's the markets' job to react, and the Fed's job to act.\"\n\n3 reasons why there likely won't be an emergency rate cut\n\nA few economists and financial experts anticipate an emergency Fed rate cut, but many don't. Here are three reasons why the Fed likely wouldn't step in before its next meeting in September.\n\nIt would further worry Americans. An emergency rate cut may create more fear among Americans and cement worries that the U.S. is headed toward a recession. The Fed strives to maximize employment, stabilize prices and maintain financial stability, so an inter-meeting rate cut could have the opposite effect that the Fed wants.\n\nSome stock market volatility isn't enough to prompt an emergency Fed rate cut. Markets react faster and are more volatile than monetary policy. Given the limited economic data, many experts believe the stock market's volatility is an overreaction. However, some experts argue that the panic is already enough for the Fed to take action and implement an emergency rate cut.\n\nThe economy isn't showing enough signs of distress. While there has recently been some weaker economic data, it isn't enough to sound alarms. The economy added fewer jobs than expected in July and unemployment crept up to 4.3 percent, but that's still a historically low figure for unemployment. Inflation fell to 3 percent in June, the lowest it's been since early 2021, according to the latest CPI report.

Continues - UrduPoint", "body": "The ongoing global stock sell-off has fueled calls for the US Federal Reserve to lower interest rates swiftly and decisively, with some analysts now calling for it to make an emergency cut before its September rate decision\n\nWashington, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Aug, 2024) The ongoing global stock sell-off has fueled calls for the US Federal Reserve to lower interest rates swiftly and decisively, with some analysts now calling for it to make an emergency cut before its September rate decision.\n\nThe futures markets, which as recently as last week expected a single quarter percentage-point cut at the US central bank's next rate decision in September, now see a half-point cut as much more likely, according to data from CME Group.\n\n\"The rate tide has quickly turned,\" Bank of America economists wrote in a recent note to clients, adding they now see a September rate cut as \"a virtual lock.\"\n\nThe US central bank has held its benchmark lending rate at a two-decade high for the past year as it battles to return inflation to its long-term target of two percent.\n\nAfter a small uptick earlier this year, annual headline inflation is now falling once more toward the target, while the US economy is still growing and the labor market has weakened.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled last week that the first rate cut could come \"as soon as\" September.\n\nBut some analysts fear that may not be soon enough, as the markets have responded in dramatic fashion to last week's below-target US jobs report, which raised fears that the US was entering a recession.\n\n\"I'm calling for a 75-basis point emergency cut in the Fed funds rate, with another 75-basis point cut indicated for next month at the September meeting,\" Wharton School professor emeritus of finance Jeremy Siegel told CNBC on Monday morning. \"And that's minimum.\"\n\n\"I wasn't calling for an inter-meeting cut, because that might signal panic,\" the Nobel prize-winning US economist Paul Krugman wrote in a social media post on Monday.\n\n\"But since we may be seeing a panic anyway, that argument loses its force,\" he said, adding: \"Real case for an emergency cut soon.\"\n\n- 'Not looking' like recession -\n\nAll three major indices on Wall Streets extended recent losses on Monday as investors continued selling AI-related tech stocks and locking in recent gains.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.\n\n6 percent, while the broad-based S&P 500 fell three percent, and the tech-rich Nasdaq closed down more than 3.4 percent.\n\nUnderscoring the market's concerns, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) -- commonly known as Wall Street's \"fear gauge\" -- spiked in early trading, briefly hitting a high not seen since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nBut speaking to CNBC before markets opened, Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee urged caution about reading too much into one jobs report.\n\n\"As you see jobs numbers come in weaker than expected but not looking yet like recession, I do think you want to be forward-looking of where the economy is headed,\" he said.\n\n\"The payroll jobs number is plus or minus 100,000 a month, so be a little careful over-concluding about things in the margin of error,\" he continued, adding that if the US economy deteriorated, the Fed would \"fix it.\"\n\n- 'Infer too much' -\n\nWhile some economists are now calling for emergency rate cuts, others have continued to voice support for a September move.\n\n\"It is usually a mistake to infer too much from one jobs report absent a major shock that abruptly changes the picture,\" Goldman Sachs economists David Mericle and Manuel Abecasis wrote in an investor note published Sunday, while raising their forecast for a recession to 25 percent, up 10 percentage-points.\n\n\"The Fed probably will place little weight on the drop in stock prices, as the main indexes still are higher than at the start of the year,\" economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note to clients.\n\nWhether it moves now or in a September, any Fed cut before the US presidential election in

Continues - UrduPoint", "body": "The ongoing global stock sell-off has fueled calls for the US Federal Reserve to lower interest rates swiftly and decisively, with some analysts now calling for it to make an emergency cut before its September rate decision\n\nWashington, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Aug, 2024) The ongoing global stock sell-off has fueled calls for the US Federal Reserve to lower interest rates swiftly and decisively, with some analysts now calling for it to make an emergency cut before its September rate decision.\n\nThe futures markets, which as recently as last week expected a single quarter percentage-point cut at the US central bank's next rate decision in September, now see a half-point cut as much more likely, according to data from CME Group.\n\n\"The rate tide has quickly turned,\" Bank of America economists wrote in a recent note to clients, adding they now see a September rate cut as \"a virtual lock.\"\n\nThe US central bank has held its benchmark lending rate at a two-decade high for the past year as it battles to return inflation to its long-term target of two percent.\n\nAfter a small uptick earlier this year, annual headline inflation is now falling once more toward the target, while the US economy is still growing and the labor market has weakened.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled last week that the first rate cut could come \"as soon as\" September.\n\nBut some analysts fear that may not be soon enough, as the markets have responded in dramatic fashion to last week's below-target US jobs report, which raised fears that the US was entering a recession.\n\n\"I'm calling for a 75-basis point emergency cut in the Fed funds rate, with another 75-basis point cut indicated for next month at the September meeting,\" Wharton School professor emeritus of finance Jeremy Siegel told CNBC on Monday morning. \"And that's minimum.\"\n\n\"I wasn't calling for an inter-meeting cut, because that might signal panic,\" the Nobel prize-winning US economist Paul Krugman wrote in a social media post on Monday.\n\n\"But since we may be seeing a panic anyway, that argument loses its force,\" he said, adding: \"Real case for an emergency cut soon.\"\n\nAll three major indices on Wall Streets extended recent losses on Monday as investors continued selling AI-related tech stocks and locking in recent gains.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.\n\n6 percent, while the broad-based S&P 500 fell three percent, and the tech-rich Nasdaq closed down more than 3.4 percent.\n\nUnderscoring the market's concerns, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) -- commonly known as Wall Street's \"fear gauge\" -- spiked in early trading, briefly hitting a high not seen since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nBut speaking to CNBC before markets opened, Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee urged caution about reading too much into one jobs report.\n\n\"As you see jobs numbers come in weaker than expected but not looking yet like recession, I do think you want to be forward-looking of where the economy is headed,\" he said.\n\n\"The payroll jobs number is plus or minus 100,000 a month, so be a little careful over-concluding about things in the margin of error,\" he continued, adding that if the US economy deteriorated, the Fed would \"fix it.\"\n\nWhile some economists are now calling for emergency rate cuts, others have continued to voice support for a September move.\n\n\"It is usually a mistake to infer too much from one jobs report absent a major shock that abruptly changes the picture,\" Goldman Sachs economists David Mericle and Manuel Abecasis wrote in an investor note published Sunday, while raising their forecast for a recession to 25 percent, up 10 percentage-points.\n\n\"We changed our Fed forecast after the employment report to include an initial string of three consecutive 25bp (basis point) rate cuts in September, November, and December,\" they said, adding an additional quarter-point cut into their forecast for this year.\n\nWhether it moves now or in a September, any Fed cut before the US presidential election in November will thrust the independent US central bank into the middle of the political campaign between former Republican president Donald Trump and Democratic vice president Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump has previously accused Powell -- whom he first nominated to run the Fed -- of displaying political favoritism toward the Democratic Party, and suggested that he would not reappoint the central banker as Fed chair if he wins in November.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve",

The market knows so much better than the Fed, so they've got to respond.\"\n\nSiegel added: \"If they are going to be as slow on the way down as they were on the way up, which by the way was the first policy error in 50 years, then we're not in for a good time with this economy.\"\n\nWhen asked if any of the stock market decline was driven by the rising chances of Kamala Harris winning the November Presidential election, Siegel reiterated that the issue was firmly with the Fed rather than the coming presidential election or geopolitical tensions, as some commentators have suggested.\n\n\"I don't think the race, I don't think Iran or Japan is the source of this slowdown. I think it's in Washington DC at the Federal Reserve building, that's the source,\" Siegel said.\n\nJPMorgan strategist Mislav Matejka said in a Monday note that the lack of Fed rate cuts in the first half of the year will weigh on economic growth in the second half, and that any coming interest rate cuts from the Fed likely won't be enough.\n\n\"The Fed will start easing, but more in a reactive way and as a response to weakening growth, i.e. it is likely behind the curve -- this might not be enough to drive a rebound,\" Matejka said.\n\nYet, while the Fed may be \"behind the curve,\" that could be by design.\n\nThat's because Powell wants to convince the market that even in the face of a potential recession, he is still determined to tame inflation, just like former Fed chairman Paul Volcker did in the 1980s.\n\n\"Powell has had it much easier than Volcker so far, but he still needs to deliver the same message. That is happening right now. Seeming to be behind the curve also helps Powell and the FOMC push back against the idea that its eventual rate cuts will be politically motivated,\" DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas said in a Monday note.\n\nRegardless of what the Fed's motivation might be with waiting until September to cut interest rates, the market is taking away a pretty clear message.\n\n\"There is growing sentiment is that the Fed has waited too long to cut interest rates and is now behind the curve,\" Comerica Wealth Management CIO John Lynch said.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.in", "dataType": "news",

Experts argue the Fed's decision to leave rates unchanged at its last meeting contributed to the chaos. Calls for steep rate cuts highlight concerns over the Fed's delayed response to a slowing economy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is to blame for the historic stock market plunge since last week, according to a growing chorus of market experts.\n\nThe S&P 500 dropped as much as 7% since the Federal Reserve left rates unchanged at the current range of 5.25%-5.50% at its policy meeting last week.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 was down as much as 10% over the same time period.\n\nWharton professor Jeremy Siegel told CNBC on Monday that the Fed is way behind the curve, arguing that they should implement 150 basis points over the next two months.\n\n\"I'm calling for a 75 basis point emergency cut in the Fed funds rate, with another 75 basis point cut indicated for next month at the September meeting, and that's minimum,\" Siegel said.\n\nSiegel believes the Federal funds rate should be 3.50%-4%.\n\nSiegel has long criticized Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for acting too late in raising interest rates during the inflation boom in 2021 and 2022, and now he thinks Powell is making exact mistake by waiting too long to cut interest rates.\n\n\"Since when has the Fed known anything about the economy?\" Siegel asked. \"Look at what happened three years ago. The market knows so much better than the Fed, so they've got to respond.\"\n\nSiegel added: \"If they are going to be as slow on the way down as they were on the way up, which by the way was the first policy error in 50 years, then we're not in for a good time with this economy.\"\n\nWhen asked if any of the stock market decline was driven by the rising chances of Kamala Harris winning the November Presidential election, Siegel reiterated that the issue was firmly with the Fed rather than the coming presidential election or geopolitical tensions, as some commentators have suggested.\n\n\"I don't think the race, I don't think Iran or Japan is the source of this slowdown. I think it's in Washington DC at the Federal Reserve building, that's the source,\" Siegel said.\n\nJPMorgan strategist Mislav Matejka said in a Monday note that the lack of Fed rate cuts in the first half of the year will weigh on economic growth in the second half, and that any coming interest rate cuts from the Fed likely won't be enough.\n\n\"The Fed will start easing, but more in a reactive way and as a response to weakening growth, i.e. it is likely behind the curve -- this might not be enough to drive a rebound,\" Matejka said.\n\nYet, while the Fed may be \"behind the curve,\" that could be by design.\n\nThat's because Powell wants to convince the market that even in the face of a potential recession, he is still determined to tame inflation, just like former Fed chairman Paul Volcker did in the 1980s.\n\n\"Powell has had it much easier than Volcker so far, but he still needs to deliver the same message. That is happening right now. Seeming to be behind the curve also helps Powell and the FOMC push back against the idea that its eventual rate cuts will be politically motivated,\" DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas said in a Monday note.\n\nRegardless of what the Fed's motivation might be with waiting until September to cut interest rates, the market is taking away a pretty clear message.\n\n\"There is growing sentiment is that the Fed has waited too long to cut interest rates and is now behind the curve,\" Comerica Wealth Management CIO John Lynch said.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_fox@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Matthew Fox", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Siegel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Siegel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Volcker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Volcker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Industrial_Organizations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congress of Industrial Organizations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/66b0ebc6a5247369a3e9794f.jpg?ver=1722881006", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

pressure to cut rates", "body": "The ongoing global stock sell-off has fueled calls for the US Federal Reserve to lower interest rates swiftly and decisively, with some analysts now calling for it to make an emergency cut before its September rate decision.\n\nThe futures markets, which as recently as last week expected a single quarter percentage-point cut at the US central bank's next rate decision in September, now see a half-point cut as much more likely, according to data from CME Group.\n\n\"The rate tide has quickly turned,\" Bank of America economists wrote in a recent note to clients, adding they now see a September rate cut as \"a virtual lock.\"\n\nThe US central bank has held its benchmark lending rate at a two-decade high for the past year as it battles to return inflation to its long-term target of two percent.\n\nAfter a small uptick earlier this year, annual headline inflation is now falling once more toward the target, while the US economy is still growing and the labor market has weakened.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled last week that the first rate cut could come \"as soon as\" September.\n\nBut some analysts fear that may not be soon enough, as the markets have responded in dramatic fashion to last week's below-target US jobs report, which raised fears that the US was entering a recession.\n\n\"I'm calling for a 75-basis point emergency cut in the Fed funds rate, with another 75-basis point cut indicated for next month at the September meeting,\" Wharton School professor emeritus of finance Jeremy Siegel told CNBC on Monday morning. \"And that's minimum.\"\n\n\"I wasn't calling for an inter-meeting cut, because that might signal panic,\" the Nobel prize-winning US economist Paul Krugman wrote in a social media post on Monday.\n\n\"But since we may be seeing a panic anyway, that argument loses its force,\" he said, adding: \"Real case for an emergency cut soon.\"\n\nAll three major indices on Wall Streets extended recent losses on Monday as investors continued selling AI-related tech stocks and locking in recent gains.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.6 percent, while the broad-based S&P 500 fell three percent, and the tech-rich Nasdaq closed down more than 3.4 percent.\n\nUnderscoring the market's concerns, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) -- commonly known as Wall Street's \"fear gauge\" -- spiked in early trading, briefly hitting a high not seen since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nBut speaking to CNBC before markets opened, Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee urged caution about reading too much into one jobs report.\n\n\"As you see jobs numbers come in weaker than expected but not looking yet like recession, I do think you want to be forward-looking of where the economy is headed,\" he said.\n\n\"The payroll jobs number is plus or minus 100,000 a month, so be a little careful over-concluding about things in the margin of error,\" he continued, adding that if the US economy deteriorated, the Fed would \"fix it.\"\n\nWhile some economists are now calling for emergency rate cuts, others have continued to voice support for a September move.\n\n\"It is usually a mistake to infer too much from one jobs report absent a major shock that abruptly changes the picture,\" Goldman Sachs economists David Mericle and Manuel Abecasis wrote in an investor note published Sunday, while raising their forecast for a recession to 25 percent, up 10 percentage-points.\n\n\"The Fed probably will place little weight on the drop in stock prices, as the main indexes still are higher than at the start of the year,\" economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note to clients.\n\nWhether it moves now or in a September, any Fed cut before the US presidential election in November will thrust the independent US central bank into the middle of the political campaign between former Republican president Donald Trump and Democratic vice president Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump has previously accused Powell -- whom he first nominated to run the Fed -- of displaying political favoritism toward the Democratic Party, and suggested that he would not reappoint the central banker as Fed chair if he wins in November.", "source": {"uri": "thestandard.com.hk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Standard"}, "authors": [],

In 2001, then-Fed Chair Alan Greenspan made an emergency 50 basis-point cut after declining to cut rates at the central bank's December 2000 meeting.\n\nSiegel pointed to the weak jobs report from last week as well as increasing unemployment. He said that the Fed hasn't moved quick enough on slashing interest rates despite the fact that inflation has cooled from its peak in the summer of 2022.\n\n\"How much have we moved the fed funds rate? Zero,\" he said. \"That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.\"\n\nSiegel predicted that the markets will react badly if the Fed doesn't cut interest rates before its September meeting.\n\n\"If they are going to be as slow on the way down as they were on the way up, which by the way was the first policy error in 50 years, then we're not in for a good time with this economy,\" Siegel said, adding: \"Don't think that the Fed knows something. ... Since when has the Fed known anything about the economy?\"\n\n\"The market knows so much better than the Fed. They've got to respond.\"\n\nOther analysts, however, weren't so sure that the Fed needed to step in.\n\n\"The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.\n\n\"Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn't really seem like an emergency.\"\n\n\"The Fed could respond by stopping\" the shrinking of its holdings of Treasurys and other bonds, which could put less upward pressure on longer-term yields, he said.\n\n\"That could at least by a symbolic action that they're not blind to what's going on.\"\n\nJohn Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management in Charlotte, noted that \"there is growing sentiment...the Fed has waited too long to cut interest rates and is now behind the curve.\"\n\n\"While we're not completely sold on the new narrative, the one thing that seems certain is that there is more volatility ahead,\" Lynch said.\n\nAnother analyst, Jamie Cox, thinks the stock market selloff is much ado about nothing.\n\n\"Sell-offs that manifest themselves through wild swings in the currency markets are sharp and swift, but usually very short lived,\" said Cox, managing partner for Richmond, Va.-based Harris Financial Group.\n\n\"Some say this is overdue, I say use this downturn to pick up some deals.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession following Friday's jobs report.

It's a question rattling throughout financial markets following July's weak jobs report and the subsequent global sell-off in equities.\n\nAfter its meeting last week, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates at 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent. July's jobs report was released shortly after the meeting, showing slower growth than expected and an uptick in the unemployment rate to 4.3 percent. That's the highest unemployment rate since October 2021, though it's still a historically low figure. What followed was a global frenzy in the stock markets. As of Monday, Japan's Nikkei dropped more than 12 percent, while U.S. stock markets fell by more than 2.5 percent.\n\nMany financial experts and investors anticipate the Fed will cut interest rates in its September meeting. However, with that meeting seven weeks away, some economists are now speculating that the Fed could announce an emergency rate cut before then due to growing recession fears. Bankrate's Second-Quarter Economic Indicator Survey found there's a 32 percent chance the economy will be in a recession by this time next year.\n\nEmergency rate cuts are rare and typically occur during extreme emergencies. In the last two decades, the Fed approved emergency rate cuts only seven times: three in 2001 after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and during the tech stock bubble burst; two during the Great Recession; and two during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHere's what the experts are saying about the potential for an eighth emergency rate cut.\n\nWill the Fed make an emergency rate cut? Economists and financial experts have mixed reactions\n\nWith recession fears on the rise, many economists and financial experts are divided on whether the Fed will implement an emergency rate cut before its next meeting in September.\n\nFor most of the past two years, the Fed has hiked interest rates to control the pace of inflation that has bedeviled consumers since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those rate hikes have driven inflation downward, from 9.1 percent in June 2022 to 3 percent in June 2024. The central bank is now wrestling with the question of when to reverse course. If it keeps rates elevated for too long, it could push the economy into recession.\n\nGreg McBride, CFA and Bankrate's chief financial analyst, says a weaker-than-expected jobs report and a stock market sell-off aren't enough to justify the Fed cutting rates between meetings.\n\n\"It will take more than 114,000 new jobs and a normal, and overdue, market correction to do it,\" McBride says.\n\nMark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, says the U.S. economy is \"not even close to the sort of crisis developments that would motivate the Fed to cut rates between meetings.\"\n\nIn order for the Fed to make a move like that, Hamrick says that markets would need to seize up to the point where businesses and consumers would have extremely limited access to cash and borrowing money, similar to what was seen early in the COVID-19 pandemic and during the 2007-2008 financial crisis.\n\n\"It can be argued that the current level of their benchmark rate is overly restrictive and needs to come down,\" Hamrick says. \"That's why expectations are high that a September rate cut is likely.\"\n\nHowever, two prominent economists say that stock market turmoil could be enough reason for an emergency Fed rate cut. Paul Krugman, a Nobel laureate in economics and a New York Times Opinion columnist, wrote on X that he wasn't anticipating an inter-meeting rate cut from the Fed because it would incite more panic, but with the already-high level of panic among investors, he says there may be a \"real case for an emergency cut soon.\"\n\n\"So, even though I've been arguing for rate cuts -- 50 in September for sure -- I wasn't calling for an inter-meeting cut, because that might signal panic,\" Krugman wrote on X. \"But since we may be seeing a panic anyway, that argument loses its force.\"\n\nJeremy Siegel, an economist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, voiced concerns over the Fed's recent decision to keep interest rates steady and called for a 75-basis-point emergency cut in the Fed funds rate during an interview with CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" Siegel also predicts another 75-basis-point cut at the Fed's September meeting.\n\n\"We've gone 90 percent toward the target on the inflation rate,\" he said in the interview. \"We've overshot the target on unemployment [4.2 percent]. Those are the two targets explicitly mentioned by the Federal Reserve. How much have we moved the Fed funds rate? Zero.\"\n\nSarah Hunt, chief market strategist at Alpine Saxon Woods, said in a Bloomberg TV interview that if the Fed did an emergency rate cut, it could alarm consumers that the economy is in worse shape than expected.\n\n\"The concern of the Fed doing an emergency cut or stepping in too hard is now going to worry people even further, in a way that isn't necessarily going to be helpful,\" Hunt said in the interview. \"These markets need to stabilize.\"\n\nIn a CNBC \"Squawk Box\" interview, Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee wouldn't say whether the central bank would make an emergency rate cut, but he did acknowledge that the Fed has been in a \"restrictive posture\" regarding its monetary policy. He emphasized that the Fed will step in if the economy starts to deteriorate.\n\n\"You only want to be that restrictive if there's fear of overheating. The data to me does not look like overheating,\" Goolsbee said in the interview. \"It's the markets' job to react, and the Fed's job to act.\"\n\n3 reasons why there likely won't be an emergency rate cut by the Fed\n\nA few economists and financial experts anticipate an emergency Fed rate cut, but many don't.

turmoil continues", "body": "Washington, United States -- The ongoing global stock sell-off has fueled calls for the US Federal Reserve to lower interest rates swiftly and decisively, with some analysts now calling for it to make an emergency cut before its September rate decision.\n\nThe futures markets, which as recently as last week expected a single quarter percentage-point cut at the US central bank's next rate decision in September, now see a half-point cut as much more likely, according to data from CME Group.\n\nREAD: Ugly day for global stocks across Wall Street, Europe, Nikkei\n\n\"The rate tide has quickly turned,\" Bank of America economists wrote in a recent note to clients, adding they now see a September rate cut as \"a virtual lock.\"\n\nThe US central bank has held its benchmark lending rate at a two-decade high for the past year as it battles to return inflation to its long-term target of two percent.\n\nAfter a small uptick earlier this year, annual headline inflation is now falling once more toward the target, while the US economy is still growing and the labor market has weakened.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled last week that the first rate cut could come \"as soon as\" September.\n\nBut some analysts fear that may not be soon enough, as the markets have responded in dramatic fashion to last week's below-target US jobs report, which raised fears that the US was entering a recession.\n\nREAD: Asian, Philippine shares plunge\n\n\"I'm calling for a 75-basis point emergency cut in the Fed funds rate, with another 75-basis point cut indicated for next month at the September meeting,\" Wharton School professor emeritus of finance Jeremy Siegel told CNBC on Monday morning. \"And that's minimum.\"\n\n\"I wasn't calling for an inter-meeting cut, because that might signal panic,\" the Nobel prize-winning US economist Paul Krugman wrote in a social media post on Monday.\n\n\"But since we may be seeing a panic anyway, that argument loses its force,\" he said, adding: \"Real case for an emergency cut soon.\"\n\n'Not looking' like recession\n\nAll three major indices on Wall Streets extended recent losses on Monday as investors continued selling AI-related tech stocks and locking in recent gains.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.6 percent, while the broad-based S&P 500 fell three percent, and the tech-rich Nasdaq closed down more than 3.4 percent.\n\nUnderscoring the market's concerns, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) -- commonly known as Wall Street's \"fear gauge\" -- spiked in early trading, briefly hitting a high not seen since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nBut speaking to CNBC before markets opened, Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee urged caution about reading too much into one jobs report.\n\n\"As you see jobs numbers come in weaker than expected but not looking yet like recession, I do think you want to be forward-looking of where the economy is headed,\" he said.\n\n\"The payroll jobs number is plus or minus 100,000 a month, so be a little careful over-concluding about things in the margin of error,\" he continued, adding that if the US economy deteriorated, the Fed would \"fix it.\"\n\n- 'Infer too much' -\n\nWhile some economists are now calling for emergency rate cuts, others have continued to voice support for a September move.\n\n\"It is usually a mistake to infer too much from one jobs report absent a major shock that abruptly changes the picture,\" Goldman Sachs economists David Mericle and Manuel Abecasis wrote in an investor note published Sunday, while raising their forecast for a recession to 25 percent, up 10 percentage-points.\n\n\"We changed our Fed forecast after the employment report to include an initial string of three consecutive 25bp (basis point) rate cuts in September, November, and December,\" they said, adding an additional quarter-point cut into their forecast for this year.\n\nWhether it moves now or in a September, any Fed cut before the US presidential election in November will thrust the independent US central bank into the middle of the political campaign between former Republican president Donald Trump and Democratic vice president Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump has previously accused Powell -- whom he first nominated to run the Fed -- of displaying political favoritism toward the Democratic Party, and suggested that he would not reappoint the central banker as Fed chair if he wins in November.", "source": {"uri": "business.inquirer.net",

turmoil continues", "body": "\"The rate tide has quickly turned,\" Bank of America economists wrote in a recent note to clients\n\nThe ongoing global stock sell-off has fueled calls for the US Federal Reserve to lower interest rates swiftly and decisively, with some analysts now calling for it to make an emergency cut before its September rate decision.\n\nThe futures markets, which as recently as last week expected a single quarter percentage-point cut at the US central bank's next rate decision in September, now see a half-point cut as much more likely, according to data from CME Group.\n\n\"The rate tide has quickly turned,\" Bank of America economists wrote in a recent note to clients, adding they now see a September rate cut as \"a virtual lock.\"\n\nThe US central bank has held its benchmark lending rate at a two-decade high for the past year as it battles to return inflation to its long-term target of two percent.\n\nAfter a small uptick earlier this year, annual headline inflation is now falling once more toward the target, while the US economy is still growing and the labor market has weakened.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled last week that the first rate cut could come \"as soon as\" September.\n\nBut some analysts fear that may not be soon enough, as the markets have responded in dramatic fashion to last week's below-target US jobs report, which raised fears that the US was entering a recession.\n\n\"I'm calling for a 75-basis point emergency cut in the Fed funds rate, with another 75-basis point cut indicated for next month at the September meeting,\" Wharton School professor emeritus of finance Jeremy Siegel told CNBC on Monday morning. \"And that's minimum.\"\n\n\"I wasn't calling for an inter-meeting cut, because that might signal panic,\" the Nobel prize-winning US economist Paul Krugman wrote in a social media post on Monday.\n\n\"But since we may be seeing a panic anyway, that argument loses its force,\" he said, adding: \"Real case for an emergency cut soon.\"\n\n- 'Not looking' like recession -\n\nAll three major indices on Wall Streets extended recent losses on Monday as investors continued selling AI-related tech stocks and locking in recent gains.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.6 percent, while the broad-based S&P 500 fell three percent, and the tech-rich Nasdaq closed down more than 3.4 percent.\n\nUnderscoring the market's concerns, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) -- commonly known as Wall Street's \"fear gauge\" -- spiked in early trading, briefly hitting a high not seen since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nBut speaking to CNBC before markets opened, Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee urged caution about reading too much into one jobs report.\n\n\"As you see jobs numbers come in weaker than expected but not looking yet like recession, I do think you want to be forward-looking of where the economy is headed,\" he said.\n\n\"The payroll jobs number is plus or minus 100,000 a month, so be a little careful over-concluding about things in the margin of error,\" he continued, adding that if the US economy deteriorated, the Fed would \"fix it.\"\n\n- 'Infer too much' -\n\nWhile some economists are now calling for emergency rate cuts, others have continued to voice support for a September move.\n\n\"It is usually a mistake to infer too much from one jobs report absent a major shock that abruptly changes the picture,\" Goldman Sachs economists David Mericle and Manuel Abecasis wrote in an investor note published Sunday, while raising their forecast for a recession to 25 percent, up 10 percentage-points.\n\n\"The Fed probably will place little weight on the drop in stock prices, as the main indexes still are higher than at the start of the year,\" economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note to clients.\n\nWhether it moves now or in a September, any Fed cut before the US presidential election in November will thrust the independent US central bank into the middle of the political campaign between former Republican president Donald Trump and Democratic vice president Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump has previously accused Powell -- whom he first nominated to run the Fed -- of displaying political favoritism toward the Democratic Party, and suggested that he would not reappoint the central banker as Fed chair if he wins in November.", "source": {"uri": "zawya.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zawya.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(Charly Triballeau/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nFear has set in on Wall Street, and stocks are having another miserable day.\n\nThe Dow tumbled more than 1,000 points at the open, and the broader market plunged 3 percent Monday. The Nasdaq, full of risky tech stocks, dropped 3.7 percent.\n\nAll of that comes amid a global market selloff. Japan's Nikkei 225 index nosedived 12 percent -- its worst rout in history. All major Asian and European markets fell substantially Monday.\n\nThree fears are emerging all at the same time to send markets into a tailspin Monday: Growing worries about a recession, concern that the Federal Reserve has failed to act promptly enough and a belief that big bets on AI may not pay off.\n\nThe most prominent is fear that the U.S. economy is in much worse shape than previously believed -- evidenced by Friday's unexpected jump in the unemployment rate.\n\nOn Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. economy added just 114,000 jobs in July -- far fewer than expected -- and the unemployment rate jumped to 4.3 percent. Although that's not in and of itself an unhealthy unemployment rate, its sudden jump higher is alarming: Last year, the unemployment rate was at its lowest level since the moon landing.\n\nTo be clear: The U.S. economy remains strong. Last quarter, it grew way more than expected, boosted by still-robust consumer spending, which makes up more than two-thirds of all gross domestic product.\n\nBut recession fears are mounting. Goldman Sachs economists Monday raised the odds of a recession to one in four in the next 12 months. That's still a \"limited\" case, because the economic data looks strong overall and the Fed has plenty of room to reduce rates from a 23-year high.\n\nBut Goldman's recession chances are still 10 percentage points higher than they were before Friday's jobs report, which it called \"more concerning now.\"\n\nThe stock market had hit record after record this year, buoyed by falling inflation and the growing sense that the Fed would shift from its series of aggressive rate hikes and start to rate cuts, which can boost corporate profits.\n\nBut the Fed didn't cut rates as many had hoped last week. The market increasingly views the Fed's patience as a mistake.\n\nThe Fed is notoriously horrible at timing its rate cuts and hikes. It was way behind the curve on inflation and had to catch up with multiple historic rate hikes in 2022 to tame runaway prices. Likewise, some economists believe the Fed should have started cutting rates sooner.\n\nRate cuts could help support the job market by cutting borrowing costs for businesses and freeing up money for companies to spend on hiring. But policy decisions take time to work their way into the economy. As inflation has cooled dramatically in recent months and the unemployment rate has risen, some fear the Fed may be too late to act before slow hiring turns into rampant layoffs.\n\nThe Fed's next meetings are scheduled for September, November, and December, Analysts at Citigroup and JPMorgan predict the Fed will slash rates by half a point at its next two meetings. But that may be too late. It may be forced to make an emergency rate cut before then -- an extraordinary intervention the market increasingly views as likely, according to CME's FedWatch tool.\n\nAn emergency cut -- which hasn't happened since the early days of Covid, is exactly what the Fed needs to do, said famed Wharton professor emeritus of finance Jeremy Siegel on CNBC Monday morning.\n\n\"It's so far behind the curve right now. I mean the Fed is up in the bleachers,\" said Siegel. \"You take a look at the data; it's not at all comforting.\"\n\nStocks had also been flying high over the past two years because of big bets on tech companies involved in artificial intelligence: Many hoped that AI would create another global industrial revolution.\n\nBut AI profits are basically nonexistent, and the unproven technology isn't yet ready for prime time. Some fear it'll never get there. Traders are beginning to unwind big trades on Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and other tech stocks that had been surging since the beginning of last year.\n\nWarren Buffett -- CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and a notoriously calm force when markets go haywire -- is also ditching tech. He just sold half of Berkshire's Apple stake, which is a troubling sign for the health of the tech sector.\n\nBecause those companies are each worth close to $1 trillion or more and make up an enormous chunk of the overall value of the S&P 500, when investors sell off tech stocks, that has a massive detrimental effect on the broader market.\n\nInvestors are running for the hills. They're selling off oil, crypto, and especially tech stocks. Instead, they're pouring into safe havens like bonds, sending Treasury yields lower.\n\nThat could spell trouble for some folks' retirement accounts. But people who are close to retirement could actually benefit if they have a heavy mix of bonds, which are benefiting from the flight to safety.\n\nLower rates, if the Fed follows suit with cuts, could help lower punishingly high mortgage rates, car loan rates and other consumer loan costs. It could mean, however, that people with money stored in savings accounts could yield less interest in the coming months.\n\nOne thing not to do: panic. This is not a market crash. Not yet, anyway. Investors are nervous, but not panicked. Monday's rout, if it ends at current levels, wouldn't even crack the top 100 worst days in market history.\n\nThe only question now: How long will this fear last before investors sense a buying opportunity?", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki",

You can opt-out at any time by visiting our Preferences page or by clicking \"unsubscribe\" at the bottom of the email.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is to blame for the historic stock market plunge since last week, according to a growing chorus of market experts.\n\nThe S&P 500 dropped as much as 7% since the Federal Reserve left rates unchanged at the current range of 5.25%-5.50% at its policy meeting last week.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 was down as much as 10% over the same time period.\n\nWharton professor Jeremy Siegel told CNBC on Monday that the Fed is way behind the curve, arguing that they should implement 150 basis points over the next two months.\n\n\"I'm calling for a 75 basis point emergency cut in the Fed funds rate, with another 75 basis point cut indicated for next month at the September meeting, and that's minimum,\" Siegel said.\n\nSiegel believes the Federal funds rate should be 3.50%-4%.\n\nSiegel has long criticized Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for acting too late in raising interest rates during the inflation boom in 2021 and 2022, and now he thinks Powell is making exact mistake by waiting too long to cut interest rates.\n\n\"Since when has the Fed known anything about the economy?\" Siegel asked. \"Look at what happened three years ago. The market knows so much better than the Fed, so they've got to respond.\"\n\nSiegel added: \"If they are going to be as slow on the way down as they were on the way up, which by the way was the first policy error in 50 years, then we're not in for a good time with this economy.\"\n\nWhen asked if any of the stock market decline was driven by the rising chances of Kamala Harris winning the November Presidential election, Siegel reiterated that the issue was firmly with the Fed rather than the coming presidential election or geopolitical tensions, as some commentators have suggested.\n\n\"I don't think the race, I don't think Iran or Japan is the source of this slowdown. I think it's in Washington DC at the Federal Reserve building, that's the source,\" Siegel said.\n\nJPMorgan strategist Mislav Matejka said in a Monday note that the lack of Fed rate cuts in the first half of the year will weigh on economic growth in the second half, and that any coming interest rate cuts from the Fed likely won't be enough.\n\n\"The Fed will start easing, but more in a reactive way and as a response to weakening growth, i.e. it is likely behind the curve -- this might not be enough to drive a rebound,\" Matejka said.\n\nYet, while the Fed may be \"behind the curve,\" that could be by design.\n\nThat's because Powell wants to convince the market that even in the face of a potential recession, he is still determined to tame inflation, just like former Fed chairman Paul Volcker did in the 1980s.\n\n\"Powell has had it much easier than Volcker so far, but he still needs to deliver the same message. That is happening right now. Seeming to be behind the curve also helps Powell and the FOMC push back against the idea that its eventual rate cuts will be politically motivated,\" DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas said in a Monday note.\n\nRegardless of what the Fed's motivation might be with waiting until September to cut interest rates, the market is taking away a pretty clear message.\n\n\"There is growing sentiment is that the Fed has waited too long to cut interest rates and is now behind the curve,\" Comerica Wealth Management CIO John Lynch said.", "source": {"uri": "markets.businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Markets Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_fox@markets.businessinsider.com", "name": "Matthew Fox", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Siegel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Siegel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Volcker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Volcker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Industrial_Organizations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congress of Industrial Organizations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66b0ebc6a5247369a3e9794f?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

The Nasdaq, full of risky tech stocks, dropped 3.7%.\n\nAll of that comes amid a global market selloff. Japan's Nikkei 225 index nosedived 12% -- its worst rout in history. All major Asian and European markets fell substantially Monday.\n\nThree fears are emerging all at the same time to send markets into a tailspin Monday: Growing worries about a recession, concern that the Federal Reserve has failed to act promptly enough and a belief that big bets on AI may not pay off.\n\nOn Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the US economy added just 114,000 jobs in July -- far fewer than expected -- and the unemployment rate jumped to 4.3%. Although that's not in and of itself an unhealthy unemployment rate, its sudden march higher is alarming: Last year, the unemployment rate was at its lowest level since the moon landing.\n\nTo be clear: The US economy remains strong. Last quarter, it grew way more than expected, boosted by still-robust consumer spending, which makes up more than two-thirds of all gross domestic product.\n\nBut recession fears are mounting. Goldman Sachs economists Monday raised the odds of a recession to one in four in the next 12 months. That's still a \"limited\" case, because the economic data looks strong overall and the Fed has plenty of room to reduce rates from a 23-year high.\n\nBut Goldman's recession chances are still 10 percentage points higher than they were before Friday's jobs report, which it called \"more concerning now.\"\n\nThe stock market had hit record after record this year, buoyed by falling inflation and the growing sense that the Fed would shift from its series of aggressive rate hikes and start to rate cuts, which can boost corporate profits.\n\nBut the Fed didn't cut rates as many had hoped last week. The market increasingly views the Fed's patience as a mistake.\n\nThe Fed is notoriously horrible at timing its rate cuts and hikes. It was way behind the curve on inflation and had to catch up with multiple historic rate hikes in 2022 to tame runaway prices. Likewise, some economists believe the Fed should have started cutting rates sooner.\n\nRate cuts could help support the job market by cutting borrowing costs for businesses and freeing up money for companies to spend on hiring. But policy decisions take time to work their way into the economy. As inflation has cooled dramatically in recent months and the unemployment rate has risen, some fear the Fed may be too late to act before slow hiring turns into rampant layoffs.\n\nThe Fed's next meetings are scheduled for September, November and December, Analysts at Citigroup and JPMorgan predict the Fed will slash rates by half a point at its next two meetings. But that may be too late. It may be forced to make an emergency rate cut before then -- an extraordinary intervention the market increasingly views as likely, according to CME's FedWatch tool.\n\nAn emergency cut -- which hasn't happened since the early days of Covid, is exactly what the Fed needs to do, said famed Wharton professor emeritus of finance Jeremy Siegel on CNBC Monday morning.\n\n\"It's so far behind the curve right now. I mean the Fed is up in the bleachers,\" said Siegel. \"You take a look at the data; it's not at all comforting.\"\n\nStocks had also been flying high over the past two years because of big bets on tech companies involved in artificial intelligence: Many hoped that AI would create another global industrial revolution.\n\nBut AI profits are basically nonexistent, and the unproven technology isn't yet ready for prime time. Some fear it'll never get there. Traders are beginning to unwind big trades on Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet and other tech stocks that had been surging since the beginning of last year.\n\nWarren Buffett -- CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and a notoriously calm force when markets go haywire -- is also ditching tech. He just sold half of Berkshire's Apple stake, which is a troubling sign for the health of the tech sector.\n\nBecause those companies are each worth close to $1 trillion or more and make up an enormous chunk of the overall value of the S&P 500, when investors sell off tech stocks, that has a massive detrimental effect on the broader market.\n\nInvestors are running for the hills. They're selling off oil, crypto and especially tech stocks. Instead, they're pouring into safe havens like bonds, sending Treasury yields lower.\n\nThat could spell trouble for some folks' retirement accounts. But people who are close to retirement could actually benefit if they have a heavy mix of bonds, which are benefiting from the flight to safety.\n\nLower rates, if the Fed follows suit with cuts, could help lower punishingly high mortgage rates, car loan rates and other consumer loan costs. It could mean, however, that people with money stored in savings accounts could yield less interest in the coming months.\n\nOne thing not to do: panic. This is not a market crash. Not yet, anyway. Investors are nervous, but not panicked. Monday's rout, if it ends at current levels, wouldn't even crack the top 100 worst days in market history.\n\nThe only question now: How long will this fear last before investors sense a buying opportunity?\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Both forces together have wreaked havoc on stocks and crypto, with Bitcoin plummeting under $50,000 on Monday for the first time since February.\n\nFor many, the weekend's crash has been reminiscent of March 2020, when a mass market selloff occurred amid worries surrounding the coronavirus pandemic. In the aftermath, central banks worldwide stepped in to provide liquidity and lower interest rates, helping stocks and crypto quickly rebound to all-time highs.\n\nAccording to Siegel, also a senior economist at WisdomTree Investments, it's already high time for another cycle of Federal Reserve rate cuts.\n\n\"The Fed has said that the long-run fed funds rate -- when inflation reached 2% and unemployment has come up to 4.2% -- should be 2.8%,\" Siegel explained. Last week, July unemployment clocked in at 4.3%, while CPI inflation reached 2.97% in June, which is 90% progress from where the Fed started.\n\n\"How much have we moved the Fed funds rate? Zero,\" said Siegel. \"That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.\"\n\nInaction, he adds, could be disastrous.\n\n\"If they're going to be as slow on the way down as they were on the way up -- which, by the way, was the worst policy error in 50 years -- then we're not in for a good time with this economy,\" he said.\n\nThough most expect the Fed to begin cutting rates soon, Coinshares' head of research James Butterfill thinks a 1.5% cut by September is a bit over the top. He believes a 50 basis point cut in September is still the most likely course.\n\n\"The Fed [is] likely to be cautious in being overly reactive despite one of their implicit mandates being a stable market,\" Butterfill told Decrypt. \"If the markets were to deteriorate significantly further, it may prompt an August rate cut, but so far unlikely.\"\n\nPer CME Fedwatch, the market is now pricing in 83% odds of a 50 basis point cut in September.\n\nCoinshares is among several analysts who believe lower interest rates will be bullish for fixed-supply assets like Bitcoin. While generally good for stocks, AJ Bell Investment Director Russ Mould says the effect of an approaching recession could still mean bad news for equities.\n\n\"Those with long memories will remember how frantic rate cuts in 2000-02 and 2007-08 failed to stave off a bear market in stocks,\" he wrote in an analyst note Monday. \"Because the economy tipped over and corporate earnings fell far faster than the headline cost of money.\"", "source": {"uri": "decrypt.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Decrypt"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_throuvalas@decrypt.co", "name": "Andrew Throuvalas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wharton_School", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wharton School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/us-federal-reserve-bank-gID_7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 1141, "textEnd": 1151}], "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Investors are increasingly hopeful that will push Federal Reserve officials to come to their rescue with an emergency rate cut.\n\nThat almost certainly won't happen.\n\n\"There's nothing in the Fed's mandate that's about making sure the stock market is comfortable,\" Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said in a New York Times interview on Monday.\n\nIn hindsight, there's a strong case to be made for why the central bank should have cut its benchmark lending rate at its meeting last week, which concluded before the jobs report came out. Had officials known the unemployment rate was going to jump from 4.1% in June to 4.3% in July, almost a full percentage point higher than where it was at the start of this year, perhaps they would've been more convinced the US economy is weakening enough that the benefits of a cut outweigh the risks.\n\nBut calling an unscheduled meeting now to lower rates ahead of the central bank's next scheduled meeting that's more than six weeks away would be counterproductive, fueling more panic.\n\nEmergency cuts are rare\n\nThe Fed's rate-setting committee meets eight times a year to vote on where officials believe interest rates should be to promote maximum employment and stable prices.\n\nBut if something comes up in between those meetings that changes their views on the ideal level for rates, officials can gather for an unscheduled \"emergency\" meeting. The last time they did so was at the onset of the pandemic when they voted to lower rates by a half point on March 3. Then, less than two weeks after that, they met again to lower rates by a full point to near-zero levels.\n\nAt that point, the writing was on the wall: Things were getting ugly quickly. By doing two large emergency cuts in succession, Fed officials didn't have to weigh whether their actions would unnecessarily cause Americans to panic.\n\nBefore those cuts, the last time the Fed was promoted to do an emergency rate cut was in the thick of the Great Recession shortly after Lehman Brothers collapsed in the fall of 2008.\n\nOptics matter\n\nThe last thing the Fed wants is for people to believe the US economy is on the cusp of a potential recession. Those beliefs can quickly materialize, whether or not they are valid.\n\n\"As a general proposition, I do not like inter-meeting cuts. I think they signal more panic than they do stability,\" Charles Plosser, then president of the Philadelphia Fed said at the central bank's emergency meeting held October 7, 2008. But he said he was \"reluctantly\" comfortable with an emergency cut since other central banks were doing it.\n\nThat's not the case currently.\n\nCentral banks that have cut interest rates recently, including the Bank of Canada, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, have done so at prescheduled meetings.\n\nSo if the Fed were to move forward with an emergency cut, people would inevitably wonder: What does the central bank representing the largest economy in the world know that everyone else doesn't?\n\nThat's exactly what then San Francisco Fed President Janet Yellen expressed at an unscheduled meeting the Fed held on January 9, 2008.\n\n\"I am concerned that it might be taken as a sign of panic by the Committee and somehow wrongly indicate that we have inside information showing that things are even worse than markets already think,\" Yellen, who is now Treasury Secretary, said according to a Fed transcript of the meeting.\n\nShe also was worried an emergency cut could \"be seen as an overreaction to the employment report,\" referring to December 2007's jobs report that came out five days before the Fed met. The report showed the nation's unemployment rate jumped by 0.3% to 5%. (Ultimately, officials waited until another unscheduled meeting weeks later to lower rates.)\n\nWould an immediate cut even help?\n\nAt the October 2008 meeting, Plosser cautioned that cutting rates immediately wouldn't \"make the next couple of months in terms of the overall economy any less painful.\"\n\nThat's the case today, too.\n\nTo a certain extent, it won't matter in the immediate term what size cut Fed officials settle on and the timing of it because it can take roughly a year for any interest rate moves to be felt throughout the economy.\n\nAnd already, US Treasury yields are sliding a lot in anticipation of rate cuts. Since they serve as a bellwether for the interest rates Americans pay on a range of loans, the dip may help ease the financial burden facing borrowers currently.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austan_Goolsbee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austan Goolsbee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lehman Brothers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Full employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Plosser", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles Plosser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_San_Francisco", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Yellen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Janet Yellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insider_trading", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insider trading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_cnn_business_articles_764/4d5148327da3cf261f094bc5896a9cd0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-03", "textStart": 1813, "textEnd": 1820}, {"amb": false, "date": "2008-10-07", "textStart": 2762, "textEnd": 2777}, {"amb": false, "date": "2008-01-09", "textStart": 3409, "textEnd": 3424}, {"amb": false, "date": "2007-12-", "textStart": 3830, "textEnd": 3843}, {"amb": false, "date": "2008-10-", "textStart": 4109, "textEnd": 4121}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Some have called for emergency interest rate cuts this week as a result. The Federal Reserve has only cut rates off-cycle in extreme emergencies, like 9/11 and COVID-19.\n\nThe US stock market is plummeting. Investors are panicking, and they're calling for the nation's central bank to cut interest rates over a month before the Fed's next meeting.\n\nDoing so would align today's economy with that of a pandemic and major terrorist events.\n\nOn Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released July's jobs report, which found that the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, the highest reading in nearly three years. Job growth fell well short of expectations and sent stocks plunging -- with many pointing their fingers at the Federal Reserve for waiting too long to cut interest rates after holding steady at its meeting last week.\n\nThe fallout from the jobs report has continued over the past few days. The US stock market tanked on Monday, with the Nasdaq and Dow Jones indices plunging. Japan's main stock market index was down 12.4% on Monday in response to both the US jobs report and Japan's latest interest-rate hike.\n\nThe global panic has prompted some economists to call for the Federal Reserve to implement an emergency interest rate cut this week; Bloomberg reported that traders were predicting a 60% chance of a rate cut within the next week. The Federal Open Market Committee is not expected to meet again until September 18, during which it's expected to cut interest rates after holding them steady for nearly a year.\n\nWharton professor Jeremy Siegel told CNBC on Monday that the Fed should make an emergency 75 basis-point cut this week and that there should be \"another 75 basis point cut indicated for next month at the September meeting -- and that's minimum.\"\n\n\"How much have we moved the fed funds rate? Zero,\" Siegel said. \"That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.\"\n\nThe Fed has not given any indication as to whether it will cut interest rates this week, but it's only done an emergency cut in extreme situations in the past -- and it doesn't look like the US economy is quite there yet. However, with concerns that the Fed is no longer able to achieve its soft landing and avoid a recession, calls for relief will likely grow.\n\nThe history of emergency rate cuts\n\nEmergency interest rate cuts are extremely rare, and the Fed has done so sparingly in the past. There were a series of off-cycle interest rate cuts in 2001 following the dot-com bust and later the September 11 terrorist attack, both of which crashed the stock market.\n\n\"In the past, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has responded to weaker economic conditions, which are often associated with downward pressure on the price level, with a lower federal funds target,\" the St. Louis Fed said of the 9/11 attacks in a January 2002 note. \"The present case has been no exception; the FOMC reduced the federal funds rate target four times in the three months following the attacks.\"\n\nLater in 2008, the Fed implemented emergency rate cuts following the housing market crash, and most recently cut rates off-cycle in March 2020 in response to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nStill, among calls to cut rates this week, some experts are urging against an overreaction. Jim Smigiel, chief investment officer and financial services company SEI, said in a statement that \"emergency Fed rate cuts being priced in makes little sense given the economic backdrop in the U.S. and would only serve to destroy policy maker credibility.\"\n\nIf the Fed doesn't cut rates this week, there will likely be increased pressure on the central bank in September to cut rates more aggressively. Powell said during a press conference last week that any decision will be made solely based on data, and he \"can imagine a scenario in which there would be everywhere from zero cuts to several cuts, depending on the way the economy evolves.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ayelet_sheffey@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Ayelet Sheffey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Siegel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Siegel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_level", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price level"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_investment_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief investment officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_St._Louis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/66b0e025393cd3c8629b476f.jpg?ver=1722873765", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 1523, "textEnd": 1535}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-11", "textStart": 2585, "textEnd": 2597}, {"amb": false, "date": "2002-01-", "textStart": 2911, "textEnd": 2923}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 3206, "textEnd": 3216}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The market knows so much better than the Fed, so they've got to respond.\"\n\nSiegel added: \"If they are going to be as slow on the way down as they were on the way up, which by the way was the first policy error in 50 years, then we're not in for a good time with this economy.\"\n\nWhen asked if any of the stock market decline was driven by the rising chances of Kamala Harris winning the November Presidential election, Siegel reiterated that the issue was firmly with the Fed rather than the coming presidential election or geopolitical tensions, as some commentators have suggested.\n\n\"I don't think the race, I don't think Iran or Japan is the source of this slowdown. I think it's in Washington DC at the Federal Reserve building, that's the source,\" Siegel said.\n\nJPMorgan strategist Mislav Matejka said in a Monday note that the lack of Fed rate cuts in the first half of the year will weigh on economic growth in the second half, and that any coming interest rate cuts from the Fed likely won't be enough.\n\n\"The Fed will start easing, but more in a reactive way and as a response to weakening growth, i.e. it is likely behind the curve -- this might not be enough to drive a rebound,\" Matejka said.\n\nYet, while the Fed may be \"behind the curve,\" that could be by design.\n\nThat's because Powell wants to convince the market that even in the face of a potential recession, he is still determined to tame inflation, just like former Fed chairman Paul Volcker did in the 1980s.\n\n\"Powell has had it much easier than Volcker so far, but he still needs to deliver the same message.

The unemployment rate also rose, inching up from 4.1% in June to 4.3%.\n\nSome traders and finance experts are now predicting or calling for an emergency rate cut in response to the market's volatility and the weak jobs report. Low interest rates can help spur the economy since it becomes cheaper to borrow money.\n\nBut Marketplace spoke to economists who say an emergency rate cut would be a bad idea. As we always say here: The stock market is not the economy.\n\n\"The Federal Reserve's mandate is to think about the economy and not necessarily what's happening in financial markets,\" said Tyler Schipper, an associate professor of economics at University of St. Thomas. \"When the stock market has a really bad day, that doesn't necessarily change the Federal Reserve's decision making.\"\n\nThe Fed had a chance to cut rates at its regularly scheduled meeting last week, but opted not to because it wants to be more certain that inflation is moving toward the Fed's 2% inflation target. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said there could be a rate cut this September.\n\nEconomic data has not changed substantially since the Fed made that decision, Schipper said.\n\nIf the Fed had that jobs report data, that possibly strengthens the case that they should have cut rates at its meeting, Schipper said. But Schipper said he doesn't think that's a strong enough reason to cut rates between meetings.\n\n\"I think markets might be slightly overreacting to that data without the bigger context. And the bigger context is, yes, the labor market has been slowing. But in 2024, we still, on average, have been creating more jobs than we were pre-pandemic in 2019,\" Schipper said.\n\nWe've become accustomed to economists underestimating jobs numbers, but they overestimated them this time, which \"freaked out\" the markets, Schipper said.\n\nPeople also shouldn't forget that there have been enormous stock market returns over the past couple of years, said Tarek Hassan, an economics professor at Boston University. He views the day's losses as more of a correction.\n\nWhat is a bit worrying is that the Cboe Volatility Index, or the VIX, is a bit high, Hassan said. The index, also known as the \"fear gauge,\" measures market expectations of volatility and it rose to its highest level since 2020.\n\n\"But it's not off the charts,\" he said.\n\nHassan also said he thinks the Fed should make a rate cut soon and that the central bank should send more signals there will be one. But he doesn't think they need to rush it.\n\nThe Fed rarely issues emergency rate cuts, last doing so back in March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic began. The only other emergency rate cuts that the Fed has issued this century happened in response to the 2007-08 financial crisis, the dot-com bubble bust and the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\n\"The case for making emergency rate cuts is typically to address real structural problems with the economy,\" Schipper said.\n\nDuring the Great Recession, the Federal Reserve and other central banks coordinated emergency rate cuts to help the global economy amid the housing crisis, Schipper said.\n\n\"That seems to be a very different case than the market dropping in response to below-expected job market numbers,\" Schipper said.\n\nData has been wonky during the pandemic, and Schipper said our typical recession indicators haven't been reliable lately. For example, the yield curve has been inverted for a while now. An inverted yield curve means that the interest paid by 10-year Treasury bonds is lower than shorter-term debt. Typically, that's the sign of an impending recession, but we have yet to enter one.\n\nIf the Fed did an emergency rate cut, that could then give credence to the idea that the Fed is seeing signs of a crisis that we weren't aware of, Schipper added.\n\n\"The Federal Reserve needs to be an institution that is calm and competent,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "marketplace.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marketplace"}, "authors": [{"uri": "janet_nguyen@marketplace.org", "name": "Janet Nguyen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000s_United_States_housing_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2000s United States housing bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_yield_curve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inverted yield curve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007\u20132008_financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2007\u20132008 financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "VIX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.marketplace.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/dowjones.jpg?fit=2800%2C1867&w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 2871, "textEnd": 2881}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

At a press conference that day, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said while he and other officials were carefully watching the labor market for signs of weakness, they wanted to see more evidence that inflation was cooling before cutting rates.\n\nBut on August 2, the monthly jobs report came in much weaker than expected, sparking fears that the U.S. economy may be fraying under the weight of high borrowing costs and that the Fed has waited too long to cut rates. A few other weak economic reports have added fuel to those worries about the economy, igniting a three-day rout that's caused the S&P 500 to shed 6% of its value since July 31.\n\nGiven the dim economic data, some analysts and investors said they believe the Fed should undertake an emergency cut before their next rate decision, scheduled for September 18.\n\n\"Some analysts are even suggesting an intra-meeting emergency cut is warranted,\" noted Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, in an email.\n\nWhat are the odds of a Fed emergency rate cut?\n\nTraders are signaling a roughly 60% likelihood of an emergency 0.25 percentage point cut within one week, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nBut some experts said they believe the odds are much lower, with Pantheon Macroeconomics noting that overnight index swap rates implied that investors on Monday saw a roughly 30% chance the Fed could make an emergency cut in the next week.\n\nChicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee on Monday told CNBC that if there's more deterioration in economic conditions, \"we're going to fix it.\" But he added that even though the jobs numbers were weaker than expected, he doesn't believe the U.S. is in a recession.\n\nWhat is the history of Fed emergency rate cuts?\n\nThe Fed has cut rates at nine emergency meetings in the last 30 years, which means an intra-meeting cut before September \"would not be unprecedented,\" Pantheon noted.\n\nThe last emergency rate cut was in March 2020, when the economy was free-falling due to the coronavirus pandemic, which shuttered businesses across the globe.\n\n\"Intra-meeting cuts have typically only happened in the event of financial crisis,\" Shah noted.\n\nThat was echoed by Pantheon, which noted that \"economic and market conditions usually have been worse than now to trigger an emergency Fed meeting.\"\n\nDo economists see an emergency rate cut as likely?\n\nWhile the markets are pricing in the chance of a rate cut, many economists believe the Fed is likely to wait until its September meeting to start easing borrowing costs, partly as the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average remain in positive territory despite the three-day rout.\n\n\"We think [Powell] will opt to wait until September, provided markets stabilize,\" Pantheon's economists wrote in a research note. \"The Fed probably will place little weight on the drop in stock prices, as the main indexes still are higher than at the start of the year.\"\n\nAnd cutting rates in an emergency meeting might undermine confidence in the economy, Amanda Agati, chief investment officer of PNC's asset management group, told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\n\"From our perspective, this isn't the environment when you want to hastily throw a rate cut out there,\" Agati said. An emergency cut could do \"more damage than it helps because then the everyone will say, 'What does the Fed know that we don't?'\"\n\nHarry and Meghan on the dangers of online harm\n\nThe \"Olympics of hula\"\n\nThe journey of rapper-turned-country singer Jelly Roll", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aimee_picchi@aol.com", "name": "Aimee Picchi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austan_Goolsbee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austan Goolsbee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_MoneyWatch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS MoneyWatch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_investment_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief investment officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asset management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/AebODORiPX3JFFoAOw9azA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_cbs_news_articles_189/46c2c238579b4839bef1a901444d6092", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 346, "textEnd": 353, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 705, "textEnd": 713}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 1260, "textEnd": 1272}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 2396, "textEnd": 2406}], "sentiment": -0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The Fed said Wednesday that it would like to see more progress toward its goal of 2% before cutting interest rates, but the data has experts calling that decision into question.\n\nDid the Fed miss its chance?\n\nInterest rates are the central banking system's core tool to combat inflation. Higher interest rates can cool an overheated economy by making it more expensive to borrow money. When it's more expensive to borrow money, people spend less. As a result, employers eventually hire less -- or even cut their workforce.\n\nA Fed rate cut, on the other hand, can help stimulate the economy by making it easier for people to borrow money and, in turn, ward off a recession.\n\nSince hiking rates 11 times since March 2022, headline inflation has cooled substantially, falling from its 9.1% peak in June 2022 to 3% in June 2024. But now it appears that the war on inflation is taking a toll on the labor market.\n\nBaig is far from alone in thinking the Fed is behind the curve. Before the July jobs report, it was an open debate about whether the Fed had waited too long to cut rates. Following the report, analysts and economists across the spectrum were in agreement: The Fed should have acted last week.\n\nIn a note, Elyse Ausenbaugh, head of investment strategy at J.P. Morgan, said the Fed had been \"slightly more hawkish than expected,\" adding that \"the market reaction to the latest jobs data reflects concerns that the Fed has quickly fallen behind the curve.\"\n\nAs of Monday morning, markets were down across the board. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 2.7%, Nasdaq fell 3.6%, and the S&P 500 was down 3.1%.\n\n\"Slowing job growth makes clear that the Fed has waited too long to cut interest rates,\" a note from analysts at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute stated.\n\nWhat the Fed knew that we didn't\n\nWhile the July jobs report surprised many economic experts, it may have not been a surprise for the Fed itself. The central bank's latest meeting happened to fall two days before the release of the Labor Department's monthly jobs report, which is not often the case.\n\nBefore the public release of each jobs report, the Federal Reserve gets preliminary employment data and estimations of hours worked from the Labor Department two days in advance, the department confirmed to Money. It receives a full report at noon the day before the release.\n\nThat means, due to a scheduling quirk, the Fed's board of governors had a glimpse of at least some jobs numbers before announcing its decision to hold rates steady Wednesday afternoon.\n\nStill, that doesn't come as much consolation to Baig with Morning Consult. She says it's possible that the Fed is being more hawkish than anticipated because of the pressure to not repeat past mistakes.\n\nShe's referring to the '70s and '80s when the U.S. last dealt with soaring inflation. The Fed raised interest rates and then quickly lowered them at the first signs price increases were easing. Then, inflation came back with a vengeance, spiking to a peak of 13.5%.\n\n\"I think that's really weighing on them, maybe even more than I suspected,\" Baig says.\n\nWill there be an emergency Fed rate cut?\n\nThe Fed had signaled its plan to slash rates in September even before the no-good jobs report Friday.\n\nAt a news conference announcing the Fed's decision, Chair Jerome Powell said that an interest rate cut is coming \"as soon as the next meeting\" if inflation continues cooling. The central bankers next meet in about six weeks, Sept. 17-18.\n\nAnalysts were nearly unanimous in expecting a rate cut in September. The jobs report all but confirms it. Now, markets are pricing in a deeper rate cut. According to CME FedWatch, a tool that gauges the likelihood of a rate cut, investors overwhelmingly expect a 0.5 percentage-point rate cut, as opposed to the standard 0.25-point cut.\n\nSome, however, are pushing for cuts before the September meeting, citing sliding stock prices.\n\n\"It would be beyond negligent for the Federal Reserve not to announce an emergency interest rate cut in response to the global rout in stock markets,\" Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, said in a statement urging the Fed to make a 0.25-point cut immediately.\n\nEmergency rate cuts are possible, though uncommon. The last time the Fed made such a move was at the beginning of the pandemic, lowering borrowing costs by a half a percentage point.\n\nHowever, Baig doesn't see that happening right now, arguing that an emergency cut may actually be harmful due to the optics.\n\n\"A lot of what the Fed does is based on vibes,\" she says. \"Them getting together and meeting last minute could instill panic that's not necessary.\"\n\nGold Prices Surge to a New Record High as Stocks Struggle\n\nOlympians Can't Pay Their Bills.

The Nasdaq, full of risky tech stocks, dropped 3.7%.\n\nAll of that comes amid a global market selloff. Japan's Nikkei 225 index nosedived 12% -- its worst rout in history. All major Asian and European markets fell substantially Monday.\n\nThree fears are emerging all at the same time to send markets into a tailspin Monday: Growing worries about a recession, concern that the Federal Reserve has failed to act promptly enough and a belief that big bets on AI may not pay off.\n\nRecession fears\n\nThe most prominent is fear that the US economy is in much worse shape than previously believed -- evidenced by Friday's unexpected jump in the unemployment rate.\n\nOn Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the US economy added just 114,000 jobs in July -- far fewer than expected -- and the unemployment rate jumped to 4.3%. Although that's not in and of itself an unhealthy unemployment rate, its sudden march higher is alarming: Last year, the unemployment rate was at its lowest level since the moon landing.\n\nTo be clear: The US economy remains strong. Last quarter, it grew way more than expected, boosted by still-robust consumer spending, which makes up more than two-thirds of all gross domestic product.\n\nBut recession fears are mounting. Goldman Sachs economists Monday raised the odds of a recession to one in four in the next 12 months. That's still a \"limited\" case, because the economic data looks strong overall and the Fed has plenty of room to reduce rates from a 23-year high.\n\nBut Goldman's recession chances are still 10 percentage points higher than they were before Friday's jobs report, which it called \"more concerning now.\"\n\nFed concerns\n\nThe stock market had hit record after record this year, buoyed by falling inflation and the growing sense that the Fed would shift from its series of aggressive rate hikes and start to rate cuts, which can boost corporate profits.\n\nBut the Fed didn't cut rates as many had hoped last week. The market increasingly views the Fed's patience as a mistake.\n\nThe Fed is notoriously horrible at timing its rate cuts and hikes. It was way behind the curve on inflation and had to catch up with multiple historic rate hikes in 2022 to tame runaway prices. Likewise, some economists believe the Fed should have started cutting rates sooner.\n\nRate cuts could help support the job market by cutting borrowing costs for businesses and freeing up money for companies to spend on hiring. But policy decisions take time to work their way into the economy. As inflation has cooled dramatically in recent months and the unemployment rate has risen, some fear the Fed may be too late to act before slow hiring turns into rampant layoffs.\n\nThe Fed's next meetings are scheduled for September, November and December, Analysts at Citigroup and JPMorgan predict the Fed will slash rates by half a point at its next two meetings. But that may be too late. It may be forced to make an emergency rate cut before then -- an extraordinary intervention the market increasingly views as likely, according to CME's FedWatch tool.\n\nAn emergency cut -- which hasn't happened since the early days of Covid, is exactly what the Fed needs to do, said famed Wharton professor emeritus of finance Jeremy Siegel on CNBC Monday morning.\n\n\"It's so far behind the curve right now. I mean the Fed is up in the bleachers,\" said Siegel. \"You take a look at the data; it's not at all comforting.\"\n\nAI worries\n\nStocks had also been flying high over the past two years because of big bets on tech companies involved in artificial intelligence: Many hoped that AI would create another global industrial revolution.\n\nBut AI profits are basically nonexistent, and the unproven technology isn't yet ready for prime time. Some fear it'll never get there. Traders are beginning to unwind big trades on Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet and other tech stocks that had been surging since the beginning of last year.\n\nWarren Buffett -- CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and a notoriously calm force when markets go haywire -- is also ditching tech. He just sold half of Berkshire's Apple stake, which is a troubling sign for the health of the tech sector.\n\nBecause those companies are each worth close to $1 trillion or more and make up an enormous chunk of the overall value of the S&P 500, when investors sell off tech stocks, that has a massive detrimental effect on the broader market.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nInvestors are running for the hills. They're selling off oil, crypto and especially tech stocks. Instead, they're pouring into safe havens like bonds, sending Treasury yields lower.\n\nThat could spell trouble for some folks' retirement accounts. But people who are close to retirement could actually benefit if they have a heavy mix of bonds, which are benefiting from the flight to safety.\n\nLower rates, if the Fed follows suit with cuts, could help lower punishingly high mortgage rates, car loan rates and other consumer loan costs. It could mean, however, that people with money stored in savings accounts could yield less interest in the coming months.\n\nOne thing not to do: panic. This is not a market crash. Not yet, anyway. Investors are nervous, but not panicked. Monday's rout, if it ends at current levels, wouldn't even crack the top 100 worst days in market history.\n\nThe only question now: How long will this fear last before investors sense a buying opportunity?\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

"Fed under pressure to cut rates as market turmoil continues", "body": "The ongoing global stock sell-off has fueled calls for the US Federal Reserve to lower interest rates swiftly and decisively, with some analysts now calling for it to make an emergency cut before its September rate decision.\n\nThe futures markets, which as recently as last week expected a single quarter percentage-point cut at the US central bank's next rate decision in September, now see a half-point cut as much more likely, according to data from CME Group.\n\n\"The rate tide has quickly turned,\" Bank of America economists wrote in a recent note to clients, adding they now see a September rate cut as \"a virtual lock.\"\n\nThe US central bank has held its benchmark lending rate at a two-decade high for the past year as it battles to return inflation to its long-term target of two percent.\n\nAfter a small uptick earlier this year, annual headline inflation is now falling once more toward the target, while the US economy is still growing and the labor market has weakened.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled last week that the first rate cut could come \"as soon as\" September.\n\nBut some analysts fear that may not be soon enough, as the markets have responded in dramatic fashion to last week's below-target US jobs report, which raised fears that the US was entering a recession.\n\n\"I'm calling for a 75-basis point emergency cut in the Fed funds rate, with another 75-basis point cut indicated for next month at the September meeting,\" Wharton School professor emeritus of finance Jeremy Siegel told CNBC on Monday morning. \"And that's minimum.\"\n\n\"I wasn't calling for an inter-meeting cut, because that might signal panic,\" the Nobel prize-winning US economist Paul Krugman wrote in a social media post on Monday.\n\n\"But since we may be seeing a panic anyway, that argument loses its force,\" he said, adding: \"Real case for an emergency cut soon.\"\n\n- 'Not looking' like recession -\n\nAll three major indices on Wall Streets fell again on Monday as investors continued selling AI-related tech stocks and locking in recent gains.\n\nUnderscoring the market's concerns, the CBOE Volatility Index-- commonly known as Wall Street's \"fear gauge\" -- spiked in early trading to a high not seen since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nBut speaking to CNBC before markets opened, Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee urged caution about reading too much into one jobs report.\n\n\"As you see jobs numbers come in weaker than expected but not looking yet like recession, I do think you want to be forward-looking of where the economy is headed,\" he said.\n\n\"The payroll jobs number is plus or minus 100,000 a month, so be a little careful over concluding about things in the margin of error,\" he continued, adding that if the US economy deteriorated, the Fed would \"fix it.\"\n\n- 'Infer too much' -\n\nWhile some analysts are now calling for emergency rate cuts, others have continued to voice support for a September move.\n\n\"It is usually a mistake to infer too much from one jobs report absent a major shock that abruptly changes the picture,\" Goldman Sachs economists David Mericle and Manuel Abecasis wrote in an investor note published Sunday, while raising their forecast for a recession to 25 percent, up 0.1 percentage-point.\n\n\"We changed our Fed forecast after the employment report to include an initial string of three consecutive 25bp (basis point) rate cuts in September, November, and December,\" they said, adding an additional quarter-point cut into their forecast for this year.\n\nWhether it moves now or in a September, any Fed cut before the US

Many experts believe that this will not happen again, as it would signal that the US economy is in bad shape, potentially leading to even more panic in the market.\n\nIn January, Prechter warned that too much optimism in the market was dangerous. He said Monday that optimism is now \"entrenched\" and that the world is seeing \"the most overgrown market ever.\"\n\nRobert Prechter, pictured, believes the Fed will make an unprecedented emergency rate cut to address market turbulence\n\nAfter Friday's jobs report, which showed unemployment rose to its highest level since October 2021 in July, global markets spiraled downward on fears the U.S. economy is sputtering.\n\nMonday's continued decline was led by Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index, the world's third-largest, which fell 12 percent this morning, the biggest one-day drop in nearly four decades.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 3 percent for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones fell 1,033 points, or 2.6 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.4 percent.\n\nBloomberg estimates that $6.4 trillion has been wiped off the value of global stock markets in the past three weeks.\n\nAccording to Prechter, much of this could have been avoided if the Fed had decided to cut rates at last week's meeting.\n\n\"The Federal Reserve had a great opportunity last Wednesday to cut the Fed Funds Rate by a quarter point, and they didn't take it,\" he said. \"I think that was a big mistake.\"\n\nUS job growth fell far short of expectations in July and the unemployment rate rose to its highest level in nearly three years\n\nUS Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell left benchmark borrowing costs unchanged at their highest level in 23 years at his latest meeting.\n\nGoldman Sachs economists estimate the chance of the US falling into a recession within a year at 15 percent to 25 percent. JPMorgan analysts estimate the chance at 50 percent.\n\nThe Fed has been raising rates since March 2022 to curb inflation, but a top economist believes the agency is suffering from tunnel vision.\n\nMohamed El-Erian, Allianz's chief economic advisor, blamed the Fed for the current market situation, saying the rate hikes are hitting the economy hard.\n\n\"I really worry that we could lose American economic exceptionalism because of a policy mistake,\" he said. Bloomberg TV.\n\nEven if the Fed waits until September to cut rates, most analysts in the industry believe a rate cut is indeed coming.\n\nAnalysts at JP Morgan wrote in a memo that \"because it appears the Fed is significantly behind, we expect a 50% rate\" [basis point] at the September meeting the number was reduced, followed by another 50 [basis point] 'cut in November.'\n\nInvestors are now also convinced that other major central banks will follow the Fed's lead and cut rates even more aggressively.

Fox 11 Tri Cities Fox 41 Yakima", "body": "The ongoing global stock sell-off has fueled calls for the US Federal Reserve to lower interest rates swiftly and decisively, with some analysts now calling for it to make an emergency cut before its September rate decision.\n\nThe futures markets, which as recently as last week expected a single quarter percentage-point cut at the US central bank's next rate decision in September, now see a half-point cut as much more likely, according to data from CME Group.\n\n\"The rate tide has quickly turned,\" Bank of America economists wrote in a recent note to clients, adding they now see a September rate cut as \"a virtual lock.\"\n\nThe US central bank has held its benchmark lending rate at a two-decade high for the past year as it battles to return inflation to its long-term target of two percent.\n\nAfter a small uptick earlier this year, annual headline inflation is now falling once more toward the target, while the US economy is still growing and the labor market has weakened.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled last week that the first rate cut could come \"as soon as\" September.\n\nBut some analysts fear that may not be soon enough, as the markets have responded in dramatic fashion to last week's below-target US jobs report, which raised fears that the US was entering a recession.\n\n\"I'm calling for a 75-basis point emergency cut in the Fed funds rate, with another 75-basis point cut indicated for next month at the September meeting,\" Wharton School professor emeritus of finance Jeremy Siegel told CNBC on Monday morning. \"And that's minimum.\"\n\n\"I wasn't calling for an inter-meeting cut, because that might signal panic,\" the Nobel prize-winning US economist Paul Krugman wrote in a social media post on Monday.\n\n\"But since we may be seeing a panic anyway, that argument loses its force,\" he said, adding: \"Real case for an emergency cut soon.\"\n\n- 'Not looking' like recession -\n\nAll three major indices on Wall Streets fell again on Monday as investors continued selling AI-related tech stocks and locking in recent gains.\n\nUnderscoring the market's concerns, the CBOE Volatility Index- commonly known as Wall Street's \"fear gauge\" -- spiked in early trading to a high not seen since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nBut speaking to CNBC before markets opened, Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee urged caution about reading too much into one jobs report.\n\n\"As you see jobs numbers come in weaker than expected but not looking yet like recession, I do think you want to be forward-looking of where the economy is headed,\" he said.\n\n\"The payroll jobs number is plus or minus 100,000 a month, so be a little careful over concluding about things in the margin of error,\" he continued, adding that if the US economy deteriorated, the Fed would \"fix it.\"\n\n- 'Infer too much' -\n\nWhile some analysts are now calling for emergency rate cuts, others have continued to voice support for a September move.\n\n\"It is usually a mistake to infer too much from one jobs report absent a major shock that abruptly changes the picture,\" Goldman Sachs economists David Mericle and Manuel Abecasis wrote in an investor note published Sunday, while raising their forecast for a recession to 25 percent, up 0.1 percentage-point.\n\n\"We changed our Fed forecast after the employment report to include an initial string of three consecutive 25bp (basis point) rate cuts in September, November, and December,\" they said, adding an additional quarter-point cut into their forecast for this year.\n\nWhether it moves now or in a September, any Fed cut before the US presidential election in November will thrust the independent US central bank into the middle of the political campaign between former Republican president Donald Trump and Democratic vice president Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump has previously accused Powell -- whom he first nominated to run the Fed -- of displaying political favoritism toward the Democratic Party, and suggested that he would not reappoint the central banker as Fed chair if he wins in November.\n\nda/dw\n\nFOX41 Yakima\u00a9FOX11 TriCities\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox41yakima.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 11 41 Tri Cities Yakima"}, "authors": [{"uri":

That was triggered by Friday's data.\n\nCommentators also said a stronger yen had led investors to unwind their \"carry trades\", in which they borrowed in the cheap Japanese currency to invest in higher-yielding assets, such as equities.\n\nWhile Wall Street's three main indexes suffered another day of pain -- with the Nasdaq down more than three percent -- a forecast-beating read on the key US services sector provided some solace.\n\nTokyo's Nikkei, which tanked more than 12 percent Monday and suffered a record points loss, jumped 10.2 percent.\n\nToyota was up more than 12 percent, Sony piled on more than nine percent and chip giant Tokyo Electron added 16.6 percent.\n\n\"This is a sweeping, across-the-board gain,\" said analysts at Nomura, adding that investors would also pay close attention to the forex market.\n\nJapan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said at a scheduled news conference Tuesday: \"The stock market has been moving again today, and I think it is important to judge this situation calmly.\"\n\n\"We will continue to monitor the situation with a sense of urgency and to carry out economic and fiscal management in close cooperation with the Bank of Japan.\"\n\nShanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Taipei, Mumbai and Bangkok also rose but Hong Kong gave up early gains to finish in the red.\n\nSingapore and Wellington also suffered more selling, while Manila was flat.\n\nLondon edged up after shedding around two percent Monday, while Paris and Frankfurt were also higher.\n\n- Yen in retreat -\n\nFriday's data sparked calls for the Fed to cut rates now. Nobel prize-winning US economist Paul Krugman wrote on social media: \"I wasn't calling for an inter-meeting cut, because that might signal panic.\n\n\"But since we may be seeing a panic anyway, that argument loses its force.\n\nReal case for an emergency cut soon.\"\n\nBut Chicago Fed boss Austan Goolsbee urged caution about reading too much into one jobs report.\n\n\"As you see jobs numbers come in weaker than expected but not looking yet like recession, I do think you want to be forward-looking of where the economy is headed,\" he told CNBC ahead of the US trading day Monday.\n\n\"The payroll jobs number is plus or minus 100,000 a month, so be a little careful over-concluding about things in the margin of error,\" he said, adding that if the US economy deteriorated, the Fed would \"fix it\".\n\nPantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note to clients that the Fed \"probably will place little weight on the drop in stock prices, as the main indexes still are higher than at the start of the year\".\n\nFed chief Jerome Powell said after the bank's policy meeting last week that a cut could come as soon as September.\n\nBets had been for at least one 25-basis-point reduction before January but talk is now about a possible 100-basis-points-worth of cuts.\n\nThe yen's rally ran out of puff and was sitting just below 145 per dollar, having hit a six-month high below 142 Monday.\n\nThe Japanese unit has surged over the past month -- after hitting a nearly four-decade low in early July -- after the Bank of Japan hiked rates hours before Powell indicated the Fed was planning a cut.\n\nMoody's Analytics analysts wrote: \"Asia's equity selloff will cause sleepless nights at the Bank of Japan. For the past two years, the central bank had been playing it safe, wary of repeating the mistake of tightening policy right into a downturn.\n\n\"The last significant rate hikes by the BoJ were in 2006, just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and in 2000, just as the dot.com bubble burst. Both times, the BoJ was forced to reverse course.\n\n\"The BoJ can hardly be blamed for this latest market selloff, so another U-turn is not a foregone conclusion.

At a press conference that day, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said while he and other officials were carefully watching the labor market for signs of weakness, they wanted to see more evidence that inflation was cooling before cutting rates.\n\nBut on August 2, the monthly jobs report came in much weaker than expected, sparking fears that the U.S. economy may be fraying under the weight of high borrowing costs and that the Fed has waited too long to cut rates. A few other weak economic reports have added fuel to those worries about the economy, igniting a three-day rout that's caused the S&P 500 to shed 6% of its value since July 31.\n\nGiven the dim economic data, some analysts and investors said they believe the Fed should undertake an emergency cut before their next rate decision, scheduled for September 18.\n\n\"Some analysts are even suggesting an intra-meeting emergency cut is warranted,\" noted Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, in an email.\n\nTraders are signaling a roughly 60% likelihood of an emergency 0.25 percentage point cut within one week, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nBut some experts said they believe the odds are much lower, with Pantheon Macroeconomics noting that overnight index swap rates implied that investors on Monday saw a roughly 30% chance the Fed could make an emergency cut in the next week.\n\nChicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee on Monday told CNBC that if there's more deterioration in economic conditions, \"we're going to fix it.\" But he added that even though the jobs numbers were weaker than expected, he doesn't believe the U.S. is in a recession.\n\nThe Fed has cut rates at nine emergency meetings in the last 30 years, which means an intra-meeting cut before September \"would not be unprecedented,\" Pantheon noted.\n\nThe last emergency rate cut was in March 2020, when the economy was free-falling due to the coronavirus pandemic, which shuttered businesses across the globe.\n\n\"Intra-meeting cuts have typically only happened in the event of financial crisis,\" Shah noted.\n\nThat was echoed by Pantheon, which noted that \"economic and market conditions usually have been worse than now to trigger an emergency Fed meeting.\"\n\nWhile the markets are pricing in the chance of a rate cut, many economists believe the Fed is likely to wait until its September meeting to start easing borrowing costs, partly as the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average remain in positive territory despite the three-day rout.\n\n\"We think [Powell] will opt to wait until September, provided markets stabilize,\" Pantheon's economists wrote in a research note. \"The Fed probably will place little weight on the drop in stock prices, as the main indexes still are higher than at the start of the year.\"\n\nAnd cutting rates in an emergency meeting might undermine confidence in the economy, Amanda Agati, chief investment officer of PNC's asset management group, told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\n\"From our perspective, this isn't the environment when you want to hastily throw a rate cut out there,\" Agati said. An emergency cut could do \"more damage than it helps because then the everyone will say, 'What does the Fed know that we don't?'\"\n\nAimee Picchi\n\nAimee Picchi is the associate managing editor for CBS MoneyWatch, where she covers business and personal finance.

Siegel argued that the rate should be \"somewhere between 3.5% and 4%,\" noting that inflation is nearly at the central bank's arbitrary 2% inflation target while the unemployment rate is rising.\n\n\"How much have we moved the fed funds rate? Zero,\" said Siegel. \"That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.\"\n\nEconomist Paul Krugman also urged the Fed to act with an emergency rate cut, rejecting the counterargument that doing so could suggest policymakers are panicking.\n\n\"Even though I've been arguing for rate cuts -- 50 [basis points] in September for sure -- I wasn't calling for an inter-meeting cut, because that might signal panic,\" Krugman wrote on social media. \"But since we may be seeing a panic anyway, that argument loses its force. Real case for an emergency cut soon.\"\n\nMonday's sell-off wiped $1 trillion off the market values of leading U.S. tech companies shortly after trading began, and Wall Street's \"fear index\" jumped to its highest level since 2020.\n\n\"Is this 1987 all over again?\" asked a headline in The Wall Street Journal, referring to the infamous stock market crash known as \"Black Monday.\" Reutersproclaimed that global markets were giving off \"'Black Monday' vibes.\" The Financial Timesnoted that \"Tokyo's Topix fell 12.2%, the sharpest sell-off since 'Black Monday' in October 1987 and more than erasing its gains for the year.\"\n\n\"The biggest concern here is they put us in a recessionary environment, and it's too late to course-correct.\"\n\nU.S. lawmakers, economists, and progressive advocacy groups have been urging the chair of the world's most powerful central bank to cut interest rates for months, warning that keeping borrowing costs elevated for an extended period could do profound harm to workers as well as the broader U.S. and global economy. Higher rates have already taken a significant toll on lower-income Americans, in part due to rising interest payments and sky-high housing costs.\n\n\"Chair Powell, enough brinkmanship,\" the Groundwork Collaborative, a vocal advocate of rate cuts, wrote on social media Monday. \"It's time to follow the data demanding rate cuts. It's time to put the American people first. It's time to cut interest rates now.\"\n\nDuring its meeting last week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) -- the Fed's policy-setting committee -- opted to keep rates at a two-decade high for the 12th consecutive month, sparking allegations that Powell is succumbing to political pressure from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and GOP lawmakers.\n\nPowell said a rate cut is \"on the table\" for the September FOMC meeting but did not make any explicit commitments.\n\nTwo days after the Fed decided to keep the current federal funds rate in place -- which came even as other nations' central banks moved to lower interest rates -- the U.S. Labor Department released data showing that the country added far fewer jobs than expected in July and that the unemployment rate rose to its highest level in roughly three years.\n\nThe data amplified concerns that the Fed has waited too long to reduce borrowing costs.\n\n\"I worry that they are behind the eight ball here,\" Groundwork executive director Lindsay Owens said last week. \"And with every passing FOMC meeting where they don't move to correct for being behind the eight ball, the risks accumulate and compound.\"\n\n\"The biggest concern here is they put us in a recessionary environment, and it's too late to course-correct,\" Owens added. \"Much better to course-correct early than late, in my opinion.\"", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common Dreams"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krugman", "type": "person",

That was triggered by Friday's data.\n\nWhile Wall Street's three main indexes suffered another day of pain -- with the Nasdaq down more than three percent -- a forecast-beating read on the key US services sector provided a little solace for investors.\n\nTokyo's Nikkei, which tanked more than 12 percent Monday and suffered a record points loss, jumped around 10.5 percent in the morning before paring some of those gains.\n\nToyota was up more than 10 percent, Sony piled on more than seven percent, while chip giant Tokyo Electron added 12.26 percent.\n\n\"This is a sweeping, across-the-board gain,\" said analysts at Nomura, adding that investors will also pay close attention to the forex market.\n\nNomura expects the Nikkei to end with the biggest-ever gain, beating 2,676.55 points in October 1990.\n\n\"If movements continue as they started, the Nikkei ended yesterday with the biggest loss and will end today by renewing the biggest point gain,\" it said.\n\nHong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Taipei and Manila also rose but Singapore and Wellington suffered more selling.\n\nFriday's data has fanned calls for the Fed to cut rates now to support the economy, with Nobel prize-winning US economist Paul Krugman writing on social media: \"I wasn't calling for an inter-meeting cut, because that might signal panic.\n\n\"But since we may be seeing a panic anyway, that argument loses its force. Real case for an emergency cut soon.\"\n\nBut Chicago Fed boss Austan Goolsbee urged caution about reading too much into one jobs report.\n\n\"As you see jobs numbers come in weaker than expected but not looking yet like recession, I do think you want to be forward-looking of where the economy is headed,\" he told CNBC ahead of the US trading day Monday.\n\n\"The payroll jobs number is plus or minus 100,000 a month, so be a little careful over-concluding about things in the margin of error,\" he said, adding that if the US economy deteriorated, the Fed would \"fix it\".\n\nPantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note to clients that the Fed \"probably will place little weight on the drop in stock prices, as the main indexes still are higher than at the start of the year\".\n\nFed chief Jerome Powell said after the bank's policy meeting last week that a cut could come as soon as September.\n\nWhile bets had been for a 25-basis-point reduction -- with at least one more before January -- they have risen sharply and investors are now eyeing at least 100-basis-points-worth of cuts by the end of the year.\n\nOn currency markets, the yen's rally ran out of puff and was sitting just below 145 per dollar, having hit a six-month high around 142 Monday.\n\nThe Japanese unit has surged over the past month -- having hit a nearly four-decade low at the start of July -- after the Bank of Japan hiked interest rates on the same day Powell indicated the Fed was planning to loosen policy.\n\nBut analysts at Moody's Analytics wrote: \"Asia's equity selloff will cause sleepless nights at the Bank of Japan. For the past two years, the central bank had been playing it safe, wary of repeating the mistake of tightening policy right into a downturn.\n\n\"The last significant rate hikes by the BoJ were in 2006, just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and in 2000, just as the dot.com bubble burst. Both times, the BoJ was forced to reverse course.\n\n\"The BoJ can hardly be blamed for this latest market selloff, so another U-turn is not a foregone conclusion.

It's not the Fed's job to make the market 'comfortable' says Fed president", "body": "Analysts holding out for the Fed to rescue the stock market might be waiting in vain, according to a Federal Reserve Bank president who warned investors that it isn't Jerome Powell's job to keep Wall Street happy.\n\n\"We've got to be monitoring the real side of the economy: There's nothing in the Fed's mandate that's about making sure the stock market is comfortable,\" Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told the New York Times. Goolsbee had previously said the Fed was standing by to \"fix\" the economy if it believed it was broken.\n\nStocks have had a rollercoaster 48 hours -- selling off globally on news about rising U.S. unemployment only to regain some ground this morning as investors calmed down.\n\nIn terms of the economy, pressure has been mounting on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to make an emergency, unscheduled interest rate cut ahead of the FOMC's next gathering in September.\n\nThe likes of Wharton's professor Jeremy Siegel have been leading such calls, with the emeritus professor of finance writing in his weekly commentary for WisdomTree: \"The Fed should make an immediate 75 bp inter-meeting cut and follow that up with a 75 bp cut at the September meeting.\"\n\nAmong Professor Siegel's reasonings was a damp jobs report, geopolitical uncertainty and volatility in both the stock and bonds market.\n\nWhile some correction in the market is healthy because this preemptively pops bubbles, Professor Siegel points out, he adds: \"In the short run, if the Fed does not indicate that it will react soon, the outlook is very unsettled.\"\n\nThe stock market has had a turbulent few days, to say the least. Fanned by fears of the U.S. entering a recession, on Monday Japan's Nikkei 225 index started with a plunge abroad reminiscent of 1987 's crash before rebounding 11%.\n\nLikewise, yesterday the S&P 500 dropped 3% -- its worst day in nearly two years -- while the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4% as the once blooming stocks of the Magnificent 7 companies continued to wilt.\n\nWall Street has been hankering after a rate cut since late last year, tired of borrowing costs remaining above average and consumers being continually squeezed as the base rate stayed at a two-decade high.\n\nInstead, brokers want to see cuts, signalling a return to buoyancy in the economy across metrics like jobs, consumer spending, and cheaper borrowing.\n\nYet, prompted by a sub-par labour report on Friday, experts began fearing that the Fed is holding on too tight and may not -- after months of speculation -- pull off a \"soft landing\" and avoid a recession in the U.S.\n\nBy Tuesday a whiplashed Wall Street was licking its wounds and charting a route ahead. Many expecting the fluctuations to continue.\n\nWhat analysts don't want to see is the dominoes of panic continuing to fall. If an emergency Fed rate cut is off the table they are leaning heavily into the expectation of a September cut.\n\n\"Incoming data have raised concerns that the US economy has hit an air pocket. Financial markets are now pricing in more than 100bp in rate cuts by year-end and significant probability of a 50bp cut in September,\" Bank of America's U.S. economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note seen by Fortune.\n\n\"Markets even began discussing whether the Fed needs to deliver intermeeting cuts. A rate cut in September is now a virtual lock, but we do not think the economy needs aggressive, recession-sized cuts.\"\n\nMark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS said much the same: \"We think volatility is likely to remain high in the near term, and that the Fed is likely to cut interest rates more quickly. But we believe recession fears are overdone.\"\n\nWhile Powell and his peers have made it clear the Fed will not be pressured by presidential hopefuls, bank analysts, or the market, the Fed does have a dual mandate: Not only is it tasked with ensuring pricing stability by fighting inflation, but it must also support high levels of employment.\n\nAnd this, President Goolsbee said this week, would be a legitimate reason for the Fed to consider cutting.\n\n\"The Fed's job is very straightforward: maximize employment, stabilize prices and maintain financial stability. That's what we're going to do,\" he told CNBC's 'Squawk Box' Monday, \"We're forward-looking about it. So if the conditions collectively start coming in like that on the through line, there's deterioration on any of those parts, we're going to fix it.\"\n\nAsked specifically about how markets are responding to cut speculation -- President Goolsbee added: \"It's the market's job to react and it's the Fed's job to act. One of those moves with a lot more volatility than the other.\"", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eleanor_pringle@fortune.com", "name": "Eleanor Pringle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Siegel", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Siegel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austan_Goolsbee", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Austan Goolsbee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emeritus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emeritus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikkei 225"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2160703327.jpg?resize=1200,600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

The Nasdaq, full of risky tech stocks, dropped 3.7%.\n\nAll of that comes amid a global market selloff. Japan's Nikkei 225 index nosedived 12% -- its worst rout in history. All major Asian and European markets fell substantially Monday.\n\nThree fears are emerging all at the same time to send markets into a tailspin Monday: Growing worries about a recession, concern that the Federal Reserve has failed to act promptly enough and a belief that big bets on AI may not pay off.\n\nOn Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the US economy added just 114,000 jobs in July -- far fewer than expected -- and the unemployment rate jumped to 4.3%. Although that's not in and of itself an unhealthy unemployment rate, its sudden march higher is alarming: Last year, the unemployment rate was at its lowest level since the moon landing.\n\nTo be clear: The US economy remains strong. Last quarter, it grew way more than expected, boosted by still-robust consumer spending, which makes up more than two-thirds of all gross domestic product.\n\nBut recession fears are mounting. Goldman Sachs economists Monday raised the odds of a recession to one in four in the next 12 months. That's still a \"limited\" case, because the economic data looks strong overall and the Fed has plenty of room to reduce rates from a 23-year high.\n\nBut Goldman's recession chances are still 10 percentage points higher than they were before Friday's jobs report, which it called \"more concerning now.\"\n\nFed concerns\n\nThe stock market had hit record after record this year, buoyed by falling inflation and the growing sense that the Fed would shift from its series of aggressive rate hikes and start to rate cuts, which can boost corporate profits.\n\nBut the Fed didn't cut rates as many had hoped last week. The market increasingly views the Fed's patience as a mistake.\n\nThe Fed is notoriously horrible at timing its rate cuts and hikes. It was way behind the curve on inflation and had to catch up with multiple historic rate hikes in 2022 to tame runaway prices. Likewise, some economists believe the Fed should have started cutting rates sooner.\n\nRate cuts could help support the job market by cutting borrowing costs for businesses and freeing up money for companies to spend on hiring. But policy decisions take time to work their way into the economy. As inflation has cooled dramatically in recent months and the unemployment rate has risen, some fear the Fed may be too late to act before slow hiring turns into rampant layoffs.\n\nThe Fed's next meetings are scheduled for September, November and December, Analysts at Citigroup and JPMorgan predict the Fed will slash rates by half a point at its next two meetings. But that may be too late. It may be forced to make an emergency rate cut before then -- an extraordinary intervention the market increasingly views as likely, according to CME's FedWatch tool.\n\nAn emergency cut -- which hasn't happened since the early days of Covid, is exactly what the Fed needs to do, said famed Wharton professor emeritus of finance Jeremy Siegel on CNBC Monday morning.\n\n\"It's so far behind the curve right now. I mean the Fed is up in the bleachers,\" said Siegel. \"You take a look at the data; it's not at all comforting.\"\n\nAI worries\n\nStocks had also been flying high over the past two years because of big bets on tech companies involved in artificial intelligence: Many hoped that AI would create another global industrial revolution.\n\nBut AI profits are basically nonexistent, and the unproven technology isn't yet ready for prime time. Some fear it'll never get there. Traders are beginning to unwind big trades on Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet and other tech stocks that had been surging since the beginning of last year.\n\nWarren Buffett -- CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and a notoriously calm force when markets go haywire -- is also ditching tech. He just sold half of Berkshire's Apple stake, which is a troubling sign for the health of the tech sector.\n\nBecause those companies are each worth close to $1 trillion or more and make up an enormous chunk of the overall value of the S&P 500, when investors sell off tech stocks, that has a massive detrimental effect on the broader market.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nInvestors are running for the hills. They're selling off oil, crypto and especially tech stocks. Instead, they're pouring into safe havens like bonds, sending Treasury yields lower.\n\nThat could spell trouble for some folks' retirement accounts. But people who are close to retirement could actually benefit if they have a heavy mix of bonds, which are benefiting from the flight to safety.\n\nLower rates, if the Fed follows suit with cuts, could help lower punishingly high mortgage rates, car loan rates and other consumer loan costs. It could mean, however, that people with money stored in savings accounts could yield less interest in the coming months.\n\nOne thing not to do: panic. This is not a market crash. Not yet, anyway. Investors are nervous, but not panicked. Monday's rout, if it ends at current levels, wouldn't even crack the top 100 worst days in market history.\n\nThe only question now: How long will this fear last before investors sense a buying opportunity?\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Investors are increasingly hopeful that will push Federal Reserve officials to come to their rescue with an emergency rate cut.\n\nThat almost certainly won't happen.\n\n\"There's nothing in the Fed's mandate that's about making sure the stock market is comfortable,\" Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said in a New York Times interview on Monday.\n\nIn hindsight, there's a strong case to be made for why the central bank should have cut its benchmark lending rate at its meeting last week, which concluded before the jobs report came out. Had officials known the unemployment rate was going to jump from 4.1% in June to 4.3% in July, almost a full percentage point higher than where it was at the start of this year, perhaps they would've been more convinced the US economy is weakening enough that the benefits of a cut outweigh the risks.\n\nBut calling an unscheduled meeting now to lower rates ahead of the central bank's next scheduled meeting that's more than six weeks away would be counterproductive, fueling more panic.\n\nThe Fed's rate-setting committee meets eight times a year to vote on where officials believe interest rates should be to promote maximum employment and stable prices.\n\nBut if something comes up in between those meetings that changes their views on the ideal level for rates, officials can gather for an unscheduled \"emergency\" meeting. The last time they did so was at the onset of the pandemic when they voted to lower rates by a half point on March 3. Then, less than two weeks after that, they met again to lower rates by a full point to near-zero levels.\n\nAt that point, the writing was on the wall: Things were getting ugly quickly. By doing two large emergency cuts in succession, Fed officials didn't have to weigh whether their actions would unnecessarily cause Americans to panic.\n\nBefore those cuts, the last time the Fed was promoted to do an emergency rate cut was in the thick of the Great Recession shortly after Lehman Brothers collapsed in the fall of 2008.\n\nThe last thing the Fed wants is for people to believe the US economy is on the cusp of a potential recession. Those beliefs can quickly materialize, whether or not they are valid.\n\n\"As a general proposition, I do not like inter-meeting cuts. I think they signal more panic than they do stability,\" Charles Plosser, then president of the Philadelphia Fed said at the central bank's emergency meeting held October 7, 2008. But he said he was \"reluctantly\" comfortable with an emergency cut since other central banks were doing it.\n\nSo if the Fed were to move forward with an emergency cut, people would inevitably wonder: What does the central bank representing the largest economy in the world know that everyone else doesn't?\n\nThat's exactly what then San Francisco Fed President Janet Yellen expressed at an unscheduled meeting the Fed held on January 9, 2008.\n\n\"I am concerned that it might be taken as a sign of panic by the Committee and somehow wrongly indicate that we have inside information showing that things are even worse than markets already think,\" Yellen, who is now Treasury Secretary, said according to a Fed transcript of the meeting.\n\nShe also was worried an emergency cut could \"be seen as an overreaction to the employment report,\" referring to December 2007's jobs report that came out five days before the Fed met. The report showed the nation's unemployment rate jumped by 0.3% to 5%. (Ultimately, officials waited until another unscheduled meeting weeks later to lower rates.)\n\nAt the October 2008 meeting, Plosser cautioned that cutting rates immediately wouldn't \"make the next couple of months in terms of the overall economy any less painful.\"\n\nThat's the case today, too.\n\nTo a certain extent, it won't matter in the immediate term what size cut Fed officials settle on and the timing of it because it can take roughly a year for any interest rate moves to be felt throughout the economy.\n\nAnd already, US Treasury yields are sliding a lot in anticipation of rate cuts. Since they serve as a bellwether for the interest rates Americans pay on a range of loans, the dip may help ease the financial burden facing borrowers currently.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The economy added only 114,000 jobs, far below estimates of about 175,000 for the month.\n\n\"Before I knew the jobs numbers, I thought they should cut,\" Sofia Baig, economist at Morning Consult, tells Money. \"Now, after seeing the jobs numbers, I'm certain they should have cut.\"\n\nThe sudden shift in the labor market signals that the overall economy could be on a path toward a recession, though it is far from a guarantee. The Fed said Wednesday that it would like to see more progress toward its goal of 2% before cutting interest rates, but the data has experts calling that decision into question.\n\nInterest rates are the central banking system's core tool to combat inflation. Higher interest rates can cool an overheated economy by making it more expensive to borrow money. When it's more expensive to borrow money, people spend less. As a result, employers eventually hire less -- or even cut their workforce.\n\nA Fed rate cut, on the other hand, can help stimulate the economy by making it easier for people to borrow money and, in turn, ward off a recession.\n\nSince hiking rates 11 times since March 2022, headline inflation has cooled substantially, falling from its 9.1% peak in June 2022 to 3% in June 2024. But now it appears that the war on inflation is taking a toll on the labor market.\n\nBaig is far from alone in thinking the Fed is behind the curve. Before the July jobs report, it was an open debate about whether the Fed had waited too long to cut rates. Following the report, analysts and economists across the spectrum were in agreement: The Fed should have acted last week.\n\nIn a note, Elyse Ausenbaugh, head of investment strategy at J.P. Morgan, said the Fed had been \"slightly more hawkish than expected,\" adding that \"the market reaction to the latest jobs data reflects concerns that the Fed has quickly fallen behind the curve.\"\n\nAs of Monday morning, markets were down across the board. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 2.7%, Nasdaq fell 3.6%, and the S&P 500 was down 3.1%.\n\n\"Slowing job growth makes clear that the Fed has waited too long to cut interest rates,\" a note from analysts at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute stated.\n\nWhile the July jobs report surprised many economic experts, it may have not been a surprise for the Fed itself. The central bank's latest meeting happened to fall two days before the release of the Labor Department's monthly jobs report, which is not often the case.\n\nBefore the public release of each jobs report, the Federal Reserve gets preliminary employment data and estimations of hours worked from the Labor Department two days in advance, the department confirmed to Money. It receives a full report at noon the day before the release.\n\nThat means, due to a scheduling quirk, the Fed's board of governors had a glimpse of at least some jobs numbers before announcing its decision to hold rates steady Wednesday afternoon.\n\nStill, that doesn't come as much consolation to Baig with Morning Consult. She says it's possible that the Fed is being more hawkish than anticipated because of the pressure to not repeat past mistakes.\n\nShe's referring to the '70s and '80s when the U.S. last dealt with soaring inflation. The Fed raised interest rates and then quickly lowered them at the first signs price increases were easing. Then, inflation came back with a vengeance, spiking to a peak of 13.5%.\n\n\"I think that's really weighing on them, maybe even more than I suspected,\" Baig says.\n\nThe Fed had signaled its plan to slash rates in September even before the no-good jobs report Friday.\n\nAt a news conference announcing the Fed's decision, Chair Jerome Powell said that an interest rate cut is coming \"as soon as the next meeting\" if inflation continues cooling. The central bankers next meet in about six weeks, Sept. 17-18.\n\nAnalysts were nearly unanimous in expecting a rate cut in September. The jobs report all but confirms it. Now, markets are pricing in a deeper rate cut. According to CME FedWatch, a tool that gauges the likelihood of a rate cut, investors overwhelmingly expect a 0.5 percentage-point rate cut, as opposed to the standard 0.25-point cut.\n\nSome, however, are pushing for cuts before the September meeting, citing sliding stock prices.\n\n\"It would be beyond negligent for the Federal Reserve not to announce an emergency interest rate cut in response to the global rout in stock markets,\" Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, said in a statement urging the Fed to make a 0.25-point cut immediately.\n\nEmergency rate cuts are possible, though uncommon. The last time the Fed made such a move was at the beginning of the pandemic, lowering borrowing costs by a half a percentage point.\n\nHowever, Baig doesn't see that happening right now, arguing that an emergency cut may actually be harmful due to the optics.\n\n\"A lot of what the Fed does is based on vibes,\" she says. \"Them getting together and meeting last minute could instill panic that's not necessary.\"\n\n5 Best Stock Trading Apps of 2024\n\nGold Prices Surge to a New Record High as Stocks Struggle", "source": {"uri": "money.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Money"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_hawk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War hawk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Consult", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morning Consult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Policy_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic Policy Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Meanwhile, all major Asian and European markets fell significantly yesterday (5/8), with the Athens Stock Exchange unable to \"escape\", \"erasing\" almost all of its 2024 gains.\n\nBut why are investors selling off their shares?\n\nAccording to CNN, three fears are emerging simultaneously: The growing chances of a recession, concern that the Federal Reserve failed to act in time, and the belief that big bets on artificial intelligence may not pay off.\n\nWill there eventually be a recession?\n\nThe more important issue is the fear that the US economy is in much worse shape than previously believed, a view based on Friday's unexpected rise in the unemployment rate.\n\nOn Friday, the Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy added just 114,000 jobs in July - far fewer than analysts had expected - with the unemployment rate rising to 4.3%. While as a number the rate is not large, its sudden rise is alarming, as last year, unemployment was at a decades-low.\n\nNote that the US economy remains strong. Last quarter, it grew much more than expected, boosted by consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of total GDP.\n\nHowever, fears of a recession are growing. Goldman Sachs economists on Monday raised the odds of a recession to 25 percent over the next 12 months. The figure is still not high because the economic data look strong and the Fed has plenty of room to cut interest rates from a 23-year high.\n\nBut it should be noted that before the jobs report, the bank was giving a 15% recession probability.\n\nThe Fed in the crosshairs\n\nThe stock market had set records this year, boosted by falling inflation and a growing sense that the Fed will start cutting rates, which could boost corporate earnings.\n\nBut the Fed didn't cut rates as many had hoped last week, with the market now increasingly seeing the wait-and-see stance as a \"mistake.\"\n\nThe rate cuts could help support the labor market by lowering borrowing costs for businesses and freeing up capital that companies could spend on hiring. But policy decisions take time to be absorbed by the economy. As inflation has fallen dramatically in recent months and the unemployment rate has risen, some fear the Fed may be planning to act when it is too late, with slow hiring having turned into rampant layoffs.\n\nWith the Fed's next meetings scheduled for September, November and December, analysts at Citigroup and JPMorgan predict the Fed will cut rates by half a point at its next two meetings. However, it may be forced to make an emergency rate cut before then, an intervention that the market sees as increasingly likely, according to CME's FedWatch tool.\n\nAn emergency cut, which hasn't happened since the early days of the pandemic, is exactly what the Fed should do, famed Wharton economics professor Jeremy Siegel told CNBC.\n\nA.I. causes concern\n\nStocks have also posted high gains in the past two years due to big bets on tech companies involved in artificial intelligence. Many investors were hoping AI would be behind a global industrial revolution.\n\nWith that scenario looking difficult, investors are starting to sell off, with stocks such as Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet having risen since early last year.\n\nWarren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, sold half the stake the company held in Apple shares, a worrying sign for the health of the tech sector.\n\nBecause these companies have a market capitalization of close to $1 trillion or more and make up a huge chunk of the S&P 500's total value, when investors sell off shares of them, the negative impact on the broader market is enormous.\n\nEnd of the carry trade\n\nA \"bonus\" fear factor appears to be the end of the popular \"carry trade\" between the yen and the dollar. This is a practice in which an investor borrows in a currency with low interest rates, such as the yen, and reinvests the proceeds in a currency with a higher rate of return, usually the euro or dollar.\n\nThe Japanese currency's exchange rate strengthened sharply after the Bank of Japan (BoJ) raised its benchmark interest rate last week and decided to restrict purchases of Japanese government bonds. This resulted in a very profitable curry trade between the yen and the dollar being closed, destabilising markets and triggering a wave of selling.\n\nWhat comes next\n\nInvestors are now selling oil, cryptocurrencies and especially tech stocks. Instead, they are turning to safe havens like bonds.\n\nIn any case, there is no need to panic, as this is not a market crash. At least not yet. Investors are nervous, but not panicky, and the question now is how long this fear will last before investors feel there is opportunity in the market.", "source": {"uri": "en.protothema.gr",

But slowing and slow are two very different points,\" said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers.\n\n\"Lower prices certainly can have a massive psychological effect. But investors need to step back and look at the fundamental story, which still remains decent.\"\n\nWhether the Fed moves now or in September, any cut before the presidential election in November will thrust the independent central bank into the middle of the political campaign between former Republican president Donald Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump has previously accused Powell -- whom he first nominated to run the Fed -- of displaying political favoritism toward the Democratic Party, and suggested that he would not reappoint the central banker as Fed chair if he wins in November.\n\nWith Post Wires", "source": {"uri": "skynews.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News Australia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But for Federal Reserve officials who laid the groundwork last week to cut rates by a quarter-percentage point at their meeting next month, the outlook would likely need to deteriorate further in the coming weeks to compel a bigger response.\n\nFed officials don't meet again until Sept. 17-18. There, they could debate whether to kick off their widely anticipated sequence of rate cuts with a larger reduction of a half-percentage point, or 50 basis points, if last month's weak-across-the-board employment report is indicative of a new, worrisome trend.\n\nBut slashing policy rates before then, in between scheduled policy meetings, would be very unusual. Those moves are generally reserved for notable deteriorations in market functioning that go well beyond an equity-market swoon.\n\n\"They have a really high bar for that,\" said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at GlobalData TS Lombard. \"I think what they would rather do is go out and say, 'If things continue the way they are, 50 basis points in September is on the table.'\"\n\nAt a news conference last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested officials were on track to lower rates by a quarter-percentage point next month. That was before the Labor Department reported on Friday that U.S. hiring cooled and the unemployment rate rose by more than expected in July, which fueled bets on a supersize half-point cut.\n\nThen on Monday, a stampede to exit popular investment strategies that borrowed cheap Japanese yen to buy stocks accelerated a market downdraft in Asia. That led some panicked investors to speculate about the Fed cutting in between scheduled policy meetings. The unwinding of those so-called carry trades began last month but gathered speed after the Bank of Japan raised interest rates last week.\n\nStill, the Fed will not \"want to respond too quickly to something happening over a few days' time, when it could reflect positioning or other developments in markets that could later be unwound,\" said Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank.\n\nThere are reasons to think the increase in the unemployment rate, which climbed to 4.3% in July from 4.1% in June, had been driven by less concerning factors, said San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly on Monday. For example, it reflected an increase in temporary as opposed to permanent layoffs.\n\nThe Fed \"is prepared to do what the economy needs when we are clear what that is, and there's many more pieces of information that come out between now and when we next meet,\" she said during a question-and-answer session in Hawaii.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 3%, or 160.23 points, the largest one-day decline since September 2022. But bond investors, who at one point bet big on rate cuts, changed their minds later in the day. The policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury yield fell by 0.22 point early Monday and then reversed course, ending the day at 3.880%, virtually flat. (Yields fall when bond prices rise.)\n\nA report on service-sector business conditions on Monday also calmed nerves about a rapid economic slowdown when the Institute for Supply Management reported its index rose 2.6 points to 51.4 in July. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.\n\nThe market moves suggested there wasn't a big flight to safety occurring, as often happens when investors grow more worried about deteriorating economic fundamentals, analysts said. Conditions instead suggest more technical drivers of a selloff that deepened late last week, including the unwind of crowded trades in Japanese stocks and large technology companies.\n\nLofty stock prices and steady income and job growth have been critical engines of an economic expansion whose resilience has baffled economists. A sustained downturn in the stock market could shift the outlook for the U.S. economy if it leads companies to slash investment plans or lay off workers. But it could take days or weeks to judge how any selloff reshapes the outlook.\n\nEven though the Fed doesn't meet for six more weeks, Powell has an opportunity to weigh in on the evolving outlook later this month. Powell has often used a widely watched speech at the beginning of a Fed conference in late August as a venue to frame the central bank's broad outlook. That conference, in the iconic Grand Teton Mountains of Wyoming, is set to begin on Aug. 23, and economic and market developments over the next three weeks could shape any remarks.\n\nLast week, \"the whole Fed committee was working on the assumption that the economy is going to look in September the way it did last week, and you could do the usual slow shuffle\" to cut rates, said Blitz. \"The markets are speaking to the Fed. They're telling the Fed, 'You're too tight, and no, you can't presume that everything is going to roll along merrily while you take your time to cut.'\"\n\nThe Fed raised its benchmark federal-funds rate most recently in July 2023 to a range between 5.25% and 5.5% to combat rising prices. Inflation has slowed notably over the past year.\n\nThe latest market reaction is notable because just a few months ago, some investors feared that the Fed might not have raised rates to a sufficiently high level to subdue inflation. Officials have been reluctant to lower rates before they see more evidence that price pressures won't reignite.\n\nExpectations of slower economic growth, cooler inflation and Fed rate cuts could begin to help rate-sensitive parts of the economy over the coming months. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 6.34% on Monday, according to Mortgage News Daily, down from 6.81% one week ago and the lowest since April 2023, when worries about potential regional-bank insolvencies led to a bond-market rally.\n\nBorrowing costs often ease in anticipation of future rate cuts. As a result, rate reductions in between scheduled policy meetings are reserved for times when financial markets face more acute strains from a rapidly deteriorating outlook or when the Fed wants the element of surprise to deliver its own signal. Since Powell became Fed chair in February 2018, the central bank has cut rates in between policy meetings twice, with both occurring in March 2020 as the Covid-19 pandemic spread.\n\nOutside of that episode, rate cuts in between meetings have occurred during the following periods:\n\nIn October 1998, the Fed cut rates just weeks after an initial reduction to prevent a market meltdown after the implosion of Long-Term Capital Management, a large hedge fund.In January 2001, a monthslong downturn in technology stocks was followed by worsening economic data, leading to a surprise half-point cut.The Fed had cut rates by 1 percentage point through the fall of 2007, but economic deterioration and a massive trading loss at a French investment bank prompted the Fed to slash rates by 0.75-point in January 2008, one week before a scheduled policy meeting.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Nasdaq, full of risky tech stocks, dropped 3.7%.\n\nAll of that comes amid a global market selloff. Japan's Nikkei 225 index nosedived 12% -- its worst rout in history. All major Asian and European markets fell substantially Monday.\n\nThree fears are emerging all at the same time to send markets into a tailspin Monday: Growing worries about a recession, concern that the Federal Reserve has failed to act promptly enough and a belief that big bets on AI may not pay off.\n\nRecession fears\n\nThe most prominent is fear that the US economy is in much worse shape than previously believed -- evidenced by Friday's unexpected jump in the unemployment rate.\n\nOn Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the US economy added just 114,000 jobs in July -- far fewer than expected -- and the unemployment rate jumped to 4.3%. Although that's not in and of itself an unhealthy unemployment rate, its sudden march higher is alarming: Last year, the unemployment rate was at its lowest level since the moon landing.\n\nTo be clear: The US economy remains strong. Last quarter, it grew way more than expected, boosted by still-robust consumer spending, which makes up more than two-thirds of all gross domestic product.\n\nBut recession fears are mounting. Goldman Sachs economists Monday raised the odds of a recession to one in four in the next 12 months. That's still a \"limited\" case, because the economic data looks strong overall and the Fed has plenty of room to reduce rates from a 23-year high.\n\nBut Goldman's recession chances are still 10 percentage points higher than they were before Friday's jobs report, which it called \"more concerning now.\"\n\nFed concerns\n\nThe stock market had hit record after record this year, buoyed by falling inflation and the growing sense that the Fed would shift from its series of aggressive rate hikes and start to rate cuts, which can boost corporate profits.\n\nBut the Fed didn't cut rates as many had hoped last week. The market increasingly views the Fed's patience as a mistake.\n\nThe Fed is notoriously horrible at timing its rate cuts and hikes. It was way behind the curve on inflation and had to catch up with multiple historic rate hikes in 2022 to tame runaway prices. Likewise, some economists believe the Fed should have started cutting rates sooner.\n\nRate cuts could help support the job market by cutting borrowing costs for businesses and freeing up money for companies to spend on hiring. But policy decisions take time to work their way into the economy. As inflation has cooled dramatically in recent months and the unemployment rate has risen, some fear the Fed may be too late to act before slow hiring turns into rampant layoffs.\n\nThe Fed's next meetings are scheduled for September, November and December, Analysts at Citigroup and JPMorgan predict the Fed will slash rates by half a point at its next two meetings. But that may be too late. It may be forced to make an emergency rate cut before then -- an extraordinary intervention the market increasingly views as likely, according to CME's FedWatch tool.\n\nAn emergency cut -- which hasn't happened since the early days of Covid, is exactly what the Fed needs to do, said famed Wharton professor emeritus of finance Jeremy Siegel on CNBC Monday morning.\n\n\"It's so far behind the curve right now. I mean the Fed is up in the bleachers,\" said Siegel. \"You take a look at the data; it's not at all comforting.\"\n\nAI worries\n\nStocks had also been flying high over the past two years because of big bets on tech companies involved in artificial intelligence: Many hoped that AI would create another global industrial revolution.\n\nBut AI profits are basically nonexistent, and the unproven technology isn't yet ready for prime time. Some fear it'll never get there. Traders are beginning to unwind big trades on Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet and other tech stocks that had been surging since the beginning of last year.\n\nWarren Buffett -- CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and a notoriously calm force when markets go haywire -- is also ditching tech. He just sold half of Berkshire's Apple stake, which is a troubling sign for the health of the tech sector.\n\nBecause those companies are each worth close to $1 trillion or more and make up an enormous chunk of the overall value of the S&P 500, when investors sell off tech stocks, that has a massive detrimental effect on the broader market.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nInvestors are running for the hills. They're selling off oil, crypto and especially tech stocks. Instead, they're pouring into safe havens like bonds, sending Treasury yields lower.\n\nThat could spell trouble for some folks' retirement accounts. But people who are close to retirement could actually benefit if they have a heavy mix of bonds, which are benefiting from the flight to safety.\n\nLower rates, if the Fed follows suit with cuts, could help lower punishingly high mortgage rates, car loan rates and other consumer loan costs. It could mean, however, that people with money stored in savings accounts could yield less interest in the coming months.\n\nOne thing not to do: panic. This is not a market crash. Not yet, anyway. Investors are nervous, but not panicked. Monday's rout, if it ends at current levels, wouldn't even crack the top 100 worst days in market history.\n\nThe only question now: How long will this fear last before investors sense a buying opportunity?\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Here are the odds.", "body": "The three-day stock market rout roiling Wall Street is prompting some experts to question whether the Federal Reserve could enact an emergency rate cut before its September meeting.\n\nThe speculation is arising in the wake of the Fed's July 31 meeting, when the central bank decided to keep its benchmark rate steady at its highest point in 23 years. At a press conference that day, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said while he and other officials were carefully watching the labor market for signs of weakness, they wanted to see more evidence that inflation was cooling before cutting rates.\n\nBut on August 2, the monthly jobs report came in much weaker than expected, sparking fears that the U.S. economy may be fraying under the weight of high borrowing costs and that the Fed has waited too long to cut rates. A few other weak economic reports have added fuel to those worries about the economy, igniting a three-day rout that's caused the S&P 500 to shed 6% of its value since July 31.\n\nGiven the dim economic data, some analysts and investors said they believe the Fed should undertake an emergency cut before their next rate decision, scheduled for September 18.\n\n\"Some analysts are even suggesting an intra-meeting emergency cut is warranted,\" noted Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, in an email.\n\nTraders are signaling a roughly 60% likelihood of an emergency 0.25 percentage point cut within one week, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nBut some experts said they believe the odds are much lower, with Pantheon Macroeconomics noting that overnight index swap rates implied that investors on Monday saw a roughly 30% chance the Fed could make an emergency cut in the next week.\n\nChicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee on Monday told CNBC that if there's more deterioration in economic conditions, \"we're going to fix it.\" But he added that even though the jobs numbers were weaker than expected, he doesn't believe the U.S. is in a recession.\n\nThe Fed has cut rates at nine emergency meetings in the last 30 years, which means an intra-meeting cut before September \"would not be unprecedented,\" Pantheon noted.\n\nThe last emergency rate cut was in March 2020, when the economy was free-falling due to the coronavirus pandemic, which shuttered businesses across the globe.\n\n\"Intra-meeting cuts have typically only happened in the event of financial crisis,\" Shah noted.\n\nThat was echoed by Pantheon, which noted that \"economic and market conditions usually have been worse than now to trigger an emergency Fed meeting.\"\n\nWhile the markets are pricing in the chance of a rate cut, many economists believe the Fed is likely to wait until its September meeting to start easing borrowing costs, partly as the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average remain in positive territory despite the three-day rout.\n\n\"We think [Powell] will opt to wait until September, provided markets stabilize,\" Pantheon's economists wrote in a research note. \"The Fed probably will place little weight on the drop in stock prices, as the main indexes still are higher than at the start of the year.\"\n\nAnd cutting rates in an emergency meeting might undermine confidence in the economy, Amanda Agati, chief investment officer of PNC's asset management group, told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\n\"From our perspective, this isn't the environment when you want to hastily throw a rate cut out there,\" Agati said. An emergency cut could do \"more damage than it helps because then the everyone will say, 'What does the Fed know that we don't?'\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austan_Goolsbee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austan Goolsbee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_MoneyWatch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS MoneyWatch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asset management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/07/05/07b58812-fbf6-4fc6-8305-15fcffa8d577/thumbnail/1200x630/9766ad9775cfe5379e1b954797be12a7/powell-gettyimages-1258939403.jpg?v=33116e4d892fab6878b5c06299369826", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 235, "textEnd": 242, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 594, "textEnd": 602}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 1149, "textEnd": 1161}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 2188, "textEnd": 2198}], "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Asian stocks kicked off the day's global trading with their worst route in decades, with Japan's Nikkei 225 falling by more than 12% to surpass losses suffered on Black Monday in October 1987.\n\nEuropean markets followed suit including London's FTSE 100 which finished yesterday's trading down by more than 2%, its worst day of the year so far. As America woke up the morning broadcasters were delivering dire yet breathless predictions of further financial misery for investors as economists debated whether the US Federal Reserve will be forced into an emergency interest rate cut to prop up the slowing economy.\n\nREAD MORE: Markets take stock as the US political show rolls on\n\n\"This is the moment we have been waiting for,\" declared CNBC host Dan Neuner.\n\n\"The Fed will need to react really fast to avoid a meltdown that could make 2008 look like a joke. It's an election year. I'm expecting emergency action.\"\n\nMark Tepper, chief executive of Strategic Wealth Partners, told Fox News that things obviously look \"pretty dire right now\" as Wall Street's so-called \"fear gauge\", the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), jumped to its highest level in more than four years. It was up by as much as 172% to 62.27 before trading opened on Monday, marking the highest level since the onset of the Covid pandemic in March 2020.\n\nWeaker than expected jobs and manufacturing data have sparked concerns that the US Fed has left it too late to begin cutting interest rates currently sitting at a 23-year high. Analysts at JP Morgan say it's a 50-50 shot whether the US will fall into recession, while Goldman Sachs has raised its odds to a 25% chance of recession within the next year.\n\nAmid this trading cacophony debate has broken out as to whether the Fed will take the unusual move of calling an emergency gathering before its next scheduled meeting to cut interest rates in an effort to quell the tumult. If so, it would be the board's first unscheduled decision since the outbreak of Covid.\n\nIt was only Wednesday of last week that the Fed decided to keep rates unchanged at 5.5%, even though its chair Jerome Powell acknowledged there were early signs of a slowing economy. The Fed also guided towards expectations of a rate cut in September.\n\nTo jump early and just a week after its last scheduled meeting would be quite extraordinary, yet traders are now pricing in a roughly 60% chance of the Fed doing just that.\n\nREAD MORE: IT chaos reveals fragility of global business infrastructure\n\nEither way, more than 120 basis points of cuts are expected by the end of this year, versus around 50 basis points at the start of last week. If the Fed doesn't go early, markets have fully priced in a hefty half-point cut in September.\n\nNigel Green, chief executive of the deVere financial advisory group, said it would be \"beyond negligent\" if the Federal Reserve does not announce an emergency cut.\n\n\"The Fed was behind the curve at the beginning of the cycle, it cannot afford to be behind the curve this time too,\" Mr Green said. \"The US central bank needs to take action now, and start to bring down rates from a more than two-decade high, or there could be legitimate and far-reaching risks of a hard landing.\"\n\nHe added: \"We hope the Fed will announce an emergency cut of 25 basis points this week, and another in September, to quell speculation and the growing sense of panic.\"\n\nThough Mr Green is not alone in this view, there is a good deal of evidence to support the judgement that an emergency cut would be a mistake that would further stoke panic rather than subdue it.\n\nOver the weekend analysts at Goldman Sachs raised their expectation of a US recession from 15% to 25%, but added there are several reasons not to fear a slump in that the economy continues to look \"fine overall\" with growth of 2.8% in the April to June period.\n\nREAD MORE: Middle East firm withdraws takeover interest in Wood\n\nOthers have further pointed out that the jobs data doesn't support the scale of yesterday's global meltdown, with the answer instead likely to be found in the increasing strength of the yen as it has rallied by more than 11% against the dollar from 38-year lows hit just a month ago. This recovery has been supported last month's increase in Japanese interest rates to \"around 0.25%\", a surprise decision that came just hours before the Fed opted to keep its cost of borrowing on hold.\n\nAnalysts say this appears to have triggered a sharp unwinding of carry trades, where investors borrow money from economies with low interest rates such as Japan or Switzerland to fund investments in higher-yielding assets elsewhere, such as US technology stocks. When this happens investors must quickly sell assets to cover currency losses, which causes ripples across all markets.\n\nRoll this together with the blow to tech sector confidence after legendary investor Warren Buffett recently sold off half his stake in Apple, and it's pretty clear why the tech-focused US Nasdaq was down by more than 4% at one point yesterday.\n\nBut emergency cut or no, what is evident is that US interest rates will be coming down at a relatively fast and furious pace in the coming months, in stark contrast to what's expected here closer to home.\n\nThe UK's Monetary Policy Committee said last week that it will not go too far nor too fast after last week's initial quarter-point cut to 5%. Similarly, the European Central Bank has not indicated any path for further policy easing after cutting rates from 4% to 3.75% in June.\n\nWith geopolitical strains and a bitter presidential election coming up in the US, there are certainly more tumultuous times in store for the world's financial markets as events play out across our highly interconnected global economy.", "source": {"uri":

An emergency rate cut would also \"demonstrate the Fed's willingness to act,\" Rudick said.\n\nAccording to CME FedWatch data, traders are pricing in a 100% chance that the central bank will cut rates in September -- and an 83.5% chance rates will be cut by 0.5%.\n\nBut emergency rate cuts might do more harm than good, according to Sarah Hunt, founding partner and chief market strategist at asset management firm Alpine Saxon Woods,\n\n\"The concern is that the Fed doing an emergency cut -- or stepping in too hard -- is now going to worry people even further, and it's not necessarily going to be helpful,\" Hunt told Bloomberg.\n\nPoor manufacturing data and alarming employment numbers are only two pieces of a greater puzzle, she said.\n\nJapanese monetary policy, tensions between Israel and Lebanon, and the unwinding of levered trades are also shaking markets -- and these factors have nothing to do with the Federal Reserve.\n\n\"Had the Fed cut last week you'd probably have had less of an amplitude of problems, but the direction would still have been down,\" Hunt said.\n\nAnd emergency cuts could trigger market panic regardless of whether they're warranted or not, Jake Ostrovskis, OTC trader at crypto market maker Wintermute, told DL News.\n\nSuch cuts would \"signal panic or undue concern about the economy, potentially undermining confidence in the central bank,\" Ostrovskis said.\n\nThat, in turn, would \"create uncertainty and increase market volatility in all assets -- especially long-duration assets like crypto,\" he said.\n\nNoelle Acheson, former head of market insights for Genesis Global Trading, has a similar insight.\n\n\"An emergency cut would signal panic, not a good look for the US central bank,\" she wrote on X. \"Imagine the panic if the Fed

The question isn't whether the Fed should cut in September, but by how much,\" he wrote.\n\nJapan's rate hikes\n\nApart from the US Fed, the actions of the Bank of Japan (BoJ) have added fuel to the fire.\n\nBack in March, the Japanese central bank increased its short-term interest rates to 0-0.1%, from minus 0.1%, marking the first rate hike in the country in 17 years.\n\nIn July, it raised the benchmark interest rate to 0.25%, its highest in 16 years, and unveiled plans to halve its monthly bond purchases to tighten its monetary policy.\n\n\"The BoJ's action has significantly strengthened the yen in recent weeks, negatively affecting the profitability of Japanese exporters,\" Drozdz explained.\n\nLarger rate cut possible?\n\nMany analysts have been expecting the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points in September, but the probability of a larger one of 50 basis points is now becoming stronger.\n\nThe probability of a rate cut of 25 basis points has fallen to 15.5%, while it has gone up from 71.5% to 84.5% for 50 basis points, according to the FedWatch Tool provided by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group.\n\n\"The Fed has laid out a gradual pathway towards normalization in its projections, assuming that inflation keeps coming in, and underlying fundamentals remain resilient,\" said Wurm.\n\n\"However, because monetary policy works with lags, the Fed will continue to keenly monitor the data to check if it has done too much. If economic activity were to slow more or if unemployment were to rise more, the Fed may consider a larger cut, not only in September, but also at subsequent meetings,\" he added.", "source": {"uri":

Robert Prechter (pictured left), the founder and president of Elliott Wave International, joined Neil Cavuto on Fox Business Monday evening and said the Fed missed a huge opportunity at its meeting last week to get ahead of the market calamity that continues to unfold.\n\n'I think there's gonna be a surprise rate cut before the September meeting because I think rates have started falling faster,' he said. The last time the Fed made emergency rate cuts came back during the early days of COVID, and many experts believe one won't happen again now because it would signal that the U.S. economy is in terrible shape, possibly leading to even more market scares.\n\nBack in January, Prechter (pictured) warned that having too much optimism in the market was dangerous. He said Monday that this optimism is now 'entrenched' and that the world is seeing 'the most overgrown market ever.' Following the Friday jobs report, which showed unemployment in July rose to the highest level since October 2021, markets worldwide went into a tailspin amid fears that the U.S. economy is sputtering.\n\nMonday's continued downfall was led by the benchmark Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo - the third largest in the world - which crashed by 12 percent this morning, the biggest single-day fall in almost four decades. The S&P 500 dropped 3 percent for its worst day in nearly two years.\n\nThe Dow Jones reeled by 1,033 points, or 2.6 percent, while the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4 percent. All told, Bloomberg estimates that $6.4 trillion has been wiped from the value of global stock markets in the last three weeks.\n\nMuch of this could have been avoided if the Fed had decided to cut rates at last week's meeting, according to Prechter (pictured). 'The Federal Reserve had a wonderful opportunity last Wednesday to lower their Fed funds rate by a quarter point; they didn't take it,' he said. 'I think that was a big mistake.'\n\nNow, economists at Goldman Sachs have raised the likelihood of the U.S. slipping into a recession within the next year from 15 percent to 25 percent, while analysts at JP Morgan put the chances at 50 percent. The Fed had been raising rates since March 2022 in a bid to contain inflation, but one top economist believes the agency is suffering from tunnel vision.\n\nThe chief economic advisor at Allianz, Mohamed El-Erian, blamed the Fed for the current state of the market , saying the hikes are hitting the economy hard. 'I really do worry that we may lose US economic exceptionalism because of a policy mistake,' he told Bloomberg TV. Even if the Fed waits until September to cute rates, most industry watchers believe a rate cut is indeed coming.\n\nJP Morgan analysts wrote in a memo that because 'the Fed looks to be materially behind the curve, we expect a 50 [basis point] cut at the September meeting, followed by another 50 [basis point] cut in November.' Investors now also believe that other major central banks will follow the Fed's lead and ease rates more aggressively, with the European Central Bank believed to be cutting rates by 67 basis points by Christmas.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

"WASHINGTON - The global stock sell-off has fuelled calls for the US Federal Reserve to lower interest rates swiftly and decisively, with some analysts now calling for it to make an emergency cut before its September rate decision.\n\nThe futures markets, which as recently as last week expected a single quarter percentage-point cut at the US central bank's next rate decision in September, now see a half-point cut as much more likely, according to data from CME Group.\n\n\"The rate tide has quickly turned,\" Bank of America economists wrote in a recent note to clients, adding they now see a September rate cut as \"a virtual lock.\"\n\nThe US central bank has held its benchmark lending rate at a two-decade high for the past year as it battles to return inflation to its long-term target of two percent.\n\nAfter a small uptick earlier this year, annual headline inflation is now falling once more toward the target, while the US economy is still growing and the labor market has weakened.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Fed chair Jerome Powell signalled last week that the first rate cut could come \"as soon as\" September.\n\nBut some analysts fear that may not be soon enough, as the markets have responded in dramatic fashion to last week's below-target US jobs report, which raised fears that the US was entering a recession.\n\n\"I'm calling for a 75-basis point emergency cut in the Fed funds rate, with another 75-basis point cut indicated for next month at the September meeting,\" Wharton School professor emeritus of finance Jeremy Siegel told CNBC on Aug 5. \"And that's minimum.\"\n\n\"I wasn't calling for an inter-meeting cut, because that might signal panic,\" the Nobel prize-winning US economist Paul Krugman wrote in a social media post on Aug 5.\n\n\"But since we may be seeing a panic anyway, that argument loses its force,\" he said, adding: \"Real case for an emergency cut soon.\"\n\nAll three major indices on Wall Streets extended recent losses on Aug 5 as investors continued selling AI-related tech stocks and locking in recent gains.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.6 per cent, while the broad-based S&P 500 fell 3 per cent, and the

Just 15.5% of traders think the Fed will approve a quarter-point cut.\n\n\"While we do not think conditions are ripe for the Fed to make an emergency rate cut, the case for a supersized 50 basis point reduction at its next meeting has been bolstered by the recent market turmoil,\" said Joe Brusuelas, RSM chief economist.\n\nThe new projections come on the heels of the disappointing July jobs report, which showed that total nonfarm payrolls grew by just 114,000 in July, while the jobless rate unexpectedly jumped to 4.3%. The report reignited fears of a slowing economy, because it triggered the so-called Sahm rule, an indicator that is used to provide an early recession signal.\n\nWALL STREET'S FEAR GAUGE SPIKES TO HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE 2020 AS GLOBAL TURMOIL DEEPENS\n\nThe rule stipulates that a recession is likely when the three-month moving average of the jobless rate is at least a half-percentage point higher than the 12-month low.\n\nOver the past three months, the unemployment rate has averaged 4.13%, which is 0.63 percentage points higher than the 3.5% rate recorded in July 2023. The Sahm rule has successfully predicted every recession since 1970.\n\nStocks plunged on Friday following the report, with the S&P 500 notching its worst day since October 2022. The indexes resumed their downward spiral Monday as the sell-off deepened. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 1,000 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 3.43%. The S&P 500 slid another 3%.\n\nSTOCK SELL-OFF CONTINUES, AS RECESSION FEARS MOUNT\n\n\"With the unemployment rate above and core PCE inflation now below the Fed's year-end forecasts, we believe that the balance of risks favors more aggressive action by the Fed,\" UBS analysts wrote in a Friday note. \"We are changing our base case to rate cuts of 50 basis points in September and 25 basis points each in November and December.\"\n\nThe slowdown in job growth has also raised questions about whether the Fed waited too long to cut interest rates, which are currently hovering near a 23-year high. Policymakers voted to hold rates steady during their meeting last week, but they opened the door to a rate cut in September.\n\nSome investors have also speculated that the Fed will be forced to make an emergency rate cut. The central bank rarely cuts rates outside of regularly scheduled meetings, and has only done so seven times. The most recent emergency cut took place on March 15, 2020, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the Fed slashed rates to near zero.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nChicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee cast doubt that the jump in unemployment and ongoing stock-market volatility is enough to warrant an emergency rate cut.\n\n\"We've got to be monitoring the real side of the economy: There's nothing in the Fed's mandate that's about making sure the stock market is comfortable,\" Goolsbee told The New York Times.", "source": {"uri": "foxbusiness.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox Business"}, "authors": [{"uri": "megan_henney@foxbusiness.com", "name": "Megan Henney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CME_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CME Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bond market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austan_Goolsbee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austan Goolsbee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq_Composite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq Composite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2024/06/1024/512/powell-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-17", "dateEnd": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 444, "textEnd": 455}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-15", "textStart": 2926, "textEnd": 2940}], "sentiment": -0.4745098039215686, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

That was triggered by Friday's data.\n\nCommentators also said a stronger yen had led investors to unwind their \"carry trades\", in which they borrowed in the cheap Japanese currency to invest in higher-yielding assets, such as equities.\n\nWhile Wall Street's three main indexes suffered another day of pain -- with the Nasdaq down more than three percent -- a forecast-beating read on the key U.S. services sector provided some solace.\n\nTokyo's Nikkei, which tanked more than 12 percent Monday and suffered a record points loss, jumped 10.2 percent.\n\nToyota was up more than 12 percent, Sony piled on more than nine percent and chip giant Tokyo Electron added 16.6 percent.\n\n\"This is a sweeping, across-the-board gain,\" said analysts at Nomura, adding that investors would also pay close attention to the forex market.\n\nJapan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said at a scheduled news conference Tuesday: \"The stock market has been moving again today, and I think it is important to judge this situation calmly.\"\n\n\"We will continue to monitor the situation with a sense of urgency and to carry out economic and fiscal management in close cooperation with the Bank of Japan.\"\n\nShanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Taipei, Mumbai, Bangkok and Manila also rose but Hong Kong gave up early gains to sit marginally in the red.\n\nSingapore and Wellington also suffered more selling.\n\nLondon edged up after shedding around two percent Monday, while Paris and Frankfurt were also higher.\n\nFriday's data sparked calls for the Fed to cut rates now. Nobel prize-winning U.S. economist Paul Krugman wrote on social media: \"I wasn't calling for an inter-meeting cut, because that might signal panic.\n\n\"But since we may be seeing a panic anyway, that argument loses its force. Real case for an emergency cut soon.\"\n\nBut Chicago Fed boss Austan Goolsbee urged caution about reading too much into one jobs report.\n\n\"As you see jobs numbers come in weaker than expected but not looking yet like recession, I do think you want to be forward-looking of where the economy is headed,\" he told CNBC ahead of the U.S. trading day Monday.\n\n\"The payroll jobs number is plus or minus 100,000 a month, so be a little careful over-concluding about things in the margin of error,\" he said, adding that if the U.S. economy deteriorated, the Fed would \"fix it\".\n\nPantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note to clients that the Fed \"probably will place little weight on the drop in stock prices, as the main indexes still are higher than at the start of the year\".\n\nFed chief Jerome Powell said after the bank's policy meeting last week that a cut could come as soon as September.\n\nBets had been for at least one 25-basis-point reduction before January but talk is now about a possible 100-basis-points-worth of cuts.\n\nThe yen's rally ran out of puff and was sitting just below 145 per dollar, having hit a six-month high below 142 Monday.\n\nThe Japanese unit has surged over the past month -- after hitting a nearly four-decade low in early July -- after the Bank of Japan hiked rates hours before Powell indicated the Fed was planning a cut.\n\nMoody's Analytics analysts wrote: \"Asia's equity selloff will cause sleepless nights at the Bank of Japan. For the past two years, the central bank had been playing it safe, wary of repeating the mistake of tightening policy right into a downturn.\n\n\"The last significant rate hikes by the BoJ were in 2006, just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and in 2000, just as the dot.com bubble burst.

In America, they meet in Washington.\n\nAnd they meet even in election years.\n\nPolitical and market pressures are inevitable, especially in a political campaign season in which U.S. monetary policy is nearing an inflection point. Events in the past few days have reinforced just how intense those pressures can be and why, politically and economically, the Federal Reserve is so important.\n\nAt a press conference last Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell strongly suggested that the central bank would finally cut interest rates in September. That's what Wall Street has been waiting months to hear. Instead of rejoicing, traders appear worried the Fed has fallen behind a cooling economy. They initiated a sharp sell-off that is still reverberating around the world.\n\nChair Powell also went out of his way to reemphasize the Fed's political independence. He was perhaps reacting to a recent published interview in which Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, said a September rate cut would be a mistake.\n\n\"Congress has, we believe, ordered us to conduct our business in a nonpolitical way at all times,\" Mr. Powell said. \"We never use our tools to support or oppose a political party, a politician, or any political outcome.\"\n\nThe scrutiny of Fed moves - or even potential moves - is so intense because the Fed is so powerful. Its interest rate decisions help determine the direction of the economy. When the Fed raises interest rates, borrowing becomes more expensive and fewer businesses take out loans to expand. The economy tends to slow. Conversely, when the central bank lowers rates, the economy tends to accelerate.\n\nThe current stock swoon has many drivers. One is worry by investors that the immediate benefits of artificial intelligence are overhyped. Another is the recent hike in Japanese interest rates, which hurt Japan's multinationals and killed a weird trade in which investors borrowed Japanese yen to buy stocks in other countries. But the bigger fear may be that the United States will tip into recession.\n\nFor months now, the economy has been showing signs of weakness. Many U.S. companies have reported gloomy outlooks for future sales. On Friday, the Labor Department reported the U.S. added 114,000 jobs in July, only about two-thirds of what many economists had been expecting.\n\nStock markets, which had already fallen Thursday on artificial intelligence fears and weak earnings reports, plunged. By the end of trading Friday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index had fallen into what Wall Street calls \"correction\" territory. That means a fall of at least 10% from a recent high and one that marks the halfway point to a bear market. Foreign stock markets also felt the chill. By Monday, Japan's Topix index had lost 12% of its value over three days, its biggest such plunge since at least 1959.\n\nThe losses intensified on all the major U.S. stock indexes Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing more than 1,000 points, its largest single-day drop in nearly two years.\n\nNot everyone is buying the doom and gloom. \"A weak July employment report does not a recession make,\" Ed Yardeni and Eric Wallerstein of Yardeni Research Inc., an investment strategy firm, wrote in a Monday note. If things break right, the analysts wrote, they expect stocks to rally after the November election.\n\n\"The labor market is cooling, but without a sharp slowdown,\" wrote analysts at Bank of America Securities. The jobs report likely looked worse because of Hurricane Beryl's impact on the Texas labor market last month, they added.\n\nThe next question is what the Fed will do at its next meeting in September. Many analysts say the poor labor report guarantees a quarter-point cut in the Fed lending rate that influences wider interest rates. Some say the Fed will cut rates by a more dramatic half a percentage point.\n\nA rate cut would make borrowing less expensive and help to boost the economy over time. Such a move, so close to the election, would open the Fed to Republican charges that it was tipping the scales in favor of the Democrats. At the same time, the Fed has never been shy about fiddling with interest rates in election years. It has either raised or lowered them in 10 of the last 11 elections. (The exception is 2012, when President Barack Obama was seeking reelection.)\n\nThe political fallout from such changes can be dramatic. The Fed reacted too late to pandemic-era inflation, and prices kept soaring. Many voters have not forgiven the administration for the 20% surge in the cost of living since Joe Biden took office.\n\nBy cutting rates, the central bank would signal that it has won the fight against inflation and can now turn its attention to boosting the economy. In theory, that could help Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris distance herself from the inflation under President Biden and push the idea that lower mortgage rates and better times lie ahead. The danger is that she could end up trying to sell half a seesaw to voters.\n\nThe flip side of a rate cut is that it usually signals a weakening economy, which typically hurts incumbents. Just ask former President Trump. When the pandemic threw millions of Americans out of work in 2020, the Fed scrambled to cut interest rates to counteract a short - but sharp - recession. It buoyed the economy but not in time to help Mr. Trump, who lost the election.", "source": {"uri": "csmonitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Science Monitor"}, "authors": [{"uri":

That was triggered by Friday's data.\n\nWhile Wall Street's three main indexes suffered another day of pain - with the Nasdaq down more than 3% - a forecast-beating read on the key U.S. services sector provided a little solace for investors.\n\nTokyo's Nikkei, which tanked more than 12% Monday and suffered a record points loss, jumped around 10.5% in the morning before paring some of those gains.\n\nToyota was up more than 10%, Sony piled on more than 7%, while chip giant Tokyo Electron added 12.26%.\n\n'This is a sweeping, across-the-board gain,' said analysts at Nomura, adding that investors will also pay close attention to the forex market.\n\nNomura expects the Nikkei to end with the biggest-ever gain, beating 2,676.55 points in October 1990.\n\n'If movements continue as they started, the Nikkei ended yesterday with the biggest loss and will end today by renewing the biggest point gain,' it said.\n\nHong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Taipei and Manila also rose but Singapore and Wellington suffered more selling.\n\nFriday's data has fanned calls for the Fed to cut rates now to support the economy, with Nobel prize-winning U.S. economist Paul Krugman writing on social media: 'I wasn't calling for an inter-meeting cut, because that might signal panic.\n\n'But since we may be seeing a panic anyway, that argument loses its force. Real case for an emergency cut soon.'\n\nBut Chicago Fed boss Austan Goolsbee urged caution about reading too much into one jobs report.\n\n'As you see jobs numbers come in weaker than expected but not looking yet like recession, I do think you want to be forward-looking of where the economy is headed,' he told CNBC ahead of the U.S. trading day Monday.\n\n'The payroll jobs number is plus or minus 100,000 a month, so be a little careful over-concluding about things in the margin of error,' he said, adding that if the U.S. economy deteriorated, the Fed would 'fix it.'\n\nPantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note to clients that the Fed 'probably will place little weight on the drop in stock prices, as the main indexes still are higher than at the start of the year.'\n\nFed chief Jerome Powell said after the bank's policy meeting last week that a cut could come as soon as September.\n\nWhile bets had been for a 25-basis-point reduction - with at least one more before January - they have risen sharply and investors are now eyeing at least 100-basis-points-worth of cuts by the end of the year.\n\nOn currency markets, the yen's rally ran out of puff and was sitting just below 145 per dollar, having hit a six-month high around 142 Monday.\n\nThe Japanese unit has surged over the past month - having hit a nearly four-decade low at the start of July - after the Bank of Japan hiked interest rates on the same day Powell indicated the Fed was planning to loosen policy.\n\nBut analysts at Moody's Analytics wrote: 'Asia's equity selloff will cause sleepless nights at the Bank of Japan. For the past two years, the central bank had been playing it safe, wary of repeating the mistake of tightening policy right into a downturn.\n\n'The last significant rate hikes by the BoJ were in 2006, just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and in 2000, just as the dot.com bubble burst. Both times, the BoJ was forced to reverse course.\n\n'The BoJ can hardly be blamed for this latest market selloff, so another U-turn is not a foregone conclusion.

Jeremy Siegel, professor emeritus of finance at the Wharton School of Business stated, \"I'm calling for a 75 basis point emergency cut in the Fed funds rate, with another 75 basis point cut indicated for next month at the September meeting, and that's minimum.\" A basis point represents one-hundredth of one percent, so a 75 basis point cut would reduce the rate by 0.75%.\n\nSiegel contends that the Fed funds rate should already be between 3.5% and 4%, significantly lower than its current target range of 5.25% to 5.5%. Siegel's recommendation comes in the wake of disappointing job numbers that have heightened fears of a U.S. recession. The economic instability has been exacerbated by the Bank of Japan's decision to raise its interest rate above 0%, which has wreaked havoc on both stock and cryptocurrency markets.\n\nOn Monday, Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $50,000 for the first time since February, reminiscent of the market crash in March 2020 at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSiegel, who also serves as a senior economist at WisdomTree Investments, argues that another cycle of Federal Reserve rate cuts is overdue. \"The Fed has said that the long-run fed funds rate -- when inflation reached 2% and unemployment has come up to 4.2% -- should be 2.8%,\" explained Siegel.\n\nSiegel warns that inaction could have dire consequences: \"If they're going to be as slow on the way down as they were on the way up -- which, by the way, was the worst policy error in 50 years -- then we're not in for a good time with this economy.\"", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

That was triggered by Friday's data.\n\nCommentators also said a stronger yen had led investors to unwind their \"carry trades\", in which they borrowed in the cheap Japanese currency to invest in higher-yielding assets, such as equities.\n\nWhile Wall Street's three main indexes suffered another day of pain -- with the Nasdaq down more than three percent -- a forecast-beating read on the key US services sector provided some solace.\n\nTokyo's Nikkei, which tanked more than 12 percent Monday and suffered a record points loss, jumped 10.2 percent.\n\nToyota was up more than 12 percent, Sony piled on more than nine percent and chip giant Tokyo Electron added 16.6 percent.\n\n\"This is a sweeping, across-the-board gain,\" said analysts at Nomura, adding that investors would also pay close attention to the forex market.\n\nJapan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said at a scheduled news conference Tuesday: \"The stock market has been moving again today, and I think it is important to judge this situation calmly.\"\n\n\"We will continue to monitor the situation with a sense of urgency and to carry out economic and fiscal management in close cooperation with the Bank of Japan.\"\n\nShanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Taipei, Mumbai, Bangkok and Manila also rose but Hong Kong gave up early gains to sit marginally in the red.\n\nSingapore and Wellington also suffered more selling.\n\nLondon edged up after shedding around two percent Monday, while Paris and Frankfurt were also higher.\n\nFriday's data sparked calls for the Fed to cut rates now. Nobel prize-winning US economist Paul Krugman wrote on social media: \"I wasn't calling for an inter-meeting cut, because that might signal panic.\n\n\"But since we may be seeing a panic anyway, that argument loses its force. Real case for an emergency cut soon.\"\n\nBut Chicago Fed boss Austan Goolsbee urged caution about reading too much into one jobs report.\n\n\"As you see jobs numbers come in weaker than expected but not looking yet like recession, I do think you want to be forward-looking of where the economy is headed,\" he told CNBC ahead of the US trading day Monday.\n\n\"The payroll jobs number is plus or minus 100,000 a month, so be a little careful over-concluding about things in the margin of error,\" he said, adding that if the US economy deteriorated, the Fed would \"fix it\".\n\nPantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note to clients that the Fed \"probably will place little weight on the drop in stock prices, as the main indexes still are higher than at the start of the year\".\n\nFed chief Jerome Powell said after the bank's policy meeting last week that a cut could come as soon as September.\n\nBets had been for at least one 25-basis-point reduction before January but talk is now about a possible 100-basis-points-worth of cuts.\n\nThe yen's rally ran out of puff and was sitting just below 145 per dollar, having hit a six-month high below 142 Monday.\n\nThe Japanese unit has surged over the past month -- after hitting a nearly four-decade low in early July -- after the Bank of Japan hiked rates hours before Powell indicated the Fed was planning a cut.\n\nMoody's Analytics analysts wrote: \"Asia's equity selloff will cause sleepless nights at the Bank of Japan. For the past two years, the central bank had been playing it safe, wary of repeating the mistake of tightening policy right into a downturn.\n\n\"The last significant rate hikes by the BoJ were in 2006, just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and in 2000, just as the dot.com bubble burst. Both times, the BoJ was forced to reverse course.\n\n\"The BoJ can hardly be blamed for this latest market selloff, so another U-turn is not a foregone conclusion. But the selloff doesn't make last week's rate hike -- which was already on shaky ground -- look any better.\"\n\n- Key figures around 0710 GMT -\n\nTokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 10.2 percent at 34,675.46

This initiative aims at purchasing $50 billion worth of Treasury securities each month. Moreover, it comes at a crucial juncture as the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to announce an emergency interest rate cut soon.\n\nU.S. Treasury Buyback Plan\n\nThe program will start with an $8.5 billion buyback in August, according to the latest tentative schedule. Moreover, it will be followed by a whopping $31.5 billion worth of Treasury buyback in September. Thereafter, the U.S. government will initiated a $10 billion buyback in October. This move aims to manage the supply of government bonds in the market and support liquidity.\n\nIn parallel, market speculation is rife about a potential emergency rate cut by the U.S. Fed. Wharton's Professor Jeremy Siegel has been vocal about his expectations for a significant rate cut. Siegel called for a 75 basis point emergency cut, followed by another 75 basis point cut in September, according to an interview with CNBC.\n\n\"Absolutely, and this may surprise you, I'm calling for a 75 basis point emergency cut in the Fed funds rate with another 75 basis point cut indicated for next month at the September meeting, and that's minimum,\" Siegel stated. Furthermore, he elaborated that the current Fed funds rate should be between 3.5% and 4% based on the recent economic data.\n\nIn addition, Siegel criticized the Federal Reserve for its inaction despite significant improvements in inflation and employment rates. \"We've gone down 90% towards the target on the inflation rate. We've overshot the target on the employment. Those are the two targets explicitly mentioned by the Federal Reserve,\" he argued.\n\nAdding to the chorus, Robert Prechter, a prominent financial analyst and president of Elliott Wave International, also predicts an emergency rate cut. Prechter that he expects the Federal Reserve to act before its scheduled September meeting due to the recent market turmoil.\n\n\"I think there's gonna be a surprise rate cut before the September meeting because I think rates have started falling faster,\" Prechter said, according to a FOX Business report. Additionally, he pointed out the last time the U.S. Fed made such a move during the height of Covid-19, in response to fears of a global economic collapse. This historical precedent sets the stage for a rate cut in current times.\n\nHowever, not all economists share this optimism. Many argue that an emergency rate cut would signal that the U.S. and global economy are in dire straits. It could potentially lead to further further market crash, according to comments by experts like Peter Schiff and Scott Melker.\n\nDespite this, the CME FedWatch Tool indicates a 74.5% probability of a 50 basis point rate cut in the September meeting. Whilst, the probability for a 25 basis point cut stands at 25.5%. Market reactions to these speculations have been mixed. Polymarket, a betting website, showed 55% odds of an emergency rate cut yesterday amid rumors of a potential emergency Fed meeting. However, these odds have since slipped to 18% due to the absence of an official announcement.\n\nThe Treasury buyback program is seen as a complementary measure to the potential rate cuts. It aims at stabilizing the financial markets. By reducing the supply of Treasuries, the government hopes to support bond prices and keep yields in check. This can indirectly support broader economic stability amid recession concerns. Amid these developments, the crypto market has already marked a recovery, offering a sigh of relief after Black Monday.", "source": {"uri": "coingape.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coingape"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kritika_mehta@coingape.com", "name": "Kritika Mehta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Siegel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Siegel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_bond", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_analyst", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial analyst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_collapse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic collapse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Schiff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Schiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HM Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/BTC-US.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

The economy continued to add jobs in health care, social assistance and construction. Public sector job creation has slowed in recent months and was little changed in July, with employment in those sectors increasing by 17,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n\"We've seen some slowdown in the labor market for several months, although it's relatively solid by historical standards,\" said Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a center-left economic think tank. \"There haven't been inflationary pressures coming from the labor market because wage growth continues to slow.\"\n\nGould added that she thinks the Fed waited too long to cut interest rates, given what the labor market data shows.\n\nSoftening is a little more concerning and we may get there sooner than necessary, she said.\n\nThe Fed decided not to cut rates at its latest meeting, it announced Wednesday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank still needs to see more data showing that inflation is falling enough to justify a rate cut. Despite recent increases in the unemployment rate, Powell said the labor market is normalizing after a warmer employment market. But he indicated it was possible the Fed could be ready to cut rates by September.\n\n\"We had a good quarter of inflation and we saw the labour market move quite markedly. As I mentioned, I don't think it needs to calm down any further for us to get the labour market inflation results. That could happen in September if the data confirms that,\" he said.\n\nPowell added that he saw no evidence in the economic data that the economy was weakening significantly.\n\nThe Fed began raising interest rates in March 2022 to combat inflation but stopped doing so last fall. The Fed has said it remains focused on getting inflation back to its 2% target, but it also needs to fulfill its dual mandate, which includes full employment. The Fed has used higher interest rates as a tool to cool the economy when it believes it is warming too quickly, but it is often a controversial tool because of the risks it poses to the labor market. In June, the Fed's most popular measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditures price index, rose 0.1% and has risen 2.5% over the past 12 months.\n\nEconomists say the economy is healthy, but that could change quickly. Many have advised the Fed to remain cautious about that risk by cutting rates quickly and sharply. While inflation has hurt families, high interest rates have also hurt the housing market, where homeownership remains out of reach for many and rents have risen due to increased demand in the rental market. Rising interest rates have also been a source of frustration for families because they have increased the cost of borrowing, economists told States Newsroom.\n\nThe consequence of extremely high interest rates for a very long period of time is that the labor market starts to crack. That's what high interest rates are supposed to do, said Dr. Rakeen Mabud, chief economist at the progressive think tank Groundwork Collaborative. \"No one knows exactly when that crack will open up and turn into a giant chasm, and I hope we don't get to that point. But I think the longer the Fed keeps rates high, the more they're playing with people's lives.\"\n\nMabud added that she doesn't see how the root causes of inflation will be addressed by the Fed keeping rates where they are, as she attributes them to factors outside the Fed's control, including supply chain issues, a shift in demand due to the pandemic and companies that have used their market power and inflation to drive up prices.\n\nEconomists have been paying particular attention to the unemployment rate because the Sahm rule, a measure of whether the country is entering a recession, was triggered by the current unemployment rate. The Sahm rule applies when the unemployment rate increases by certain percentage points compared with previous employment data. July's unemployment rate entered the territory that economists say triggers the rule. Still, there may be reasons not to panic just yet.\n\nGould said that in the case of this report, it is essential to understand that the unemployment rate can increase because people who were not counted as part of the labor force, because they were not actively looking for work, return to it and are included in the group of unemployed people.\n\nPeople are optimistic about their job prospects. They are returning to the job market or entering it for the first time to try to find a job. Many of them didn't find a job in July, but they are satisfied, Gould said.\n\nJesse Rothstein, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of California, Berkeley, said it may be time for the Fed to adjust its policy and put its foot back on the economic accelerator.\n\n\"This is a type of easing that we have never seen before,\" he said. \"It's not as rapid as when we go into a recession, despite the Sahm rule being triggered. We've been aiming for a soft landing and I think the Fed has done a very good job of that so far, but a soft landing requires frequent small adjustments.\"\n\nThe labor market showed encouraging signs in the fight against inflation. Wages rose 3.6% from a year ago. That's the weakest economists have seen in two years, Gould said, suggesting there aren't any inflationary pressures on wages that the Fed should be concerned about in this report. The news for workers isn't all bad, either.\n\n\"We can be happy about the slowdown in nominal wage growth because inflation has come down faster and real wages have continued to rise. If you look at the standard of living of workers, even though we are seeing a slowdown, the standard of living has been rising and has been for over a year on average because inflation has come down much faster,\" she said.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centre-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Policy_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic Policy Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_consumption_expenditures_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal consumption expenditures price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Full employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Berkeley"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2164058797-scaled-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

What the stock market collapse means and what the Fed fears most", "body": "The American economy is too financialized to withstand any sustained drop in asset prices\n\nIt's carnage out there in the markets, and things have been moving with the force of a tsunami.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 plunged more than 12% on Monday in what was the biggest single-day drop since 'Black Monday' in 1987. As of this writing, the Dow has dropped some 900 points, while the Nasdaq has cratered 3% in what has turned out to be a global market rout.\n\nThe triggers for the selloff are clear enough and have been well covered in the financial media. Friday's disappointing US jobs report ignited fears of a US recession. The once-hot but overly leveraged and overhyped AI trade has gone sour, which has led to a bloodbath for tech stocks.\n\nLargely responsible for the latter development is the breaking of the massive dollar-yen carry trade - where investors were borrowing cheaply in yen and investing in higher-yielding US assets. This can be thought of roughly as a big interest-rate arbitrage: Borrow at low rates and lend (invest) at higher rates. But when the Bank of Japan raised rates on July 31 and, perhaps even more importantly, signaled more hikes to come, a massive capitulation in these carry-trade positions ensued. This has reverberated through markets and led to a lot of margin calls. And since investors often have to sell other assets to meet margin calls, it creates even more selling pressure.\n\nPredicting where markets may be headed in the coming days and weeks is a hazardous endeavor that I won't venture. Many investors are of course trying to catch the proverbial 'falling knife' - meaning buying in during or immediately after a sharp selloff. A number of analysts are already saying that the panic is overblown and things will soon stabilize. If I had high conviction about how things will shape up over the short term, I would simply trade the market, not write about it.\n\nSo instead of shooting in the dark with a forecast, let's figure out how to think about what's going on. And it's always good to step back a bit and try to find the bird's eye view in the midst of turmoil. First, there's the obvious: This is really a fairly classic instance of a positioning unwind rather than a response to an economic shock. A lot of equity investors got in too deep chasing the bubble in tech stocks - and a lot of these unfortunate folks were borrowing cheaply in Japanese yen to do so (see above about the carry trade). There are a lot of margin calls going on, a lot of forced liquidations on leveraged positions - and probably a lot of wives securing the windows in the high rises.\n\nAssuming this doesn't blow over quickly, what's really important to look at is how the market's perception of the Federal Reserve's next steps evolves - and then what those steps turn out to be. This is not so much because the Fed is omnipotent, but because this is where the chaos of the moment intersects with some of the deep and structural features of the US economy.\n\nThe Fed kept interest rates on hold at its July meeting while hinting strongly at a rate cut in September. Many analysts believe the US central bank has waited too long to bring rates back down after the series of post-pandemic hikes aimed at cooling inflation. Market expectations of upcoming interest rate cuts had been moving sharply higher even prior to recent events.\n\nHowever, the market meltdown has propelled this conversation into overdrive. If as recently as last Wednesday futures tied to the federal funds rate were showing an 87% chance of a 25 basis-point cut - the smallest possible move - in September, investors are now pricing in about 55 basis points of easing at September's meeting and 100 basis points by November's. In other words, the market sees about a 20% chance of an emergency rate cut.\n\nCan Friday's downbeat employment report really be that much of a game-changer for the US economy? It certainly moved the needle but it can hardly explain such a radical shift. What is really behind such pricing - not to mention calls for an emergency cut - is a belief that the Fed needs to step in and rescue the markets.\n\nThis speaks volumes about how the Fed is perceived to have, in addition to its official mandate of price stability and full employment, an unspoken mandate of market stability. This hidden third mandate even has a name: the 'Fed put'.\n\nIn finance, a 'put' is a contract that gives its owner the right to sell something - such as a stock, bond, or commodity - at a predetermined price, regardless of the market price. Think of it as a guarantee - no matter how far the market has fallen, you can unload your asset for the set price.\n\nBut the term has come to be used in a more general sense. Applied to the Fed, it means that there is a belief that whenever the economy or markets turn south, the Fed will swoop in and cut interest rates or print money to provide a boost. Such a policy is, of course, officially denied, but many investors think that there is a floor underneath markets, just as there is for an asset with a 'put' option. This has been an important source of what may seem like unfounded and never-wavering confidence in the US stock market that has prevailed with few exceptions since the late 1990s.\n\nThe Fed has, in fact, shown time and again that it is ready to intervene in various ways - directly or opaquely - whenever the stability of financial markets is threatened.\n\nThe entire narrative we have been seeing around the Fed over the last 48 hours speaks to a sturdy belief that some version of the 'Fed put' remains in place. While the Fed is unlikely to actually go so far as to summon an emergency meeting to cut rates - doing so would be an overt display of panic - it will very likely aggressively talk markets down from the precipice by all but promising hefty rate cuts for the remainder of the year. And if things really get out of hand in markets, a more forceful intervention is nearly guaranteed.\n\nSo let's take this a step further and try to understand what really underlies this invisible commitment to markets. Is this just banal corruption on the part of stock-holding Fed committee members? No. That's not how it works.\n\nWhat really underlies this is that the Fed is simply responding to a deep structural distortion of the economy that is in plain view but often insufficiently appreciated. The US economy is so financialized and so leveraged, and so many Americans (particularly the elite classes) are so dependent on the prices of financial assets for their wealth that a sustained and long-term drop in markets would simply be catastrophic. If a large part of GDP is connected, one way or another, to asset prices, movements in markets take on an importance far beyond the fortunes of Wall Street players.\n\nTo find a rather remarkable illustration of this, look no further than the extent to which even the tax base is dependent on financial markets. The year 2023 was a pretty good one for the economy, whether judged by the labor market or growth figures. Nevertheless, total receipts of the federal government were down about 7% from 2022. How is that possible in a year in which not only did the economy grow but personal income actually increased? The answer: Individual income tax receipts actually dropped despite rising incomes because capital gains realizations from the previous year were lower (capital gains realizations are merely the profits on investments sold). The reason for the decline in capital gains is that in 2022 US stocks had their worst year since 2008.\n\nMarket instability is therefore the one thing the Fed - and the powers that be in Washington and New York - fear most. They will entertain any manner of short-term thinking, introduce any moral hazard, and inflate and reinflate any bubble to keep the markets humming. If the price of this is inflation or even more perverse distortions in the economy, then so be it.\n\nMeanwhile, stocks have been a critical weapon in the arsenal of America's wealthier classes for countering the effects of inflation. Whereas people on fixed incomes or those whose wage increases are not keeping up with price growth are watching their purchasing power erode, the investment class is able to beat inflation through high asset prices. What's a 10% increase at the grocery store if your portfolio is up 20%? This goes a long way toward explaining the increasing bifurcation in the American economy between the haves and the have-nots.\n\nWhatever may come of the current volatility, there are good reasons to believe that the apocalypse is not nigh. When the bill for all the can-kicking and bubble-inflating finally does come due, it almost certainly won't be as a stock-market collapse. Stock markets, after all, can always be reinflated through money printing, and it's hard to imagine the Fed standing aside while markets spiral into oblivion. Markets, which represent the interests of the class of privileged people who benefit from rising asset prices, want easy money to continue climbing. And such people tend to get what they want for longer than any logic would dictate they should.\n\nIn nominal terms, stock markets can go up indefinitely, with the occasional hiccups smoothed out by more liquidity. The question simply becomes - at what cost? Will there still be a functioning bond market? Where will inflation be?

The jobs report made the American economy look like it could be on rockier footing than previously thought and sparked bets that the Federal Reserve might have to cut interest rates sooner and more aggressively.\n\nBut economists say the stock slide is not a surefire sign that a recession is ahead. The current sell-off, they say, is the result of investors having to untangle complicated, heavily leveraged trades that have artificially boosted stock values.\n\nWorld stock indexes on Tuesday showed signs of recovery.\n\nAlthough there's a chance the turbulence could lead to a self-fulfilling economic slowdown, analysts and economists say it's too soon to panic. The economy, by most measures, is still in solid shape. Americans are continuing to spend, the service sector is growing, and the stock market remains up for the year, not too far off the all-time highs it set recently.\n\n\"This is not the recession train; it's just a good old-fashioned market panic,\" said Joe Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US. \"This is not a D.C.-inspired event, about a slowing job market or the Fed being behind the curve. It's about a larger regime change, where investors are adjusting to the end of easy money globally.\"\n\nJapan for years kept interest rates negative, making it attractive to borrow money against the yen to invest in higher-yielding assets such as tech stocks. But the Bank of Japan last week raised interest rates to 0.25 percent and suggested that it would continue, causing the yen's value to spike against the dollar and sending ripples through the global economy. Most immediately, that led to a sell-off of tech and artificial intelligence stocks, including darlings such as Apple and Nvidia, which some investors had been buying up using the proceeds of trades in cheap yen. Analysts have repeatedly warned about bloated valuations well before the Japanese move.\n\n\"Investors have gotten so used to the stock market only going one way that now people are suddenly realizing, 'Oh, stocks can also go down?' \" said Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. \"This is a situation where one weak data point - Friday's jobs numbers - brought the bears out of hibernation.\"\n\nFresh data on Friday showed U.S. employers added 114,000 jobs in July, far fewer than expected. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose to 4.3 percent, its highest level in almost three years, raising urgent questions about whether the Fed was keeping undue pressure on the economy by keeping interest rates at a 23-year high.\n\nThe central bank last week left borrowing costs unchanged, saying it needed more proof that inflation was reliably under control. Many expected the Fed to begin cutting rates at its next meeting in September.\n\nBut lackluster jobs data, combined with the global rout, quickly changed the picture. By Monday morning's sell-off, critics were not only concerned that the Fed would have to ramp up the size of its September rate cut but also wondering whether the bank might trigger an emergency move before then.\n\nThe bar for that kind of intervention is high: The last time Fed officials changed rates between official policy meetings was at the start of the pandemic, when the economy was in free fall. Plus, the constant refrain from central bankers is that they don't react to a single data point or sudden jolt to the market. Rather, they are supposed to look through little ticks up or down and give enough time for the data to tell a comprehensive story.\n\nOn CNBC on Monday morning, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said the central bank's role was to help the job market, keep prices stable and maintain financial stability. So far, the economy has been able to not only withstand the Fed's inflation fight but stay strong overall, the stock slide notwithstanding.\n\n\"We're forward-looking about it,\" Goolsbee said. \"So if the conditions collectively start coming in like that on the through line, there's deterioration on any of those parts, we're going to fix it.\"\n\nEither way, the Fed is now expected to roll back borrowing costs multiple times before the end of the year. Goldman Sachs predicts three cuts - one each at meetings in September, November and December. Although the investment bank recently raised its odds for a recession - to a 25 percent chance in the next year, up from 15 percent - its economists note \"the data look fine overall and we do not see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nThe view that the market panic was disconnected from the economy was broadly shared among many Democratic policymakers and at least some Biden administration officials. They pointed to a series of reasons to doubt the latest report as a signal of a deteriorating economy, particularly the relatively high percentage of Americans who are still working.\n\nThe administration has been silent on the Wall Street panic. So far, none of President Biden's top surrogates on the economy - Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen, White House National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard, or White House Council of Economic Advisers chair Jared Bernstein - had publicly addressed the market sell-off as of Monday afternoon, although experts say that is likely to change in coming days should the decline continue.\n\n\"A couple days of alarming market developments are not going to necessarily fundamentally change the economic message from the Biden administration or the Harris campaign,\" said Tobin Marcus, head of U.S. policy and politics at Wolfe Research and an economic policy staffer to Biden as vice president during the Obama administration. \"But if the situation gets much, much worse in the coming days, they'll have to respond to it directly.\"\n\nRepublicans bashed Biden and Vice President Harris, the Democratic nominee in November's election, as markets slid. \"This is the Harris-Biden economy at work,\" the Republican National Committee posted on X. Former president Donald Trump declared a \"KAMALA CRASH\" on Truth Social, the social media site he owns.\n\nSome White House allies on Capitol Hill and elsewhere have expressed frustration that the Federal Reserve had not cut interest rates yet. The White House has been careful not to criticize the Fed or urge it to cut interest rates out of a desire to avoid even the appearance of interfering with its independence, despite the sentiment among many administration officials that the central bank should have moved earlier. Biden has sought to draw a contrast with Trump, who as president demonstrated a lack of regard for the bank's independence and repeatedly called on Powell to cut rates. Some liberal lawmakers have argued the White House has been too deferential to the Fed, but it's unclear whether that will change even after the market sell-off.\n\nThere was also encouraging news Monday that eased some fears that this wave of financial frenzy will spiral into something worse. New data showed that the service sector - which makes up the largest part of the economy - picked up in July, thanks to new orders and increased hiring, according to an index from the Institute for Supply Management.\n\n\"The services expansion is extremely important and should assuage fears that the labor market is quickly deteriorating,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial.\n\nStill, she and others caution that tanking global markets could set off a chain reaction that leads consumers and businesses to suddenly pull back, further slowing the economy.\n\n\"The underlying economy is still okay,\" Krosby said. \"But this has a feel of, 'Sell now, ask questions later.'\"", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"},

That was triggered by Friday's data.\n\nWhile Wall Street's three main indexes suffered another day of pain -- with the Nasdaq down more than three percent -- a forecast-beating read on the key US services sector provided a little solace for investors.\n\nTokyo's Nikkei, which tanked more than 12 percent Monday and suffered a record points loss, jumped around 10.5 percent in the morning before paring some of those gains.\n\nToyota was up more than 10 percent, Sony piled on more than seven percent, while chip giant Tokyo Electron added 12.26 percent.\n\n\"This is a sweeping, across-the-board gain,\" said analysts at Nomura, adding that investors will also pay close attention to the forex market.\n\nNomura expects the Nikkei to end with the biggest-ever gain, beating 2,676.55 points in October 1990.\n\n\"If movements continue as they started, the Nikkei ended yesterday with the biggest loss and will end today by renewing the biggest point gain,\" it said.\n\nHong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Taipei and Manila also rose but Singapore and Wellington suffered more selling.\n\nFriday's data has fanned calls for the Fed to cut rates now to support the economy, with Nobel prize-winning US economist Paul Krugman writing on social media: \"I wasn't calling for an inter-meeting cut, because that might signal panic.\n\n\"But since we may be seeing a panic anyway, that argument loses its force. Real case for an emergency cut soon.\"\n\nBut Chicago Fed boss Austan Goolsbee urged caution about reading too much into one jobs report.\n\n\"As you see jobs numbers come in weaker than expected but not looking yet like recession, I do think you want to be forward-looking of where the economy is headed,\" he told CNBC ahead of the US trading day Monday.\n\n\"The payroll jobs number is plus or minus 100,000 a month, so be a little careful over-concluding about things in the margin of error,\" he said, adding that if the US economy deteriorated, the Fed would \"fix it\".\n\nPantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note to clients that the Fed \"probably will place little weight on the drop in stock prices, as the main indexes still are higher than at the start of the year\".\n\nFed chief Jerome Powell said after the bank's policy meeting last week that a cut could come as soon as September.\n\nWhile bets had been for a 25-basis-point reduction -- with at least one more before January -- they have risen sharply and investors are now eyeing at least 100-basis-points-worth of cuts by the end of the year.\n\nOn currency markets, the yen's rally ran out of puff and was sitting just below 145 per dollar, having hit a six-month high around 142 Monday.\n\nThe Japanese unit has surged over the past month -- having hit a nearly four-decade low at the start of July -- after the Bank of Japan hiked interest rates on the same day Powell indicated the Fed was planning to loosen policy.\n\nBut analysts at Moody's Analytics wrote: \"Asia's equity selloff will cause sleepless nights at the Bank of Japan. For the past two years, the central bank had been playing it safe, wary of repeating the mistake of tightening policy right into a downturn.\n\n\"The last significant rate hikes by the BoJ were in 2006, just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and in 2000, just as the dot.com bubble burst. Both times, the BoJ was forced to reverse course.\n\n\"The BoJ can hardly be blamed for this latest market selloff, so another U-turn is not a foregone conclusion.

That was triggered by Friday's data.\n\nCommentators also said a stronger yen had led investors to unwind their \"carry trades\", in which they borrowed in the cheap Japanese currency to invest in higher-yielding assets, such as equities.\n\nWhile Wall Street's three main indexes suffered another day of pain -- with the Nasdaq down more than three percent -- a forecast-beating read on the key US services sector provided some solace.\n\nTokyo's Nikkei, which tanked more than 12 percent Monday and suffered a record points loss, jumped 10.2 percent.\n\nToyota was up more than 12 percent, Sony piled on more than nine percent and chip giant Tokyo Electron added 16.6 percent.\n\n\"This is a sweeping, across-the-board gain,\" said analysts at Nomura, adding that investors would also pay close attention to the forex market.\n\nJapan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said at a scheduled news conference Tuesday: \"The stock market has been moving again today, and I think it is important to judge this situation calmly.\"\n\n\"We will continue to monitor the situation with a sense of urgency and to carry out economic and fiscal management in close cooperation with the Bank of Japan.\"\n\nShanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Taipei, Mumbai, Bangkok and Manila also rose but Hong Kong gave up early gains to sit marginally in the red.\n\nSingapore and Wellington also suffered more selling.\n\nLondon edged up after shedding around two percent Monday, while Paris and Frankfurt were also higher.\n\nFriday's data sparked calls for the Fed to cut rates now. Nobel prize-winning US economist Paul Krugman wrote on social media: \"I wasn't calling for an inter-meeting cut, because that might signal panic.\n\n\"But since we may be seeing a panic anyway, that argument loses its force. Real case for an emergency cut soon.\"\n\nBut Chicago Fed boss Austan Goolsbee urged caution about reading too much into one jobs report.\n\n\"As you see jobs numbers come in weaker than expected but not looking yet like recession, I do think you want to be forward-looking of where the economy is headed,\" he told CNBC ahead of the US trading day Monday.\n\n\"The payroll jobs number is plus or minus 100,000 a month, so be a little careful over-concluding about things in the margin of error,\" he said, adding that if the US economy deteriorated, the Fed would \"fix it\".\n\nMore from this section 'We won't be intimidated': Somalis protest after Al-Shabaab attack Rodman hails Hayes impact as USA reach Olympic football semis 'I'm still here': Joan Chen plays thwarted immigrant mom in 'Didi'\n\nPantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note to clients that the Fed \"probably will place little weight on the drop in stock prices, as the main indexes still are higher than at the start of the year\".\n\nFed chief Jerome Powell said after the bank's policy meeting last week that a cut could come as soon as September.\n\nBets had been for at least one 25-basis-point reduction before January but talk is now about a possible 100-basis-points-worth of cuts.\n\nThe yen's rally ran out of puff and was sitting just below 145 per dollar, having hit a six-month high below 142 Monday.\n\nThe Japanese unit has surged over the past month -- after hitting a nearly four-decade low in early July -- after the Bank of Japan hiked rates hours before Powell indicated the Fed was planning a cut.\n\nMoody's Analytics analysts wrote: \"Asia's equity selloff will cause sleepless nights at the Bank of Japan. For the past two years, the central bank had been playing it safe, wary of repeating the mistake of tightening policy right into a downturn.\n\n\"The last significant rate hikes by the BoJ were in 2006, just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and in 2000, just as the dot.com bubble burst. Both times, the BoJ was forced to reverse course.\n\n\"The BoJ can hardly be blamed for this latest market selloff, so another U-turn is not a foregone conclusion.

What is in the data?", "body": "(Aug 6): An unexpectedly weak US employment report, featuring a post-pandemic high in the jobless rate, has rekindled worries a recession may be in the offing that would dash the Federal Reserve's hoped-for soft landing for the economy.\n\nWith stock markets reeling on the premise the Fed has now kept interest rates too high for too long, a Goldilocks outcome narrative that had persisted for months has suddenly been overrun by angry bears.\n\nSo just what is the state of play in the US economy? It is rare that any one data point captures all that is at play, but here is a look at a clutch of indicators - some still favorable to ongoing growth and no recession, others perhaps not.\n\nMost recessions occur because overall economic output, also known as gross domestic product, falls notably. That has not happened and does not look like it will imminently.\n\nGrowth in the second quarter came in at 2.8% on an annualized basis, double the rate of the first quarter, exactly the average of the last six quarters, and on par with the average growth rate over the three years before the pandemic.\n\nWhile the mix of growth is changing, one measure that Fed Chair Jerome Powell tracks as a gauge of underlying private-sector demand - final sales to private domestic purchasers - held at 2.6% in the second quarter. Again that is right on its average of the last year and a half and matches the run rate up to the pandemic.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management's closely watched services activity index climbed back into expansion territory and measures of new orders and employment both rebounded.\n\nA rival measure of services activity, accounting for two-thirds of US economic activity, from S&P Global held near the highest in more than two years in July.\n\n\"The July ... surveys are indicative of the economy continuing to grow at the start of the third quarter at a rate comparable to GDP rising at a solid annualized 2.2% pace,\" according to Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nThe reason interest rates remain so high is that inflation surged in 2021 and 2022 and has been slower to fall than it was to rise. The year began with an unexpected upturn in inflation that gave the Fed pause about pivoting to rate cuts.\n\nMore recent data, though, show it coming closer to the Fed's targeted 2% level, which should allow rate cuts to begin soon. The question many investors have is did the Fed wait too long to shift its focus from inflation to jobs.\n\nUS employers have slowed hiring, adding an average of about 170,000 jobs each month for the last three months, and just 114,000 in July, versus 267,000 a month in the first quarter of 2024, and 251,000 last year.\n\nMeanwhile the unemployment rate rose in July for a fourth straight month, to 4.3%, nearly a full percentage-point above its January 2023 low and the highest since October 2021.\n\nOnce the unemployment rate heads upward with that kind of momentum, it does not typically stabilize until the Fed cuts interest rates.\n\nThe historical relationship between a rise in the unemployment rate and an economic downturn is captured by the so-called Sahm rule that says a recession is underway when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises half a percentage point above its low from the previous 12 months.\n\nTo date, the rule has never been wrong.\n\nClaudia Sahm, the economist who defined the rule that bears her name, told Bloomberg TV on Monday she believes the economy is probably not currently in a recession, but \"we are getting uncomfortably close.\"\n\nThe US household debt delinquency rate rose to 3.2% in the first quarter versus 3.1% in the final three months of last year, according to the New York Fed. That is well below the 4.7% seen at the end of 2019, just before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBut New York Fed researchers also found among credit-card borrowers who have reached their borrowing limits - this group tends to be disproportionately younger and lower-income - delinquency rates have risen dramatically.\n\nAnalysts say strains felt by low-income households can ripple through the economy. The New York Fed releases second-quarter data on Tuesday.\n\nIncoming reports on the economy have tended to fall short of economists' forecasts in the last several months, with Friday's weak employment data only the latest example.\n\nCitigroup's \"Surprise Index\" has only been around for about two decades, so it does not have an established track record for being predictive of recessions, but it can say a lot about the change in investors' faith in the Fed being able to deliver the soft landing for the economy.\n\nThe 2020 pandemic recession triggered an all-out response from fiscal and monetary authorities, with the Fed slashing interest rates to zero and buying trillions of dollars in bonds to ease financial conditions, and Congress and two successive presidential administrations pushing through trillions of dollars of spending to bolster consumers and businesses.\n\nThis time around would likely look quite different, and not just because the recession, if that is what this turns out to be, looks far smaller than the massive hole blown in the US and world economy by the COVID-19 shutdowns.\n\nThe Fed's policy rate is currently in the 5.25%-5.5% range, giving it much more room to cut borrowing costs than it had in March 2020, when the benchmark rate was in the 1.50%-1.75% range.\n\nAnd on the fiscal side, high US government debt levels could prevent a robust stimulative response from the current or next presidential administration.", "source": {"uri": "theedgemalaysia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Edge Malaysia"}, "authors": [],

The jobs report made the American economy look like it could be on rockier footing than previously thought and sparked bets that the Federal Reserve might have to cut interest rates sooner and more aggressively.\n\nBut economists say the stock slide is not a surefire sign that a recession is ahead. The current sell-off, they say, is the result of investors having to untangle complicated, heavily leveraged trades that have artificially boosted stock values.\n\nAll three major stock indexes fell Monday, the Nasdaq composite by 3.4%, the S&P 500 by 3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average by 2.6%, as investors moved money out of equities and into bonds. Global markets had also reeled, with Japan's Nikkei 225 plunging 12%, its largest one-day drop in almost 40 years, after an interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan last week.\n\nAlthough there's a chance the turbulence could lead to a self-fulfilling economic slowdown, analysts and economists say it's too soon to panic. The economy, by most measures, is still in solid shape. Americans are continuing to spend, the service sector is growing, and the stock market remains up for the year, not too far off the all-time highs it set recently.\n\n\"This is not the recession train; it's just a good old-fashioned market panic,\" said Joe Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US. \"This is not a D.C.-inspired event, about a slowing job market or the Fed being behind the curve. It's about a larger regime change, where investors are adjusting to the end of easy money globally.\"\n\nJapan for years kept interest rates negative, making it attractive to borrow money against the yen to invest in higher-yielding assets such as tech stocks. But the Bank of Japan last week raised interest rates to 0.25% and suggested that it would continue, causing the yen's value to spike against the dollar and sending ripples through the global economy. Most immediately, that led to a sell-off of tech and artificial intelligence stocks, including darlings such as Apple and Nvidia, which some investors had been buying up using the proceeds of trades in cheap yen. Analysts have repeatedly warned about bloated valuations well before the Japanese move.\n\n\"Investors have gotten so used to the stock market only going one way that now people are suddenly realizing, 'Oh, stocks can also go down?' \" said Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. \"This is a situation where one weak data point -- Friday's jobs numbers -- brought the bears out of hibernation.\"\n\nFresh data on Friday showed U.S. employers added 114,000 jobs in July, far fewer than expected. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose to 4.3%, its highest level in almost three years, raising urgent questions about whether the Fed was keeping undue pressure on the economy by keeping interest rates at a 23-year high.\n\nThe central bank last week left borrowing costs unchanged, saying it needed more proof that inflation was reliably under control. Many expected the Fed to begin cutting rates at its next meeting in September.\n\nBut lackluster jobs data, combined with the global rout, quickly changed the picture. By Monday morning's sell-off, critics were not only concerned that the Fed would have to ramp up the size of its September rate cut but also wondering whether the bank might trigger an emergency move before then.\n\nThe bar for that kind of intervention is high: The last time Fed officials changed rates between official policy meetings was at the start of the pandemic, when the economy was in free fall. Plus, the constant refrain from central bankers is that they don't react to a single data point or sudden jolt to the market. Rather, they are supposed to look through little ticks up or down and give enough time for the data to tell a comprehensive story.\n\nOn CNBC on Monday morning, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said the central bank's role was to help the job market, keep prices stable and maintain financial stability. So far, the economy has been able to not only withstand the Fed's inflation fight but stay strong overall, the stock slide notwithstanding.\n\n\"We're forward-looking about it,\" Goolsbee said. \"So if the conditions collectively start coming in like that on the through line, there's deterioration on any of those parts, we're going to fix it.\"\n\nEither way, the Fed is now expected to roll back borrowing costs multiple times before the end of the year. Goldman Sachs predicts three cuts -- one each at meetings in September, November and December. Although the investment bank recently raised its odds for a recession -- to a 25% chance in the next year, up from 15% -- its economists note \"the data look fine overall and we do not see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nThe view that the market panic was disconnected from the economy was broadly shared among many Democratic policymakers and at least some Biden administration officials. They pointed to a series of reasons to doubt the latest report as a signal of a deteriorating economy, particularly the relatively high percentage of Americans who are still working.\n\nThe administration has been silent on the Wall Street panic. So far, none of President Joe Biden's top surrogates on the economy -- Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen, White House National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard, or White House Council of Economic Advisers chair Jared Bernstein -- had publicly addressed the market sell-off as of Monday afternoon, although experts say that is likely to change in coming days should the decline continue.\n\n\"A couple days of alarming market developments are not going to necessarily fundamentally change the economic message from the Biden administration or the Harris campaign,\" said Tobin Marcus, head of U.S. policy and politics at Wolfe Research and an economic policy staffer to Biden as vice president during the Obama administration. \"But if the situation gets much, much worse in the coming days, they'll have to respond to it directly.\"\n\nRepublicans bashed Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee in November's election, as markets slid. \"This is the Harris-Biden economy at work,\" the Republican National Committee posted on X. Former president Donald Trump declared a \"KAMALA CRASH\" on Truth Social, the social media site he owns.\n\nSome White House allies on Capitol Hill and elsewhere have expressed frustration that the Federal Reserve had not cut interest rates yet. The White House has been careful not to criticize the Fed or urge it to cut interest rates out of a desire to avoid even the appearance of interfering with its independence, despite the sentiment among many administration officials that the central bank should have moved earlier.\n\nBiden has sought to draw a contrast with Trump, who as president demonstrated a lack of regard for the bank's independence and repeatedly called on Powell to cut rates. Some liberal lawmakers have argued the White House has been too deferential to the Fed, but it's unclear whether that will change even after the market sell-off.\n\nThere was also encouraging news Monday that eased some fears that this wave of financial frenzy will spiral into something worse. New data showed that the service sector -- which makes up the largest part of the economy -- picked up in July, thanks to new orders and increased hiring, according to an index from the Institute for Supply Management.\n\n\"The services expansion is extremely important and should assuage fears that the labor market is quickly deteriorating,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial.\n\nStill, she and others caution that tanking global markets could set off a chain reaction that leads consumers and businesses to suddenly pull back, further slowing the economy.\n\n\"The underlying economy is still OK,\" Krosby said. \"But this has a feel of, 'Sell now, ask questions later.'\"", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"},

However, a worse-than-expected U.S. jobs report coupled with various macroeconomic factors in recent days has led some to call for an emergency rate cut.\n\nU.S. indices were down about 2.4% at publication time, while bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was down more than 8%. The decline in the cryptocurrency market cap over the past 24 hours is the largest daily downturn since January 2022.\n\nJeremey Siegel on Monday called on the Fed to make an emergency 75 basis-point cut in the federal funds rate and another 75 bps cut in September. The professor emeritus of finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business and Wisdom Tree chief economist told CNBC that the fed funds rate right now should be between 3.5% and 4%.\n\n\"If they are going to be as slow on the way down as they were on the way up, which, by the way, was the first policy error in 50 years, then we're not in for a good time with this economy,\" Siegel said.\n\nThe deVere Group's Nigel Green called for a 25-basis point cut right now to avoid a recession. In a note, he said the Fed \"needs to take action now...or there could be legitimate and far-reaching risks of a hard landing.\"\n\nBitwise CIO Matt Hougan sees a more measured approach and said an emergency cut is unlikely.\n\n\"Powell is pretty measured, and the timing around the election makes an emergency anything seem unlikely,\" Hougan told The Block. \"But we'll probably see 50bps in September and 100bps+ by year-end. We're entering a new cycle of global liquidity, same as the last cycle.\"\n\nHougan also recalled March 12, 2020, the date of the COVID-inspired market crash that saw the Dow fall 2,400 points while the price of bitcoin plummeted nearly 40%.\n\n\"But guess what, that turned out to be a historic buying opportunity. Bitcoin BTC -5.81% rallied more than 1,000% in the next year, as central banks did what they do and printed their way out of the crisis,\" Hougan said, noting this looks more like an opportunity than cause to panic.\n\nLast Friday, the 12 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds logged outflows of $237.45 million, their biggest single-day of outflows since May 1 ($563.77 million).\n\nThe GMCI 30, which represents a selection of the top 30 cryptocurrencies, is down 9.6% to 102.98 over the past 24 hours. That's the index's lowest level since early February.\n\n\"The Fed stands ready to implement policy to achieve its dual mandate of price stability and full employment,\" Brian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto market maker GSR, told The Block in an email. \"As such, should it determine that current policy is restrictive and undertake an emergency inter-meeting rate cut, that would be a positive for risk assets, including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Not only would it demonstrate that the Fed's willingness to act, but also Bitcoin's price has shown a strong positive correlation with global liquidity since its inception.\"", "source": {"uri": "theblock.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Block"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_shubnell@theblock.co", "name": "Jason Shubnell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_investment_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief investment officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wharton_School", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wharton School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Correlation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_maker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market maker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Full employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_stability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price stability"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.tbstat.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=webp,q=75/wp/uploads/2022/07/20220727_Federal_Reserve_Building.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-12", "textStart": 1970, "textEnd": 1984}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-01", "textStart": 2535, "textEnd": 2540}], "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

That is, their blood sugar is sufficiently elevated to put them at risk of Type 2 diabetes, even though they aren't yet showing any symptoms. The good news is that they can greatly reduce that risk by losing weight, improving their diet and getting more exercise. But they need to take action quickly to avoid serious health problems.\n\nNo, this isn't a medical advice column. But I found myself thinking about medical analogies when looking at recent economic data. The United States probably (probably) hasn't entered a recession yet. But the economy is definitely looking pre-recessionary. And policymakers - right now basically meaning the Federal Reserve - need to move quickly to head off the risks of serious economic deterioration.\n\nIt's clear that the Fed made a mistake by not cutting rates last week; indeed, it probably should have begun cutting months ago. Unfortunately, we can't turn back the clock. But the Fed's open market committee, which sets short-term interest rates, can and should make a substantial cut - probably half a percentage point, rather than its usual quarter-point - at its next meeting, scheduled for mid-September.\n\nAnd we can only hope that the recent plunge in long-term interest rates, which reflects expectations of future Fed cuts, will be enough to avert a gratuitous economic slump.\n\nWhy do I say that the economy looks pre-recessionary? The most important factor is the unemployment rate, which has been gradually trending up over the past few months. Friday's employment report triggered the Sahm rule, which says that a sufficiently large rise in the unemployment rate is a strong indication that a recession has started. Many economists, including Claudia Sahm, who devised the rule, believe that for a variety of technical reasons things may not be as dire as they look. But even so, the situation is worrisome.\n\nIt's not just the official data. Private surveys and general buzz also point to a softening economy. The appraisal of the labor market by consumers surveyed by the Conference Board has deteriorated, Amazon has warned that consumers seem cautious, and so on. None of this screams recession, but it does point to a rising risk of a near-future recession.\n\nAm I 100% sure that we'll have a recession unless the Fed moves quickly to cut rates? Of course not - nothing is certain in economics, or in life more generally. But policymakers who wait for perfect certainty before acting will always move too late.\n\nSo how did we get to this point? The Fed increased interest rates a lot in response to the 2021-22 surge in inflation. I didn't oppose that move; I don't think the Fed had a choice, given the perceived risk that inflation might become entrenched in the economy the way it did in the 1970s.\n\nBy the second half of 2023, however, it was clear that fears of a return to that '70s show were misplaced; inflation was coming down steadily without the years of high unemployment some economists wrongly claimed would be necessary.\n\nBut the Fed didn't respond to falling inflation by cutting interest rates, seemingly unwilling to act until it was sure inflation was back to target. (Another example of how waiting for perfect certainty guarantees that you'll move too late.) To some extent, the Fed may have been the victim of a statistical head-fake: Official numbers showed rising monthly inflation in early 2024, but as I wrote at the time, this looked more like noise in the data rather than anything that really happened.\n\nBeyond that, however, it's hard to escape the sense that the Fed has to some extent been paralyzed by inflation PTSD. Having faced harsh criticism for moving too slowly to raise rates when inflation began rising a few years ago, it may have compensated by failing to cut rates when inflation began to fall. For a long time, our economy held up remarkably well despite very high interest rates; now the cracks are starting to show.\n\nWhat's especially galling about the current situation is that we may be about to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. As of right now, America has basically achieved what many economists had considered impossible: a soft landing, in which we managed to get inflation way down without high unemployment. But we are increasingly at risk of experiencing a lot of unnecessary pain simply because the pilot waited too long to pull up the plane's nose.\n\nOne more thing: If the Fed cuts rates in September, it will probably face a firestorm of criticism from Republicans accusing it of trying to help Kamala Harris defeat Donald Trump in the presidential election. And yes, a rate cut would probably help Democrats, largely because it would help drive home how successful America has been in bringing inflation under control.\n\nBut politics shouldn't, and I hope won't, affect the Fed's decision. For the fact is that the economic case for major rate cuts is overwhelming; the Fed would be acting politically if it didn't respond to that economic case simply because the election is looming.", "source": {"uri": "spokesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Spokesman Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Type 2 diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sugar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Sahm", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Claudia Sahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noise pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 70}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

The Shanghai is down almost 2%. The Korean exchange is down 9%. And Japanese stocks just suffered their largest daily loss - ever - with the Nikkei 225 index down 12%.\n\nHere in the U.S., despite having risen off their lows at the opening bell, the three major indexes are deeply in the red. The Nasdaq leads the way, down almost 4%.\n\nThe VIX - commonly known as the market's fear gauge - surged to 53 this morning. It hasn't been this high since the early days of the Covid Pandemic in March 2020.\n\nWhat's behind all this?\n\nFears that the Federal Reserve has blown it once again, and the U.S. is headed for a recession.\n\nWith this as our intro, let's turn to legendary investor Louis Navellier in his Flash Alert podcast from Growth Investor this past Friday:\n\nYou know, folks, I can't fix stupid.\n\nSomeone on the Fed, they're not thinking right. They're not looking at the data, and it's sad.\n\nSometimes the bigger the group, the lower the IQ. And they really screwed up, and that's why the market is reacting so violently.\n\nIf somehow you missed the fireworks that began last Friday, it was a bloodbath.\n\nThe S&P had its worst decline since 2022. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq officially slipped into a correction, meaning \"down 10% from its most recent peak.\" And the rotation into small caps fizzled with the Russell 2000 tanking 3.6%.\n\nBut rather than a rebound here on Monday, the markets are selling off even more violently.\n\nAs noted earlier, the catalyst for the collapse was Friday's unemployment rate that jumped to 4.3%. This stoked fears that the Fed has already gone too far with its restrictive interest rate policy and might have unintentionally tipped the economy into a recession.\n\nAs we pointed out in Friday's Digest, the Fed's June SEP projection showed a forecast of a 4.2% unemployment rate at the end of 2025. So, the fact that we're already at 4.3% suggests the Fed is not just off again, but off by an embarrassing margin.\n\nWith this in mind, let's return to Louis and his Friday podcast:\n\nThe biggest news, by far, is what's happened to treasury bond yields.\n\nThe two-year Treasury note has hit an intraday low of 3.86%. The 10-year bond hit an intraday low of 3.8%.\n\nThe yield curve is almost entirely un-inverted. And rates are so low that the Fed has to cut five times now - five quarter-point cuts.\n\nObviously, [the Fed] is going to be cutting rates on September 18th. But they really should cut 50 [basis points], to be candid with you.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the 10-year Treasury yield has fallen even farther since then. As I write, it's at 3.75%.\n\nSecond Louis's call for a 50-basis point cut is echoed by an increasing number of market participants. If we look at the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, we see that the probability that the Fed cuts rates by 50 basis points in September has exploded to 92.50%.\n\nFor context, on Thursday, before the unemployment report, those odds were just 22%.\n\nAnd if we look farther out, the FedWatch Tool puts majority odds on five quarter-point cuts by December, just as Louis suggests.\n\nBack to Louis:\n\nIt's a mess. It really is a mess. The economy has been neglected, and it's showing up in the data now.\n\nI know the Fed wants to get to their 2% inflation target but they're there already... They have to quit waiting for a one-year average.\n\nThe purpose of rate cuts is to ease monetary conditions, making lending easier, which helps fuel economic growth.\n\nIn a perfect world, central banks are ahead of the curve, preemptively using interest rate policy to influence economic growth in an efficient, positive way.\n\nBut many times, due to the lag effect in between when interest rates are changed and when those changes show up in the economy, central banks find themselves behind the curve. So, their policy changes are all too often reactions to troubling data rather than proactive measures to prevent painful market conditions.\n\nAs we look around the world today, where are the interest rate policies of other central banks? How are their economies? And what does that suggest for the U.S. by comparison?\n\nWell, as to interest rate cuts, here's The Wall Street Journal:\n\nThe Swiss National Bank kicked off the policy-easing cycle in the developed world in March. The European Central Bank followed with a rate cut in June. Central banks in Sweden and Canada have also cut rates in recent months.\n\nWe can now throw The Bank of England into the mix. Last Thursday, it cut its key interest rate for the first time in over four years.\n\nAnd let's not forget China. Two weeks ago, China's central bank cut both major short- and long-term interest rates.\n\nMeanwhile, Japan has raised rates. But it's in a unique situation where the raise was a deliberate (and somewhat panicked) effort to stop the slide of the yen against the dollar.\n\nSo, the world is already ahead of the U.S. in a shift in policy.\n\nHowever, even with this head start, it might not be enough for some of these other countries to stave off recession.\n\nLast week's data revealed that Europe's mild recession ended with the first quarter of 2024. Two back-to-back gross domestic product (GDP) declines of -0.1% in the third and fourth quarters of 2023 were followed by growth of +0.3% in the first quarter...\n\nAfter five quarters of economic stagnation following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the European Central Bank's (ECB) acceleration of the monetary tightening due to the related surge in energy prices, Europe's economic growth is expected to continue over the coming quarters, according to the consensus of 50 economists tracked by Bloomberg.\n\nBut there's growing risk of a double-dip recession thanks to the Europe's largest economy - Germany.\n\nHere's Semfor from last week:\n\nThe eurozone economy grew by 0.3% in the second quarter, slightly exceeding economists' predictions, but Germany revealed it is tipping toward a recession.\n\nGrowing gross domestic product -- the total value of goods and services -- in Spain, France, and Ireland helped offset a 0.1% decline in Germany, Europe's biggest economy but lately its problem child.\n\nThe eurozone entered a technical recession in the second half of 2023, and while analysts said that the latest figures suggest it is healing, it's still unclear how long the recovery will last.\n\n\"The question remains where the economy will head from here and recent data do not provide much confidence that the eurozone economy is further accelerating,\" wrote one economist.\n\nThe risk is that Germany's recession will spread to the rest of Europe.\n\nIf many central banks have already cut rates and yet they're still at risk of a recession, that's troubling for the U.S., that hasn't begun cutting rates yet.\n\nAnd now, the Fed is in a bind. Clearly, they need to cut rates, but if they do so in between FOMC meetings, then they risk appearing panicked themselves, thus triggering a massive market rout. But if they wait another full month, that's just added interest rate restriction weighing on the economy.\n\nHere's Louis's take:\n\nIf our Fed waits until September 18th to cut rates, they're not even late to the party, it's like showing up to the party after it's over. Because, by then, Canada will have already cut twice, Britain will have cut twice, and the European Central Bank will have cut twice.\n\nSo, for us to be so slow to cut is irresponsible...\n\nI'm very frustrated that the Fed did not take the advice of Bill Dudley, the former New York Fed President who demanded a cut on Wednesday.\n\nWell, Louis is right - we're in for rate cuts. The only questions are \"how many?\" and \"how fast?\".\n\nBut is it already too late?\n\nWhereas Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell sounded upbeat and confident about the labor force, inflation, and interest rates last Wednesday in his press conference - almost stepping into \"victory lap\" territory - things have suddenly reversed.\n\nThe Fed appears on its heels, playing defense against a tidal wave of economic weakness that already looks beyond its control. Meanwhile, the selloff that began last Friday and is extending as I write Monday is Wall Street's attempt to get out of the way before a larger crash materializes.\n\nThis reminds us of the old market adage that's sad but true...\n\nBull markets don't die of old age, they're killed by the Federal Reserve.\n\nFor all we know, this is just a pullback (albeit a violent one) in an overheated market before stocks close out the year on a high note - possibly, thanks to a Fed that's about to unleash the mother of all doves.\n\nBut we don't know that. So, we must find the right balance between defense and offense.\n\nFrom defensive orientation, mind your stop-losses and don't let fear influence your market decisions. And as Louis notes in his podcast update, only sell on \"up\" days, and be careful not to get fleeced on ETF bid/ask spreads.\n\nFrom an offensive orientation, begin looking at your \"wish list\" stocks. You don't have to rush into them - we don't know how deep or long this selloff will last. But keep your eyes open. We might find ourselves enjoying some fantastic buying opportunities in the coming days/weeks.\n\nAlso, as we've highlighted many times, trading is a fantastic way to capitalize on heightened volatility.\n\nIn recent Digests, we've featured the trading approaches of Jonathan Rose at Masters in Trading Live, and Tom Gentile's Money Calendar. Markets like this are when their systems can generate enormous returns - sometimes even within just a day or two.\n\nThere's also Luke Lango's system in Breakout Trader, which uses price trends and volume to identify stocks that appear to be entering a period of accelerated price gains. Luke just put together a research video explaining how it works. You can watch it for free, right here.\n\nHere's Luke explaining more about the video:\n\nI lay out the whole backstory of how I developed this system, the powerful data analytics behind my entire approach, as well as why I think it could be a game-changer for anyone who wants to identify breakout stocks.\n\nSo, whether you're looking to trade this market in the short term or find buy-and-hold opportunities for the long term, keep your eyes open for great bargains. After all, though Louis is correct when he says you \"can't fix stupid,\" we can profit from it.", "source": {"uri": "investorplace.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InvestorPlace"}, "authors":

That was triggered by Friday's data.\n\nWhile Wall Street's three main indexes suffered another day of pain - with the Nasdaq down more than three per cent - a forecast-beating read on the key US services sector provided a little solace for investors.\n\nTokyo's Nikkei, which tanked more than 12 per cent on Monday and suffered a record points loss, jumped around 10.5 per cent in the morning before paring some of those gains.\n\nToyota was up more than 10 per cent, Sony piled on more than seven per cent, while chip giant Tokyo Electron added 12.26 per cent.\n\n\"This is a sweeping, across-the-board gain,\" said analysts at Nomura, adding that investors will also pay close attention to the forex market.\n\nNomura expects the Nikkei to end with the biggest-ever gain, beating 2,676.55 points in October 1990.\n\n\"If movements continue as they started, the Nikkei ended yesterday with the biggest loss and will end today by renewing the biggest point gain,\" it said.\n\nHong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Taipei and Manila also rose but Singapore and Wellington suffered more selling.\n\nFriday's data has fanned calls for the Fed to cut rates now to support the economy, with Nobel prize-winning US economist Paul Krugman writing on social media: \"I wasn't calling for an inter-meeting cut, because that might signal panic.\n\n\"But since we may be seeing a panic anyway, that argument loses its force. Real case for an emergency cut soon.\"\n\nBut Chicago Fed boss Austan Goolsbee urged caution about reading too much into one jobs report.\n\n\"As you see jobs numbers come in weaker than expected but not looking yet like recession, I do think you want to be forward-looking of where the economy is headed,\" he told CNBC ahead of the US trading day on Monday.\n\n\"The payroll jobs number is plus or minus 100,000 a month, so be a little careful over-concluding about things in the margin of error,\" he said, adding that if the US economy deteriorated, the Fed would \"fix it\".\n\nPantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note to clients that the Fed \"probably will place little weight on the drop in stock prices, as the main indexes still are higher than at the start of the year\".\n\nFed chief Jerome Powell said after the bank's policy meeting last week that a cut could come as soon as September.\n\nWhile bets had been for a 25-basis-point reduction - with at least one more before January - they have risen sharply and investors are now eyeing at least 100-basis-points-worth of cuts by the end of the year.\n\nOn currency markets, the yen's rally ran out of puff and was sitting just below 145 per dollar, having hit a six-month high around 142 on Monday.\n\nThe Japanese unit has surged over the past month - having hit a nearly four-decade low at the start of July - after the Bank of Japan hiked interest rates on the same day Powell indicated the Fed was planning to loosen policy.\n\nBut analysts at Moody's Analytics wrote: \"Asia's equity selloff will cause sleepless nights at the Bank of Japan. For the past two years, the central bank had been playing it safe, wary of repeating the mistake of tightening policy right into a downturn.\n\n\"The last significant rate hikes by the BoJ were in 2006, just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and in 2000, just as the dot.com bubble burst. Both times, the BoJ was forced to reverse course.\n\n\"The BoJ can hardly be blamed for this latest market selloff, so another U-turn is not a foregone conclusion. But the selloff doesn't make last week's rate hike - which was already on shaky ground - look any better.

Last month's rise in the unemployment rate has set off new worries about the threat of a recession\n\nThe global financial markets are in turmoil, reflecting a sudden fear that the Federal Reserve may have kept its key interest rate too high for too long, thereby increasing the risk of a US recession.\n\nEconomists and Wall Street traders now anticipate the Fed to slash its benchmark rate, which impacts borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, much quicker than they predicted just a week ago. Chair Jerome Powell has frequently emphasised that the Fed could swiftly reduce rates if it deems it necessary to boost the economy.\n\nHowever, the recurring fear of an impending recession has been a characteristic of the post-pandemic economy - and has been proven incorrect each time. Instead, against most analysts' predictions, steady economic growth and a robust pace of hiring have persisted. Historically, the US economy would often flash warning signs when it was in or near a recession.\n\nBut these red lights have malfunctioned since the COVID-19 pandemic hit and disrupted normal business activity. The latest warning sign was Friday's July jobs report from the Labor Department, which revealed that the unemployment rate increased from 4.1% to 4.3% - still a relatively low level but the highest rate in nearly three years.\n\nMarkets panicked after the report was released, partly because it triggered the so-called Sahm Rule. Stocks took another tumble on Monday, following a plunge in share prices overseas. The Dow Jones index plummeted more than 1,030 points, or 2.6%.\n\nThe Sahm Rule, named after former Fed economist Claudia Sahm, has historically indicated that a recession is underway when the three-month average unemployment rate rises by half a percentage point from its low of the previous year. This rule, in place since 1970, is based on the idea that unemployment can create a domino effect: as more people lose their jobs, they reduce their spending, which then impacts other businesses, leading to a halt in hiring or even job cuts.\n\nHowever, the Sahm Rule could potentially be another false alarm in predicting a recession. Even Sahm herself isn't convinced that a recession is looming. Typically, the rule is activated when companies begin to cut jobs, resulting in an increase in the unemployment rate.\n\nHowever, the current rise in unemployment is not due to job cuts, but rather an influx of people into the job market who haven't immediately found work. Jay Bryson, chief economist at Wells Fargo, believes that the risk of recession has increased with the rising unemployment rate. However, he remains optimistic about the economy's resilience.\n\n\"The good news here,\" he stated, \"is that there haven't been any major shocks hitting the economy,\" such as a sudden surge in oil prices or a housing crash. \"Absent a shock, it's a bit more challenging to get into a recession.\"\n\nOther previously reliable recession indicators have failed in the post-pandemic era, including:\n\n- A bond market measure known as the \"inverted yield curve.''- The rule of thumb that two consecutive quarters of shrinking economic output amount to a \".\n\n- The general guideline is that two consecutive quarters of shrinking economic output equate to a \"technical recession.''\".\n\nLast week, Powell acknowledged the Sahm Rule and its implications but noted that other recession indicators, such as changes in bond yields, haven't materialised in recent years. \"This pandemic era has been one in which so many apparent rules have been flouted,\" he stated at a press conference. \"Many received pieces of received wisdom just haven't worked, and it's because the situation really is unusual or unique.\"\n\nPowell's comments came after the central bank maintained its key rate but hinted at a potential reduction as early as the next policy meeting in September. Financial markets and most economists now predict the Fed will end up cutting rates fairly quickly this year, partly to counteract economic weakness.\n\nBryson anticipates half-point cuts in the Fed's benchmark rate in September and November and an additional quarter-point cut in December. This is significantly quicker than Wells Fargo's previous prediction of just two quarter-point rate cuts this year, in September and December.\n\nSome analysts have suggested that the Fed could lower its rate at an emergency meeting before September. However, most economists are sceptical that officials would take such a step unless there were further signs of economic weakness.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle noted in a report: \"Historically, the (Fed) has only delivered inter-meeting cuts ... when there was a clear negative shock or when the data were worse than they have been so far.\"\n\nFor four years, economists have grappled with understanding an economy that was initially shut down by the COVID-19 pandemic, then bounced back with such vigour that it reignited inflationary pressures that had been dormant for four decades. When the Fed began to control inflation by aggressively increasing rates from March 2022, economists almost unanimously predicted that the higher borrowing costs would trigger a recession.\n\nHowever, this recession never materialised. The central bank increased its rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023, leading to the occurrence of the \"inverted yield curve\". An inverted yield curve happens when the interest rate on shorter-term Treasury bonds, like two-year notes, rises above the rate on a longer-term bond, such as the 10-year Treasury.\n\nThis occurred in July 2022, and yields remained inverted until Monday, when the 2-year briefly fell below the 10-year yield. Usually, longer-term bonds offer higher yields to reward investors for tying up their money for a longer period. However, when shorter-term bonds start yielding higher returns, it typically indicates that markets expect the Fed to increase its short-term rate and maintain it at a high level to suppress inflation or cool the economy.\n\nSuch measures often result in a recession. According to Deutsche Bank, an inverted yield curve has preceded each of the last 10 recessions, typically by about one to two years. However, there was a false signal in 1967 when an inversion occurred but no downturn followed.\n\nTiffany Wilding, an economist and managing director at bond giant PIMCO, suggests that the reason it hasn't worked this time is due to the government's massive financial aid packages, which totalled approximately $5trillion in 2020 and 2021. This enriched both consumers and businesses, allowing them to spend and invest without borrowing as much, thus reducing the impact of the Fed's rate hikes and weakening the signal from the inverted yield curve.\n\nIn 2022, the government also reported that the gross domestic product - the economy's output of goods and services - had fallen for two consecutive quarters, a long-standing rule of thumb often associated with a recession.\n\nWhile the headline economic figures did indicate that economic output was falling, another measure in the GDP report told a different story: When volatile items such as inventories, government spending and imports were removed, it showed that the underlying economy continued to expand at a healthy rate.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lawrence_matheson@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lawrence Matheson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_yield_curve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inverted yield curve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Output_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Output (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big-box_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big-box store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secaucus,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secaucus, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Secaucus, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domino effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIMCO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PIMCO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/money/article33403790.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_economy-recession-signals.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Chair Jerome Powell has often stressed that the Fed could quickly lower rates if it decides that it's needed to bolster the economy.\n\nYet the periodic fear of a forthcoming recession has been a hallmark of the post-pandemic economy -- and has proved wrong every time. Instead, contrary to what most analysts have predicted, steady economic growth and a solid pace of hiring have endured.\n\nIn the past, the U.S. economy would often flash telltale signals when it was in or near a recession. But those red lights have gone haywire since the COVID-19 pandemic struck and upended normal business activity.\n\nThe latest red flag was Friday's July jobs report from the Labor Department, which showed that the unemployment rate rose from 4.1% to 4.3% -- still a relatively low level but the highest rate in nearly three years.

The logic behind the rule is that unemployment can be self-sustaining: As more people lose jobs, they cut back their spending, harming other companies, which then stop hiring or even cut workers.\n\nYet the Sahm Rule could be yet another recession signal that turns out to be a false alarm. Sahm herself doubts that a recession is imminent.\n\nThe rule is typically triggered when companies start cutting jobs, thereby raising the unemployment rate. Yet now, unemployment has been rising not because companies are slashing jobs but because so many people have poured into the job market. Not all of them have found work right away.\n\nJay Bryson, chief economist at Wells Fargo, thinks the risk of recession has risen along with the unemployment rate. But he ultimately thinks the economy will pull through.\n\n\"The good news here,\" he said, \"is that there haven't been any major shocks hitting the economy,\" such as a spike in oil prices or a housing bust. \"Absent a shock, it's a bit more challenging to get into a recession.\"\n\nOther previously notable recession indicators that have flopped in the post-pandemic era include:\n\n-- A bond market measure with a dry-as-dust label: The \"inverted yield curve.''\n\n-- The rule of thumb that two consecutive quarters of shrinking economic output amount to a \"technical recession.''\n\nLast week, Powell said that while he was aware of the Sahm Rule and its implications, other recession signals, such as changes in bond yields, haven't been borne out in recent years.\n\n\"This pandemic era has been one in which so many apparent rules have been flouted,\" he said at a news conference. \"Many received pieces of received wisdom just haven't worked, and it's because the situation really is unusual or unique.\"\n\nPowell spoke after the central bank kept its key rate unchanged but signaled that it could reduce the rate as soon as the next policy meeting in September.\n\nFinancial markets and most economists now think the Fed will end up cutting rates fairly quickly this year, in part to offset economic weakness.\n\nBryson expects half-point cuts in the Fed's benchmark rate in September and November and an additional quarter-point cut in December.

When the Fed moved to tame inflation by aggressively raising rates starting in March 2022, economists almost uniformly predicted that the higher borrowing costs would cause a recession.\n\nIt never came.\n\nThe central bank raised its rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023, and the phenomenon known as the \"inverted yield curve\" soon followed. An inverted yield curve occurs when the interest rate on shorter-term Treasury bonds, such two-year notes, rises above the rate on a longer-term bond, such as the 10-year Treasury. That happened in July 2022, and yields remained inverted until Monday, when the 2-year briefly fell below the 10-year yield.\n\nTypically, longer-term bonds have higher yields to compensate investors for locking up their money for an extended period of time. When shorter-term bonds start paying out higher yields instead, it usually occurs because markets expect the Fed to crank up its short-term rate and keep it high to quell inflation or cool the economy. Such steps often lead to a recession.\n\nAn inverted yield curve has preceded each of the last 10 recessions, according to Deutsche Bank, usually by about one to two years. It did provide one false signal in 1967, when an inversion occurred but no downturn followed.\n\nTiffany Wilding, an economist and managing director at bond giant PIMCO, says one reason it hasn't worked this time is that the government's huge financial assistance packages, totaling roughly $5 trillion in 2020 and 2021, enriched consumers and business alike. As a result, they have been able to spend and invest without borrowing as much, muting the impact of the Fed's rate hikes and dulling the signal from the inverted yield curve.\n\nAlso in 2022, the government reported that gross domestic product -- the economy's output of goods and services -- had fallen for two straight quarters, a longtime rule of thumb that has often accompanied a recession.\n\nThe top-line economic numbers did show that economic output was falling. But another measure in the GDP report told a different story: Stripping out volatile items such as inventories, government spending and imports, it showed that the underlying economy continued to expand at a healthy pace.", "source": {"uri": "gorgenewscenter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "gorgenewscenter.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_yield_curve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inverted yield curve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Sahm", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claudia Sahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Output_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Output (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goods and services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIMCO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PIMCO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

The jobs report made the American economy look like it could be on rockier footing than previously thought and sparked bets that the Federal Reserve might have to cut interest rates sooner and more aggressively.\n\nSubscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.\n\nBut economists say the stock slide is not a surefire sign that a recession is ahead. The current sell-off, they say, is the result of investors having to untangle complicated, heavily leveraged trades that have artificially boosted stock values.\n\nAll three major stock indexes fell Monday, the Nasdaq Composite by 3.4 percent, the S&P 500 by 3 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average by 2.6 percent, as investors moved money out of equities and into bonds. Global markets had also reeled, with Japan's Nikkei 225 plunging 12 percent, its largest one-day drop in almost 40 years, after an interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan last week.\n\nAlthough there's a chance the turbulence could lead to a self-fulfilling economic slowdown, analysts and economists say it's too soon to panic. The economy, by most measures, is still in solid shape. Americans are continuing to spend, the service sector is growing, and the stock market remains up for the year, not too far off the all-time highs it set recently.\n\n\"This is not the recession train; it's just a good old-fashioned market panic,\" said Joe Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US. \"This is not a D.C.-inspired event, about a slowing job market or the Fed being behind the curve. It's about a larger regime change, where investors are adjusting to the end of easy money globally.\"\n\nJapan for years kept interest rates negative, making it attractive to borrow money against the yen to invest in higher-yielding assets such as tech stocks. But the Bank of Japan last week raised interest rates to 0.25 percent and suggested that it would continue, causing the yen's value to spike against the dollar and sending ripples through the global economy. Most immediately, that led to a sell-off of tech and artificial intelligence stocks, including darlings such as Apple and Nvidia, which some investors had been buying up using the proceeds of trades in cheap yen. Analysts have repeatedly warned about bloated valuations well before the Japanese move.\n\n\"Investors have gotten so used to the stock market only going one way that now people are suddenly realizing, 'Oh, stocks can also go down?' \" said Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. \"This is a situation where one weak data point - Friday's jobs numbers - brought the bears out of hibernation.\"\n\nFresh data on Friday showed U.S. employers added 114,000 jobs in July, far fewer than expected. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose to 4.3 percent, its highest level in almost three years, raising urgent questions about whether the Fed was keeping undue pressure on the economy by keeping interest rates at a 23-year high.\n\nThe central bank last week left borrowing costs unchanged, saying it needed more proof that inflation was reliably under control. Many expected the Fed to begin cutting rates at its next meeting in September.\n\nBut lackluster jobs data, combined with the global rout, quickly changed the picture. By Monday morning's sell-off, critics were not only concerned that the Fed would have to ramp up the size of its September rate cut but also wondering whether the bank might trigger an emergency move before then.\n\nThe bar for that kind of intervention is high: The last time Fed officials changed rates between official policy meetings was at the start of the pandemic, when the economy was in free fall. Plus, the constant refrain from central bankers is that they don't react to a single data point or sudden jolt to the market. Rather, they are supposed to look through little ticks up or down and give enough time for the data to tell a comprehensive story.\n\nOn CNBC on Monday morning, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said the central bank's role was to help the job market, keep prices stable and maintain financial stability. So far, the economy has been able to not only withstand the Fed's inflation fight but stay strong overall, the stock slide notwithstanding.\n\n\"We're forward-looking about it,\" Goolsbee said. \"So if the conditions collectively start coming in like that on the through line, there's deterioration on any of those parts, we're going to fix it.\"\n\nEither way, the Fed is now expected to roll back borrowing costs multiple times before the end of the year. Goldman Sachs predicts three cuts - one each at meetings in September, November and December. Although the investment bank recently raised its odds for a recession - to a 25 percent chance in the next year, up from 15 percent - its economists note \"the data look fine overall and we do not see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nThe view that the market panic was disconnected from the economy was broadly shared among many Democratic policymakers and at least some Biden administration officials. They pointed to a series of reasons to doubt the latest report as a signal of a deteriorating economy, particularly the relatively high percentage of Americans who are still working.\n\nThe administration has been silent on the Wall Street panic. So far, none of President Biden's top surrogates on the economy - Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen, White House National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard, or White House Council of Economic Advisers chair Jared Bernstein - had publicly addressed the market sell-off as of Monday afternoon, although experts say that is likely to change in coming days should the decline continue.\n\n\"A couple days of alarming market developments are not going to necessarily fundamentally change the economic message from the Biden administration or the Harris campaign,\" said Tobin Marcus, head of U.S. policy and politics at Wolfe Research and an economic policy staffer to Biden as vice president during the Obama administration. \"But if the situation gets much, much worse in the coming days, they'll have to respond to it directly.\"\n\nRepublicans bashed Biden and Vice President Harris, the Democratic nominee in November's election, as markets slid. \"This is the Harris-Biden economy at work,\" the Republican National Committee posted on X. Former president Donald Trump declared a \"KAMALA CRASH\" on Truth Social, the social media site he owns.\n\nSome White House allies on Capitol Hill and elsewhere have expressed frustration that the Federal Reserve had not cut interest rates yet. The White House has been careful not to criticize the Fed or urge it to cut interest rates out of a desire to avoid even the appearance of interfering with its independence, despite the sentiment among many administration officials that the central bank should have moved earlier. Biden has sought to draw a contrast with Trump, who as president demonstrated a lack of regard for the bank's independence and repeatedly called on Powell to cut rates. Some liberal lawmakers have argued the White House has been too deferential to the Fed, but it's unclear whether that will change even after the market sell-off.\n\nThere was also encouraging news Monday that eased some fears that this wave of financial frenzy will spiral into something worse. New data showed that the service sector - which makes up the largest part of the economy - picked up in July, thanks to new orders and increased hiring, according to an index from the Institute for Supply Management.\n\n\"The services expansion is extremely important and should assuage fears that the labor market is quickly deteriorating,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial.\n\nStill, she and others caution that tanking global markets could set off a chain reaction that leads consumers and businesses to suddenly pull back, further slowing the economy.\n\n\"The underlying economy is still okay,\" Krosby said. \"But this has a feel of, 'Sell now, ask questions later.'\"\n\nhttps://washingtonpost.com/documents/88e131bf-aa10-4989-a973-7fb0c9d4b765.pdf\n\nhttps://washingtonpost.com/documents/4c26e08a-13ee-456e-b780-737e622bc267.pdf\n\nRelated Content\n\nHow this city turned its scorching heat into a tourism draw\n\nA gold at age 55, a gold at age 27, and a momentous day for women Olympians", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

What the stock market collapse means and what the Fed fears most  --  RT Business News", "body": "By Henry Johnston, a Moscow-based RT editor who worked in finance for over a decade\n\nIt's carnage out there in the markets, and things have been moving with the force of a tsunami.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 plunged more than 12% on Monday in what was the biggest single-day drop since 'Black Monday' in 1987. As of this writing, the Dow has dropped some 900 points, while the Nasdaq has cratered 3% in what has turned out to be a global market rout.\n\nThe triggers for the selloff are clear enough and have been well covered in the financial media. Friday's disappointing US jobs report ignited fears of a US recession. The once-hot but overly leveraged and overhyped AI trade has gone sour, which has led to a bloodbath for tech stocks.\n\nLargely responsible for the latter development is the breaking of the massive dollar-yen carry trade - where investors were borrowing cheaply in yen and investing in higher-yielding US assets. This can be thought of roughly as a big interest-rate arbitrage: Borrow at low rates and lend (invest) at higher rates. But when the Bank of Japan raised rates on July 31 and, perhaps even more importantly, signaled more hikes to come, a massive capitulation in these carry-trade positions ensued. This has reverberated through markets and led to a lot of margin calls. And since investors often have to sell other assets to meet margin calls, it creates even more selling pressure.\n\nPredicting where markets may be headed in the coming days and weeks is a hazardous endeavor that I won't venture. Many investors are of course trying to catch the proverbial 'falling knife' - meaning buying in during or immediately after a sharp selloff. A number of analysts are already saying that the panic is overblown and things will soon stabilize. If I had high conviction about how things will shape up over the short term, I would simply trade the market, not write about it.\n\nSo instead of shooting in the dark with a forecast, let's figure out how to think about what's going on. And it's always good to step back a bit and try to find the bird's eye view in the midst of turmoil. First, there's the obvious: This is really a fairly classic instance of a positioning unwind rather than a response to an economic shock. A lot of equity investors got in too deep chasing the bubble in tech stocks - and a lot of these unfortunate folks were borrowing cheaply in Japanese yen to do so (see above about the carry trade). There are a lot of margin calls going on, a lot of forced liquidations on leveraged positions - and probably a lot of wives securing the windows in the high rises.\n\nAssuming this doesn't blow over quickly, what's really important to look at is how the market's perception of the Federal Reserve's next steps evolves - and then what those steps turn out to be. This is not so much because the Fed is omnipotent, but because this is where the chaos of the moment intersects with some of the deep and structural features of the US economy.\n\nThe Fed kept interest rates on hold at its July meeting while hinting strongly at a rate cut in September. Many analysts believed the US central bank has waited too long to bring rates back down after the series of post-pandemic hikes aimed at cooling inflation. Market expectations of upcoming interest rate cuts had been moving sharply higher even prior to recent events.\n\nHowever, the market meltdown has propelled this conversation into overdrive. If as recently as last Wednesday futures tied to the federal funds rate were showing an 87% chance of a 25 basis-point cut - the smallest possible move - in September, investors are now pricing in about 55 basis points of easing at September's meeting and 100 basis points by November's. In other words, the market sees about a 20% chance of an emergency rate cut.\n\nCan Friday's downbeat employment report really be that much of a game-changer for the US economy? It certainly moved the needle but it can hardly explain such a radical shift. What is really behind such pricing - not to mention calls for an emergency cut - is a belief that the Fed needs to step in and rescue the markets.\n\nThis speaks volumes about the how the Fed is perceived to have, in addition to its official mandate of price stability and full employment, an unspoken mandate of market stability. This hidden third mandate even has a name: the 'Fed put'.\n\nIn finance, a 'put' is a contract that gives its owner the right to sell something - such as a stock, bond, or commodity - at a predetermined price, regardless of the market price. Think of it as a guarantee - no matter how far the market has fallen, you can unload your asset for the set price.\n\nBut the term has come to be used in a more general sense. Applied to the Fed, it means that there is a belief that whenever the economy or markets turn south, the Fed will swoop in and cut interest rates or print money to provide a boost. Such a policy is, of course, officially denied, but many investors think that there is a floor underneath markets, just as there is for an asset with a 'put' option. This has been an important source of what may seem like unfounded and never-wavering confidence in the US stock market that has prevailed with few exceptions since the late 1990s.\n\nThe Fed has, in fact, shown time and again that it is ready to intervene in various ways - directly or opaquely - whenever the stability of financial markets is threatened.\n\nThe entire narrative we have been seeing around the Fed over the last 48 hours speaks to a sturdy belief that some version of the 'Fed put' remains in place. While the Fed is unlikely to actually go so far as to summon an emergency meeting to cut rates - doing so would be an overt display of panic - it will very likely aggressively talk markets down from the precipice by all but promising hefty rate cuts for the remainder of the year. And if things really get out of hand in markets, a more forceful intervention is nearly guaranteed.\n\nSo let's take this a step further and try to understand what really underlies this invisible commitment to markets. Is this just banal corruption on the part of stock-holding Fed committee members? No. That's not how it works.\n\nWhat really underlies this is that the Fed is simply responding to a deep structural distortion of the economy that is in plain view but often insufficiently appreciated. The US economy is so financialized and so leveraged, and so many Americans (particularly the elite classes) are so dependent on the prices of financial assets for their wealth that a sustained and long-term drop in markets would simply be catastrophic. If a large part of GDP is connected, one way or another, to asset prices, movements in markets take on an importance far beyond the fortunes of Wall Street players.\n\nTo find a rather remarkable illustration of this, look no further than the extent to which even the tax base is dependent on financial markets. The year 2023 was a pretty good one for the economy, whether judged by the labor market or growth figures. Nevertheless, total receipts of the federal government were down about 7% from 2022. How is that possible in a year in which not only did the economy grow but personal income actually increased? The answer: Individual income tax receipts actually dropped despite rising incomes because capital gains realizations from the previous year were lower (capital gains realizations are merely the profits on investments sold). The reason for the decline in capital gains is that in 2022 US stocks had their worst year since 2008.\n\nMarket instability is therefore the one thing the Fed - and the powers that be in Washington and New York - fear most. They will entertain any manner of short-term thinking, introduce any moral hazard, and inflate and reinflate any bubble to keep the markets humming. If the price of this is inflation or even more perverse distortions in the economy, then so be it.\n\nMeanwhile, stocks have been a critical weapon in the arsenal of America's wealthier classes for countering the effects of inflation. Whereas people on fixed incomes or those whose wage increases are not keeping up with price growth are watching their purchasing power erode, the investment class is able to beat inflation through high asset prices. What's a 10% increase at the grocery store if your portfolio is up 20%? This goes a long way toward explaining the increasing bifurcation in the American economy between the haves and the have-nots.\n\nWhatever may come of the current volatility, there are good reasons to believe that the apocalypse is not nigh. When the bill for all the can-kicking and bubble-inflating finally does come due, it almost certainly won't be as a stock-market collapse. Stock markets, after all, can always be reinflated through money printing, and it's hard to imagine the Fed standing aside while markets spiral into oblivion. Markets, which represent the interests of the class of the privileged people who benefit from rising asset prices, want easy money to continue climbing. And such people tend to get what they want for longer than any logic would dictate they should.\n\nIn nominal terms, stock markets can go up indefinitely, with the occasional hiccups smoothed out by more liquidity. The question simply becomes - at what cost? Will there still be a functioning bond market? Where will inflation be? Will the currency be lugged around in wheelbarrows?\n\nWhat's important to watch in the coming weeks and months is how seriously the Fed takes what is going on in markets and how much the market holds it hostage to act. There won't be statements from the Eccles Building saying markets need to be rescued, but actions always speak louder than words. And how the Fed acts will reveal where its true priorities lie.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Margin (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_(investment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carry (investment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspan_put", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenspan put"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arbitrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikkei 225"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Efficient-market hypothesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital gain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Full employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.08/article/66b1114120302779d907bcc1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 1088, "textEnd": 1095}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

That is, their blood sugar is sufficiently elevated to put them at risk of Type 2 diabetes, even though they aren't yet showing any symptoms. The good news is that they can greatly reduce that risk by losing weight, improving their diet and getting more exercise. But they need to take action quickly to avoid serious health problems.\n\nNo, this isn't a medical advice column. But I found myself thinking about medical analogies when looking at recent economic data. The United States probably (probably) hasn't entered a recession yet. But the economy is definitely looking pre-recessionary. And policymakers -- which right now basically means the Federal Reserve -- need to move quickly to head off the risks of serious economic deterioration.\n\nIt's already clear that the Fed made a mistake by not cutting rates last week; indeed, it probably should have begun cutting months ago. Unfortunately, we can't turn back the clock. But the Fed's open market committee, which sets short-term interest rates, can and should make a substantial cut -- probably half a percentage point, rather than its usual quarter-point -- at its next meeting, scheduled for mid-September.\n\nAnd we can only hope that the recent plunge in long-term interest rates, which reflects expectations of future Fed cuts, will be enough to avert a gratuitous economic slump.\n\nWhy do I say that the economy looks pre-recessionary? The most important factor is the unemployment rate, which has been gradually trending up over the past few months. Friday's employment report triggered the Sahm rule, which says that a sufficiently large rise in the unemployment rate is a strong indication that a recession has started. Many economists, including Claudia Sahm, who devised the rule, believe that for a variety of technical reasons things may not be as dire as they look. But even so, the situation is worrisome.\n\nIt's not just the official data. Private surveys and general buzz also point to a softening economy. The appraisal of the labor market by consumers surveyed by the Conference Board has deteriorated, Amazon has warned that consumers seem cautious, and so on. None of this screams recession, but it does point to a rising risk of a near-future recession.\n\nAm I 100 percent sure that we'll have a recession unless the Fed moves quickly to cut rates? Of course not -- nothing is certain in economics, or in life more generally. But policymakers who wait for perfect certainty before acting will always move too late.\n\nSo how did we get to this point? The Fed increased interest rates a lot in response to the 2021-22 surge in inflation. I didn't oppose that move; I don't think the Fed had a choice, given the perceived risk that inflation might become entrenched in the economy the way it did in the 1970s.\n\nBy the second half of 2023, however, it was clear that fears of a return to that '70s show were misplaced; inflation was coming down steadily without the years of high unemployment some economists wrongly claimed would be necessary.\n\nBut the Fed didn't respond to falling inflation by cutting interest rates, seemingly unwilling to act until it was sure inflation was back to target. (Another example of how waiting for perfect certainty guarantees that you'll move too late.) To some extent, the Fed may have been the victim of a statistical head-fake: Official numbers showed rising monthly inflation in early 2024, but as I wrote at the time, this looked more like noise in the data rather than anything that really happened.\n\nBeyond that, however, it's hard to escape the sense that the Fed has to some extent been paralyzed by inflation PTSD. Having faced harsh criticism for moving too slowly to raise rates when inflation began rising a few years ago, it may have compensated by failing to cut rates when inflation began to fall. For a long time, our economy held up remarkably well despite very high interest rates; now the cracks are starting to show.\n\nWhat's especially galling about the current situation is that we may be about to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. As of right now, America has basically achieved what many economists had considered impossible: a soft landing, in which we managed to get inflation way down without high unemployment. But we are increasingly at risk of experiencing a lot of unnecessary pain simply because the pilot waited too long to pull up the plane's nose.\n\nOne more thing: If the Fed cuts rates in September, it will probably face a firestorm of criticism from Republicans accusing it of trying to help Kamala Harris defeat Donald Trump in the presidential election. And yes, a rate cut would probably help Democrats, largely because it would help drive home how successful America has been in bringing inflation under control.\n\nBut politics shouldn't, and I hope won't, affect the Fed's decision. For the fact is that the economic case for major rate cuts is overwhelming; the Fed would be acting politically if it didn't respond to that economic case simply because the election is looming.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

What is in the data?", "body": "By Ann Saphir and Dan Burns\n\nAug 6 (Reuters) - An unexpectedly weak U.S. employment report, featuring a post-pandemic high in the jobless rate, has rekindled worries a recession may be in the offing that would dash the Federal Reserve's hoped-for soft landing for the economy.\n\nWith stock markets reeling on the premise the Fed has now kept interest rates too high for too long, a Goldilocks outcome narrative that had persisted for months has suddenly been overrun by angry bears.\n\nSo just what is the state of play in the U.S. economy? It is rare that any one data point captures all that is at play, but here is a look at a clutch of indicators - some still favorable to ongoing growth and no recession, others perhaps not.\n\nGROWTH AND DEMAND\n\nMost recessions occur because overall economic output, also known as gross domestic product, falls notably. That has not happened and does not look like it will imminently.\n\nGrowth in the second quarter came in at 2.8% on an annualized basis, double the rate of the first quarter, exactly the average of the last six quarters, and on par with the average growth rate over the three years before the pandemic.\n\nWhile the mix of growth is changing, one measure that Fed Chair Jerome Powell tracks as a gauge of underlying private-sector demand - final sales to private domestic purchasers - held at 2.6% in the second quarter. Again that is right on its average of the last year and a half and matches the run rate up to the pandemic.\n\nSERVICES SECTOR STRENGTH\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management's closely watched services activity index climbed back into expansion territory and measures of new orders and employment both rebounded.\n\nA rival measure of services activity, accounting for two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, from S&amp;P Global held near the highest in more than two years in July.\n\n\"The July ... surveys are indicative of the economy continuing to grow at the start of the third quarter at a rate comparable to GDP rising at a solid annualized 2.2% pace,\" according to Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nINFLATION COOLING\n\nThe reason interest rates remain so high is that inflation surged in 2021 and 2022 and has been slower to fall than it was to rise. The year began with an unexpected upturn in inflation that gave the Fed pause about pivoting to rate cuts.\n\nMore recent data, though, show it coming closer to the Fed's targeted 2% level, which should allow rate cuts to begin soon. The question many investors have is did the Fed wait too long to shift its focus from inflation to jobs.\n\nJOB MARKET SIGNALS RECESSION?\n\nU.S. employers have slowed hiring, adding an average of about 170,000 jobs each month for the last three months, and just 114,000 in July, versus 267,000 a month in the first quarter of 2024, and 251,000 last year.\n\nMeanwhile the unemployment rate rose in July for a fourth straight month, to 4.3%, nearly a full percentage-point above its January 2023 low and the highest since October 2021.\n\nOnce the unemployment rate heads upward with that kind of momentum, it does not typically stabilize until the Fed cuts interest rates.\n\nThe historical relationship between a rise in the unemployment rate and an economic downturn is captured by the so-called Sahm rule that says a recession is underway when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises half a percentage point above its low from the previous 12 months.\n\nTo date, the rule has never been wrong.\n\nClaudia Sahm, the economist who defined the rule that bears her name, told Bloomberg TV on Monday she believes the economy is probably not currently in a recession, but \"we are getting uncomfortably close.\"\n\nDELINQUENCIES ON THE RISE\n\nThe U.S. household debt delinquency rate rose to 3.2% in the first quarter versus 3.1% in the final three months of last year, according to the New York Fed. That is well below the 4.7% seen at the end of 2019, just before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBut New York Fed researchers also found among credit-card borrowers who have reached their borrowing limits - this group tends to be disproportionately younger and lower-income - delinquency rates have risen dramatically.\n\nAnalysts say strains felt by low-income households can ripple through the economy. The New York Fed releases second-quarter data on Tuesday.\n\nDOWNSIDE SURPRISES\n\nIncoming reports on the economy have tended to fall short of economists' forecasts in the last several months, with Friday's weak employment data only the latest example.\n\nCitigroup's \"Surprise Index\" has only been around for about two decades, so it does not have an established track record for being predictive of recessions, but it can say a lot about the change in investors' faith in the Fed being able to deliver the soft landing for the economy.\n\nThe index is near a two-year low.\n\nWHAT CAN BE DONE?\n\nThe 2020 pandemic recession triggered an all-out response from fiscal and monetary authorities, with the Fed slashing interest rates to zero and buying trillions of dollars in bonds to ease financial conditions, and Congress and two successive presidential administrations pushing through trillions of dollars of spending to bolster consumers and businesses.\n\nThis time around would likely look quite different, and not just because the recession, if that is what this turns out to be, looks far smaller than the massive hole blown in the U.S. and world economy by the COVID-19 shutdowns.\n\nThe Fed's policy rate is currently in the 5.25%-5.5% range, giving it much more room to cut borrowing costs than it had in March 2020, when the benchmark rate was in the 1.50%-1.75% range.\n\nAnd on the fiscal side, high U.S. government debt levels could prevent a robust stimulative response from the current or next presidential administration.\n\n(Reporting By Dan Burns and Ann

That was triggered by Friday's data.\n\nWhile Wall Street's three main indexes suffered another day of pain -- with the Nasdaq down more than three percent -- a forecast-beating read on the key US services sector provided a little solace for investors.\n\nTokyo's Nikkei, which tanked more than 12 percent Monday and suffered a record points loss, jumped around 10.5 percent in the morning before paring some of those gains.\n\nToyota was up more than 10 percent, Sony piled on more than seven percent, while chip giant Tokyo Electron added 12.26 percent.\n\n\"This is a sweeping, across-the-board gain,\" said analysts at Nomura, adding that investors will also pay close attention to the forex market.\n\nNomura expects the Nikkei to end with the biggest-ever gain, beating 2,676.55 points in October 1990.\n\n\"If movements continue as they started, the Nikkei ended yesterday with the biggest loss and will end today by renewing the biggest point gain,\" it said.\n\nHong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Taipei and Manila also rose but Singapore and Wellington suffered more selling.\n\nFriday's data has fanned calls for the Fed to cut rates now to support the economy, with Nobel prize-winning US economist Paul Krugman writing on social media: \"I wasn't calling for an inter-meeting cut, because that might signal panic.\n\n\"But since we may be seeing a panic anyway, that argument loses its force. Real case for an emergency cut soon.\"\n\nBut Chicago Fed boss Austan Goolsbee urged caution about reading too much into one jobs report.\n\n\"As you see jobs numbers come in weaker than expected but not looking yet like recession, I do think you want to be forward-looking of where the economy is headed,\" he told CNBC ahead of the US trading day Monday.\n\n\"The payroll jobs number is plus or minus 100,000 a month, so be a little careful over-concluding about things in the margin of error,\" he said, adding that if the US economy deteriorated, the Fed would \"fix it\".\n\nPantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note to clients that the Fed \"probably will place little weight on the drop in stock prices, as the main indexes still are higher than at the start of the year\".\n\nFed chief Jerome Powell said after the bank's policy meeting last week that a cut could come as soon as September.\n\nWhile bets had been for a 25-basis-point reduction -- with at least one more before January -- they have risen sharply and investors are now eyeing at least 100-basis-points-worth of cuts by the end of the year.\n\nOn currency markets, the yen's rally ran out of puff and was sitting just below 145 per dollar, having hit a six-month high around 142 Monday.\n\nThe Japanese unit has surged over the past month -- having hit a nearly four-decade low at the start of July -- after the Bank of Japan hiked interest rates on the same day Powell indicated the Fed was planning to loosen policy.\n\nBut analysts at Moody's Analytics wrote: \"Asia's equity selloff will cause sleepless nights at the Bank of Japan. For the past two years, the central bank had been playing it safe, wary of repeating the mistake of tightening policy right into a downturn.\n\n\"The last significant rate hikes by the BoJ were in 2006, just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and in 2000, just as the dot.com bubble burst. Both times, the BoJ was forced to reverse course.\n\n\"The BoJ can hardly be blamed for this latest market selloff, so another U-turn is not a foregone conclusion. But the selloff doesn't make last week's rate hike -- which was already on shaky ground -- look any better.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate: UP 1.9 percent at $74.32 per barrel", "source": {"uri":

What is it?", "body": "A passerby looks at a electronic stock board showing Japan's Nikkei 225 index at a securities firm in Tokyo. AP\n\nGlobal stock markets have been in panic mode since last week when a weak US jobs report triggered something called \"the Sahm Rule\", a reliable indicator that the economy is in recession.\n\nWhat is the Sahm Rule?\n\nThe indicator is named after its creator, Claudia Sahm, a former Federal Reserve and White House economist. The rule indicates a recession has started when the three-month moving average of the US unemployment rate is 0.5 percentage points or more above its lowest during the previous 12 months.\n\nThe threshold was crossed when US government data showed on Friday (August 2) that the unemployment rate had hit 4.3 per cent, its highest level since October 2021. The Sahm Rule reading reached 0.53 points in July, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n\nFlorian Ielpo, head of macroeconomic research at investment manager Lombard Odier, said the rule was a \"purely empirical\" indicator with \"no theoretical basis\". But the markets \"have clearly drawn the conclusion that there will be a recession\", he added.\n\nInvestors are worried that the US Federal Reserve has waited too long to cut interest rates, which sit at a 23-year high and were raised to tame soaring inflation.\n\nIs the US really entering recession?\n\nDespite the data, even Sahm herself doubts that the US economy is contracting. \"I am not concerned that, at this moment, we are in a recession,\" she told Fortune magazine on Friday.\n\n\"No one should be in panic mode today, though it appears some might be,\" she said, adding that key measures of the economy \"still look really good\". Sahm pointed to growing household income along with resilient consumer spending and business investment.\n\n\"This time really could be different,\" Sahm said. Research group Capital Economics said the rise in the unemployment rate has so far been driven by an expansion in the labour force rather than a fall in employment.\n\n\"This marks a difference from previous cycles,\" the group's chief economist, Neil Shearing, said in a note, adding that \"it is likely that Hurricane Beryl contributed to weakness in July's payrolls figure.\"\n\nChicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC on Monday that job numbers were \"weaker than expected but not looking yet like a recession\".\n\nUS Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell also downplayed the Sahm Rule's impact before the job's report was released last week.\n\n\"A statistical regularity is what I'd call it,\" he told a press conference following the Fed's policy meeting on Wednesday. \"It's not like an economic rule where it's telling you something must happen.\"\n\nEarlier that day, the Fed decided to keep its benchmark interest rate between 5.25 per cent and 5.50 per cent, but Powell signalled that a cut could come in September.\n\nWill the Fed act sooner?\n\nThe triggering of the Sahm Rule may raise pressure on the Fed to cut rates more than expected at its September meeting -- or even act beforehand.\n\nPowell spoke two days before the latest jobs data was published. \"Obviously it is something that will worry the Fed,\" Ielpo said. \"Could the Fed make an unscheduled rate cut? For now, it's not likely,\" he added.\n\nSome analysts now expect the Fed to cut rates by 0.50 percentage points in September, up from previous bets of a 0.25-point cut. The Fed could make such a cut to \"slow down the decline in the markets if it really continues until then\",\" Ielpo said.\n\nDeutsche Bank said markets are now pricing in a total of two percentage points of cuts over the next 12 months, \"which has only really been seen before in a recession\".\n\nCapital Economics economist Shearing, however, said it saw a 0.25-percentage-point reduction at each of its three remaining meetings this year. \"While the jobs report was bad it wasn't that bad,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"},

On Monday, Japanese stocks set the stage with a 12.4% drop, and European stocks fell to a lesser extent, closing 2.2% lower. US markets are tumbling as I write this on Monday, and the VIX volatility index briefly spiked above 60. What prompted this plunge, what should investors do now, and what indicators are we watching next?\n\nThe Fed held rates steady, and US economic data showed weakness\n\nThe US Federal Reserve (Fed) kept interest rates at current levels at its meeting on Wednesday (July 31) and declined to make a firm commitment to cut rates in September -- although it left the door wide open to a rate cut. Markets took the news in stride on Wednesday, only to react negatively on Thursday and even more negatively on Friday in the face of some high-profile earnings misses and data indicating a weakening US economy:\n\nThe Bank of Japan and Bank of England took action\n\nUnlike the Fed, other central banks took action last week.\n\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) made two important monetary policy decisions. First, it raised its key policy rate. Second, it decided to reduce its purchases of long-term Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) by about 400 billion yen every quarter until March 2026 -- which constitutes an implementation of a quantitative tightening (QT) policy. It's important to note that the BOJ will conduct an interim assessment of the purchase plan and may modify the purchase amount if necessary.\n\nSwayed by easing inflation data, the Bank of England (BOE) cut its policy rate by 25 basis points to 5.0%, its first rate cut since the pandemic and the first of this rate cycle. This should be a gradual easing cycle; the market is pricing a total of two rate cuts by the BOE this year. It's important to note that while Consumer Price Index inflation has fallen to the BOE's target of 2%, inflation forecasts from the BOE's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) were revised higher into year end (to 2.7%) to account for base effects of last year's relative decline in energy prices. The BOE notes it expects second-round effects from domestic prices and wages to persist, but there is not a consensus on the duration of this within the members of the MPC.\n\nThe market sell-off: What can investors do now?\n\nThis all brings us to today - August 5. The double-digit drop in Japanese stocks does not come as a complete surprise given that the Japanese yen has strengthened so much. As we noted last week in the wake of the BOJ decision, there is a distinct risk that a strengthening yen will weaken Japanese stocks, as it has done over recent weeks and historically in the last several decades.\n\nOn the other hand, I was surprised to see the VIX even briefly spiked above 60. To me, that suggests an overreaction.\n\nSo what is an investor to do?\n\nFirst and foremost, stay calm. We have to remember that market corrections are not uncommon. They happen in most years and don't tend to come out of nowhere. Our tactical indicator turned defensive at the start of July as growth was below trend and slowing. We're not surprised to see bonds rallying and stocks falling. At midyear, we said we wouldn't be surprised to see a correction (and then a recovery) before the end of the year.\n\nThe question is whether something larger is happening - i.e., a recession. We think markets are overly worried about recession. While we do believe that the Fed has increased recession risks by not cutting in July, we still believe the US job market is in relatively good shape and employers appear reluctant to cut employees. Having said that, markets have had a strong rally this year, suggesting very positive news is priced in, and so it makes sense that we are experiencing a meaningful correction given recent developments: a Fed that is more hawkish than expected, growing instability in the Middle East, some tech earnings disappointment, and increased uncertainty about the US presidential election. And of course markets are thinly traded in August.\n\nBut we also believe there are compelling reasons to be constructive about this sell-off:\n\nReasons for investors to be positive\n\nPositive earnings surprises. Despite some high profile misses, earnings season has been relatively positive. Of the 75% of S&P 500 companies that have reported actual earnings results, 78% of them have reported a positive earnings-per-share (EPS) surprise and 59% of them have reported a positive revenue surprise.\n\nThird-quarter forecasts. More importantly, forecasts for earnings in the third quarter have not been downwardly revised beyond what is typical in the first month of the quarter. The bottom-up EPS estimate for the third quarter (which is an aggregate of median EPS estimates for all the companies in the S&P 500 index) decreased by 1.8% from June 30 to July 31.\n\nThis decline is equal to the 5-year average, the 10-year average, and the 20-year average for S&P 500 companies; in all three of those time periods, earnings estimate were downwardly revised on average by 1.8%. And contributions to earnings growth have been broadening, with forward earnings projections indicating more contribution from non-Magnificent 7 companies.\n\nRecession indicators have not been triggered. We don't think risks of a recession have risen significantly. If you think about the key hallmarks of a recession, they have not been triggered:\n\nFed rate cuts. We think it's virtually a certainty that the Fed will cut rates before the end of the third quarter - and likely again in November and December. There is a growing probability of a 50 basis point rate cut in September and now there is a growing probability the Fed will cut before that meeting. (Markets even briefly anticipated today that the Fed would have to make an emergency cut before that meeting). We note that the July US jobs report also showed a drop in average hourly earnings to 3.6%, indicating a continued reduction in wage inflation which should give the Fed more confidence to begin cutting.\n\nValuations. One key benefit of the sell-off is that valuations, which were admittedly very high, have already gotten more attractive. And there is a very significant amount of cash sitting on sidelines that investors are likely to deploy as bargains appear.\n\nFor those with a time horizon longer than a few months, I think it's important to be patient. Yes, as I forewarned in last week's blog, I believe it was a mistake that the Fed didn't cut rates last week, but I don't believe it will cause irreparable damage to the economy. This sell-off is a very emotional market reaction that is overestimating the potential for recession, in my view. We anticipate rate cuts are on the horizon, and we know the US economy is in relatively good shape.\n\nOur base case is that it is not too late for the Fed to begin to cut. If the Fed does start to ease soon, we believe it will likely be able to avoid a recession, and the US economy would likely experience a re-acceleration in growth in late 2024/early 2025.\n\nOutlook\n\nI wouldn't be surprised to experience a volatile and challenging market environment in coming weeks. However, I still worry that the biggest mistake long-term investors could make is getting spooked and moving out of markets. I have seen this emotional investor reaction occur in significant sell-offs over the years, including the Global Financial Crisis, and it is perhaps the most damaging decision investors can make. Rather, I am optimistic this sell-off could represent an opportunity for those patient investors with a significant overweighting to cash to consider reducing that exposure.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nThe Jackson Hole conference begins in a few weeks. This is an opportunity for Fed policymakers to get closer to a commitment to cut rates - and also to articulate their views on the topic of R-star, which is the real long-term interest rate that is considered to be neutral -- neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is at full employment. I think of this as a very arcane concept - one that can be considered \"very imprecise\" and subject to \"considerable real-time mismeasurement\" - but one that should give us a sense of where the Fed might be headed once it starts cutting rates.", "source": {"uri": "ifamagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IFA Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIX", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "VIX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_tightening", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quantitative tightening"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Japan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Probability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://ifamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Recession.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "dateEnd": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 5015, "textEnd": 5033}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 768, "textEnd": 775}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 2527, "textEnd": 2535}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

The Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded its worst day in nearly two years as concerns over the economy's health sparked a global sell-off.\n\nThe turmoil started in Japan, where the blue-chip Nikkei index experienced its steepest one-day drop, plummeting 12.4%, reminiscent of the Black Monday crash in 1987. This turmoil quickly spread to the U.S., fueled by Friday's alarming jobs report and fears that the Fed was not reducing the high-interest rates quickly enough.\n\nWall Street Rattled\n\nThe Dow tumbled 1,033.99 points, or 2.6%, finishing at 38,703.27. The Nasdaq Composite plummeted 3.4%, ending at 16,200.08, and the S&P 500 dropped 3%, closing at 5,186.33. Both the blue-chip Dow and the S&P 500 recorded their largest daily declines since September 2022.\n\nThe mega-cap Mag 7 -- which includes Tesla, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google-parent Alphabet -- saw a combined market value loss exceeding $650 billion.\n\nWall Street's \"Fear Index\" surged to 65.73 before the market opened, a jump of about 42 points from Friday's close. The VIX later reduced its gains and ended at 38.57, the highest level in nearly four years.\n\nConcerns about a U.S. recession were the primary cause of the global market collapse following Friday's disappointing July jobs report. Investors are also worried that the Federal Reserve is lagging in reducing interest rates to support a slowing economy, as the central bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged at their highest level in two decades last week.\n\n\"There's no doubt that something broke in the markets last week, and it will take some time to fix the damage,\" said Joe Tigay, portfolio manager for Rational Equity Armor Fund.\n\nThe solution many are now advocating for is for Powell to convene an emergency Federal Reserve meeting to promptly cut rates before the scheduled meeting in September.\n\n\"I'm calling for a 75-basis point emergency cut in the Fed funds rate, with another 75-basis point cut indicated for next month at the September meeting,\" Wharton School professor emeritus of finance Jeremy Siegel told CNBC on Monday morning.\n\nThe Fed funds rate has stayed between 5.25% and 5.50% since last July. However, some experts minimized the likelihood of an emergency rate cut occurring.\n\n\"The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth.\n\nTech Stocks Bleed\n\nInvestors continue to sell off megacap tech stocks and the previously popular artificial intelligence sector. Tech shares were among the worst performers on Monday:\n\nNvidia slid 6.4%, bringing its decline from its 52-week high to nearly 29%. Apple plummeted 4.8% after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway halved its stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nOther notable declines included Tesla, which fell 4.2%, and Super Micro Computer, which gave up 2.5%.\n\nIn Asia overnight, Japanese stocks entered a bear market as Asia-Pacific investors reacted to Friday's disappointing U.S. jobs figures. The Nikkei's 12.4% loss, closing at 31,458.42, marked its worst day since the \"Black Monday\" crash of 1987.\n\nThe 4,451.28-point drop was also the largest in points in the index's history. On Black Monday, the Dow fell by over 22% in a single day.\n\nOther global markets were also hit hard:\n\nU.S. Treasury yields fell amid recession fears, as investors sought the safety of bonds. Bond prices move inversely to yields. The benchmark 10-year note yielded 3.78% on Monday, hitting its lowest level since June 2023.\n\nBitcoin tumbled from nearly $62,000 on Friday to around $54,000 on Monday.\n\nEurope's Stoxx 600 fell by 2.2%.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index was at about 38 after peaking at 65, its highest level since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Known as Wall Street's \"fear gauge,\" the VIX index is based on market pricing for options on the S&P 500.\n\nThere is also speculation that the unwinding of the yen \"carry trade\" contributed to the global market decline. After the Bank of Japan raised interest rates last week, narrowing the rate differential between Japan and the U.S., the yen appreciated against the dollar, disrupting a practice where traders borrowed in the cheap currency to invest in other global assets.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times, Singapore Edition"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_ghosh@ibtimes.sg", "name": "R.

It's a question of how soon central bankers will cut and how big they will go.\n\nLast week's ugly economic reports on manufacturing and employment helped trigger a mini-meltdown in the stock market - one that continues today. Instead of a soft landing, the economy may be careening toward recession.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. economy created 114,000 jobs last month versus expectations of 176,000. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate jumped from 4.1% to 4.3%.\n\nThose who are savvy about government statistics know that the real jobs numbers are likely even worse than reported. That's because the total jobs that were reportedly created are estimates derived not from actual counting but from the so-called \"birth-death model.\"\n\nWhen employment growth is declining, this statistical model tends to be well behind the curve in accounting for job losses.\n\nThe official economic reports were still disappointing enough to virtually guarantee a Fed rate cut by September.\n\nBut nervous traders on Wall Street and panicked politicians in Washington, D.C. want central bankers to cut by 50 basis points instead of the forecasted 25 - and to do so before their next scheduled policy meeting in September.\n\nUltra-liberal Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) threw a fit on social media aimed directly at Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\n\"Fed Chair Powell made a serious mistake not cutting interest rates,\" she posted. \"He's been warned over and over again that waiting too long risks driving the economy into a ditch.\"\n\n\"The jobs data is flashing red,\" she continued. \"Powell needs to cancel his summer vacation and cut rates now -- not wait 6 weeks.\"\n\nSenator Warren knows that a small cut in September would be too little too late to change voters' perceptions of the Biden/Harris economy before the election takes place.\n\nIt may not be the smartest political strategy for Democrats to admit that a declining jobs market is raising alarms about the economy. After all, they have been trying to convince voters that Joe Biden's policies have given us strong growth, falling inflation, and low unemployment.\n\nBut now, apparently, the Biden economy is so fragile that it requires an emergency stimulus injection from the Federal Reserve.\n\nWere the Fed to make extraordinary policy moves before the election, it would raise a whole other set of alarms.\n\nEven though Fed policymakers swear up and down that their decisions aren't influenced by political considerations, their decisions can in fact influence political outcomes.\n\nFed officials can claim it's not their intent to sway voter sentiment just as they claim they don't aim to move asset markets. But the very act of rigging interest rates distorts markets and the economy, creating winners and losers of the Fed's choosing.", "source": {"uri": "fxstreet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FXStreet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stimulus (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Macroeconomics/CentralBanks/FED/the-federal-reserve-building-in-washington-dc-usa-67160227_Large.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

The United States is not facing imminent recession. The American economy is still growing. There is no reason to panic.\n\nTrump and his lackeys would like an economic panic because nothing else they've thrown at Kamala Harris is working.\n\nCould Trump's billionaire supporters try to bring on a crash by suddenly withdrawing their assets from the stock and bond markets? That would be difficult to pull off. They couldn't do it without suffering massive losses. And where would they put their assets in the meantime?\n\nIn truth, Fed chair Jerome Powell -- who Trump first appointed in 2018 -- should have begun cutting interest rates at the Fed's last meeting rather than waiting until September.\n\nThe Fed's current 5.3 percent prime rate is too high. The Fed's goal of 2 percent inflation is too low.\n\nBut there's no reason for the Fed to make an emergency rate cut right now. Doing so might be seen as a sign that the Fed is worried about the economy falling into recession, which itself could cause a panic.\n\nInstead, Powell should make it clear that the Fed is likely to cut the prime interest rate by half a percent at its September meeting.\n\nThe other variable affecting markets is the Middle East. The world is justifiably worried about that tinderbox -- and Netanyahu's insistence on holding power by escalating warfare.\n\nCould Biden do more to restrain Netanyahu -- for humanitarian as well as economic and geopolitical reasons? Yes. Stop shipping him offensive weapons.\n\nAs to the stock market and the American economy, history provides some solace.\n\nOctober 19, 1987, proved to be a short-term drop. The Fed poured money into the banks. Brokers didn't default. Within two years, the market made back all its losses. The economy was fine.\n\nAnd although Trump doesn't seem to realize it, the stock market is not the real economy, anyway. The richest 1 percent of Americans own more than half of all the shares of stock owned by Americans. The richest 10 percent own over 90 percent.\n\nThe real economy consists of average working people. Their spending determines whether and how fast businesses hire more workers.\n\nLower-income people have been especially hurt by high interest rates -- which have raised credit-card fees, car loans, mortgages, and rents.\n\nLast Friday's slower-than-usual jobs report for July provides evidence. Employment slowed in July because the paychecks of average working people aren't going far enough to keep employers hiring.\n\nOne reason paychecks aren't going far enough is that interest rates are still too high.\n\nBut there's a second reason paychecks aren't going far enough. Big corporations still have too much power to keep prices high.\n\nHere, the remedy is more competition.\n\nThis won't happen overnight, but the Biden administration's tough anti-monopoly enforcement is a good start. The Federal Trade Commission's Lina Khan and the Justice Department's antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter have for the first time in more than a half-century made antitrust enforcement an integral part of economic policy making.\n\nBut there's far more to do. Hopefully, Khan and Kanter will remain in their positions in a Kamala Harris administration.\n\nIn sum, what should we take from today's tumble on the stock market?\n\nFirst, there's no reason to panic.\n\nSecond, Jerome Powell should all but commit the Fed to a half-point cut in the prime interest rate in September.\n\nThird, tougher antitrust enforcement over the longer term will better fortify the U.S. economy against a deep recession.\n\nFourth, don't listen to economic prognosticators.", "source": {"uri": "angrybearblog.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AngryBear Econ"}, "authors": [{"uri": "angry_bear@angrybearblog.com", "name": "Angry Bear", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lina_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lina Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://angrybearblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/angry-bear-link-preview.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-10-", "textStart": 17, "textEnd": 27, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

That job belongs to the body to which the Constitution grants the monetary powers of the government.\n\nThe collapse in stock markets around the world might not guarantee a recession -- but it certainly suggests that one is lurking. So for whom dast one suppose the American voter is more likely to pull the lever? The dour Democrat who is ready to raise taxes, regulate the economy, and debase the dollar? Or the sunny tribune of tax-cuts, deregulation, and his celebrated sidekick, who have been extolling the virtues of a -- oops -- weak dollar?\n\nNo doubt there are those who are going to blame the Federal Reserve. Wall Street traders certainly profess to be looking to America's central bank for help -- whether by, say, calling an emergency Open Market Committee meeting to weigh an interest rate cut, or by slowing the pace of its balance sheet drawdown. Such appeals overlook how the Fed's own errors have, to a degree, led to the troubles coming to a head today.\n\nFeature the jobs numbers, released Friday, that preceded the global sell-off. The report of weak hiring, and a jump in unemployment, \"raised fear,\" the Associated Press said, that the Fed \"has pressed the brakes on the economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.\" Panicked traders, the AP said, \"are wondering if the damage has been so severe\" that a rate cut needs to come before the Fed's next scheduled meeting.\n\nBarring that, one analyst observed, the Fed \"could respond by stopping\" its effort to shrink its balance sheet. That's a reference to the assets the Fed acquired, starting with Ben Bernanke, under the guise of Quantitative Easing. It was meant to boost the economy after the 2008 financial meltdown. That balance sheet now stands at more than $7 trillion. It would be a \"symbolic action that they're not blind to what's going on,\" the analyst told the AP.\n\nMore than \"symbolic action\" is needed, though, to address the fiscal and monetary overhang under which America finds itself, in no small part as a result of Fed policies. Today's interest rates, after all, might not prove necessary had the Fed not held rates artificially low for years to stimulate the economy. Or, if the Fed hadn't stood idly by while President Biden's overspending program triggered an inflation spiral that the Fed waved away as \"transitory.\"\n\nYet some 14 years later, the Fed has indeed ratcheted up interest rates, to levels not seen since 2007, and behold, inflation is still running some 50 percent above the Fed's target rate. Rates could come down. Increasingly, though, the Fed's own balance sheet -- and the central bank's inability to get it back down to its historic level of less than $1 trillion -- is seen as a factor making it harder to bring down inflation.\n\nThat's the insight of a former Fed board member, Kevin Warsh, who sees the central bank's balance sheet as a root cause of today's inflation. Mr. Bernanke's easing, Mr. Warsh observes, paved the way for \"a fundamental, persistent and I fear permanent change\" in how the Fed works. The problem, as he explains, is that while it's easy for the Fed to rack up assets, it has proven reluctant to part with them -- despite its avowed intention to do so.\n\nOur own view, in any event, is not for the Fed to get more involved in managing the economy but less. It is a moment to remember that none of the monetary powers of the United States government were granted in the Constitution to the Federal Reserve. The blasted bank didn't even exist. No, all of the monetary powers granted in the Constitution are granted to the Congress, which is -- in our view -- where reform has to begin.\n\nWe have long since given up on the idea of the Democrats entering the fray for monetary reform. So what will the Republicans do? The Biden dollar at the moment wouldn't fetch a 2,400th of an ounce of gold. It's within a whisker of being the weakest dollar since the Continental. If Congress is to restore a convertible, stable dollar, though, it's going to need leadership on this head. Our sense is that the voters are not dumb and are looking for leadership.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "new_york_sun@nysun.com", "name": "New York Sun", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deregulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deregulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Bernanke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Bernanke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quantitative easing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warsh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_reform", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary reform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://wp.nysun.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/wall-street-scaled.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=fill&fm=jpg&fl=progressive", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

A modest additional drop this morning brought that number to the lowest level since April 2023.\n\nIn the big picture, rates have been moving consistently lower due to an ongoing bond market rally that began in May. That rally is driven by softer inflation/economic data and an increased willingness on the part of the Fed to consider rate cuts.\n\nThere are more esoteric factors in play, both for the big picture and the past few days. These factors have more to do with the plumbing of global financial markets and the mortgage specific bonds that directly dictate mortgage rates. The net effect is that rates are highly variable depending on the day, the lender, and the client scenario.\n\nAll that to say, just because our rate index is now in the 6.3's, you won't necessarily see a 30yr fixed rate in the 6.3's. In some cases, a 6.625% rate would be considered low. In other cases with only a few differences, the low rate could be 6.125%.\n\nEither way, you are where you are today, but everyone wants to know where we're going. Sadly, predictions are for suckers. A lot of people predicted the Fed would cut rates multiple times in 2024. They were shunned in the first quarter as rate cut odds dried up. Now this morning, some commentators were calling for the Fed to make emergency rate cuts TODAY at the same time the market moved to price in multiple, larger rate cuts by the end of the year.\n\nWith the next Fed meeting just over 5 weeks away, and plenty of important economic data during that time, we still don't know what the road ahead will look like.

But she said she wasn't prepared to say when or by how because she expects to look at more data between now and the next Fed policy meeting in September.\n\n\"I can't tell you whether we will do a certain degree of cuts,\" she said.\n\nThe pressure on the Fed to cut rates is rising in the wake of heavy selling on Wall Street and a disappointing jobs report Friday that stoked recession fears.\n\nData from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday showed the US economy added 114,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in July, fewer than the 175,000 expected by economists. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3% -- its highest level since October 2021.\n\nTraders are now betting the Fed will act more aggressively in the remaining months of 2024.\n\nThey expect rate cuts of half a percent in both September and November and another quarter-point cut in December. Previously traders were looking at two quarter-point cuts for the rest of this year.\n\nJPMorgan chief economist Michael Feroli suggests there is even a growing argument for a rate cut before the next scheduled policy meeting on Sept. 17-18.\n\nThere is a \"strong case to act before September,\" he said in a research note.\n\nThe Fed looks to be \"materially behind the curve,\" added Feroli, who expects a 50-basis-point cut at the September meeting followed by another 50-basis-point cut in November.\n\nBut Daly noted that the job market is backward looking, and that the July report released last Friday had a lot of temporary layoffs that could reverse as soon as the next jobs report.\n\nAs for the uptick in the unemployment rate, she also pointed to a large increase in the number of people in the labor force, who appeared to be immigrants coming into the job market for the first time. Daly said it takes them longer to find jobs when they first start out.\n\n\"I'll be watching very carefully to see if the next labor market report continues to suggest that kind of same number or same dynamic, but that could also reverse,\" said Daly.\n\nOne thing Daly said she did on Friday was call chief executives in her district to understand whether they were slowing hiring or laying off workers. She confirmed that companies are slowing the pace of hiring right now.\n\n\"We don't see firms laying off workers,\" said Daly. \"We don't see demand, slowing consumer demand, flowing incomes are still strong. Order books are still good.

Here's what really happened yesterday on Wall Street", "body": "Two weeks before October 19, 1987, I warned publicly that \"in two weeks, the stock market will lose 20 percent of its value.\" Then, on October 19, 1987, the S&P 500 had the biggest one-day fall in its history -- dropping 20 percent.\n\nI was immediately deluged with letters and phone calls (no emails then) from people who wanted to sign up for my \"investment letter.\" I told them, with some regret, that I didn't have an investment letter.\n\nWhat I didn't tell them was that I had been making the same prediction -- that in two weeks the stock market would lose 20 percent of its value -- for three years.\n\nEveryone who makes economic predictions will one day be proven correct if they stick to their guns.\n\nREAD: Laura Ingraham: Trump's 'loser strategy' already lost Republicans two Senate seats\n\nWhich brings us to what happened yesterday.\n\n\"Stock markets are crashing, jobs numbers are terrible, we are heading to World War III, and we have two of the most incompetent 'leaders' in history,\" Trump bloviated.\n\nRubbish. The United States is not facing imminent recession. The American economy is still growing. There is no reason to panic.\n\nTrump and his lackeys would like an economic panic because nothing else they've thrown at Kamala Harris is working.\n\nCould Trump's billionaire supporters try to bring on a crash by suddenly withdrawing their assets from the stock and bond markets? That would be difficult to pull off. They couldn't do it without suffering massive losses. And where would they put their assets in the meantime?\n\nIn truth, Fed chair Jerome Powell -- who Trump first appointed in 2018 -- should have begun cutting interest rates at the Fed's last meeting rather than waiting until September.\n\nThe Fed's current 5.3 percent prime rate is too high. The Fed's goal of 2 percent inflation is too low.\n\nBut there's no reason for the Fed to make an emergency rate cut right now. Doing so might be seen as a sign that the Fed is worried about the economy falling into recession, which itself could cause a panic.\n\nInstead, Powell should make it clear that the Fed is likely to cut the prime interest rate by half a percent at its September meeting.\n\nThe other variable affecting markets is the Middle East. The world is justifiably worried about that tinderbox -- and Netanyahu's insistence on holding power by escalating warfare.\n\nCould Biden do more to restrain Netanyahu -- for humanitarian as well as economic and geopolitical reasons? Yes. Stop shipping him offensive weapons.\n\nAs to the stock market and the American economy, history provides some solace.\n\nOctober 19, 1987, proved to be a short-term drop. The Fed poured money into the banks. Brokers didn't default. Within two years, the market made back all its losses. The economy was fine.\n\nAnd although Trump doesn't seem to realize it, the stock market is not the real economy, anyway. The richest 1 percent of Americans own more than half of all the shares of stock owned by Americans. The richest 10 percent own over 90 percent.\n\nThe real economy consists of average working people. Their spending determines whether and how fast businesses hire more workers.\n\nLower-income people have been especially hurt by high interest rates -- which have raised credit-card fees, car loans, mortgages, and rents.\n\nLast Friday's slower-than-usual jobs report for July provides evidence. Employment slowed in July because the paychecks of average working people aren't going far enough to keep employers hiring.\n\nOne reason paychecks aren't going far enough is that interest rates are still too high.\n\nBut there's a second reason paychecks aren't going far enough. Big corporations still have too much power to keep prices high.\n\nHere, the remedy is more competition.\n\nThis won't happen overnight, but the Biden administration's tough anti-monopoly enforcement is a good start. The Federal Trade Commission's Lina Khan and the Justice Department's antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter have for the first time in more than a half-century made antitrust enforcement an integral part of economic policy making.\n\nBut there's far more to do. Hopefully, Khan and Kanter will remain in their positions in a Kamala Harris administration.\n\nIn sum, what should we take from today's tumble on the stock market?\n\nFirst, there's no reason to panic.\n\nSecond, Jerome Powell should all but commit the Fed to a half-point cut in the prime interest rate in September.\n\nThird, tougher antitrust enforcement over the longer term will better fortify the U.S. economy against a deep recession.\n\nFourth, don't listen to economic prognosticators.\n\nNOW READ: Trump just entered his 'Fat Elvis' phase", "source": {"uri": "alternet.org",

Since that time, price increases have fallen near the central bank's preferred 2% target rate, while the unemployment rate hovers around 4%, considered historically low.\n\nPowell put himself on a war footing against inflation two years ago, arguing the Fed could always drop rates if the hawkish position proved to be too much for the economy.\n\nIn March 2022, Powell likened himself to Paul Volcker, a former Fed chair who famously rolled out policies pushing interest rates to double digits. Volcker presided over the bank when inflation topped out at 14%, compared to the 8.5% rate at the start of Powell's fight.\n\nPowell's position marked a major change.\n\nFor the past 12 years, since the Great Recession, the Federal Reserve kept rates rock-bottom low and pumped money into bond markets, often resulting in all three major indexes hitting historical highs on a regular basis. This led investors to believe low rates were here to stay.\n\nBut with prices ebbing, the Dow losing more 1,000 points on Monday, and stocks running toward correction territory, calls are growing for an emergency rate cut.\n\n\"If they are going to be as slow on the way down as they were on the way up, which, by the way, was the first policy error in 50 years, then we're not in for a good time with this economy,\" famed Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel said on CNBC Monday.\n\nOther economists argue stocks, rather than showing worrying signs of a recession, are going through a course correction right now. A lot is riding on how the economy weathers the next few months headed into the November elections. That's especially true for Powell.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump has already made his opinion known about Powell, the man Trump himself nominated as Fed chairman in 2017 when he was president. Trump is now warning Powell to steer clear of any rate cuts until after November.\n\nThe former president and other Republicans are reportedly pressing to place the Federal Reserve under the purview of the executive branch. Such a scenario would likely require rate cuts or increases to go through the White House before implementation, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing a memo.\n\nPowell has repeatedly pushed back on any insinuation the Fed is politicized, telling reporters last week: \"We don't change anything in our approach to address other factors like the political calendar.\" He has kept to this position throughout the past several months.\n\nAlong with staying away from politics, Powell has also tried to avoid discussing fiscal policy, for the most part. He has deviated in some situations, such as in a \"60 Minutes\" interview earlier this year when he called the U.S.' current fiscal situation \"unsustainable.\"\n\n\"I don't think that's at all controversial,\" Powell said of the size of the national debt when asked whether it is a danger to the economy. The national debt topped $35 trillion last week. Many Fed watchers argue the central bank's job would be less challenging if the Fed chairman and lawmakers synchronized their efforts.\n\nWhile Trump's spoiled on Powell, it's not a given he stays if Democratic Presidential nominee Kamala Harris wins. Vice President Harris voted against his confirmation when she was in the Senate, siding with her progressive lawmakers who worried Powell would be lax in overseeing banks.\n\n\"There's a very low probability that once his term is up in 2026, he is renominated,\" Frank Kelly, a political strategist at investment firm DWS told Fortune. \"It's interesting, and he doesn't necessarily want to do it.\" Powell will take slaying inflation as a win and willingly leave, Kelly added.", "source": {"uri": "wjla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WJLA"}, "authors": [{"uri":

And several US online brokers appeared to struggle with connectivity issues in the early going Monday as investors rushed to check their portfolios -- or perhaps move in or out of positions during the early chaos.\n\nAll manner of market commentators were in full flight on Monday. Some admonished those panicked about a return to prices seen just a few months ago. Others were spiking the football on an overhyped AI trade that appeared to finally be cracking under pressure.\n\nWall Street strategists proffered all manner of explanations, ranging from the unwind of the aforementioned yen carry trade, to Vice President Kamala Harris's better poll numbers against Donald Trump, to investors simply growing too complacent with concentration in the AI trade and low volatility. Even this weekend's news that Warren Buffett had trimmed his holdings in Apple got some run as an explanation.\n\nBut last week's market turn had a clear catalyst: the Federal Reserve.\n\nAnd this remains the cleanest way to understand why the stock market's year of smooth sailing has come to an abrupt end. When the Fed held interest rates steady last week, investor reactions suggested the central bank had made a policy mistake by not taking the chance to lower rates before the economy showed signs of weakness.\n\nA soft July jobs report heightened worries that rather than lowering rates from a position of strength (having tamed inflation without harming the labor market), the Fed would end up cutting from a position of need with the labor market quickly softening.\n\nIn a press conference last week, Fed Chair Jay Powell repeated the recent slowdown in hiring and uptick in unemployment is a \"normalization\" of the labor market. Investors appear less convinced.\n\nSo, with more than six weeks between now and the Fed's next regularly scheduled policy meeting, markets have been quick to put pressure on the central bank not to miss its next appointment.\n\nTalk has quickly shifted from whether the Fed should cut rates on Sept. 18 to by how much the Fed should cut. (50 basis points is the current market expectation.)\n\nSome even suggested Monday the Fed might consider cutting interest rates between its scheduled meetings, a move last made during the throes of the pandemic in March 2020.\n\nA 15% drop in the Nasdaq would seem to bring with it less urgency.

This is nonsense | Robert Reich", "body": "The American economy is still growing. There is no reason to panic, despite Trump's 'world war three' comments\n\nTwo weeks before 19 October 1987, I warned publicly that \"in two weeks, the stock market will lose 20% of its value.\" Then, on 19 October 1987, the S&P 500 had the biggest one-day fall in its history - dropping 20%.\n\nI was immediately deluged with letters and phone calls (no emails then) from people who wanted to sign up for my \"investment letter\". I told them, with some regret, that I didn't have an investment letter.\n\nWhat I didn't tell them was that I had been making the same prediction - that in two weeks the stock market would lose 20% of its value - for three years.\n\nEveryone who makes economic predictions will one day be proven correct if they stick to their guns.\n\nWhich brings us to what happened on Monday.\n\n\"Stock markets are crashing, jobs numbers are terrible, we are heading to world war three, and we have two of the most incompetent 'leaders' in history,\" Donald Trump bloviated on Monday.\n\nRubbish. The United States is not facing imminent recession. The American economy is still growing. There is no reason to panic.\n\nTrump and his lackeys would like an economic panic because nothing else they've thrown at Kamala Harris is working.\n\nCould Trump's billionaire supporters try to bring on a crash by suddenly withdrawing their assets from the stock and bond markets? That would be difficult to pull off. They couldn't do it without suffering massive losses. And where would they put their assets in the meantime?\n\nIn truth, the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell - who Trump first appointed in 2018 - should have begun cutting interest rates at the Fed's last meeting rather than waiting until September.\n\nThe Fed's current 5.3% prime rate is too high. The Fed's goal of 2% inflation is too low.\n\nBut there's no reason for the Fed to make an emergency rate cut right now. Doing so might be seen as a sign that the Fed is worried about the economy falling into recession, which itself could cause a panic.\n\nInstead, Powell should make it clear that the Fed is likely to cut the prime interest rate by half a percentage point at its September meeting.\n\nThe other variable affecting markets is the Middle East. The world is justifiably worried about that tinderbox - and Netanyahu's insistence on holding power by escalating warfare.\n\nCould Joe Biden do more to restrain Benjamin Netanyahu - for humanitarian as well as economic and geopolitical reasons? Yes. Stop shipping him offensive weapons.\n\nAs to the stock market and the American economy, history provides some solace.\n\n19 October 1987, proved to be a short-term drop. The Fed poured money into the banks. Brokers didn't default. Within two years, the market made back all its losses. The economy was fine.\n\nAnd although Trump doesn't seem to realize it, the stock market is not the real economy, anyway. The richest 10% of Americans own over 90% of all the shares of stock owned by Americans. The richest1% own just over half.\n\nThe real economy consists of average working people. Their spending determines whether and how fast businesses hire more workers.\n\nLower-income people have been especially hurt by high interest rates - which have raised credit-card fees, car loans, mortgages and rents.\n\nLast Friday's slower-than-usual jobs report for July provides evidence. Employment slowed in July because the paychecks of average working people aren't going far enough to keep employers hiring.\n\nOne reason paychecks aren't going far enough is that interest rates are still too high.\n\nBut there's a second reason paychecks aren't going far enough. Big corporations still have too much power to keep prices high.\n\nHere, the remedy is more competition.\n\nThis won't happen overnight, but the Biden administration's tough anti-monopoly enforcement is a good start. The Federal Trade Commission's Lina Khan and the justice department's antitrust chief, Jonathan Kanter, have for the first time in more than a half-century made antitrust enforcement an integral part of economic policy making.\n\nBut there's far more to do. Hopefully, Khan and Kanter will remain in their positions in a Kamala Harris administration.\n\nIn sum, what should we take from today's tumble on the stock market?\n\nFirst, there's no reason to panic.\n\nSecond, Jerome Powell should all but commit the Fed to a half-point cut in the prime interest rate in September.\n\nThird, tougher antitrust enforcement over the longer term will better fortify the US economy against a deep recession.\n\nFourth, don't listen to economic prognosticators.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_reich@theguardian.com", "name": "Robert Reich", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lina_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lina Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fe4ff808eb6dd24a2764506317b4c9871a198e0/0_0_6243_3746/master/6243.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=f5ec66297571fee65334d5a38f790e69", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

Now signs of strength contend with shakier readings.\n\nThe U.S. economy has spent three years defying expectations. It emerged from the pandemic shock more quickly and more powerfully than many experts envisioned. It proved resilient in the face of both inflation and the higher interest rates the Federal Reserve used to combat it. The prospect many forecasters once considered imminent -- a recession -- looked increasingly like a false alarm.\n\nUntil now.\n\nAn unexpectedly weak jobs report on Friday -- showing slower hiring in July, and a surprising jump in unemployment -- triggered a sell-off in the stock market as investors worried that an economic downturn might be underway after all. By Monday, that decline had turned into a rout, with financial markets tumbling around the world.\n\nSome economists said investors were overreacting to one weak but hardly disastrous report, since many indicators show the economy on fundamentally firm footing.\n\nBut they said there were also reasons to worry. Historically, increases in joblessness like the one in July -- the unemployment rate rose to 4.3 percent, the highest since 2021 -- have been a reliable indicator of a recession. And even without that precedent, there has been evidence that the labor market is weakening.\n\n\"Even before the employment report, you were seeing some real signs of softening in the labor market,\" said Jay Bryson, chief economist for Wells Fargo.\n\nMr. Bryson still expects a \"soft landing,\" in which inflation cools without a broad economic downturn. But the chances of a more painful outcome have risen. Other forecasters said the same: Economists at Goldman Sachs over the weekend said they saw a 25 percent chance of a recession over the next year, up from 15 percent before the latest round of economic data.\n\nMore important than the predictions themselves -- which, after all, have repeatedly proved unreliable -- are the factors underlying them. The American economy no longer has the reserves of strength that helped carry it through the recent turbulence. Families no longer have a buffer of cash built up during the pandemic, or pent-up demand to spend it. Businesses no longer have a backlog of jobs to fill or shelves to restock.\n\nNone of that means a recession -- an actual contraction of the economy -- is inevitable. But it does make this economic moment more precarious than any in recent years.\n\nWhy Dour Predictions Have Been Wrong (So Far)\n\nThere is a crucial difference between the earlier, inaccurate recession forecasts and the latest set of warnings: The previous predictions were based largely on historical patterns and theoretical models. The new ones are based on actual evidence of a slowdown.\n\nWhen economists began predicting a recession in 2022, inflation was high and the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates aggressively to try to bring it under control. In the past, those conditions usually led to a recession: Policymakers try to curb demand just enough to bring down inflation, but end up overshooting and causing widespread layoffs.\n\nThat didn't happen this time. Consumers and businesses emerged from the pandemic with plenty of savings and relatively little debt, making them less sensitive to higher borrowing costs. At the same time, the easing of pandemic-related disruptions allowed inflationary pressures to dissipate without requiring a big drop in demand for goods and services.\n\n\"All of those normal rules that tend to apply in both historical experience and theoretical models were very different this time around,\" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University professor who recently left a role in the Treasury Department.\n\nAs a result, even as many economists warned a recession was coming, there was never much evidence of one in the data. Hiring, wage growth and consumer spending all eased, but none collapsed. Unemployment remained near lows unseen in decades. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic output, continued to grow at a healthy -- and at times robust -- pace.\n\nWhy Recession Fears Have Re-emerged\n\nNow, though, cracks are beginning to appear. More people are falling behind on their credit card bills and car payments. Filings for unemployment benefits have begun to rise. Overall consumer spending has remained strong, but there have been signs that lower-income consumers are pulling back.\n\nThe July employment data was the clearest warning sign yet. Job growth slowed much more than expected and was concentrated in a handful of industries. The increase in the unemployment rate, the third in four months, was enough to suggest that a recession might already have begun, according to a well-known gauge known as the Sahm Rule.\n\nClaudia Sahm, the former Fed economist who developed the rule, said disruptions during and since the pandemic might have scrambled her namesake indicator as they had so many other once-reliable recession warning signs. But she said the underlying logic -- that even small increases in unemployment are something to worry about -- still held.\n\n\"Given everything we know, or that we think we know, the United States is not in a recession,\" Ms. Sahm said. \"But the risk of going into a recession in, say, in the next three to six months? Those have really gone up.\"\n\nReasons for Optimism\n\nStill, by most measures the U.S. economy is slowing down, not stalling out.\n\nConsumer spending, personal income and job growth -- all measures used by the National Bureau of Economic Research to determine when recessions begin and end -- have remained solidly positive. Gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, grew faster in the second quarter than in the first, and is expected to show another gain in the third quarter. Other recent data have shown unexpectedly strong productivity growth and a rebounding service sector.\n\nBetter still, inflation has cooled significantly, which gives the Fed more leeway to reduce interest rates if the economy weakens further, without worrying as much that doing so will allow prices to start rising quickly again.\n\nJerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, indicated in a news conference last week -- before the jobs report or the market plunge -- that the central bank could cut rates as early as its next meeting in September, something investors now view as a near certainty. Some investors expect the Fed to intervene even earlier, although careful Fed watchers consider such an emergency move unlikely.\n\nThe challenge for policymakers is that after two years of seeking to slow the economy, they are aiming to do something even more delicate: Get it to level off. And they are trying to do so with imperfect and at times contradictory data, using tools ill suited to such finely calibrated adjustments.\n\n\"It's very hard to distinguish the difference between reaching the runway and plowing through it,\" Ms. Sinclair said.\n\nTalmon Joseph Smith contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"},

We experienced a sharp market selloff, with the S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 dropping more than 3% and the Dow falling more than 2%.\n\nWhenever we experience broader market volatility or receive breaking news, I like to send my subscribers across all my services a Special Market Podcast. So, this morning, that's exactly what I did. I discussed the broader market's sharp selloff, as well as...\n\nThe last thing I want any investor to do right now is panic, so I've decided to send you this morning's podcast, too. Whether you're a paying member or not, I think it's important that you hear what triggered the broader market weakness, how long I expect it to last, as well as the best way to protect yourself.\n\nYou can read the full transcript of today's Special Market Podcast below.\n\n*******************\n\nThis is Louis Navellier. It is August, Monday the 5th. Obviously, it was a horrific opening to the market today. So, I have several things to point out.\n\nFirst, it's August. No one's around and the computers are running everything. So, the key on the selloff is to watch the volume. The selloffs are going to continue until the volume dissipates. So, what we want to see is a blowoff and then a quick reversal. But it's hard to get reversals in August because again, no one's around. So, expect more air pockets like this to continue because this is what happens in August and that's just unfortunate.\n\nThere is some significant news out there. News broke that Warren Buffett sold half of his Apple Inc. (AAPL) holdings and Apple was one of the few Magnificent Seven stocks that had better-than expected results. So, they're shooting Apple.\n\nThere's something called a carry trade. The folks in Japan can't raise rates because the deficit is so big. They're trying to have positive rates, but they would rather stick their money in America and buy our Treasuries and they get the currency appreciation plus higher yields.\n\nNow, today the Japanese yen is down 2.7% against the dollar. The dollar is also down because our interest rates are collapsing. The two-year and the 10-year Treasury are about 3.7%. So, the yield curve has been uninverted and is as flat as a pancake. So, the strongest currency right now is the euro.\n\nBut the bottom line is interest rates are collapsing so fast that the Fed has to cut rates six times. Basically, that's six quarter-point rate cuts just to be in sync with market rates.\n\nNow, some of you might've seen my article on MarketWatch came out on Friday where I basically admonished the Fed for not listening to its elders. Bill Dudley and Alan Blinder both wrote editorials respectively in Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal calling the Fed to cut now.\n\nI was essentially demanding a 50-basis-point rate cut and I'm still in that camp that they should cut rates down 50 basis points before their meeting in Jackson Hole at the end of the month. That Jackson Hole meeting is a big deal; other central bankers show up.\n\nBut the sad thing is if our Fed waits till September 18 to cut rates, they're not even late to the party. It's like showing up to the party after it's over because by then, by September 18, Canada will already cut twice, Great Britain will have cut twice and the European Central Bank will have cut twice. So, for us to be so slow to cut is irresponsible.\n\nSo, the Fed has to do something. They can't just be like an ostrich with their head in the sand and be oblivious to everything. Unemployment has risen from 3.4% to 4.3% in the last 15 months. It's going to be 5% by October.\n\nAlso, if you haven't noticed, we have an election coming up. So, I'm sure this is very upsetting to the Biden administration and Kamala Harris, who's going to be running on their behalf. It'll be interesting to see how everybody responds.\n\nSo, the bottom line is welcome to August. I did give a talk at the Vegas MoneyShow on Friday and my title of my talk is \"Why I Think the Stock Market Should Be Closed Every August.\" This is most unfortunate. Usually in a presidential election year, you don't have this kind of volatility in August. But nonetheless we do.\n\nI get a lot of questions on how can the market possibly do what it's doing. And the answer is the machines are in control. Wall Street is on vacation, Europe is on vacation. The machines are running amuck. And we will have a reversal, but we have to watch the volume in it. We have to have a blowoff and then a reversal.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) is announcing this week. Their sales are supposed to be up 142%, earnings are supposed to be up 130%. So, we'll see if it can find firmer footing. Obviously, there's no earnings or sales problem with Super Micro.\n\nI think the main thing is that the Fed has to cut 50 basis points yesterday and they're just so far out of sync with market rates. It's not even funny. So, this means credit's essentially being cut off to a lot of people, even good borrowers. No one would be stupid enough to borrow right now at the rates the Fed has because they're so far above market rates.\n\nSo, hang in there, folks. I know you don't enjoy this, but I do want to remind everybody that when the market gets hit, they do throw the baby out with the bathwater. But good stocks bounce like fresh tennis balls and bad stocks bounce like rocks. We don't have rocks in our portfolio. We have stocks with strong sales, strong earnings. We have stocks that are an oasis. That's the high Alpha stuff that we calculate. We are purposefully looking for stocks that zig when the market zags. So, hang in there.\n\nThe good news is our stocks will bounce, and the bad news is a recession is imminent. So, hang in there everybody. I know you don't enjoy this, but we will be bouncing here shortly. Take care everybody.

Today, economics editor Christopher Condon looks at how the Federal Reserve may respond to a bout of market turmoil. Sign up here and follow us at @bpolitics. Email our editors here.\n\nLast week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spelled out his thinking quite explicitly, by central banker standards. Yes, the Fed was on course to cut interest rates. No, it wasn't contemplating anything more dramatic than a quarter-point reduction in September.\n\nFast forward to Monday morning, and Fed officials awoke to a global market slump - and a cacophony of traders and investors urging them to do more, faster, sooner. The early signs are that Powell and company won't be much moved.\n\nWhat changed the backdrop: On Friday -- two days after Powell spoke - the US published weak employment numbers for July. That ramped up pressure on the Fed to reconsider. Wall Street banks and futures markets started to adjust their interest-rate calls and predict a jumbo half-point cut next month.\n\nThen, over the American weekend, Asian stocks went into meltdown. So, by Monday morning US time, an ever-louder chorus was declaring the Fed to be behind the curve, and warning of recession if it didn't act aggressively, perhaps even with an emergency cut before the mid-September meeting.", "source": {"uri": "bloomberg.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bloomberg Business"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_condon@bloomberg.com", "name": "Christopher Condon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "follow_us_at@bloomberg.com", "name": "Follow Us At", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "newsletter_about_money@bloomberg.com", "name": "Newsletter About Money", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swoon_(artist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swoon (artist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_exchange", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Futures exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Internet_Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Internet Marketing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Associations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iesPItkN3VVw/v0/1200x798.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

Then came the Federal Reserve's meeting on Wednesday, followed by weaker-than-expected U.S. manufacturing data on Thursday, and a weak labor report on Friday.\n\nThis has all led to an unwinding of the Yen carry trade. A large leveraged position that traders have put on for years, that allows them to borrow Yen at a lower interest rate and invest in US treasuries at a higher rate. The Bank of Japan's interest rate hike last Wednesday started an unwind of the position, and margin calls are now exacerbating the move.\n\nThe US indices were also significantly lower following large declines last Thursday and Friday. Especially after the weekend when reports emerged that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold half of its Apple position and is holding a company record $277 billion in cash.\n\nAs the US markets have declined, the grouping of large technology companies known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" has lost a combined $1.28 trillion in market cap over three sessions.\n\nIn response, the futures market pricing showed that expectations for Fed interest rate cuts surged on Monday morning. With Jeremy Siegel of Wharton's School of Business calling for 150 basis points of rate cuts.\n\n\"I'm calling for a 75 basis point emergency cut in the Fed funds rate, with another 75 basis point cut indicated for next month at the September meeting - and that's minimum,\"\n\n-Jeremy Siegel\n\nThe VIX volatility index surged to 65 on Monday, the highest level the VIX has hit since March 2020, shortly after the Federal Reserve's emergency actions during the Covid-19 pandemic when it rose to 85.\n\nGold and silver prices were down sharply on Monday.

It emerged from the pandemic shock more quickly and more powerfully than many experts envisioned. It proved resilient in the face of both inflation and the higher interest rates the Federal Reserve used to combat it. The prospect many forecasters once considered imminent -- a recession -- looked increasingly like a false alarm.\n\nUntil now.\n\nAn unexpectedly weak jobs report on Friday -- showing slower hiring in July, and a surprising jump in unemployment -- triggered a sell-off in the stock market as investors worried that an economic downturn might be underway after all. By Monday, that decline had turned into a rout, with financial markets tumbling around the world.\n\nSome economists said investors were overreacting to one weak but hardly disastrous report, since many indicators show the economy on fundamentally firm footing.\n\nBut they said there were also reasons to worry. Historically, increases in joblessness like the one in July -- the unemployment rate rose to 4.3 percent, the highest since 2021 -- have been a reliable indicator of a recession. And even without that precedent, there has been evidence that the labor market is weakening.\n\n\"Even before the employment report, you were seeing some real signs of softening in the labor market,\" said Jay Bryson, chief economist for Wells Fargo.\n\nMr. Bryson still expects a \"soft landing,\" in which inflation cools without a broad economic downturn. But the chances of a more painful outcome have risen. Other forecasters said the same: Economists at Goldman Sachs over the weekend said they saw a 25 percent chance of a recession over the next year, up from 15 percent before the latest round of economic data.\n\nMore important than the predictions themselves -- which, after all, have repeatedly proved unreliable -- are the factors underlying them. The American economy no longer has the reserves of strength that helped carry it through the recent turbulence. Families no longer have a buffer of cash built up during the pandemic, or pent-up demand to spend it. Businesses no longer have a backlog of jobs to fill or shelves to restock.\n\nNone of that means a recession -- an actual contraction of the economy -- is inevitable. But it does make this economic moment more precarious than any in recent years.\n\nThere is a crucial difference between the earlier, inaccurate recession forecasts and the latest set of warnings: The previous predictions were based largely on historical patterns and theoretical models. The new ones are based on actual evidence of a slowdown.\n\nWhen economists began predicting a recession in 2022, inflation was high and the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates aggressively to try to bring it under control. In the past, those conditions usually led to a recession: Policymakers try to curb demand just enough to bring down inflation, but end up overshooting and causing widespread layoffs.\n\nThat didn't happen this time. Consumers and businesses emerged from the pandemic with plenty of savings and relatively little debt, making them less sensitive to higher borrowing costs. At the same time, the easing of pandemic-related disruptions allowed inflationary pressures to dissipate without requiring a big drop in demand for goods and services.\n\n\"All of those normal rules that tend to apply in both historical experience and theoretical models were very different this time around,\" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University professor who recently left a role in the Treasury Department.\n\nAs a result, even as many economists warned a recession was coming, there was never much evidence of one in the data. Hiring, wage growth and consumer spending all eased, but none collapsed. Unemployment remained near lows unseen in decades. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic output, continued to grow at a healthy -- and at times robust -- pace.\n\nNow, though, cracks are beginning to appear. More people are falling behind on their credit card bills and car payments. Filings for unemployment benefits have begun to rise. Overall consumer spending has remained strong, but there have been signs that lower-income consumers are pulling back.\n\nThe July employment data was the clearest warning sign yet. Job growth slowed much more than expected and was concentrated in a handful of industries. The increase in the unemployment rate, the third in four months, was enough to suggest that a recession might already have begun, according to a well-known gauge known as the Sahm Rule.\n\nClaudia Sahm, the former Fed economist who developed the rule, said disruptions during and since the pandemic might have scrambled her namesake indicator as they had so many other once-reliable recession warning signs. But she said the underlying logic -- that even small increases in unemployment are something to worry about -- still held.\n\n\"Given everything we know, or that we think we know, the United States is not in a recession,\" Ms. Sahm said. \"But the risk of going into a recession in, say, in the next three to six months? Those have really gone up.\"\n\nStill, by most measures the U.S. economy is slowing down, not stalling out.\n\nConsumer spending, personal income and job growth -- all measures used by the National Bureau of Economic Research to determine when recessions begin and end -- have remained solidly positive. Gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, grew faster in the second quarter than in the first, and is expected to show another gain in the third quarter. Other recent data have shown unexpectedly strong productivity growth and a rebounding service sector.\n\nBetter still, inflation has cooled significantly, which gives the Fed more leeway to reduce interest rates if the economy weakens further, without worrying as much that doing so will allow prices to start rising quickly again.\n\nJerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, indicated in a news conference last week -- before the jobs report or the market plunge -- that the central bank could cut rates as early as its next meeting in September, something investors now view as a near certainty. Some investors expect the Fed to intervene even earlier, although careful Fed watchers consider such an emergency move unlikely.\n\nThe challenge for policymakers is that after two years of seeking to slow the economy, they are aiming to do something even more delicate: Get it to level off. And they are trying to do so with imperfect and at times contradictory data, using tools ill suited to such finely calibrated adjustments.\n\n\"It's very hard to distinguish the difference between reaching the runway and plowing through it,\" Ms. Sinclair said.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goods and services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Washington University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Sahm", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Claudia Sahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_Broadcast_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sinclair Broadcast Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Output_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Output (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal income in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bureau_of_Economic_Research", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Bureau of Economic Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Recession-Fears-May-Be-Overstated-but-Not-Unfounded.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

Typically, in periods of market angst, the dollar is the primary beneficiary due to safe-haven flows.\n\nThat did not take place this time around with the euro managing to quickly climb close to $1.10 despite the continued negative newsflow from the eurozone.\n\nFriday's weaker US labor market report was also blamed for the acute market reaction.\n\nThe Fed's Daly commented, \"the labor market is slowing but not falling off a cliff\". She added some color about Friday's print by stating, \"the July jobs report reflected a lot of temporary layoffs, hurricane effect\" in an obvious attempt to negate fears about a US recession.\"\n\nThe last two recessions in the US coincided with significant events like the COVID-19 pandemic (2020) and the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008. Interestingly, certain market participants may be trying to make a connection between the 2000 dot-com bubble and the current AI frenzy.\n\nThis comparison has merit but again a one-off event, the tragic September 11, 2001 attacks, played a key role in pushing the US into recession in 2001.\n\nThe end-product of the last few sessions is that the market is now expecting 110bps of easing by the Fed by year-end with some famous economists talking about a 50bps rate cut in September.\n\nConsidering that two weeks ago the debate was on whether the Fed could cut ahead of the November Presidential election, the market is probably running ahead of itself.\n\nAggressive easing by the Fed is usually associated with significant, one-off events; barring such a development, the current US data has to dramatically deteriorate over the next 40 days to justify such a reaction.\n\nThe market usually needs fresh newsflow, particularly key data releases, to digest and reassess its current thinking. The calendar is rather light across the board today and, considering the absence of any Fed speakers, the possibility of another sea of red in equities is high. Interestingly, gold continues to experience strong volatility and is hovering around the $2,400 level.\n\nDespite the aggressive repricing of Fed rate cut expectations, the RBA opted to stay vigilant to upside risks to inflation at today's meeting, ignoring some marginal calls for a more dovish stance.\n\nIn fact, RBA Governor Bullock commented that a rate hike was considered today and that \"a rate cut is not on the agenda in the near term\", thus pouring cold water on expectations for RBA rate cuts during 2024.\n\nKey data will be published during the Asian session in both New Zealand and China. The RBNZ is preparing for its August 14 meeting and hence a negative set of labour market data could open the door to a dovish shift.\n\nThis shift, to a certain extent, depends on China where the administration is still trying to solve the housing sector puzzle.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nikkei", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Nikkei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_(investment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carry (investment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_Australia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reserve Bank of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subprime mortgage crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacifism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pacifism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2001-09-11", "textStart": 1780, "textEnd": 1798}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-14", "textStart": 3351, "textEnd": 3360}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

Now they have to contend with recession fears as well.\n\nThe labor market and price growth have cooled enough that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is openly contemplating slashing rates -- an outcome that markets would have celebrated as recently as a month ago. But last week's weak employment data, coupled with the unwinding of popular tech and currency-related trades that powered market gains over the last year, amplified concerns that Powell and other Fed policymakers waited too long to keep the economy from sputtering out.\n\nMarkets across the globe fell sharply on Monday as traders reckoned with the possibility that the U.S. economy could stall. Stocks, crypto markets and certain commodities could remain volatile, analysts warned. There aren't many major economic indicators on the calendar between now and next week when the Labor Department will report the producer and consumer price indices for July.\n\nIn the meantime, the sell-off should be taken as a sign that \"we have clearly shifted the recent economic narrative from 'bad news is good news' (markets rising in anticipation of more Fed rate cuts) to 'bad news is bad news' (markets falling in reaction to concerns about weaker jobs market and recession/hard landing,\" Wells Fargo Investment Institute President Darrell Cronk told clients in a research note on Monday.\n\nTo be clear: The U.S. is not in a recession. The economy grew by a healthy 2.8 percent last quarter, unemployment is below historic averages and recent corporate earnings have been solid, overall. Goldman Sachs economists on Sunday raised the likelihood of a U.S. slump occurring in the next 12 months, but they still peg the probability at just 25 percent. Nomura's Senior U.S. Economist Jeremy Schwartz set similar odds, but said \"markets have overreacted about the possibility of a recession being imminent.\"\n\nEconomic projections are never certain -- remember this headline from 2022? -- but if the economy slows quickly, it will hurt Vice President Kamala Harris' argument that Biden administration policies were stabilizing forces in the face of high inflation and soaring borrowing costs. It would also create fresh challenges for a campaign that is still recasting its economic messaging on the fly.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, who often treats the stock market as a real-time barometer of the economy's health, went on the attack on Monday claiming that the sell-off was a \"KAMALA CRASH\" and that \"THE GREAT DEPRESSION OF 2024!\" would follow.\n\nThe political consequences of a rapid economic downturn -- however unlikely -- would be devastating for Harris's campaign. But near-term volatility in the stock market would matter less than some headlines might suggest.\n\n\"I have studied economic factors that influence political outcomes for years now,\" pollster Frank Luntz wrote on X. \"I can state categorically that the stock market doesn't matter - it didn't help Trump when it was up, and it will not hurt Harris when it is down.\"\n\n-- A big source of the downturn? The carry trade. Investors funded risky bets with yen, which has remained weak due to Japan's low interest rates. The Bank of Japan raised rates last week, and Powell signaled that rate cuts in the U.S. were imminent. Once the yen strengthened against the dollar, investors who borrowed yen to fund their bets \"were forced to buy more of the currency by bankers insisting on additional collateral,\" wrote The WSJ's Ryan Dezember. \"That is pushing the yen even higher, prompting more margin calls.\"\n\n-- The Cboe Volatility Index -- known as \"the fear gauge\" -- jumped to a high of 65 before the market open, per The WSJ's Chelsey Dulaney. It closed at 38.57, its highest close since the pandemic.\n\n-- A blip or a trend? After reporting its worst losses since 1987, the Nikkei is projected to open with a bounce on Tuesday, Wayne Cole of Reuters reports.\n\nEmergency cuts? -- Some traders are betting that the Fed will intervene and cut rates in an emergency meeting before it's scheduled to convene in September. That's unlikely, writes The NYT's Jeanna Smialek. \"We've got to be monitoring the real side of the economy: There's nothing in the Fed's mandate that's about making sure the stock market is comfortable,\" Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, told Smialek.\n\n-- \"Policy adjustments will be necessary in the coming quarters,\" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said Monday in a moderated discussion co-hosted by the Hawaii Executive Collaborative, per Bloomberg's Laura Curtis. \"We have now confirmed that the labor market is slowing, and it is extremely important that we not let it slow so much that it tips itself into a downturn.\"\n\nNo recession (at least not yet) -- The Fed's quarterly survey of senior loan officers found that there was basically \"unchanged demand for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans to firms of all sizes\" during the second quarter. It's the first time in two years that loan officers didn't report weaker demand, per Reuters.\n\nHuge antitrust ruling -- The Justice Department and several dozen state attorneys general won a major antitrust case against Google on Monday, Josh Sisco reports. \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta wrote in a 286-page ruling.\n\n-- \"This pro-competition ruling is a victory for the American people. As President Biden and Vice President Harris have long said, Americans deserve an internet that is free, fair, and open for competition,\" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. \"The Biden-Harris agenda is building an economy that ensures entrepreneurs and small businesses have a fair shot at the American Dream.\"\n\nMore Chinese tech restrictions -- Ari Hawkins and Oriana Pawlyk report that the Biden administration could soon crack down on Chinese software for driverless cars.\n\nFannie stays put -- Fannie Mae, the government-controlled mortgage giant, will stay in downtown D.C. after all, having modified its lease agreement with Carr Properties for its Midtown Center offices, Katy O'Donnell reports. \"Our reduced office footprint will allow us to continue to best meet the needs of our employees and business operations while being fiscally responsible,\" the company said in a statement.\n\n-- The WSJ's Gina Heeb reports that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are set to impose tougher standards on commercial real estate lenders and brokers.\n\nSandbox -- A bipartisan group of lawmakers led by Sens. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) plus Reps. French Hill (R-Ark.) and Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) are pitching a bill that would require regulators to create \"regulatory sandboxes\" for financial firms to experiment with artificial intelligence, reports Brendan Pedersen for Punchbowl.\n\nMoritz unloads -- Sequoia Capital Chair Michael Moritz took to The FT's opinion page to argue that many of his peers in Silicon Valley are making a mistake in supporting Trump. \"They are, I suspect, seduced by the notion that because of their means, they will be able to control Trump. And, I imagine they are also committing another cardinal error: deluding themselves that he will not do what he says or promises.\"", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Closing the Monday session down 12.4% and sending shockwaves through global financial markets.\n\nThe dramatic selloff then spread to the U.S. and other major economies.\n\nThe spark was the Bank of Japan's surprise interest rate hike last week. Then came the Federal Reserve's meeting on Wednesday, followed by weaker-than-expected U.S. manufacturing data on Thursday, and a weak labor report on Friday.\n\nThis has all led to an unwinding of the Yen carry trade. A large leveraged position that traders have put on for years, that allows them to borrow Yen at a lower interest rate and invest in US treasuries at a higher rate. The Bank of Japan's interest rate hike last Wednesday started an unwind of the position, and margin calls are now exacerbating the move.\n\nThe US indices were also significantly lower following large declines last Thursday and Friday. Especially after the weekend when reports emerged that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold half of its Apple position and is holding a company record $277 billion in cash.\n\nAs the US markets have declined, the grouping of large technology companies known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" has lost a combined $1.28 trillion in market cap over three sessions.\n\nIn response, the futures market pricing showed that expectations for Fed interest rate cuts surged on Monday morning. With Jeremy Siegel of Wharton's School of Business calling for 150 basis points of rate cuts.\n\n\"I'm calling for a 75 basis point emergency cut in the Fed funds rate, with another 75 basis point cut indicated for next month at the September meeting - and that's minimum,\"\n\n-Jeremy Siegel\n\nThe VIX volatility index surged to 65 on Monday, the highest level the VIX has hit since March 2020, shortly after the Federal Reserve's emergency actions during the Covid-19 pandemic when it rose to 85.\n\nGold and silver prices were down sharply on Monday.

Now it might be too late.\n\n\u00d7 Expand\n\nRichard Drew/AP Photo\n\nA television screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, August 5, 2024, headlines trading as stocks fall.\n\nStock markets around the world plunged into chaos on Monday. It wasn't a full-blown financial panic, but the \"volatility index\" (a measurement of instability in the S&P 500) still spiked dramatically to the highest level since the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Japan, the Nikkei stock index plummeted more than 12 percent, the worst sell-off since 1987. American markets crashed at the open, though regained some of the losses in afternoon trading.\n\nIt is long since time that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell should have started cutting interest rates. A cut in September is now widely predicted. Let's hope it's not too late.\n\nFirst, some background. There appear to be three main factors behind Monday's instability. The first is a growing conviction among financiers that the Federal Reserve has indeed waited too long to cut interest rates. The July jobs report was the weakest since before the pandemic, with just 114,000 new jobs created, and the unemployment rate nudging up to 4.3 percent. As I have argued previously, interest rate movements take a long time to have any effect, while rising unemployment can quickly snowball out of control into a recession. The Fed may now be too late to head off a recession. Some of the bad July numbers may have been due to hurricane weather effects, but that still plays into herd mentality on Wall Street, and in any case there's a decent chance the next several months will also feature hurricanes.\n\nMore from Ryan Cooper\n\nThe second factor is that the AI hype train appears to be slowing. This mania was most evident over the last year by the dozens of random companies -- perhaps dazzled by the overheated promises coming out of Silicon Valley, or just not wanting to miss the next big thing -- releasing AI tools of dubious functionality that no one asked for. The results have been mixed at best.\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence models like Chat GPT or Midjourney are genuinely staggering mathematical artifacts, but never have demonstrated anything like the broad business use cases claimed by boosters like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. It is truly amazing, for instance, that a tech product can write a passable five-paragraph essay on cue, but the world is already drowning in low-quality writing. Worse, these models are hugely more resource-intensive than traditional tech businesses. Unlike software, where the marginal cost of production is virtually nothing, training and running one of these AI models requires a lot of extremely expensive and electricity-gobbling AI chips.\n\nNvidia, which makes most of these chips, was briefly the most valuable company in the world some weeks ago. It's down now in part because of a failure to meet stated production goals, but also because of rising skepticism from places like Goldman Sachs about claims that all the pricey chips Nvidia is selling to other businesses are going to produce the anticipated profits.\n\nMeanwhile, the only story for the Tesla investor cult that is propping up its own preposterous overvaluation is that AI-powered robotaxis are coming any day now. Not only does that appear vanishingly unlikely to happen, but the company's actual business -- selling cars -- is in serious trouble.\n\nMoreover, AI tech also poses a real threat to some actually existing tech companies, above all Google. Most obviously, the internet is already swamped with AI-generated SEO sludge that clutters up its search results, and it's getting worse by the day. Moreover, Google's own AI model, Bard, became the butt of viral jokes overnight when users found it recommending they put glue on their pizza or eat rocks, but that illustrated a very real problem. Those AI results came from Bard repeating joke articles or posts that it ingested without asking (potential copyright infringement is another big legal land mine here). If Google becomes an AI summary machine, thus cutting off traffic to online publishers, then it blows up the social contract that underpins the whole idea of search engines, and hence Google's basic business model.\n\nThe third factor creating Monday's sell-off is the Bank of Japan raising its target interest rate -- only to 0.25 percent, but still the highest level since the 2008 crisis. The goal is reportedly to strengthen the Japanese yen against other currencies, so as to boost domestic spending power and reduce the price of imports. But this also makes Japan's large export sector less competitive, prompting a sell-off that was exacerbated by the fact that so much investment in Japanese firms has been coming from flighty overseas investors of late.\n\nAt any rate, voices on Wall Street are begging for help. On CNBC's Squawk Box, Wharton emeritus professor Jeremy Siegel argued that the Fed should issue an emergency rate cut of 0.75 percent, and cut again by the same amount in December, to prevent a market collapse.\n\nIt all makes for quite the contrast with 2022 and 2023, when analysts were demanding brutal increases in unemployment, and wage growth was viewed as a problem almost by definition (though not by Siegel, to be fair). Economists Larry Summers and Jason Furman predicted that taming inflation would require driving unemployment to 10 percent or 15 percent, respectively. During the Fed's policy committee meeting in July 2023, participants worried that unemployment might get too low, and that \"nominal wages were still rising at rates above levels assessed to be consistent with\" stable prices.\n\nDespite its supposed dual mandate to both stabilize prices and maximize employment, for decades now the Fed has clearly prioritized the former goal. Former Fed chair Janet Yellen, for instance, started raising rates in 2015 after the central bank undershot the inflation target for the previous three consecutive years. But when financial companies are threatened, priorities shift. When high interest rates destabilized Silicon Valley Bank in 2023, for instance, the Fed leaped into action to save it, trampling on precedent and arguably the law to do so.\n\nSo if the value of rich people's portfolios is what it takes for the Fed to stop running the labor market into the ground, that's fine.

Japan had experienced its second-worst stock crash on Monday, which spilled over into crypto and other financial markets.\n\nRelated: US$801 Million Liquidated as BTC Dips Below US$55K, SOL Drops 30%\n\nJapanese stocks fell 12%, the ASX had its worst day since 2020 dropping 3%, while US indexes also took hits: the S&P was down 3%, the Nasdaq 3.4% and the Dow 2.6%.\n\nThere are several reasons for the crash, the Japanese yen carry trade is one, an inflated AI and tech bubble another, but many experts believe the US Fed has been too slow to act on interest rates. While many had expected several rate cuts in 2024, the Federal Reserve had decided to hold off on any cuts at least until September.\n\nSome experts are now calling for an urgent intervention to avoid further downturns. American economist Jeremy Siegel, Professor of Finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and Senior Economist at Wisdom Tree, is one of them.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC's Squawk Box, Siegel called upon the Fed to cut rates immediately by 75 base points rates now and 75 in September.\n\nSiegel said that the US has \"already blown beyond the Fed's 4.2% long-term unemployment rate\" and is close to the Fed's inflation target, questioning why the Fed hasn't lowered its \"very restricted 5.33% Funds rate\" at all. He argued that the funds rate should be 4% or less.\n\nOthers, like Egyptian-American economist and the Chief economic adviser at Allianz, Mohamed Abdullah El-Erian disagree. El-Erian warned that a rushed rate cut - a so-called 'intermeeting cut' as it's between the July and September Fed meetings - would send a 'panic signal' to markets\n\nThe crash saw all crypto assets plummet over the weekend with the worst drops on Monday when Bitcoin fell briefly below US$50k (AU$76.64k) the lowest it has been since February.\n\nWhile BTC lost heavily with total crypto liquidations topping US$1 billion, it wasn't even the hardest hit. Ethereum, on the back of a Jump Crypto sell-off, dropped 25% week-on-week, going from US$3,313 (AU$5,076) in late July to as low as US$2,220 (AU$3,401) on Monday.\n\nRelated: Morgan Stanley to Offer Clients Spot Bitcoin ETFs IBIT and FBTC\n\nAt the time of writing ETH has recovered some of its losses, trading for US$2,520 (AU$3,870), BTC currently trades for US$56,022 (AU$86,034).", "source": {"uri": "cryptonews.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crypto News Australia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aaron_feuerstein@cryptonews.com.au", "name": "Aaron Feuerstein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Securities_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Securities Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wharton_School", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wharton School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allianz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Stanley"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn.cryptonews.com.au/2024/08/06133029/8624SMC.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

It is a strategy in which traders profit from the difference between Japanese and other global interest rates.\n\nHowever, Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said the tapering may have had \"less impact than first thought\" and that \"little has really changed\" for the Japanese economy and its prospects.\n\nMarkets continued to fall in the U.S. as recession fears and the lack of a Fed rate cut spooked investors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed down 3.4 percent, while the Dow and S&P 500 fell 2.6 percent and 3 percent, respectively.\n\nThis followed disappointing employment figures, which raised concerns that the Federal Reserve was too slow to cut interest rates and that the world's largest economy now faces a looming recession.\n\nLater in the day on Monday, however, separate data showed the U.S. services sector rebounded from a four-year low in July, limiting market losses.\n\nFed policymakers also made comments in an attempt to calm market nerves.\n\nWhile there are now calls for an emergency rate cut in the US, current market prices suggest the Fed will wait until its September meeting before easing monetary policy.\n\nCentral bank policy mistakes pose \"the most significant downside macroeconomic risk\" for major economies this year, according to Kallum Pickering, chief economist at Peel Hunt.\n\nHe added: 'While we still expect a soft landing in the US, we have lowered our expectations for near-term real GDP and raised our expectations for the size and pace of the Fed's upcoming cuts.\n\n'Some reliable signals of a US recession, including the yield curve inversion, have been flashing red for months.\n\n'So far, however, economic activity in the US remains extremely strong.\n\n'A key reason for the US strength and positive surprises is that domestic activity has benefited from a massive fiscal stimulus.\n\n'As this support is likely to persist for a long time, it could help limit downside risks as US economic activity slows in the near term.'\n\nDIY INVESTMENT PLATFORMS AJ-Bel AJ-Bel\n\nEasy investing and ready-made portfolios\n\nHargreaves Lansdown Hargreaves Lansdown\n\nFree Fund Trading and Investment Ideas\n\ninteractive investor interactive investor\n\nFixed investment costs from \u00a34.99 per month\n\nSaxo Saxo\n\nGet \u00a3200 back on trading fees\n\nTrading 212 Trading 212\n\nFree trading and no account fees\n\nAffiliate links: If you purchase a product, This is Money may earn a commission.

Instead, (Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome) Powell should make it clear that the Fed is likely to cut the prime interest rate by half a percentage point at its September meeting.\"", "source": {"uri": "alternet.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alternet.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Reich", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert Reich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barron's_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barron's (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Bill_Clinton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=53118906&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C54%2C0%2C70", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 61, "textEnd": 69, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 685, "textEnd": 693}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1}

The Dow plunged more than 1,000 points, or 2.6%, the S&P fell 3% and the Nasdaq dropped 3.4%.\n\nSome market participants said Monday's tumble was overdone. In a note to clients Tuesday, Goldman Sachs analysts noted central banks like the Federal Reserve \"are no longer constrained by the fear of high inflation\" and are ready to lower interest rates. Plus, investors across the spectrum have built up \"very significant cash piles\" that can be used to purchase stocks at their suddenly lower prices, they wrote. And debt among firms remains low, meaning they \"can absorb the impact of weaker growth better than in many other downturns.\"\n\nYet there remains disagreement about how fast the economy is slowing. Analysts with Citibank said Tuesday that they disagreed with the notion that Friday's jobs report, which showed unemployment unexpectedly increasing to 4.3% and just 114,000 jobs added in July, was an outlier data point, as has been suggested by at least two regional Federal Reserve presidents.\n\n\"The unfortunate reality is that a range of data confirm what the rise in the unemployment rate is now prominently signaling -- the U.S. economy is at best at risk of falling into a recession and at worst already has,\" they wrote in a note to clients Tuesday, pointing to a range of data -- from a hiring rate that's slowed to a crawl to increasing unemployment claims -- that things are worse than they seem.\n\nThe focus remains on what the Federal Reserve, which is in charge of balancing inflation and jobs growth via raising and lowering the cost of borrowing, will do after announcing last week that it was leaving rates unchanged.\n\nThat decision has now come to be seen by some analysts as a mistake.\n\nThe Citi analysts said a larger-than-usual 50-basis-point rate cut by the Fed at its next meeting in September is now the most likely scenario and that a potential inter-meeting cut -- usually done only in emergencies -- is \"on the table.\"\n\n\"Data over the next month is likely to confirm the continued slowdown,\" they wrote.\n\nYet others argued there is zero chance that the Fed would make such a move, which is usually reserved for extreme scenarios like the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nTorsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said in a note Tuesday that the economy remains in decent shape.\n\n\"If the economy were crashing, default rates would be spiking higher, and that is not what the data shows.\" he wrote.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikkei 225"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citibank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Citibank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Global_Management", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apollo Global Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UoY8FnitKdbbaoyZbbaK2Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_nbc_universal_184/07a39c1f57d8aaadcdd1adde463e4cc6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791765", "eventUri": "eng-9791765", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 105, "relevance": 1}

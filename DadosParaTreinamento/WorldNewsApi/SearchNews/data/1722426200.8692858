Medical professionals are cautioning that an intense hankering for salty snacks like crisps and pickles might be indicative of Addison's disease. A case study published in the journal Pediatrics Child Health detailed the diagnosis of a 15-year-old girl from Toronto, Canada, who was hospitalised after months of unexplained symptoms. These included severe dizziness, fatigue, dehydration, and an insatiable desire for salty treats.

Located atop the kidneys, these glands are crucial for producing hormones that regulate metabolism, immune system, blood pressure, stress response, and other vital functions. This led to the diagnosis of Addison's disease, a rare disorder affecting one in 100,000 people. The condition arises when the adrenal glands fail to produce sufficient hormones, resulting in nausea, abdominal pain, weight loss, dark skin patches, and even salt cravings. As per the NHS, Addison's disease can be managed with lifelong hormone replacement therapy. However, if left untreated, the condition can be life-threatening. The disease can upset the body's hormonal balance and affect sodium and potassium levels, which are crucial for regulating blood pressure, muscle function, kidney function, and cell nutrients. Healthy sodium levels should be between 136 to 145 millimoles per litre (mmol/L), as this is necessary for controlling the water content in and around cells and for generating electrical signals between nerves, allowing the brain to communicate with the rest of the body. When the Canadian patient arrived at the hospital, her sodium level was approximately 130mmol/L, despite consuming jars of pickles, handfuls of chips, and heavily salting her meals, according to Mail Online. It is estimated that about 80 per cent of people with Addison's disease experience salt cravings because the condition causes them to excrete an excessive amount of sodium in their urine. In contrast, her potassium levels were on the high end of the scale at five mmol/L. Excessive potassium can disrupt vital electrical impulses that control the heartbeat, potentially leading to a life-threatening irregular heart rhythm. Despite drinking three litres of water daily, the patient had an insatiable thirst. The NHS lists increased thirst as a symptom of Addison's disease due to the way it affects the body's ability to regulate water levels. In 70 to 90 per cent of cases, Addison's disease is caused by an issue with the immune system, which leads it to attack the adrenal gland's outer layer (the adrenal cortex). Some other potential triggers range from conditions that can cause damage to the adrenal glands such as tuberculosis (TB), although this is quite rare in the UK. The NHS asserts that symptoms at the early stages of Addison's disease could be similar to more common health issues like clinical depression or the flu. Signs can comprise: Lack of energy or motivation (fatigue) Muscle weakness Low mood Loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss Increased thirst. As time goes on, these problems might escalate leaving you with further symptoms such as lightheadedness, fainting spells, cramps and extreme tiredness. Additionally, small patches of darkened skin may appear, or your lips or gums could darken in colour. The NHS recommends: \"Although these symptoms are not always caused by Addison's disease, you should see a GP so they can be investigated.\"", "summary": "A teenager with an insatiable craving for salty snacks was diagnosed with a rare but deadly condition, according to a study in the journal Pediatrics Child Health", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/red-flag-warning-sign-anyone-29409618", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/article29409615.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_man-eating-crisps.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:30:00", "author": "Annabal Bagdi,Fiona Callingham", "authors": ["Annabal Bagdi", "Fiona Callingham"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.295}

Col. Jefferson Grimes told Task and Purpose. They were flying an AH-64 Apache helicopter during the 1st Combat Aviation Brigade's gunnery training when the incident occurred.\n\n\"The crew is receiving all necessary medical treatment,\" Grimes told Task and Purpose. \"They are in stable condition.\"\n\nThe circumstances of the crash have not been announced yet. The incident remains under investigation.\n\nApache AH-64 helicopters require a two-person team in order to fly. One person flies the aircraft and the other operates the weapons systems.\n\nPowered by twin turboshaft engines, Apache helicopters can swiftly navigate through various terrains, from dense urban environments to rugged mountain ranges, with impressive speed and agility. The robust airframe, equipped with sophisticated avionics and sensor systems, enables pilots to engage targets with precision-guided munitions, including Hellfire missiles, rockets, and a 30mm chain gun.\n\nFort Riley is in the Flint Hills Region of Kansas. There are around15,000 active duty service members assigned to Fort Riley.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the Army for comment.\n\nTuesday's Apache crash was the latest in a rising trend of aircraft crashes among Army soldiers. The pattern has forced officials to take measures to reinforce aviation training.\n\nThe Army announced mandatory training to reinforce basic flying skills for all aviators in April, following a series of 12 crashes in the past six months. Nine soldiers and one border patrol agent were killed as a result of those crashes.\n\nThe 12 reported crashes involved 11 helicopters and one C-12 fixed-wing aircraft. Two of the crashes happened within just days of each other in Colorado and Washington in March, leaving four crew members injured. Both of those incidents involved Army AH-64 Apache helicopters, Army Times reported.\n\nIn February, the Army National Guard ordered a component-wide pause on flight missions after two AH-64D Apache helicopters crashed. Units across the nation were ordered to \"review safety policies and procedures.\"\n\nA UH-72 Lakota helicopter also crashed in February, resulting in three fatalities.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jenna_sundel@newsweek.com", "name": "Jenna Sundel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_AH-64_Apache", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing AH-64 Apache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Riley", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fort Riley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_Aviation_Brigade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Combat Aviation Brigade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Infantry_Division_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1st Infantry Division (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_affairs_(military)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public affairs (military)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_colonel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant colonel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airborne forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM-114_Hellfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AGM-114 Hellfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_Hills", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flint Hills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turboshaft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turboshaft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avionics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Avionics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_duty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Active duty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision-guided_munition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Precision-guided munition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurocopter_UH-72_Lakota", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eurocopter UH-72 Lakota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Army Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beechcraft_C-12_Huron", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beechcraft C-12 Huron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2390650/apache-helicopter.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=70c807a176dfc056315bd2563bed5b2e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553051", "eventUri": "eng-9553051", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

It's unclear what caused the crash, and officials are investigating the incident.\n\nThe Army has been marred by a seemingly constant string of helicopter incidents, particularly among Apache and Black Hawk helicopters. Last year, the service saw 10 incidents, including 14 fatalities -- far outpacing deaths occurring in combat operations abroad.\n\nRead Next: Army Pumping Millions into Food Kiosks, But They May Soon Be Obsolete\n\nArmy aircraft have been grounded twice since the spring of last year -- once servicewide after nine soldiers died in April 2023 in a crash that involved two Black Hawk helicopters out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky.\n\nThat incident marked one of the deadliest training mishaps in Army history. Later that month, three 11th Airborne Division soldiers died when two Apaches collided.\n\nLast year's incidents also include a November crash in which five Army special operations soldiers died in a Black Hawk crash in the Mediterranean Sea, off the coast of Cyprus.\n\nAs frequent as last year's crashes were, incident rates with Army aviation so far this year are roughly three times that compared to last year, according to data provided by the service.\n\nUnits were ordered in early April to go over safety procedures and other additional training by Friday. However, the service has been short on answers as to why incidents are on the rise.\n\nThe incidents have been partly attributed to pilots flying less with the winding down of the post-9/11 wars. Since 2012, flight hours across the Army's top three helicopter platforms have dipped dramatically, according to data provided by the Army.\n\nFlight time with the Apache dropped the most -- about 50%. Chinook pilots have 36% less time in the air, and the Black Hawk, the service's premier workhorse, is flying 25% less.\n\nService officials have historically been swift to place blame on service members and slow to examine equipment or training doctrine relevant to safety concerns.\n\n\"If we have known issues with certain helicopters, we need to know so we can resource your department in a manner that protects the lives of our brave women and men in uniform,\" Sen.

That incident came just a few days after an Apache helicopter accident in Washington state.\n\nThose mishaps followed a pair of AH-64D Apache helicopter crashes in February, which led the Army National Guard to order a component-wide pause on flight missions.", "source": {"uri": "militarytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Military Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_lehrfeld@militarytimes.com", "name": "Jonathan Lehrfeld", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_AH-64_Apache", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing AH-64 Apache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Infantry_Division_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "1st Infantry Division (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Riley", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fort Riley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junction_City,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Junction City, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Junction City, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_Aviation_Brigade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Combat Aviation Brigade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_colonel_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant colonel (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infantry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Carson", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort Carson"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Carson"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Living_History/By_Time_Period", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Living History/By Time Period", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Land_Forces", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Land Forces", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.militarytimes.com/resizer/-a5_n5tmEaQgeMXoPuG-4CcEhdk=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/archetype/BXW6CBFL4NA6BEBUEUF37OPHKQ.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553051", "eventUri": "eng-9553051", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-27", "textStart": 1042, "textEnd": 1050}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Army officials announced in April that all aviation units would be required to undergo mandatory training to reinforce basic flying skills following 12 crashes in the past six months that had killed nine soldiers and one Border Patrol agent.\n\nAt the time, 11 helicopters and one C-12 fixed-wing aircraft have crashed since October,\n\nBrig. Gen. Jon Byrom, commanding general of the U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center, told reporters during an April 10 roundtable.\n\nBy comparison, the Army recorded nine Class A Mishaps - which involve the loss of life or at least $2.5 million in damage - for all Fiscal Year 2023.\n\n\"We understand how to train ourselves,\" Maj. Gen. Walter T. Rugen, director of Army aviation, said at the roundtable. \"We understand what the standards are, and we just want to make sure everybody is aware of those standards and then they're performing to standard.\"", "source": {"uri": "taskandpurpose.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Task & Purpose"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_schogol@taskandpurpose.com", "name": "Jeff Schogol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_AH-64_Apache", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing AH-64 Apache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_&_Purpose", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Task & Purpose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Riley", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fort Riley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Infantry_Division_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1st Infantry Division (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_colonel_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant colonel (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_Aviation_Brigade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Combat Aviation Brigade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military.com", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Army aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major general (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigadier_general_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brigadier general (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-wing_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixed-wing aircraft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2024/05/08/Fort-Riley-Apache-scaled.jpg?auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553051", "eventUri": "eng-9553051", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-10", "textStart": 1407, "textEnd": 1415}], "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

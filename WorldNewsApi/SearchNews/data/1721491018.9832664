Models like Microsoft\u2019s ChatGPT, Google\u2019s Gemini and Meta AI all admit to using Canadian news to either train or provide answers to users\u2019 questions. It will be up to Canada\u2019s broadcasting regulator to determine if AI services are reproducing news as defined in the law, said Heritage Minister Pascale St-Onge\u2019s office. \u201cWe are closely monitoring developments in artificial intelligence and their implications for the news media sector,\u201d the office said in a statement. Companies had until last week to notify the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission whether the law applies to any of their platforms. That list has not yet been made public. Meta said it remains exempt from the law because its AI system draws from sources across the web that are not restricted by the legislation. Google is already set to receive an exemption, after it negotiated a deal with the government to set up a media fund, while Microsoft didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.", "summary": "It will be up to Canada's broadcasting regulator to determine if AI services are reproducing news as defined in the law, the heritage minister's office said", "url": "https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/ai-chatbots-online-news-act", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/nationalpost/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ChatGPT-1.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:02:59", "author": "The Canadian Press", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.291}

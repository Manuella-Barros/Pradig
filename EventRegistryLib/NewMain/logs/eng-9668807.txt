However, he did share a rare insight into his anxieties around fame, how he handles it, and walking in the shadow of Lopez's spotlight.\n\nHe alluded to Lopez a few times through the episode, revealing to Hart that, \"My wife will tell you, I like to talk.\" He also shared how he discusses parenting with Lopez and raising their five children -- his three with Jennifer Garner and two step-children with Lopez -- with money -- as opposed to how he and Lopez grew up.\n\n\"I like this life for them better than the one I had and that's the balance, and I talk to Jennifer about that a lot,\" he said.\n\nIt wasn't until the end of the episode where he recalled a story with Lopez and the chaos that surrounds her when she steps out in public.\n\n\"My daughter is always throwing out titles to her autobiography,\" Affleck explained. \"We went somewhere with [Lopez] -- I can't remember because she's so famous, and she creates this -- people love her, and she really represents something important to people,\" Affleck says. \"[To me,] People are like, 'Hey, I like your movie,' and then they're like 'AAAHHHH! J-LO!,'\" he yelled. \"It's amazing, you know what I mean?,\" he told Hart with a smile across his face.\n\n\"I think it was when we rolled through Times Square,\" he continued. \"We get out of the car, we were going to a play, and I was like, 'F--k it, babe, we're going to be late, we gotta walk a block and a half.' [Lopez] was like, 'Alright,' she didn't say s--t.\"\n\n\"We get out with her, all the kids, through Times Square, and the s--t was like f--kin' bananas,\" Affleck said. \"I was like, 'Oh my God.' There was a lady, she was smoking weed, in a full purple skintight suit -- she's a heavy lady -- and she starts running backwards filming, going 'J-LO!!' Like a herald, that then gets everyone else, and then all the tourists come in,\" he continued to recall.\n\n\"Then we've got our five kids, it's me and Jen and what feels like hundreds of people, and they're all screaming. And my daughter just turns to me and goes, 'J-Lo Was My Stepmother,'\" Affleck continued. \"And I was like, alright that's a good title,\" referring back to her initial autobiography title.\n\nEarlier in the interview, Affleck explained why he has \"resting b---h face\" -- or in his words \"resting hard face\" -- when asked by Hart about his work behind the camera and if he prefers one over the other.\n\n\"First of all, I'm also a little bit shy, I don't like a lot of attention,\" Affleck told Hart. \"This is why people see me and they're like, 'Why's this dude always mad?,'\" he said, referring to what's become known as his \"resting b---h face,\" often caught by paparazzi.\n\nHe explained that he doesn't like being photographed when he's with his children, \"because somebody has their camera and stick it in my face and I'm like, 'Okay, here we go.'\"\n\nAffleck further shared how he finds the public is often \"projecting something\" onto him that he doesn't feel about himself \"at all\".\n\n\"It's taught me that the projection that people get is not necessarily one... If you want to, and I know people that do this and are very good at it and I envy them,\" Affleck began.\n\n\"'It's an act', The whole f--king thing's an act now. Instagram's an act, social media is an act. What image do you want to put? What do you want to show people to make them interested in this act that you're doing?\" Affleck said. \"Because nobody is posting their lowest moment, no one is advertising like, 'I'm an a--hole, look how horrendous I am. You have an outside version of your life that's curated that you're advertising on social media.\"\n\nSome people have speculated that the rumored separation between Affleck and Lopz may have something to do with her fame and outsized presence online while Affleck prefers to lay low.\n\nTMZ reported that Affleck and Lopez are trying to sell the marital home they bought last year for $60 million, with Affleck reportedly staying at a rental in Brentwood.

Magazine reported, through anonymous sources, that Lopez is also angry at Affleck's pal Matt Damon for the same reason. \"She's furious with everyone on Team Ben, including Matt Damon and Jen,\" the site reported, also naming Affleck's mom.\n\nThe new report, which was published on June 19, comes as TMZ shared photos and a video showing Lopez vacationing in Positano, Italy, without Affleck or her kids. She was seen getting on a boat with friends and seemed to be in a cheerful mood, TMZ reported. Around the same time, Affleck was spotted on a motorcycle in California with Samuel, 12, one of the three kids he shares with Garner, TMZ reported. He was also seen having a large silver Airstream RV delivered to his rental property.\n\nIn the past, the couple traveled together during summers.\n\nAffleck and Garner have been spotted visiting each other's homes; for example, Affleck was seen visiting Garner on Father's Day, according to Daily Mail.\n\nIn early June, TMZ reported that Lopez and Affleck have separated and are trying to sell their marital home, with Affleck moving into a rental property in Brentwood. However, Lopez and Affleck have not confirmed a split.\n\nThe OK! Magazine report said that Lopez is \"upset with Matt Damon, Jennifer Garner and her mother-in-law, Christine Anne Boldt\" because she believes they have been \"supporting\" Affleck during the talk of marital turmoil.\n\n\"J.Lo's relationship with Christine has always been tense,\" the source told OK!. \"Christine's extremely close to Ben's first wife, Jennifer Garner, and thinks he made the biggest mistake of his life by letting her go.\"\n\nThe source continued to OK: \"J.Lo can't help but think Christine is poisoning his head against her and thinks it's pathetic that Ben's run back to his mommy.\"\n\nA source told OK! that Affleck has been \"leaning\" on Damon during the marriage issues, and noted that he is co-parenting with Garner. Lopez, Affleck, and Garner have both attended graduation events recently for two of the kids Garner and Affleck share.\n\nAnother person who isn't too pleased with Garner trying so much to help Affleck is her current boyfriend, businessman John Miller, according to Daily Mail.\n\nA source told Daily Mail that it \"bothers\" Miller that Garner is trying to \"fix\" the marriage between Affleck and Lopez.\n\n\"He cares deeply for Ben and sympathizes with what he is going through with Jennifer, but that doesn't mean Jen should be the one to fix her ex-husband's issues with his current wife. That makes no sense to anyone,\" the source told Daily Mail.\n\n\"Jen is such a caring and wonderful woman and mother and there is nothing but a deep friendship and bond between her and Ben,\" the source added to Daily Mail.\n\nContinued the source, \"John wants nothing more than for Ben to be okay, but it isn't his girlfriend's responsibility to play babysitter to him. That is for Ben to figure out on his own and for his wife to handle. It isn't Jen's responsibility, and he has told her this.\"", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_mcbride@heavy.com", "name": "Jessica McBride", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Garner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Garner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK!", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OK!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Damon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Damon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Garner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Garner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recreational vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motorcycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Father's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentwood,_Essex", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brentwood, Essex"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brentwood, Essex"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Articles", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Information", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Information", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/jennifer-lopez-garner.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668807", "eventUri": "eng-9668807", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 283, "textEnd": 290}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

She canceled the 2024 tour that was scheduled to kick off in July in order to 'recollect herself.'\n\n'She is excited about going on tour next year when her personal life is on calmer ground and she can connect with her fans. She will take her tribe with her and make the most of it,' said the source.\n\nLopez is also said to be 'shocked' by the bad press she has been getting, which she believes is not fair.\n\n'If people could see what she has really gone through they would be easier on her,' said the source.\n\n'Ben is a great guy but he can be grumpy and a downer. I think the world saw that in photos like when they were at the Grammys last year; he wouldn't smile. If they saw how it really was, they would not attack her,' said the friend of Jennifer.\n\n'He chain smokes and cusses and seems irritated a lot of the time. Great director and actor, but not a lot of laughs with him, you know?' said the source. 'He is a wonderful father though.'\n\nLopez plans on pushing on.\n\n'She is really not used to this kind of bad feedback, but she will get over it. She will march on,' said the pal.\n\n'Jennifer is a very smart and strong woman and she will bounce back, she always does!'\n\nThese days she has been leaning on her close friends.\n\nOne is stylist Shawn Barton, whose nickname is Beezy. Another is vocal coach Stevie Mackey.\n\nThe singer is sad about the end of her nuptials but 'is trying to make the best of it by working out, spending time with her twins and making new plans for 2025' (seen with Emme on June 8)\n\nThere have been many reports that Ben and Jennifer will announce their divorce soon and plan to do it on a Friday, which is the norm among celebrities who are splitting.\n\nWhen the source was asked about this they offered, 'I think they have wanted to wait until all the kids are out of school and done with school plans and all that before they make their big announcement. They are putting the kids first.'\n\nRead MoreEXCLUSIVE Tell-tale sign Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck's marriage is over revealed in new photos of $60m home\n\nAnd as far as how Jennifer and Ben are getting along these days, the insider said they are being 'cordial' with each other.\n\nSo what happened to the once jovial Ben who used to smile at fans and make out with Jennifer in public?\n\nThe source points to the pressure in Ben's career.\n\n'He is now filming Accounting 2 and the hours are really long, he is working hard at it and it's a lot to juggle with marriage and kids,' said the source. 'So sometimes he is not in the best mood.'\n\nMeanwhile, Lopez cleared her schedule this summer to give herself some downtime to re-examine her life.\n\n'She is living alone and not with Ben, I think everyone knows that already, so that is a major change for her and the kids,' said the pal. Indeed, Ben moved into a $100K a month rental near Garner months ago.\n\n'Of course Jenny is sad, she loves Ben, but they are just too different, there is no give and take, there was no blending, they are just on separate tracks.'\n\nThe source added that Jennifer gave it her all: 'She really tried hard to make it work, and it just did not work.\n\n'She invested a lot of time and energy, and I think he did the same. There is no one to blame here. It just was not in the cards. It is very hard for two massive stars to keep a marriage going, one has to give in, and in this case neither gave in.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail

After splitting two decades ago, they each went on to marry and have children with other people.\n\nLopez is mom to twins Emme and Max, whom she shares with ex-husband Marc Anthony, while Affleck welcomed Violet and Fin, in addition to Samuel, with Jennifer Garner.\n\nNext: Why Fans Think Jennifer Lopez Hinted at Relationship Problems With Ben Affleck", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yasmine_coleman@postandcourier.com", "name": "Yasmine Coleman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Affleck", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Affleck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selena", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Selena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_View_(talk_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The View (talk show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Stern", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Howard Stern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Behar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joy Behar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Short film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Father's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Garner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Garner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/c0/6c0c7595-8021-51e6-ae8f-0ae8875c03ad/6674775891d39.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668807", "eventUri": "eng-9668807", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 278, "textEnd": 285}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

She was with a few friends as they made their way to a boat. Her rock-hard abs were on display, thanks to a yellow crop top and fitted print shorts. Her sun-kissed skin also showed off the signature J.Lo glow from the perfect holiday weather -- she looked stunning! Without a care in the world, Lopez looked unbothered by all of the stress she was facing back in the U.S.\n\nLopez and Affleck have tried hard to keep things amicable, attending their blended family's end-of-the-year events -- from graduations to sporting events, they've been there. The duo then heads in opposite directions, though, with Lopez retreating to the couple's $61 million Beverly Hills estate and Affleck to his rented Brentwood home. The property is on the market for $65 million, but they haven't said a word about the state of their marriage so far.\n\nAffleck is reportedly the one who is ready to throw in the towel with their relationship. \"The last thing Ben wants to do is hurt Jen. He still loves and respects her,\" a source told In Touch. \"And, of course, the family situation comes into this heavily, which is why he's agreed to do this in a civilized and loving way, just like he did with Jennifer Garner.\"\n\nThe estranged couple hasn't shown a united front in quite some time, and that's probably why it feels like they are winding things down.

(The couple will celebrate their two-year wedding anniversary on July 16 -- well, hopefully.)\n\nSpeaking of hope, there was that in droves after Lopez posted a photo of Affleck for Father's Day this past Sunday -- curiously, a shot from Affleck's 2001 film Pearl Harbor -- and called him \"our hero.\" (Affleck is dad to kids Violet, Seraphina, and Samuel with ex-wife Jennifer Garner; Lopez shares twins Max and Emme with ex-husband Marc Anthony.) Though Lopez and Affleck have enjoyed Italy together in the past -- they honeymooned in 2022 in Milan and Lake Como, took a birthday trip to Capri, and last summer visited Italy again together -- he seemed to be a no show this time as divorce seems more and more likely for the pair.\n\n\"They can't get on the same page [and] have been discussing divorce as an option,\" a source told Us Weekly. As the two attempt to sell their $61 million Beverly Hills marital home -- purchased just last year -- \"Jennifer is distraught,\" they said. \"She wants to sell their house off-market to try and get less attention surrounding it.\" Meanwhile, \"Ben doesn't care about the negative attention,\" they added. \"He's been through this before, and it doesn't faze him.\"\n\nA second source told Us Weekly that \"It has been really hard for her, and she is trying to figure out her next act,\" and yet another source told the outlet that \"Jennifer has been trying for months to make it work and is pushing to fix things.\"\n\nAs their marriage remains in limbo, Lopez is in Positano, a cliffside village on southern Italy's Amalfi Coast, Page Six reports, and she was \"with several friends who were close by her side, both on land and on the water,\" according to Entertainment Tonight. The Daily Mail reports that Lopez \"feels like she did all she could to salvage her marriage,\" the outlet writes, citing a music industry source as saying that \"Jenny has had enough, and she really tried, but she can do no more,\" they said. \"It's not getting any better -- it's worse.\"\n\nShe is now \"trying to make the best\" of her time by focusing on Max and Emme and on her career. \"She is excited about going on tour next year when her personal life is on calmer ground and she can connect with her fans,\" they said. \"She will take her tribe with her and make the most of it.\"",

I'm like, people are projecting something onto me that I don't feel about myself at all,\" Affleck explained. \"Whether it's a certain look or, I don't know, role or something... For a long time they'd be like, this guy's a frat guy. I've never been in a fraternity one day in my life! Never once been inside of a frat house, nothing against it. How can I have anything against it? I've never been there. But I dunno why you are all saying I'm a frat guy either. What does that mean? I'm like, I didn't go to college.\"\n\nHart and Affleck filmed their conversation in January. \"Hart to Heart\" is streaming now on Peacock.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The singer was spotted in Positano this week, and she was without her famous husband as well as her two children, Max and Emme. JLo was spotted hanging out on a boat with a few friends as she looked to be relaxing while soaking up the sun. She sported a yellow bandeau top and a pair of shorts as she went for a less glam look than usual.\n\nTMZ reports that Jennifer Lopez looked relaxed and happy as she enjoyed her time in the Italian sunshine. The outlet claims that the solo vacation comes at a time when JLo and Ben Affleck are dodging serious divorce rumors. Not only has Affleck moved out of their shared home, but they're also selling their lavish mansion. The pair haven't announced a split, and are still spending time together in public sporadically. However, there have been no signs that the relationship is getting any better.\n\nMeanwhile, The Daily Mail suggests that Lopez's solo trip to Italy may be the final nail in the coffin for her marriage to Affleck. The couple is spending a lot of time apart, which may well be a sign that their relationship is falling apart. It may also hint that divorce may be around the corner. Of course, fans have plenty to say about JLo and Ben's relationship status.\n\n\"JLo is has always been more married to her career than to any of her husbands,\" one person commented. \"Hard to make a marriage work if you do not share the same values. Ben seems to value privacy and his children. JLo seems to value Benny, her entourage and the spotlight,\" another said.\n\n\"I don't think she is someone who has made many friends in her life - she seems to just have her management, producer, agent and immediate family. Her best friend seems to be the spotlight and it's fading,\" a third person commented.\n\nIt could be that Jennifer Lopez is simply taking some time to rest and recharge during this hectic time in her life. She's been dealt several blows as of late. She might need some time to unwind. A solo trip could be what she needs to clear her head before making a big decision about her marriage. However, she may also be planning her next move.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the rest of the summer plays out for Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck. Will they spend their second anniversary together, or will they announce their divorce?

And she starts running backwards filming going 'J.Lo!' like a herald that then gets everybody else -- and they're all tourists -- just whoosh!\"\n\nHowever, the fanfare proved thoroughly entertaining for Affleck's kids, who have a long-standing joke of coming up with hypothetical titles for their future autobiographies.\n\n\"My daughter just turns to me,\" the actor noted, \"and goes, 'J.Lo Was My Stepmother.' I was like, 'That's a good title.' Could be a lot worse than that.\"\n\nJokes aside, Affleck also got candid about witnessing the negative effects all the media attention surrounding him, Lopez and Garner has had on their children.\n\n\"Every day I'm alive I want to make sure I'm doing the right thing by them, making their lives better,\" he reflected. \"And that doesn't mean that sometimes I don't come home and I see that they've gone through some bulls--t. It breaks my heart where I'm like, 'This s--t would never happen if I wasn't in this life.' And it's hard. I really, really f--king second guess it a lot.\"\n\nHowever, Affleck acknowledged their fame does have benefits.\n\n\"But I also know I like this life better for them than the one I had,\" he added. \"And that's the balance. And I talk with Jennifer about that a lot as we look at what's the difference between our kids lives.\"\n\nKeep reading to look back at Affleck and Lopez's decades-long relationship.

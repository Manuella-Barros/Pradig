{"id": 231306726, "title": "Biden and Macron stress a shared vision on Ukraine and Gaza even amid bubbling disagreements - POLITICO", "text": "Macron had hoped to announce around this week\u2019s D-day celebrations that France was going ahead with its plan to send up to several hundred soldiers to Ukraine to train up mine clearance teams and an armed vehicle brigade. But the plan appears to have hit a snag, complicated by threats of retaliation from Russia and the politics of this week\u2019s EU elections. According to several French officials, Macron is still engaged in discussions about leading a coalition of countries that will send trainers to Ukraine. And during a press conference with Zelenskyy Friday evening, he said other NATO countries have already agreed to join a coalition and that he plans to finalize it \u201cin the coming days.\u201d Biden, meanwhile, is eager to move Macron his way on a plan to leverage $300 billion in seized Russian assets to generate additional aid for Ukraine now. Going into Saturday\u2019s meeting, France remained the lone holdout among G7 allies on a U.S. plan to give Ukraine a $50 billion loan that would be repaid with interest from the seized assets. Biden met last week with Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo to discuss the practicalities of the plan \u2014 the bulk of the seized assets are currently held in Brussels \u2014 and the EU has given its initial approval. Aides are optimistic they\u2019ll be able to get Macron on board in time for a formal announcement at next week\u2019s G7 summit in southern Italy. The leaders did not respond to a shouted question about that apparent impasse, instead walking off stage together after 18 minutes of comments to the press. Addressing economic frictions will also be a major part of Saturday\u2019s agenda. Macron, staring down an electoral rebuke on Sunday with his party expected to finish second or third in France\u2019s EU elections, needs the U.S. to soften its America-first trade policies that have softened growth across Europe \u2014 and left leaders like himself and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz politically vulnerable. Europe, among allies, has borne the brunt of the economic fallout of the war in Ukraine after agreeing to halt imports of Russian energy and imposing sanctions on the Kremlin. Biden\u2019s subsidies for manufacturing in the U.S., which Macron has criticized, could further harm European industries by diverting business investment. While few experts expect any further remedy or carve-out for European producers before the end of Biden\u2019s term, Macron hopes that continued talks may eventually bear more fruit \u2014 especially after meeting last month with Chinese President Xi Jinping about resolving trade disputes that could allow Beijing greater economic influence in Europe. Biden, meanwhile, is hoping to convince France and the rest of the EU to join the U.S. in boxing out Beijing from the global marketplace by raising tariffs on Chinese goods. Macron has been nervous about letting Washington dictate Europe\u2019s approach to Beijing, warning in an interview last year that continental leaders shouldn\u2019t \u201cblindly\u201d follow the U.S. and get dragged into a messy trade war at a time when the economy is shaky and war has returned to European soil. The two leaders attempted to showcase their alignment when they issued statements to the press following their meetings on Saturday and before the state visit took a more ceremonial turn that evening. It\u2019s the only state visit invitation that Biden accepted in this reelection year, a sign, aides said, of the president\u2019s affinity for Macron and the importance he places on the U.S.-French relationship. But even that element of Biden\u2019s visit was the subject of an intense back and forth among aides on both sides, as the White House refused to agree to Macron\u2019s request for a longer, more freewheeling joint press conference, according to two people familiar with the planning and negotiations. Both were granted anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Asked about the lack of a press conference on a state visit between two leaders who prize democracy, Kirby had little to say. \u201cThis was the arrangement that was made,\u201d he said.", "summary": "The two leaders met on Saturday as questions persist over the future of Ukraine funding and a peace proposal for Gaza.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/08/biden-macron-france-00162397", "image": "https://static.politico.com/c9/e4/6da6b1ee435c8ff8dd5eb73337d3/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1491671682", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:25:59", "author": "Clea Caulcutt,Eli Stokols", "authors": ["Clea Caulcutt", "Eli Stokols"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "eu", "sentiment": -0.094}

Again, Hamlin is in the mix to win his first career Cup title. Again, Hamlin knows his season will be judged not on his start, but on his finish.\n\nCan he ever get over the hump in the No. 11 Toyota and score NASCAR's biggest prize, the pursuit of which has caused him all kinds of heartache through the years?\n\nPeople are also reading...

But if he doesn't win it all, Hamlin seems at peace with the knowledge that his career has hovered in the rarified air as one of the best in NASCAR history.\n\nHis 54th career win -- one he predicted on his podcast -- was just the latest reminder of his elite ability behind the wheel. Hamlin tied Lee Petty for 12th on the career wins list, and only Hall of Famers Kyle Busch and recently-retired Kevin Harvick are ahead of him.\n\nHamlin can't knock 'em. As for the \"does a championship define greatness?\" crowd, Hamlin told the haters to take a hike.\n\n\"I know that I'm a championship-caliber driver,\" Hamlin said. \"I'll just say it. I think there's been worse drivers to win a championship than me.\"\n\nLike who?\n\nStroll through the garage or flip through the history book and it's easy to find championship drivers Hamlin would be foolish to trade careers with just for a title.\n\n\u25a0\" Brad Keselowski won the 2012 championship but has only three other top-five series finishes over that span and is winless (he has 35 overall) since 2021. Hamlin also has three Daytona 500 victories to none for Keselowski.\n\n\u25a0\" Matt Kenseth is as respected as any driver in recent NASCAR history and currently serves as a competition advisor for Legacy Motor Club. His one win in his 2003 championship season made him a scapegoat the following year when NASCAR upended the championship process and moved to a playoff-type format. Kenseth won 39 career races.\n\n\" \u25a0 Hey, who doesn't love Dale Jarrett? The popular NBC announcer failed to win a race in his first four seasons and had only two wins in his last four full seasons. He did win four of his 32 career races in his 1999 championship season.\n\n\" The Labonte Brothers. Terry Labonte won 22 times over a whopping 890 career Cup starts. In an era where slow-and-steady won the championship race, Labonte won Cup titles in 1984 and 1996 -- with a combined four wins. Bobby Labonte needed 729 races to win 21 times. He did win five times in 1999 and four times in 2000, when he won his only career Cup championship.\n\n\u25a0\" Would Hamlin trade careers with his JGR teammate and 2017 champion Martin Truex Jr.? What about 2023 champ Ryan Blaney? Surely not.\n\nConsider, since Hamlin's rookie season in 2006, he has only one winless year (2018) and posted 8, 7 and 6 win-seasons at JGR.\n\n\"I care about wins and winning every single week because in the end I absolutely would take 60-some wins and no championship over 20 and one,\" Hamlin said. \"It's just not even close.\"\n\nThe 43-year-old Hamlin and Junior Johnson are the only drivers in the 50win Cup Club without a championship.\n\n\"This team definitely has all the makings of,\" a championship season, Hamlin crew chief Chris Gabehart said. \"Denny is doing a phenomenal job as a driver. The car, the new Toyota Camry, it's really given us a lot to work with. Everybody at Joe Gibbs Racing is really pulling the rope and excited to win races.\"\n\nHamlin and Christopher Bell have delivered four wins this season to JGR. William Byron has three wins and Kyle Larson and Chase Elliott each have one to give Hendrick Motorsports five checkered flags in 2024. The Ford teams -- like Team Penske and Stewart-Haas Racing -- have been flat this season, which has already created some massive separation between the contenders and the rest of the field. The first 11 races could just be a preview for what's ahead in a season that stretches into November.\n\n\"I think we have got off to a good start, Hendrick and us,\" Gibbs said. \"This is very competitive. I think that's what we'll see as we go forward.\"\n\nHamlin had some fun after the race when he pointed toward the Dover scoring pylon with his 11 in the top spot and posted a photo on social media with the caption \" pylon works.\" Hamlin trolled Talladega and Texas after the tracks removed the scoring pylons in moves that offended NASCAR traditionalists.\n\nAt last check, Phoenix Raceway, the site of the NASCAR championship race, still had a scoring pylon.\n\nWinning that title sure would be nice. Ending the season with a few more wins to jolt him higher on the careers list just might be even better.\n\n\"It's my personal goal, in my career I want to get to a number that puts me well inside that top 10 of race winners,\" he said. \"I think that will speak for itself and the resume.\"\n\nTags Sports Games And Toys Motor Racing Job Market Motor Vehicles Be the first to know\n\nGet local

He did win four of his 32 career races in his 1999 championship season.\n\n\" \u25a0The Labonte Brothers. Terry Labonte won 22 times over a whopping 890 career Cup starts. In an era where slow-and-steady won the championship race, Labonte won Cup titles in 1984 and 1996 -- with a combined four wins. Bobby Labonte needed 729 races to win 21 times. He did win five times in 1999 and four times in 2000, when he won his only career Cup championship.\n\n\" \u25a0Would Hamlin trade careers with his JGR teammate and 2017 champion Martin Truex Jr.? What about 2023 champ Ryan Blaney? Surely not.\n\nConsider, since Hamlin's rookie season in 2006, he has only one winless year (2018) and posted 8, 7 and 6 win-seasons at JGR.\n\n\"I care about wins and winning every single week because in the end I absolutely would take 60-some wins and no championship over 20 and one,\" Hamlin said. \"It's just not even close.\"\n\nThe 43-year-old Hamlin and Junior Johnson are the only drivers in the 50win Cup Club without a championship.\n\n\"This team definitely has all the makings of,\" a championship season, Hamlin crew chief Chris Gabehart said. \"Denny is doing a phenomenal job as a driver. The car, the new Toyota Camry, it's really given us a lot to work with. Everybody at Joe Gibbs Racing is really pulling the rope and excited to win races.\"\n\nHamlin and Christopher Bell have delivered four wins this season to JGR. William Byron has three wins and Kyle Larson and Chase Elliott each have one to give Hendrick Motorsports five checkered flags in 2024. The Ford teams -- like Team Penske and Stewart-Haas Racing -- have been flat this season, which has already created some massive separation between the contenders and the rest of the field. The first 11 races could just be a preview for what's ahead in a season that stretches into November.\n\n\"I think we have got off to a good start, Hendrick and us,\" Gibbs said. \"This is very competitive. I think that's what we'll see as we go forward.\"\n\nHamlin had some fun after the race when he pointed toward the Dover scoring pylon with his 11 in the top spot and posted a photo on social media with the caption \" pylon works.\" Hamlin trolled Talladega and Texas after the tracks removed the scoring pylons in moves that offended NASCAR traditionalists.\n\nAt last check, Phoenix Raceway, the site of the NASCAR championship race, still had a scoring pylon.\n\nWinning that title sure would be nice. Ending the season with a few more wins to jolt him higher on the careers list just might be even better.\n\n\"It's my personal goal, in my career I want to get to a number that puts me well inside that top 10 of race winners,\" he said. \"I think that will speak for itself and the resume.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to

Again, Hamlin is in the mix to win his first career Cup title. Again, Hamlin knows his season will be judged not on his start, but on his finish.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But if he doesn't win it all, Hamlin seems at peace with the knowledge that his career has hovered in the rarified air as one of the best in NASCAR history.\n\nHis 54th career win -- one he predicted on his podcast -- was just the latest reminder of his elite ability behind the wheel. Hamlin tied Lee Petty for 12th on the career wins list, and only Hall of Famers Kyle Busch and recently-retired Kevin Harvick are ahead of him.\n\nHamlin can't knock 'em. As for the \"does a championship define greatness?\" crowd, Hamlin told the haters to take a hike.\n\n\"I know that I'm a championship-caliber driver,\" Hamlin said. \"I'll just say it. I think there's been worse drivers to win a championship than me.\"\n\nLike who?\n\nStroll through the garage or flip through the history book and it's easy to find championship drivers Hamlin would be foolish to trade careers with just for a title.\n\n\u25a0\" Brad Keselowski won the 2012 championship but has only three other top-five series finishes over that span and is winless (he has 35 overall) since 2021. Hamlin also has three Daytona 500 victories to none for Keselowski.\n\n\u25a0 \"Matt Kenseth is as respected as any driver in recent NASCAR history and currently serves as a competition advisor for Legacy Motor Club. His one win in his 2003 championship season made him a scapegoat the following year when NASCAR upended the championship process and moved to a playoff-type format. Kenseth won 39 career races. \"\n\n\u25a0 Hey, who doesn't love Dale Jarrett?

Again, Hamlin is in the mix to win his first career Cup title. Again, Hamlin knows his season will be judged not on his start, but on his finish.\n\nCan he ever get over the hump in the No. 11 Toyota and score NASCAR's biggest prize, the pursuit of which has caused him all kinds of heartache through the years?\n\nPeople are also reading...

But if he doesn't win it all, Hamlin seems at peace with the knowledge that his career has hovered in the rarified air as one of the best in NASCAR history.\n\nHis 54th career win -- one he predicted on his podcast -- was just the latest reminder of his elite ability behind the wheel. Hamlin tied Lee Petty for 12th on the career wins list, and only Hall of Famers Kyle Busch and recently-retired Kevin Harvick are ahead of him.\n\nHamlin can't knock 'em. As for the \"does a championship define greatness?\" crowd, Hamlin told the haters to take a hike.\n\n\"I know that I'm a championship-caliber driver,\" Hamlin said. \"I'll just say it. I think there's been worse drivers to win a championship than me.\"\n\nLike who?\n\nStroll through the garage or flip through the history book and it's easy to find championship drivers Hamlin would be foolish to trade careers with just for a title.\n\n\u25a0\" Brad Keselowski won the 2012 championship but has only three other top-five series finishes over that span and is winless (he has 35 overall) since 2021. Hamlin also has three Daytona 500 victories to none for Keselowski.\n\n\u25a0\" Matt Kenseth is as respected as any driver in recent NASCAR history and currently serves as a competition advisor for Legacy Motor Club. His one win in his 2003 championship season made him a scapegoat the following year when NASCAR upended the championship process and moved to a playoff-type format. Kenseth won 39 career races.\n\n\" \u25a0 Hey, who doesn't love Dale Jarrett? The popular NBC announcer failed to win a race in his first four seasons and had only two wins in his last four full seasons. He did win four of his 32 career races in his 1999 championship season.\n\n\" The Labonte Brothers. Terry Labonte won 22 times over a whopping 890 career Cup starts. In an era where slow-and-steady won the championship race, Labonte won Cup titles in 1984 and 1996 -- with a combined four wins. Bobby Labonte needed 729 races to win 21 times. He did win five times in 1999 and four times in 2000, when he won his only career Cup championship.\n\n\u25a0\" Would Hamlin trade careers with his JGR teammate and 2017 champion Martin Truex Jr.? What about 2023 champ Ryan Blaney? Surely not.\n\nConsider, since Hamlin's rookie season in 2006, he has only one winless year (2018) and posted 8, 7 and 6 win-seasons at JGR.\n\n\"I care about wins and winning every single week because in the end I absolutely would take 60-some wins and no championship over 20 and one,\" Hamlin said. \"It's just not even close.\"\n\nThe 43-year-old Hamlin and Junior Johnson are the only drivers in the 50win Cup Club without a championship.\n\n\"This team definitely has all the makings of,\" a championship season, Hamlin crew chief Chris Gabehart said. \"Denny is doing a phenomenal job as a driver. The car, the new Toyota Camry, it's really given us a lot to work with. Everybody at Joe Gibbs Racing is really pulling the rope and excited to win races.\"\n\nHamlin and Christopher Bell have delivered four wins this season to JGR. William Byron has three wins and Kyle Larson and Chase Elliott each have one to give Hendrick Motorsports five checkered flags in 2024. The Ford teams -- like Team Penske and Stewart-Haas Racing -- have been flat this season, which has already created some massive separation between the contenders and the rest of the field. The first 11 races could just be a preview for what's ahead in a season that stretches into November.\n\n\"I think we have got off to a good start, Hendrick and us,\" Gibbs said. \"This is very competitive. I think that's what we'll see as we go forward.\"\n\nHamlin had some fun after the race when he pointed toward the Dover scoring pylon with his 11 in the top spot and posted a photo on social media with the caption \" pylon works.\" Hamlin trolled Talladega and Texas after the tracks removed the scoring pylons in moves that offended NASCAR traditionalists.\n\nAt last check, Phoenix Raceway, the site of the NASCAR championship race, still had a scoring pylon.\n\nWinning that title sure would be nice. Ending the season with a few more wins to jolt him higher on the careers list just might be even better.\n\n\"It's my personal goal, in my career I want to get to a number that puts me well inside that top 10 of race winners,\" he said. \"I think that will speak for itself and the resume.\"\n\nTags Sports Games And Toys Motor Racing Job Market Motor Vehicles Be the first to know\n\nGet local

Well ...\n\n\"I'd have been pissed off,\" Larson admitted, \"because I've finished second to him so many times, and I would hate to probably hear, 'Oh, the Larson-Hamlin finish,' or, 'Hamlin beat him again.' That would suck.\"\n\nSix times Larson and Hamlin have finished 1-2 in a race, including the previous week at Dover and last year at Kansas, when Hamlin bumped Larson into the wall on the final lap to win. In fact, all six times, Hamlin has been the victor.\n\nIt almost came down to them again Sunday, too. They ran near the front all race, and it was Hamlin who had the lead after Kyle Busch brought out a late caution and the field cycled through pit stops. But on the restart, Larson ducked low and caught Hamlin in the middle with Buescher on the outside, and the No. 11 from Joe Gibbs Racing dropped backward like a rock.\n\n\"I needed to get a push from the 5,\" Hamlin said, \"but I knew he wasn't going to stay in line. He was going to go for the win.\"\n\nHamlin wound up finishing fifth, saying afterward: \"Had a great view of the finish.\"\n\nThrough the first dozen races of the Cup Series season, Larson and Hamlin have emerged as the guys to beat.\n\nLarson has led a series-best 633 laps and Hamlin is second at 606. Larson leads in stage wins with six while Hamlin is second with three. Hamlin is tied for the series lead with three trips to victory lane while Larson now has two.\n\nPick the statistic -- top-fives, where Larson has a series-leading six and Hamlin has four -- and the story keeps playing out.\n\n\"It's important for sure to put together good runs every weekend, and I think our team has done a phenomenal job of that,\" Larson said. \"We've racked up a ton of stage points compared to the field, which has been huge. Stage wins, as well, which obviously helps. Then we've been finishing good, too. We've either been top-five every race or something has happened where we finished just around 20th. But those days last year I would have crashed or something, doing something stupid.\"\n\nAs for their developing rivalry, Larson and Hamlin have a lot to live up to in the pantheon of remarkable ones in NASCAR.\n\nIn the 1970s, Cale Yarborough and Bobby Allison feuded so fiercely and so often that after a crash during the 1979 Daytona 500, the two jumped from their cars and began throwing haymakers. Richard Petty and David Pearson at least kept their rivalry on the track, though it was no less heated, and Tony Stewart and Kurt Busch often clashed throughout the 2000s.\n\nThe last great rivalry, though, might have been Dale Earnhardt and Jeff Gordon, going fender-to-fender for wins seemingly every week. And that one ended in tragedy nearly 25 years ago, when Earnhardt was killed in a crash during the Daytona 500.\n\nBoth had passionate fans, just like Larson and Hamlin do. Both were part of powerful teams, just like Hamlin and Larson are.\n\nIn fact, Larson has helped Hendrick Motorsports pile up six wins through the first 12 races, with William Byron winning three times and Chase Elliott once.

Denny Hamlin and Chris Gabehart know that. It's no secret that Gabehart helped revive Denny's career when he joined the 11 team.\n\nDrivers feel like they know everything. Or at least, when they are in the car during the moment they tend to feel that way. However, the crew chiefs and teams are able to take in all kinds of data\n\nFresh off his win at Dover, Denny Hamlin talked about his crew chief and the trust he has in him. Even when he doesn't think it's the right call, he listens to what Gabehart tells him to do, and he does it.\n\n\"He always says [it's my choice] in the end,\" Hamlin said on his Actions Detrimental podcast. \"He says, 'Listen, you're in the car, you felt what you felt. You did the restart so you make the right call. My job is just to give you what my opinion is and what the numbers say.' So, I think that's why our relationship works as good as it does is that we trust each other to make the call.\n\n\"When he says 'pit' and in my mind I'm disagreeing with him, it doesn't matter my job is to pit. Because he's convicted in that ruling whatever it is. I realized when I sat out during my back issues in 2013, these crew chiefs have much more at their fingertips and they see the much bigger picture more than we do inside that car.\"\n\nTogether, Denny Hamlin and Chris Gabehart are one of the best pairings in the Cup Series. This season the two have won three races, four including the Busch Light Clash. Could this be the season the 11 team wins the championship?\n\nHaving three wins in the first eleven races of the season is impressive. In fact, Denny Hamlin has only done it one other time in his career. It was quite the season for him, too. Really, the season everything slipped away at the end of the year.\n\nDuring the 2010 season, Hamlin won at Martinsville, Texas, and Darlington in the first eleven races of the season. However, there are more similarities between 2010 and 2024. Right now, Denny is on a bit of a checkers or wreckers mentality. His wins are his only top-5s of the season.\n\nSo far in 2024, Hamlin has three wins, a top-10, and an average finishing position of 14.18 after eleven races. Back in 2010, Hamlin had three wins, a top-5, and an average finishing position of 13.9 in that same timeframe. The DNF this year at Talladega brought down his average, so you could argue he has been better this year than he was then.\n\nThat 2010 season ended with eight wins and heartbreak as Jimmie Johnson came in to snag the title in the end. This season is looking a lot like that one, and that means we are in store for more wins from Denny Hamlin. Will he finish the job this time around?", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_howard@on3.com", "name": "Jonathan Howard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denny_Hamlin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denny Hamlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Gabehart", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chris Gabehart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dover,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dover, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dover, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busch_Light_Clash_at_The_Coliseum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Busch Light Clash at The Coliseum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martinsville_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martinsville Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmie_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmie Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darlington_Raceway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darlington Raceway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talladega_Superspeedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talladega Superspeedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/05/03103558/denny-hamlin-chris-gabehart-dover.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539010", "eventUri": "eng-9539010", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

He not only made it back to the Bills' 53-man roster in 2023, but he managed to get back on the field.\n\nHamlin played in five games (zero starts), registering two tackles as he was finding his feet again at the NFL level.\n\nHowever, the NFL is a results business and Hamlin appears to be right on the edge of being traded or cut as the Bills look to trim down their roster this offseason.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_schultz@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Adam Schultz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damar_Hamlin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Damar Hamlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlin_County,_South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamlin County, South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamlin County, South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer Management", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Cost_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Cost Management", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Consulting", "wgt": 11}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/32cd4-17149434690386-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539010", "eventUri": "eng-9539010", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Matthew OHaren-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWhen the 2024 Cup Series season began, a lot of people believed that the new Toyota Camry was not living up to the mark, and boy have they been proven wrong. The most successful driver in the car so far this season has been Denny Hamlin and ahead of the Kansas race, he was full of praise for the Japanese manufacturer. There still is an issue when it comes to superspeedway racing but overall, the new Camry seems to be a success as per the driver of the #11.\n\n\"I thought that it adapted well. I'm really encouraged by what I've seen with the Toyota so far this year, it's been good at all types of race tracks. Speedways has been the only one where we kind of qualified not well,\" the Joe Gibbs Racing star said.\n\nHamlin's three wins in 12 races matched his best start to the season since 2010 but you wouldn't think that was possible given how less competitive the new Camry looked at the two superspeedway season opener races this year.\n\nThe JGR star's comments certainly ooze confidence and perhaps it would not be a surprise to see a Toyota driver lifting the title at Phoenix in November. Had Denny Hamlin won at Kansas on Sunday, it would have been his best start to any Cup Series season.\n\nThe #11 car was leading the race when the green flag fell for the overtime restart and almost immediately Chris Buescher and Kyle Larson got past him. Then it was Chase Elliott and Martin Truex Jr's turn, the latter exacting something of a payback for what happened at the Richmond Raceway earlier this year.\n\n\"Well, a difficult spot, right? I needed to get the push from the 5 (Kyle Larson), but I knew he wasn't going to stay in line, that he was going to go for the win. Unfortunately, it left me in a spot where I was vulnerable there in the middle,\" the 43-year-old said after the race as per a report in RACER.\n\nIncidents like these probably don't affect the Joe Gibbs Racing veteran as much as people might believe. He seems to be in the form of his life and he already has a place in the last 16. The goal right now is to prepare for the much-awaited playoffs later this year and hopefully win a race or two along the way.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nilavro_ghosh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Nilavro Ghosh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denny_Hamlin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denny Hamlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Camry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toyota Camry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dover_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dover Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Hollywood_Casino_400", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2019 Hollywood Casino 400"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_track_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval track racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Gibbs_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Gibbs Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dover,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dover, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dover, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racer_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racer (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_Raceway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richmond Raceway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chase Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Buescher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Buescher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2023/10/3ec83be0-untitled-design-2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539010", "eventUri": "eng-9539010", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

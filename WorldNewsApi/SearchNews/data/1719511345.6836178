{"id": 223769826, "title": "BMC collects Rs 4,856 crore in property tax \u2014 lowest in 2 years", "text": "The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has collected Rs 4,856 crore in property tax for April 2023 - March 2024 \u2014 the lowest collection in two years. The civic body had collected Rs 4,994 crore the previous year, against an annual target of Rs 4,800 crore. Property tax is the second largest source of revenue for the civic body that is collected till March 31 every year. For the previous financial year, the BMC had set up a target to collect around Rs 4,500 crore. However, due to late issuance of property tax receipts, it extended the last date of payment till May 25, 2024. While the civic body has overachieved its target for this year by more than Rs 300 crore, it is still the lowest collection since 2021-22, when the civic body had recovered Rs 5,207 crore, highest so far. Civic officials said that one of the key reasons behind low recovery of property tax this year is the late issuance of property tax bills to citizens. From December 26, 2023, the civic authorities had sent property tax bills at a 17.5 per cent higher rate. However, following a public outrage in social media, the civic authorities issued revised bills for paying property tax. \u201cWe started to issue new bills starting the first week of February this year and it took at least a few weeks for every property owner to receive the bills. Each property owner needs to pay the tax within 90 days after receiving the bills, as a result, we have extended the deadline till May 25, to expedite our collection,\u201d said an official. The officials also maintained, owing to the ongoing Lok Sabha elections there has been a shortfall of staffers in the civic body. \u201cAhead of any election year, we start issuing property tax bills by September or October of the preceding year so that our officers can finish the book-keeping and accounting formalities before they go for election duty. This year, there is already a shortfall of employees in our department,\u201d the official added. Civic body data shows that of the total Rs 4,856 crore collected in property tax this year, Rs 463 crore was recovered from K/East ward which covers the Andheri (East), Jogeshwari areas, followed by Rs 456 crore, collected from H/East ward, which covers Bandra East, Kalanagar, Santacruz areas, Rs 419 crore from G/South (Worli, Prabhadevi) ward and Rs 406 crore from K/West ward, which covers the Andheri (west), Juhu, Versova, Oshiwara areas. The lowest recovery of Rs 33 crore was from B ward, which covers the Dongri, Sandhurst Road areas, followed by Rs 61 crore recovered from C ward, which covers Pydhoni, Bhuleshwar areas. The BMC has not increased property tax rates since 2015 and, as per rules, the tax rates are hiked every five years. However, the BMC has not increased the rates since the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/bmc-in-property-tax-lowest-in-2-years-9353509/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/Untitled-2024-05-26T222119.754.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:55:01", "author": "Pratip Acharya", "authors": ["Pratip Acharya"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.452}

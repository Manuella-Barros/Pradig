Gilgeous-Alexander and Doncic round out top 3", "body": "Nikola Jokic did it all again. And the MVP trophy is his again.\n\nJokic, the Denver Nuggets star from Serbia, was announced Wednesday night as the NBA's Most Valuable Player -- his third time winning the award in the past four seasons, a feat that just six other players in league history have accomplished.\n\nHe averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists. Others averaged more in each category -- and Jokic has had better years in each of those categories -- but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season.\n\nJokic got 79 of a possible 99 first-place votes from the panel of reporters and broadcasters who cast ballots on awards when the regular season ended.\n\n\"It's got to start with your teammates,\" Jokic said on TNT, where the award was announced. \"Without them, I'm nothing. Without them, I cannot do nothing. Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, development coaches ... I cannot be whoever I am without them.\"\n\nIt likely was not a coincidence that Jokic appeared on television for the award announcement wearing a T-shirt commemorating the life of one of his mentors, Golden State assistant coach Dejan Milojevi\u0107, who died earlier this year after a heart attack on a road trip.\n\nOklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was second and Dallas' Luka Doncic was third, both getting into the top three of MVP voting for the first time. With Jokic from Serbia, Gilgeous-Alexander from Canada and Doncic from Slovenia, it marked the third consecutive season that three players born outside the U.S. finished 1-2-3 in the MVP balloting.\n\nThis time, the foreign dominance atop the NBA was even more pronounced: Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is from Greece, was fourth -- so this became the first time in the award's 69-year history that international players went 1-2-3-4 in the voting. It also became the sixth consecutive year that a player born outside the U.S. won the award.\n\nNew York's Jalen Brunson was fifth.\n\n\"Some people say it's the best player on the best team,\" Jokic said, when asked to define an MVP. \"To me, it's the guy who's the most valuable, the team couldn't play without him.\"\n\nJokic is now the ninth player to win the MVP award at least three times. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won it six times, Bill Russell and Michael Jordan each won five, Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won four, and Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are the other three-time winners.\n\nJokic's surprise rise to superstardom has been chronicled time and again over the years: He was the 41st overall pick in the 2014 draft, didn't even think he had a realistic chance at playing in the NBA when his career was beginning and now has a Hall of Fame resume at 29.\n\nThe other players with three MVP trophies in a four-year span are James, Johnson, Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Chamberlain and Russell. And Jokic becomes the fifth player to be first or second in the MVP voting in four consecutive years -- joining Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Russell and Tim Duncan.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander had perhaps the best feel-good story in the NBA this season, helping Oklahoma City to the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference by averaging 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds and 6.2 assists. The Thunder won 57 games, 17 more than they did last season and 33 more than they did two years ago, their rise coinciding with Gilgeous-Alexander's emergence as one of the game's elite players.\n\n\"There is not a night when I don't feel like we have the best player on the floor. ...

And the MVP trophy is his again.Jokic, the Denver Nuggets star from Serbia, was announced Wednesday night as the NBA's Most Valuable Player -- his third time winning the award in the past four seasons, a feat that just six other players in league history have accomplished.Related video above: Denver Nuggets defeated Miami Heat in 2023 to clinch first championship in franchise historyHe averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists. Others averaged more in each category -- and Jokic has had better years in each of those categories -- but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season.Jokic got 79 of a possible 99 first-place votes from the panel of reporters and broadcasters who cast ballots on awards when the regular season ended.\"It's got to start with your teammates,\" Jokic said on TNT, where the award was announced. \"Without them, I'm nothing. Without them, I cannot do nothing. Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, development coaches ... I cannot be whoever I am without them.\"It likely was not a coincidence that Jokic appeared on television for the award announcement wearing a T-shirt commemorating the life of one of his mentors, Golden State assistant coach Dejan Milojevi\u0107, who died earlier this year after a heart attack on a road trip.Oklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was second and Dallas' Luka Doncic was third, both getting into the top three of MVP voting for the first time. With Jokic from Serbia, Gilgeous-Alexander from Canada and Doncic from Slovenia, it marked the third consecutive season that three players born outside the U.S. finished 1-2-3 in the MVP balloting.This time, the foreign dominance atop the NBA was even more pronounced: Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is from Greece, was fourth -- so this became the first time in the award's 69-year history that international players went 1-2-3-4 in the voting. It also became the sixth consecutive year that a player born outside the U.S. won the award.New York's Jalen Brunson was fifth.\"Some people say it's the best player on the best team,\" Jokic said, when asked to define an MVP. \"To me, it's the guy who's the most valuable, the team couldn't play without him.\"Jokic is now the ninth player to win the MVP award at least three times. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won it six times, Bill Russell and Michael Jordan each won five, Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won four, and Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are the other three-time winners. Jokic's surprise rise to superstardom has been chronicled time and again over the years: He was the 41st overall pick in the 2014 draft, didn't even think he had a realistic chance at playing in the NBA when his career was beginning and now has a Hall of Fame resume at 29.The other players with three MVP trophies in a four-year span are James, Johnson, Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Chamberlain and Russell. And Jokic becomes the fifth player to be first or second in the MVP voting in four consecutive years -- joining Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Russell and Tim Duncan.Gilgeous-Alexander had perhaps the best feel-good story in the NBA this season, helping Oklahoma City to the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference by averaging 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds and 6.2 assists. The Thunder won 57 games, 17 more than they did last season and 33 more than they did two years ago, their rise coinciding with Gilgeous-Alexander's emergence as one of the game's elite players.\"There is not a night when I don't feel like we have the best player on the floor. ...

Others averaged more in each category -- and Jokic has had better years in each of those categories -- but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander, from Hamilton, Ont., was ahead of Dallas' Luka Doncic as both got into the top three of MVP voting for the first time. With Jokic from Serbia, Gilgeous-Alexander from Canada and Doncic from Slovenia, it marked the third consecutive season that three players born outside the U.S. finished 1-2-3 in the MVP balloting.\n\nThis time, the foreign dominance atop the NBA was even more pronounced: Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is from Greece, was fourth -- so this became the first time in the award's 69-year history that international players went 1-2-3-4 in the voting. It also became the sixth consecutive year that a player born outside the U.S. won the award.\n\nNew York's Jalen Brunson was fifth.\n\n\"Some people say it's the best player on the best team,\" Jokic said, when asked to define an MVP. \"To me, it's the guy who's the most valuable, the team couldn't play without him.\"\n\nJokic got 79 of a possible 99 first-place votes from the panel of reporters and broadcasters who cast ballots on awards when the regular season ended.\n\n\"It's got to start with your teammates,\" Jokic said on TNT, where the award was announced. \"Without them, I'm nothing. Without them, I cannot do nothing. Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, development coaches ... I cannot be whoever I am without them.\"\n\nIt likely was not a coincidence that Jokic appeared on television for the award announcement wearing a T-shirt commemorating the life of one of his mentors, Golden State assistant coach Dejan Milojevi\u0107, who died earlier this year after a heart attack on a road trip.\n\nJokic is now the ninth player to win the MVP award at least three times. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won it six times, Bill Russell and Michael Jordan each won five, Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won four, and Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are the other three-time winners.\n\nJokic's surprise rise to superstardom has been chronicled time and again over the years: He was the 41st overall pick in the 2014 draft, didn't even think he had a realistic chance at playing in the NBA when his career was beginning and now has a Hall of Fame resume at 29.\n\nThe other players with three MVP trophies in a four-year span are James, Johnson, Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Chamberlain and Russell. And Jokic becomes the fifth player to be first or second in the MVP voting in four consecutive years -- joining Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Russell and Tim Duncan.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander had perhaps the best feel-good story in the NBA this season, helping Oklahoma City to the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference by averaging 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds and 6.2 assists. The Thunder won 57 games, 17 more than they did last season and 33 more than they did two years ago, their rise coinciding with Gilgeous-Alexander's emergence as one of the game's elite players.\n\n\"There is not a night when I don't feel like we have the best player on the floor. ... There's no one I'd rather have on our team than him,\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault, the league's coach of the year this season, said last month.\n\nDoncic made a case for the MVP award by posting the first season in NBA history in which a player averaged 34 points, nine rebounds and nine assists per game. There had been 14 instances before this year in which a player averaged that many points and rebounds in a season -- of those, five had resulted in MVP wins, including last season when Philadelphia's Joel Embiid averaged 33 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nAnd this was the second time ever that a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists per game. The other was in 1972-73, when Kansas City's Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11 assists. He finished third in that season's MVP voting, just like Doncic did this season.\n\nBut in the end, it was Jokic who stood above all others -- and the vote wasn't close.\n\n\"I think he's stated his case pretty well,\" Nuggets guard Jamal Murray said. \"He does it every night. It's hard to do what he does and face the kind of pressure that he does each and every game. He does it with a smile on his face. He makes everybody around us better. And he's a leader on the court and somebody that we expect greatness from every time he steps on the court and he's delivered.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Arnie Stapleton and Pat Graham in Denver

Jokic, Luka Doncic and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander are the three finalists for the NBA MVP Award that will be announced Wednesday, May 8, 2024. [...]\n\nNikola Jokic did it all again. And the MVP trophy is his again.\n\nJokic, the Denver Nuggets star from Serbia, was announced Wednesday night as the NBA's Most Valuable Player -- his third time winning the award in the past four seasons, a feat that just six other players in league history have accomplished.\n\nHe averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists. Others averaged more in each category -- and Jokic has had better years in each of those categories -- but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season.\n\nJokic got 79 of a possible 99 first-place votes from the panel of reporters and broadcasters who cast ballots on awards when the regular season ended.\n\n\"It's got to start with your teammates,\" Jokic said on TNT, where the award was announced. \"Without them, I'm nothing.

He showed me the way how you're supposed to do things -- act, train, workout. ... He trusted me and I can just say, 'thank you.'\"\n\nJokic appeared on all 99 ballots, with 18 second-place votes and two third-place votes. Gilgeous-Alexander also appeared on every ballot, with 15 first-place votes, 40 second-place, 40 third-place, three fourth-place and one fifth-place nod.\n\nDoncic was on all but one ballot and got four first-place votes. Antetokounmpo got one first-place vote on his way to fourth. New York's Jalen Brunson was fifth, followed by Boston's Jayson Tatum, Minnesota's Anthony Edwards, Sacramento's Domantas Sabonis and Phoenix's Kevin Durant.\n\n\"Some people say it's the best player on the best team,\" Jokic said, when asked to define an MVP. \"To me, it's the guy who's the most valuable, the team couldn't play without him.\"\n\nJokic is now the ninth player to win the MVP award at least three times.

And the MVP trophy is his again. Jokic, the Denver Nuggets star from Serbia, was announced Wednesday night as the NBA's Most Valuable Player, topping Canada's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder in the voting. It was the third time Jokic has won the award in the past four seasons, a feat that just six other players in league history have accomplished. He averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists. Others averaged more in each category - and Jokic has had better years in each of those categories - but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season. Gilgeous-Alexander, from Hamilton, Ont., was ahead of Dallas' Luka Doncic as both got into the top three of MVP voting for the first time. With Jokic from Serbia, Gilgeous-Alexander from Canada and Doncic from Slovenia, it marked the third consecutive season that three players born outside the U.S. finished 1-2-3 in the MVP balloting. This time, the foreign dominance atop the NBA was even more pronounced: Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is from Greece, was fourth - so this became the first time in the award's 69-year history that international players went 1-2-3-4 in the voting. It also became the sixth consecutive year that a player born outside the U.S. won the award. New York's Jalen Brunson was fifth. \"Some people say it's the best player on the best team,\"\u009d Jokic said, when asked to define an MVP. \"To me, it's the guy who's the most valuable, the team couldn't play without him.\"\u009d Jokic got 79 of a possible 99 first-place votes from the panel of reporters and broadcasters who cast ballots on awards when the regular season ended. \"It's got to start with your teammates,\"\u009d Jokic said on TNT, where the award was announced. \"Without them, I'm nothing. Without them, I cannot do nothing. Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, development coaches ... I cannot be whoever I am without them.\"\u009d It likely was not a coincidence that Jokic appeared on television for the award announcement wearing a T-shirt commemorating the life of one of his mentors, Golden State assistant coach Dejan Milojevi\u00c4\u2021, who died earlier this year after a heart attack on a road trip. Jokic is now the ninth player to win the MVP award at least three times. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won it six times, Bill Russell and Michael Jordan each won five, Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won four, and Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are the other three-time winners. Jokic's surprise rise to superstardom has been chronicled time and again over the years: He was the 41st overall pick in the 2014 draft, didn't even think he had a realistic chance at playing in the NBA when his career was beginning and now has a Hall of Fame resume at 29. The other players with three MVP trophies in a four-year span are James, Johnson, Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Chamberlain and Russell. And Jokic becomes the fifth player to be first or second in the MVP voting in four consecutive years - joining Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Russell and Tim Duncan. Gilgeous-Alexander had perhaps the best feel-good story in the NBA this season, helping Oklahoma City to the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference by averaging 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds and 6.2 assists. The Thunder won 57 games, 17 more than they did last season and 33 more than they did two years ago, their rise coinciding with Gilgeous-Alexander's emergence as one of the game's elite players. \"There is not a night when I don't feel like we have the best player on the floor. \"| There's no one I'd rather have on our team than him,\"\u009d Thunder coach Mark Daigneault, the league's coach of the year this season, said last month. Doncic made a case for the MVP award by posting the first season in NBA history in which a player averaged 34 points, nine rebounds and nine assists per game. There had been 14 instances before this year in which a player averaged that many points and rebounds in a season - of those, five had resulted in MVP wins, including last season when Philadelphia's Joel Embiid averaged 33 points and 10 rebounds. And this was the second time ever that a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists per game. The other was in 1972-73, when Kansas City's Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11 assists. He finished third in that season's MVP voting, just like Doncic did this season. But in the end, it was Jokic who stood above all others - and the vote wasn't close. \"I think he's stated his case pretty well,\" Nuggets guard Jamal Murray said. \"He does it every night. It's hard to do what he does and face the kind of pressure that he does each and every game. He does it with a smile on his face. He makes everybody around us better. And he's a leader on the court and somebody that we expect greatness from every time he steps on the court and he's delivered.\"\u009d ___ AP Sports Writers Arnie Stapleton and Pat Graham in Denver

He defeated finalists Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Luka Doncic in runaway fashion.\n\nEver since the NBA announced its three finalists for the Most Valuable Player award for the 2023-24 season, many have assumed it was just a matter of time until Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic collected his third trophy.\n\nTheir assumptions were right as Jokic was named the league's MVP on Wednesday night, joining the two awards he won in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 seasons. Jokic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder, and Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks were the three finalists, but Jokic easily outpaced his two contemporaries in voting. Jokic finished with 79 of the 99 first-place votes, followed by Gilgeous-Alexander (15), Doncic (four), with Giannis Antetokounmpo of Milwaukee received the one other first-place vote.\n\nThe overall voting had Jokic with 926 points, with Gilgeous-Alexander runner-up (640 points) and Doncic third (566). A total of eight players received votes with Antetokounmpo fourth, Jalen Brunson of the Knicks fifth, Jayson Tatum of the Celtics sixth, Anthony Edwards of the Timberwolves seventh, Domantas Sabonis of the Kings eighth, and Kevin Durant of the Suns ninth.\n\nWith the finalists being Jokic from Serbia, Doncic from Slovenia, and Gilgeous-Alexander from Canada, it was guaranteed that a foreign-born player would win the award for the sixth straight season. There were just four winners born outside of the United States during the first 72 seasons of the NBA.\n\nIn his eighth NBA season, Jokic averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 9.0 assists per game, ranking in the top 10 in all three stats. It was just the second season in NBA history in which a player averaged at least 25 points, 12 rebounds, and eight assists, joining Oscar Robertson in 1961-62. Jokic also shot 58.3 percent from the field and posted 25 triple-doubles as he led the Nuggets to the second seed in the Western Conference and a 57-25 overall record, which ties for the third-best mark in franchise history.\n\nWith the win, Jokic becomes the ninth player in NBA history with at least three MVP awards, but he also became the first to accomplish another feat. By winning the NBA Finals MVP award last season as the Nuggets won their first championship in franchise history, Jokic becomes the first player to win either an NBA MVP or Finals MVP in four straight seasons.\n\nThe only players with more regular season MVP awards than Jokic are LeBron James and Wilt Chamberlain (four each), Michael Jordan and Bill Russell (five each), and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (six).\n\nThis season is the first in which the NBA established a minimum games played criteria in order to be eligible for end-of-season awards such as MVP. Players must have played in at least 65 of the 82 games, and they must have been on the court for at least 20 minutes during those 65 games. With that threshold in place, last year's MVP winner, Joel Embiid, was ineligible for the award after playing in 39 games even though he ended up leading the NBA with 34.7 points per game.\n\nConsidered one of the most selfless athletes in all of sports, Jokic was deferential when asked by Ernie Johnson of TNT where he would begin with recognition for the award.\n\n\"It's got to start with my teammates,\" Jokic replied. \"Without them, I'm nothing, and without them, I cannot do nothing. Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, strength coaches, development coaches. It's all one big circle that, I cannot be where I am without them.\"\n\nHe then credited a handful of individuals within the Nuggets when asked who most helped him get to this point as a three-time NBA MVP winner.\n\n\"Since I've came here to Denver and the Nuggets organization, individually I'm working with three people,\" Jokic said. \"It's [athletic trainer] Jason Miller, it's [strength and conditioning coach] Felipe [Eichenberger] and it's [assistant coach] Ogi [Stojakovic]. It's those guys who've worked with me closely, and of course coach [Michael Malone], who I've been with eight years. And Jamal [Murray] is the guy I played with the most in this organization. And my family -- they're always with me, always around me.\"\n\nWhile winning the MVP award is certainly a great honor, it hasn't been a predictor of postseason success for recent winners, including the last two times Jokic won. Prior to this season, the last eight MVP winners failed to win an NBA championship in the season they won the award. Steph Curry in 2014-15 was the last MVP winner to then go on to win the championship that season.\n\nJokic and the Nuggets lost in the second round of the playoffs when he won in 2020-21 and then lost in the first round when he repeated a season later. On the night he won his third MVP award, Jokic and the Nuggets find themselves in an 0-2 hole in the second round of the playoffs to the Minnesota Timberwolves.", "source": {"uri":

And the MVP trophy is his again.\n\nJokic, the Denver Nuggets star from Serbia, was announced Wednesday night, May 8, as the NBA's Most Valuable Player -- his third time winning the award in the past four seasons, a feat that just six other players in league history have accomplished.\n\nHe averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists. Others averaged more in each category -- and Jokic has had better years in each of those categories -- but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season.\n\nJokic got 79 of a possible 99 first-place votes from the panel of reporters and broadcasters who cast ballots on awards when the regular season ended.\n\n\"It's got to start with your teammates,\" Jokic said on TNT, where the award was announced. \"Without them, I'm nothing. Without them, I cannot do nothing. Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, development coaches ... I cannot be whoever I am without them.\"\n\nOklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was second and Dallas' Luka Doncic was third, both getting into the top three of MVP voting for the first time. With Jokic from Serbia, Gilgeous-Alexander from Canada and Doncic from Slovenia, it marked the third consecutive season that three players born outside the U.S. finished 1-2-3 in the MVP balloting.\n\nThis time, the foreign dominance atop the NBA was even more pronounced: Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is from Greece, was fourth -- so this became the first time in the award's 69-year history that international players went 1-2-3-4 in the voting. It also became the sixth consecutive year that a player born outside the U.S. won the award.\n\nJokic appeared on television for the award announcement wearing a T-shirt commemorating the life of one of his mentors, Golden State assistant coach Dejan Milojevi\u0107, who died earlier this year after a heart attack on a road trip.\n\n\"To be honest, I'm wearing this shirt pretty much every day, especially when I'm in the training facility,\" Jokic said. \"Deki was the guy who gave me the freedom. He showed me the way how you're supposed to do things -- act, train, workout. ... He trusted me and I can just say, 'thank you.'\"\n\nJokic appeared on all 99 ballots, with 18 second-place votes and two third-place votes. Gilgeous-Alexander also appeared on every ballot, with 15 first-place votes, 40 second-place, 40 third-place, three fourth-place and one fifth-place nod.\n\nDoncic was on all but one ballot and got four first-place votes. Antetokounmpo got one first-place vote on his way to fourth. New York's Jalen Brunson was fifth, followed by Boston's Jayson Tatum, Minnesota's Anthony Edwards, Sacramento's Domantas Sabonis and Phoenix's Kevin Durant.\n\n\"Some people say it's the best player on the best team,\" Jokic said, when asked to define an MVP. \"To me, it's the guy who's the most valuable, the team couldn't play without him.\"\n\nJokic is now the ninth player to win the MVP award at least three times. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won it six times, Bill Russell and Michael Jordan each won five, Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won four, and Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are the other three-time winners.\n\nJokic's surprise rise to superstardom has been chronicled time and again over the years: He was the 41st overall pick in the 2014 draft, didn't even think he had a realistic chance at playing in the NBA when his career was beginning and now has a Hall of Fame resume at 29.\n\nThe other players with three MVP trophies in a four-year span are James, Johnson, Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Chamberlain and Russell. And Jokic becomes the fifth player to be first or second in the MVP voting in four consecutive years -- joining Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Russell and Tim Duncan.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander had perhaps the best feel-good story in the NBA this season, helping Oklahoma City to the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference by averaging 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds and 6.2 assists. The Thunder won 57 games, 17 more than they did last season and 33 more than they did two years ago, their rise coinciding with Gilgeous-Alexander's emergence as one of the game's elite players.\n\n\"There is not a night when I don't feel like we have the best player on the floor. ... There's no one I'd rather have on our team than him,\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault, the league's coach of the year this season, said last month.\n\nDoncic made a case for the MVP award by posting the first season in NBA history in which a player averaged 34 points, nine rebounds and nine assists per game. There had been 14 instances before this year in which a player averaged that many points and rebounds in a season -- of those, five had resulted in MVP wins, including last season when Philadelphia's Joel Embiid averaged 33 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nAnd this was the second time ever that a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists per game. The other was in 1972-73, when Kansas City's Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11 assists. He finished third in that season's MVP voting, just like Doncic did this season.\n\nBut in the end, it was Jokic who stood above all others -- and the vote wasn't close.\n\n\"I think he's stated his case pretty well,\" Nuggets guard Jamal Murray said. \"He does it every night. It's hard to do what he does and face the kind of pressure that he does each and every game. He does it with a smile on his face. He makes everybody around us better. And he's a leader on the court and somebody that we expect greatness from every time he steps on the court and he's delivered.\"", "source": {"uri": "mb.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manila

Gilgeous-Alexander and Doncic round out top 3", "body": "Nikola Jokic did it all again. And the MVP trophy is his again.\n\nJokic, the Denver Nuggets star from Serbia, was announced Wednesday night as the NBA's Most Valuable Player -- his third time winning the award in the past four seasons, a feat that just six other players in league history have accomplished.\n\nHe averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists. Others averaged more in each category -- and Jokic has had better years in each of those categories -- but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season.\n\nJokic got 79 of a possible 99 first-place votes from the panel of reporters and broadcasters who cast ballots on awards when the regular season ended.\n\n\"It's got to start with your teammates,\" Jokic said on TNT, where the award was announced. \"Without them, I'm nothing. Without them, I cannot do nothing. Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, development coaches ... I cannot be whoever I am without them.\"\n\nIt likely was not a coincidence that Jokic appeared on television for the award announcement wearing a T-shirt commemorating the life of one of his mentors, Golden State assistant coach Dejan Milojevi\u0107, who died earlier this year after a heart attack on a road trip.\n\nOklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was second and Dallas' Luka Doncic was third, both getting into the top three of MVP voting for the first time. With Jokic from Serbia, Gilgeous-Alexander from Canada and Doncic from Slovenia, it marked the third consecutive season that three players born outside the U.S. finished 1-2-3 in the MVP balloting.\n\nThis time, the foreign dominance atop the NBA was even more pronounced: Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is from Greece, was fourth -- so this became the first time in the award's 69-year history that international players went 1-2-3-4 in the voting. It also became the sixth consecutive year that a player born outside the U.S. won the award.\n\nJokic appeared on all 99 ballots, with 18 second-place votes and two third-place votes. Gilgeous-Alexander also appeared on every ballot, with 15 first-place votes, 40 second-place, 40 third-place, three fourth-place and one fifth-place nod.\n\nDoncic was on all but one ballot and got four first-place votes. Antetokounmpo got one first-place vote on his way to fourth. New York's Jalen Brunson was fifth, followed by Boston's Jayson Tatum, Minnesota's Anthony Edwards, Sacramento's Domantas Sabonis and Phoenix's Kevin Durant.\n\n\"Some people say it's the best player on the best team,\" Jokic said, when asked to define an MVP. \"To me, it's the guy who's the most valuable, the team couldn't play without him.\"\n\nJokic is now the ninth player to win the MVP award at least three times. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won it six times, Bill Russell and Michael Jordan each won five, Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won four, and Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are the other three-time winners.\n\nJokic's surprise rise to superstardom has been chronicled time and again over the years: He was the 41st overall pick in the 2014 draft, didn't even think he had a realistic chance at playing in the NBA when his career was beginning and now has a Hall of Fame resume at 29.\n\nThe other players with three MVP trophies in a four-year span are James, Johnson, Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Chamberlain and Russell. And Jokic becomes the fifth player to be first or second in the MVP voting in four consecutive years -- joining Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Russell and Tim Duncan.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander had perhaps the best feel-good story in the NBA this season, helping Oklahoma City to the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference by averaging 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds and 6.2 assists. The Thunder won 57 games, 17 more than they did last season and 33 more than they did two years ago, their rise coinciding with Gilgeous-Alexander's emergence as one of the game's elite players.\n\n\"There is not a night when I don't feel like we have the best player on the floor. ... There's no one I'd rather have on our team than him,\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault, the league's coach of the year this season, said last month.\n\nDoncic made a case for the MVP award by posting the first season in NBA history in which a player averaged 34 points, nine rebounds and nine assists per game. There had been 14 instances before this year in which a player averaged that many points and rebounds in a season -- of those, five had resulted in MVP wins, including last season when Philadelphia's Joel Embiid averaged 33 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nAnd this was the second time ever that a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists per game. The other was in 1972-73, when Kansas City's Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11 assists. He finished third in that season's MVP voting, just like Doncic did this season.\n\nBut in the end, it was Jokic who stood above all others -- and the vote wasn't close.\n\n\"I think he's stated his case pretty well,\" Nuggets guard Jamal Murray said. \"He does it every night. It's hard to do what he does and face the kind of pressure that he does each and every game. He does it with a smile on his face. He makes everybody around us better. And he's a leader on the court and somebody that we expect greatness from every time he steps on the court and he's delivered.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Arnie Stapleton and Pat Graham in Denver

And the MVP trophy is his again.\n\nJokic, the Denver Nuggets star from Serbia, was announced Wednesday night as the NBA's Most Valuable Player - his third time winning the award in the past four seasons, a feat that just six other players in league history have accomplished.\n\nHe averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists. Others averaged more in each category - and Jokic has had better years in each of those categories - but he was the only player to rank in the NBA\u00b4s top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season.\n\nJokic got 79 of a possible 99 first-place votes from the panel of reporters and broadcasters who cast ballots on awards when the regular season ended.\n\n\"It\u00b4s got to start with your teammates,\" Jokic said on TNT, where the award was announced. \"Without them, I\u00b4m nothing. Without them, I cannot do nothing. Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, development coaches ... I cannot be whoever I am without them.\"\n\nIt likely was not a coincidence that Jokic appeared on television for the award announcement wearing a T-shirt commemorating the life of one of his mentors, Golden State assistant coach Dejan Milojevi\u00b4c, who died earlier this year after a heart attack on a road trip.\n\nFILE - Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic (15) shoots against Memphis Grizzlies guard Jordan Goodwin (4) in the second half of an NBA basketball game, Sunday, April 14, 2024, in Memphis, Tenn. Jokic, Luka Doncic and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander are the three finalists for the NBA MVP Award that will be announced Wednesday, May 8, 2024. (AP Photo/Brandon Dill, File)\n\nOklahoma City\u00b4s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was second and Dallas\u00b4 Luka Doncic was third, both getting into the top three of MVP voting for the first time. With Jokic from Serbia, Gilgeous-Alexander from Canada and Doncic from Slovenia, it marked the third consecutive season that three players born outside the U.S. finished 1-2-3 in the MVP balloting.\n\nThis time, the foreign dominance atop the NBA was even more pronounced: Milwaukee\u00b4s Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is from Greece, was fourth - so this became the first time in the award\u00b4s 69-year history that international players went 1-2-3-4 in the voting. It also became the sixth consecutive year that a player born outside the U.S. won the award.\n\nNew York's Jalen Brunson was fifth.\n\n\"Some people say it\u00b4s the best player on the best team,\" Jokic said, when asked to define an MVP. \"To me, it\u00b4s the guy who\u00b4s the most valuable, the team couldn\u00b4t play without him.\"\n\nJokic is now the ninth player to win the MVP award at least three times. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won it six times, Bill Russell and Michael Jordan each won five, Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won four, and Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are the other three-time winners.\n\nJokic\u00b4s surprise rise to superstardom has been chronicled time and again over the years: He was the 41st overall pick in the 2014 draft, didn\u00b4t even think he had a realistic chance at playing in the NBA when his career was beginning and now has a Hall of Fame resume at 29.\n\nThe other players with three MVP trophies in a four-year span are James, Johnson, Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Chamberlain and Russell. And Jokic becomes the fifth player to be first or second in the MVP voting in four consecutive years - joining Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Russell and Tim Duncan.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander had perhaps the best feel-good story in the NBA this season, helping Oklahoma City to the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference by averaging 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds and 6.2 assists. The Thunder won 57 games, 17 more than they did last season and 33 more than they did two years ago, their rise coinciding with Gilgeous-Alexander\u00b4s emergence as one of the game\u00b4s elite players.\n\n\"There is not a night when I don\u00b4t feel like we have the best player on the floor. ... There\u00b4s no one I\u00b4d rather have on our team than him,\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault, the league\u00b4s coach of the year this season, said last month.\n\nDoncic made a case for the MVP award by posting the first season in NBA history in which a player averaged 34 points, nine rebounds and nine assists per game. There had been 14 instances before this year in which a player averaged that many points and rebounds in a season - of those, five had resulted in MVP wins, including last season when Philadelphia\u00b4s Joel Embiid averaged 33 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nAnd this was the second time ever that a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists per game. The other was in 1972-73, when Kansas City\u00b4s Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11 assists. He finished third in that season\u00b4s MVP voting, just like Doncic did this season.\n\nBut in the end, it was Jokic who stood above all others - and the vote wasn't close.\n\n\"I think he\u00b4s stated his case pretty well,\" Nuggets guard Jamal Murray said. \"He does it every night. It\u00b4s hard to do what he does and face the kind of pressure that he does each and every game. He does it with a smile on his face. He makes everybody around us better. And he\u00b4s a leader on the court and somebody that we expect greatness from every time he steps on the court and he\u00b4s delivered.\"\n\nAP Sports Writers Arnie Stapleton and Pat Graham in Denver contributed to this report.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA\n\nFILE - Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, left, scores against Golden State Warriors guard Brandin Podziemski, middle, and forward Dario Saric during the second half of an NBA basketball game in San Francisco, Saturday, Nov. 18, 2023.

And the NBA's most valuable player trophy is his again, as well.\n\nJokic, the Denver Nuggets star from Serbia, was announced Wednesday night as the league's MVP for the third time in the past four seasons -- a feat that just six other players in NBA history have accomplished.\n\nHe averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 9.0 assists. Others averaged more in each category -- and Jokic has had better years in each of those categories -- but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds, and assists per game this season.\n\nJokic received 79 of a possible 99 first-place votes from the panel of reporters and broadcasters who cast ballots on awards when the regular season ended.\n\n\"It's got to start with your teammates,\" Jokic said on TNT, where the award was announced. \"Without them, I'm nothing. Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, development coaches ... I cannot be whoever I am without them.\"\n\nIt likely was not a coincidence that Jokic appeared on television for the award announcement wearing a T-shirt commemorating the life of one of his mentors, Golden State Warriors assistant coach Dejan Milojevi\u0107, who died earlier this year after a heart attack on a road trip.\n\nOklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was second and Luka Doncic of Dallas was third, both getting into the top three of MVP voting for the first time. With Jokic from Serbia, Gilgeous-Alexander from Canada, and Doncic from Slovenia, it marked the third consecutive season that three players born outside the United States finished 1-2-3 in the MVP balloting.\n\nThis time, the foreign dominance atop the NBA was even more pronounced. Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is from Greece, was fourth -- so this became the first time in the award's 69-year history that international players went 1-2-3-4 in the voting. It also became the sixth consecutive year that a player born outside the U.S. won the award.\n\nJokic appeared on all 99 ballots, with 18 second-place votes and two third-place votes. Gilgeous-Alexander also appeared on every ballot, with 15 first-place votes, 40 second-place, 40 third-place, three fourth-place, and one fifth-place nod.\n\nDoncic was on all but one ballot and got four first-place votes. Antetokounmpo got one first-place vote. New York's Jalen Brunson was fifth, followed by Boston's Jayson Tatum, Minnesota's Anthony Edwards, Sacramento's Domantas Sabonis and Phoenix's Kevin Durant.\n\n\"Some people say it's the best player on the best team,\" Jokic said, when asked to define an MVP. \"To me, it's the guy who's the most valuable, the team couldn't play without him.\"\n\nJokic is the ninth player to win the MVP award at least three times. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won it six times, Bill Russell and Michael Jordan each won five, Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won four, and Moses Malone, Larry Bird, and Magic Johnson are the other three-time winners.\n\nJokic's surprise rise to superstardom has been chronicled time and again over the years: He was the 41st overall pick in the 2014 draft, didn't even think he had a realistic chance at playing in the NBA when his career was beginning, and now has a Hall of Fame resume at 29.\n\nThe other players with three MVP trophies in a four-year span are James, Johnson, Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Chamberlain, and Russell. And Jokic becomes the fifth player to be first or second in the MVP voting in four consecutive years -- joining Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Russell, and Tim Duncan.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander had perhaps the best feel-good story in the NBA this season, helping Oklahoma City to the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference by averaging 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 6.2 assists. The Thunder won 57 games, 17 more than they did last season and 33 more than they did two years ago, their rise coinciding with Gilgeous-Alexander's emergence as one of the game's elite players.\n\n\"There is not a night when I don't feel like we have the best player on the floor. ... There's no one I'd rather have on our team than him,\" Thunder Coach Mark Daigneault, the league's coach of the year this season, said last month.\n\nDoncic made a case for the MVP award by posting the first season in NBA history in which a player averaged 34 points, nine rebounds, and nine assists per game. There had been 14 instances before this year in which a player averaged that many points and rebounds in a season -- of those, five had resulted in MVP wins, including last season when Philadelphia's Joel Embiid averaged 33 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nAnd this was the second time ever that a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists per game. The other was in 1972-73, when Kansas City's Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11 assists. He finished third in that season's MVP voting, just like Doncic did this season.\n\nBut in the end, it was Jokic who stood above all others -- and the vote wasn't close.\n\n\"I think he's stated his case pretty well,\" Nuggets guard Jamal Murray said. \"He does it every night. It's hard to do what he does and face the kind of pressure that he does each and every game. He does it with a smile on his face. He makes everybody around us better. And he's a leader on the court and somebody that we expect greatness from every time he steps on the court, and he's delivered.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

And the MVP trophy is his again.\n\nJokic, the Denver Nuggets star from Serbia, was announced Wednesday night as the NBA's Most Valuable Player, topping Canada's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder in the voting.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nIt was the third time Jokic has won the award in the past four seasons, a feat that just six other players in league history have accomplished.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists. Others averaged more in each category -- and Jokic has had better years in each of those categories -- but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander, from Hamilton, Ont., was ahead of Dallas' Luka Doncic as both got into the top three of MVP voting for the first time. With Jokic from Serbia, Gilgeous-Alexander from Canada and Doncic from Slovenia, it marked the third consecutive season that three players born outside the U.S. finished 1-2-3 in the MVP balloting.\n\nThis time, the foreign dominance atop the NBA was even more pronounced: Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is from Greece, was fourth -- so this became the first time in the award's 69-year history that international players went 1-2-3-4 in the voting. It also became the sixth consecutive year that a player born outside the U.S. won the award.\n\nNew York's Jalen Brunson was fifth.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Some people say it's the best player on the best team,\" Jokic said, when asked to define an MVP. \"To me, it's the guy who's the most valuable, the team couldn't play without him.\"\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nJokic got 79 of a possible 99 first-place votes from the panel of reporters and broadcasters who cast ballots on awards when the regular season ended.\n\n\"It's got to start with your teammates,\" Jokic said on TNT, where the award was announced. \"Without them, I'm nothing. Without them, I cannot do nothing. Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, development coaches ... I cannot be whoever I am without them.\"\n\nIt likely was not a coincidence that Jokic appeared on television for the award announcement wearing a T-shirt commemorating the life of one of his mentors, Golden State assistant coach Dejan Milojevi\u0107, who died earlier this year after a heart attack on a road trip.\n\nJokic is now the ninth player to win the MVP award at least three times. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won it six times, Bill Russell and Michael Jordan each won five, Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won four, and Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are the other three-time winners.\n\nJokic's surprise rise to superstardom has been chronicled time and again over the years: He was the 41st overall pick in the 2014 draft, didn't even think he had a realistic chance at playing in the NBA when his career was beginning and now has a Hall of Fame resume at 29.\n\nThe other players with three MVP trophies in a four-year span are James, Johnson, Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Chamberlain and Russell. And Jokic becomes the fifth player to be first or second in the MVP voting in four consecutive years -- joining Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Russell and Tim Duncan.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nGilgeous-Alexander had perhaps the best feel-good story in the NBA this season, helping Oklahoma City to the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference by averaging 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds and 6.2 assists. The Thunder won 57 games, 17 more than they did last season and 33 more than they did two years ago, their rise coinciding with Gilgeous-Alexander's emergence as one of the game's elite players.\n\n\"There is not a night when I don't feel like we have the best player on the floor. ... There's no one I'd rather have on our team than him,\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault, the league's coach of the year this season, said last month.\n\nDoncic made a case for the MVP award by posting the first season in NBA history in which a player averaged 34 points, nine rebounds and nine assists per game. There had been 14 instances before this year in which a player averaged that many points and rebounds in a season -- of those, five had resulted in MVP wins, including last season when Philadelphia's Joel Embiid averaged 33 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nAnd this was the second time ever that a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists per game. The other was in 1972-73, when Kansas City's Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11 assists. He finished third in that season's MVP voting, just like Doncic did this season.\n\nBut in the end, it was Jokic who stood above all others -- and the vote wasn't close.\n\n\"I think he's stated his case pretty well,\" Nuggets guard Jamal Murray said. \"He does it every night. It's hard to do what he does and face the kind of pressure that he does each and every game. He does it with a smile on his face. He makes everybody around us better. And he's a leader on the court and somebody that we expect greatness from every time he steps on the court and he's delivered.\"\n\n___\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAP Sports Writers Arnie Stapleton

Gilgeous-Alexander and Doncic round out top 3 - Sentinel Colorado", "body": "Jokic got 79 of a possible 99 first-place votes from the panel of reporters and broadcasters who cast ballots\n\nNikola Jokic did it all again. And the MVP trophy is his again.\n\nJokic, the Denver Nuggets star from Serbia, was announced Wednesday night as the NBA's Most Valuable Player -- his third time winning the award in the past four seasons, a feat that just six other players in league history have accomplished.\n\nHe averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists. Others averaged more in each category -- and Jokic has had better years in each of those categories -- but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season.\n\nJokic got 79 of a possible 99 first-place votes from the panel of reporters and broadcasters who cast ballots on awards when the regular season ended.\n\n\"It's got to start with your teammates,\" Jokic said on TNT, where the award was announced. \"Without them, I'm nothing. Without them, I cannot do nothing. Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, development coaches ... I cannot be whoever I am without them.\"\n\nIt likely was not a coincidence that Jokic appeared on television for the award announcement wearing a T-shirt commemorating the life of one of his mentors, Golden State assistant coach Dejan Milojevi\u0107, who died earlier this year after a heart attack on a road trip.\n\nOklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was second and Dallas' Luka Doncic was third, both getting into the top three of MVP voting for the first time. With Jokic from Serbia, Gilgeous-Alexander from Canada and Doncic from Slovenia, it marked the third consecutive season that three players born outside the U.S. finished 1-2-3 in the MVP balloting.\n\nThis time, the foreign dominance atop the NBA was even more pronounced: Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is from Greece, was fourth -- so this became the first time in the award's 69-year history that international players went 1-2-3-4 in the voting. It also became the sixth consecutive year that a player born outside the U.S. won the award.\n\nJokic appeared on all 99 ballots, with 18 second-place votes and two third-place votes. Gilgeous-Alexander also appeared on every ballot, with 15 first-place votes, 40 second-place, 40 third-place, three fourth-place and one fifth-place nod.\n\nDoncic was on all but one ballot and got four first-place votes. Antetokounmpo got one first-place vote on his way to fourth. New York's Jalen Brunson was fifth, followed by Boston's Jayson Tatum, Minnesota's Anthony Edwards, Sacramento's Domantas Sabonis and Phoenix's Kevin Durant.\n\n\"Some people say it's the best player on the best team,\" Jokic said, when asked to define an MVP. \"To me, it's the guy who's the most valuable, the team couldn't play without him.\"\n\nJokic is now the ninth player to win the MVP award at least three times. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won it six times, Bill Russell and Michael Jordan each won five, Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won four, and Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are the other three-time winners.\n\nJokic's surprise rise to superstardom has been chronicled time and again over the years: He was the 41st overall pick in the 2014 draft, didn't even think he had a realistic chance at playing in the NBA when his career was beginning and now has a Hall of Fame resume at 29.\n\nThe other players with three MVP trophies in a four-year span are James, Johnson, Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Chamberlain and Russell. And Jokic becomes the fifth player to be first or second in the MVP voting in four consecutive years -- joining Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Russell and Tim Duncan.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander had perhaps the best feel-good story in the NBA this season, helping Oklahoma City to the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference by averaging 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds and 6.2 assists. The Thunder won 57 games, 17 more than they did last season and 33 more than they did two years ago, their rise coinciding with Gilgeous-Alexander's emergence as one of the game's elite players.\n\n\"There is not a night when I don't feel like we have the best player on the floor. ... There's no one I'd rather have on our team than him,\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault, the league's coach of the year this season, said last month.\n\nDoncic made a case for the MVP award by posting the first season in NBA history in which a player averaged 33 points, nine rebounds and nine assists per game. There had been 14 instances before this year in which a player averaged that many points and rebounds in a season -- of those, five had resulted in MVP wins, including last season when Philadelphia's Joel Embiid averaged 33 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nAnd this was the second time ever that a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists per game. The other was in 1972-73, when Kansas City's Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11 assists. He finished third in that season's MVP voting, just like Doncic this season.\n\nBut in the end, it was Jokic who stood above all others -- and the vote wasn't close.\n\n\"I think he's stated his case pretty well,\" Nuggets guard Jamal Murray said. \"He does it every night. It's hard to do what he does and face the kind of pressure that he does each and every game. He does it with a smile on his face. He makes everybody around us better. And he's a leader on the court and somebody that we expect greatness from every time he steps on the court and he's delivered.\"\n\nThis story has been corrected to Doncic averaging 33 points, not 34.\n\nAP Sports Writers Arnie Stapleton and Pat Graham in Denver contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "sentinelcolorado.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sentinel Colorado"}, "authors":

And the MVP trophy is his again.\n\nJokic, the Denver Nuggets star from Serbia, was announced Wednesday night as the NBA's Most Valuable Player -- his third time winning the award in the past four seasons, a feat that just six other players in league history have accomplished.\n\nHe averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists. Others averaged more in each category -- and Jokic has had better years in each of those categories -- but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season.\n\nJokic got 79 of a possible 99 first-place votes from the panel of reporters and broadcasters who cast ballots on awards when the regular season ended.\n\n\"It's got to start with your teammates,\" Jokic said on TNT, where the award was announced. \"Without them, I'm nothing. Without them, I cannot do nothing. Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, development coaches ... I cannot be whoever I am without them.\"\n\nIt likely was not a coincidence that Jokic appeared on television for the award announcement wearing a T-shirt commemorating the life of one of his mentors, Golden State assistant coach Dejan Milojevi\u0107, who died earlier this year after a heart attack on a road trip.\n\nOklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was second and Dallas' Luka Doncic was third, both getting into the top three of MVP voting for the first time. With Jokic from Serbia, Gilgeous-Alexander from Canada and Doncic from Slovenia, it marked the third consecutive season that three players born outside the U.S. finished 1-2-3 in the MVP balloting.\n\nThis time, the foreign dominance atop the NBA was even more pronounced: Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is from Greece, was fourth -- so this became the first time in the award's 69-year history that international players went 1-2-3-4 in the voting. It also became the sixth consecutive year that a player born outside the U.S. won the award.\n\nJokic appeared on all 99 ballots, with 18 second-place votes and two third-place votes. Gilgeous-Alexander also appeared on every ballot, with 15 first-place votes, 40 second-place, 40 third-place, three fourth-place and one fifth-place nod.\n\nDoncic was on all but one ballot and got four first-place votes. Antetokounmpo got one first-place vote on his way to fourth. New York's Jalen Brunson was fifth, followed by Boston's Jayson Tatum, Minnesota's Anthony Edwards, Sacramento's Domantas Sabonis and Phoenix's Kevin Durant.\n\n\"Some people say it's the best player on the best team,\" Jokic said, when asked to define an MVP. \"To me, it's the guy who's the most valuable, the team couldn't play without him.\"\n\nJokic is now the ninth player to win the MVP award at least three times. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won it six times, Bill Russell and Michael Jordan each won five, Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won four, and Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are the other three-time winners.\n\nJokic's surprise rise to superstardom has been chronicled time and again over the years: He was the 41st overall pick in the 2014 draft, didn't even think he had a realistic chance at playing in the NBA when his career was beginning and now has a Hall of Fame resume at 29.\n\nThe other players with three MVP trophies in a four-year span are James, Johnson, Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Chamberlain and Russell. And Jokic becomes the fifth player to be first or second in the MVP voting in four consecutive years -- joining Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Russell and Tim Duncan.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander had perhaps the best feel-good story in the NBA this season, helping Oklahoma City to the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference by averaging 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds and 6.2 assists. The Thunder won 57 games, 17 more than they did last season and 33 more than they did two years ago, their rise coinciding with Gilgeous-Alexander's emergence as one of the game's elite players.\n\n\"There is not a night when I don't feel like we have the best player on the floor. ... There's no one I'd rather have on our team than him,\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault, the league's coach of the year this season, said last month.\n\nDoncic made a case for the MVP award by posting the first season in NBA history in which a player averaged 33 points, nine rebounds and nine assists per game. There had been 14 instances before this year in which a player averaged that many points and rebounds in a season -- of those, five had resulted in MVP wins, including last season when Philadelphia's Joel Embiid averaged 33 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nAnd this was the second time ever that a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists per game. The other was in 1972-73, when Kansas City's Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11 assists. He finished third in that season's MVP voting, just like Doncic this season.\n\nBut in the end, it was Jokic who stood above all others -- and the vote wasn't close.\n\n\"I think he's stated his case pretty well,\" Nuggets guard Jamal Murray said. \"He does it every night. It's hard to do what he does and face the kind of pressure that he does each and every game. He does it with a smile on his face. He makes everybody around us better. And he's a leader on the court and somebody that we expect greatness from every time he steps on the court and he's delivered.\"\n\nThis story has been corrected to Doncic averaging 33 points, not 34.\n\nAP Sports Writers Arnie Stapleton and Pat Graham in Denver contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "newson6.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News On 6"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Jokic topped Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder and Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks, who finished second and third, respectively, in the voting.\n\n\"It's got to start with the teammates; without them, I cannot do nothing,\" Jokic said Wednesday on TNT after being named MVP. \"Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, strength coaches, development coaches. It is all one big circle. But I cannot be whatever I am without them.\"\n\nJokic's third MVP victory wasn't close. He garnered 79 first-place votes and a total of 926 points. Gilgeous-Alexander received 15 first-place votes and 640 points. Doncic claimed four first-place votes and 566 points. The Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo finished fourth, and New York Knicks guard Jalen Brunson was fifth in voting.\n\n\"There's a lot of players that deserve it,\" Jokic said of the MVP race. \"It's probably details and the small things [that determine it].\"\n\nJokic is the first center in six decades to win MVP three times in four seasons; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did so from 1973-74 to 1976-77. Jokic also is the ninth player in the NBA history to win at least three MVPs, joining Abdul-Jabbar (6 total), Michael Jordan (5), Bill Russell (4), LeBron James (4), Wilt Chamberlain, Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson.\n\n\"It's hard to differentiate greatness from greatness from greatness,\" Denver coach Michael Malone said in early April of how Jokic has gotten better from previous MVP seasons. \"And then that's what he's been over multiple years now. I know the last six years now, we've had by far the best record in the Western Conference and only second of the NBA behind, I think, Milwaukee in that time.\"\n\nIn his ninth season, Jokic played 79 games, his most since logging 80 games during the 2018-19 season. He joined Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to finish in the top five in total points (fifth), rebounds (third) and assists (second) in multiple seasons, according to research by ESPN Stats & Information. Elgin Baylor is the only other player to do so once.\n\nJokic is also the second player to record 2,000 points, 900 rebounds and 600 assists in a season, joining Oscar Robertson.\n\nJokic averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists -- all in the top 10 in each statistical category. He had 25 triple-doubles, second only to the Sacramento Kings' Domantas Sabonis (26), while averaging 58.3% shooting from the field and 35.9% from behind the arc.\n\nPowered by Jokic, Denver finished the season fifth in offensive efficiency, eighth in defensive efficiency and fourth in net rating. The Nuggets were one of four teams to rank in the top 10 in all three, along with the Boston Celtics, New York Knicks and Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nWhile Denver boasted the best starting five in the league, Jokic's value was undeniable to Denver. The Nuggets posted a plus-11.8 net efficiency when Jokic was on the court but a minus-8.6 when he was off the court. Jokic led the NBA with a plus-682 plus-minus. The Nuggets were minus-251 with their franchise player off the court.\n\nOf course, the humble Jokic often says he doesn't care about individual honors as much as he covets the championship. Jokic is trying to lead the Nuggets to a repeat as world champs.\n\nShould he do so, the Nuggets big man will have put together a four-year run that only four other all-time greats have done. Russell, Bird, Johnson and James are the only players to win three regular-season MVPs and two NBA titles in a four-year span.\n\n\"Nikola has matured, his ability to continue to make everyone around him better,\" Malone said. \"And when you win a championship, and we're going to run it back, but in place of Bruce [Brown] and Jeff [Green], we're going to try to put young players in and the fact that we have a better record than we did last year.\n\n\"And we've had Jamal Murray miss [23] games. It speaks to Nikola understanding it's still my responsibility as a great player to help [the younger role players] as well as all the other guys to understand what their roles are, how to play on both ends of the floor and, most importantly, make those guys better.\"\n\nESPN's Stats & Information contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"},

Gilgeous-Alexander and Doncic round out top 3 - Medicine Hat News", "body": "SUBSCRIBE NOW Nikola Jokic did it all again. And the MVP trophy is his again. Jokic, the Denver Nuggets star from Serbia, was announced Wednesday night as the NBA's Most Valuable Player - his third time winning the award in the past four seasons, a feat that just six other players in league history have accomplished. He averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists. Others averaged more in each category - and Jokic has had better years in each of those categories - but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season. Jokic got 79 of a possible 99 first-place votes from the panel of reporters and broadcasters who cast ballots on awards when the regular season ended. Oklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was second and Dallas' Luka Doncic was third, both getting into the top three of MVP voting for the first time. With Jokic from Serbia, Gilgeous-Alexander from Canada and Doncic from Slovenia, it marked the third consecutive season that three players born outside the U.S. finished 1-2-3 in the MVP balloting. This time, the foreign dominance atop the NBA was even more pronounced: Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is from Greece, was fourth - so this became the first time in the award's 69-year history that international players went 1-2-3-4 in the voting. It also became the sixth consecutive year that an player born outside the U.S. won the award. Jokic is now the ninth player to win the MVP award at least three times. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won it six times, Bill Russell and Michael Jordan each won five, Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won four, and Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are the other three-time winners. Jokic's surprise rise to superstardom has been chronicled time and again over the years: He was the 41st overall pick in the 2014 draft, didn't even think he had a realistic chance at playing in the NBA when his career was beginning and now has a Hall of Fame resume at 29. The other players with three MVP trophies in a four-year span are James, Johnson, Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Chamberlain and Russell. And Jokic becomes the fifth player to be first or second in the MVP voting in four consecutive years - joining Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Russell and Tim Duncan. Gilgeous-Alexander had perhaps the best feel-good story in the NBA this season, helping Oklahoma City to the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference by averaging 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds and 6.2 assists. The Thunder won 57 games, 17 more than they did last season and 33 more than they did two years ago, their rise coinciding with Gilgeous-Alexander's emergence as one of the game's elite players. \"There is not a night when I don't feel like we have the best player on the floor. \"| There's no one I'd rather have on our team than him,\"\u009d Thunder coach Mark Daigneault, the league's coach of the year this season, said last month. Doncic made a case for the MVP award by posting the first season in NBA history in which a player averaged 34 points, nine rebounds and nine assists per game. There had been 14 instances before this year in which a player averaged that many points and rebounds in a season - of those, five had resulted in MVP wins, including last season when Philadelphia's Joel Embiid averaged 33 points and 10 rebounds. And this was the second time ever that a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists per game. The other was in 1972-73, when Kansas City's Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11 assists. He finished third in that season's MVP voting, just like Doncic did this season. ___ AP NBA:", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors":

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's six MVPs are the most ever. Bill Russell and Michael Jordan won five apiece and Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James four.\n\nJokic joins Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson as three-time winners after earning 79 first-placed votes compared to 15 for Gilgeous-Alexander and four for Doncic.\n\n\"We've got to start with the teammates. Without them I cannot do anything,\" Jokic said in the MVP announcement broadcast on TNT when asked to reflect on yet another MVP.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nNBA: Jokic, Doncic and Gilgeous-Alexander finalists for MVP award\n\n\"Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, across time coaches, development coaches -- it's all one big circle that I cannot be wherever I am without them.\"\n\nBehind Jokic, the 57-25 Nuggets matched the franchise high for victories in a season -- although they were tied for best record in the West with Oklahoma City and ended up with the second seed behind the young Thunder team.\n\nDeserving MVP\n\nAs always, the MVP award offered plenty of scope for argument.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander, a 25-year-old Canadian, averaged 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds, 6.2 assists and 2.0 steals per game for upstarts Oklahoma City and had a league-high 51 30-point games.\n\nSlovenia's Doncic led the league in scoring with 33.9 points per game and ranked second in assists with 9.8 per game. He averaged 9.2 rebounds per game and became the third player to average a 30-point triple-double after the All-Star break after Oscar Robertson (1961-62) and Russell Westbrook (2016-17).\n\nBut Nuggets coach Mike Malone was in no doubt that Jokic's third MVP was richly deserved.\n\n\"I don't know if I can put that into words what his greatness means to every team,\" Malone said last month, adding that he particularly admired the fact that winning the award was \"not his motivation.\"\n\n\"When he gets up in the morning ... he's not doing it for the individual accolades and recognition,\" Malone said. \"He's doing it for the collective to win and hopefully win another championship. That's what he's all about.\"\n\nMalone on Jokic: Excellence every night\n\nMalone said Jokic was a classic example of a player who makes the rest of his team better.\n\n\"That is what I marvel at, most importantly with Nikola as a player. Just the consistent greatness and how he finds ways to every single night, no matter who is available around him, to bring that level of excellence every night,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Basically, put that team on his back and make each and every one of his teammates that much better.\"\n\nWhen Jokic won the 2022 MVP he was already back home in Sombor, Serbia, in the wake of the Nuggets' playoff exit.\n\nWhether Jokic will be able to combine an MVP award and the title this season remains to be seen.\n\nThe Nuggets dropped the first two games of their Western Conference semi-final series to the Minnesota Timberwolves and face the tough task of trying to claw back on the Timberwolves' home court starting on Friday.\n\nJokic's victory marks the sixth straight season that the MVP award has gone to a player born outside the United States. The last US-born player to win was James Harden in 2018.", "source": {"uri": "cebudailynews.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "CDN Digital"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And the MVP trophy is his again.\n\nJoki\u0107, the Denver Nuggets star from Serbia, was announced Wednesday night as the NBA's Most Valuable Player -- his third time winning the award in the past four seasons, a feat that just six other players in league history have accomplished.\n\nHe averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists. Others averaged more in each category -- and Jokic has had better years in each of those categories -- but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season.\n\nJoki\u0107 got 79 of a possible 99 first-place votes from the panel of reporters and broadcasters who cast ballots on awards when the regular season ended.\n\n\"It's got to start with your teammates,\" Joki\u0107 said on TNT, where the award was announced. \"Without them, I'm nothing. Without them, I cannot do nothing. Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, development coaches ... I cannot be whoever I am without them.\"\n\nIt likely was not a coincidence that Joki\u0107 appeared on television for the award announcement wearing a T-shirt commemorating the life of one of his mentors, Golden State assistant coach Dejan Milojevi\u0107, who died earlier this year after a heart attack on a road trip.\n\nOklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was second and Dallas' Luka Doncic was third, both getting into the top three of MVP voting for the first time. With Jokic from Serbia, Gilgeous-Alexander from Canada and Doncic from Slovenia, it marked the third consecutive season that three players born outside the U.S. finished 1-2-3 in the MVP balloting.\n\nThis time, the foreign dominance atop the NBA was even more pronounced: Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is from Greece, was fourth -- so this became the first time in the award's 69-year history that international players went 1-2-3-4 in the voting. It also became the sixth consecutive year that a player born outside the U.S. won the award.\n\nNew York's Jalen Brunson was fifth.\n\n\"Some people say it's the best player on the best team,\" Jokic said, when asked to define an MVP. \"To me, it's the guy who's the most valuable, the team couldn't play without him.\"\n\nJokic is now the ninth player to win the MVP award at least three times. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won it six times, Bill Russell and Michael Jordan each won five, Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won four, and Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are the other three-time winners.\n\nJokic's surprise rise to superstardom has been chronicled time and again over the years: He was the 41st overall pick in the 2014 draft, didn't even think he had a realistic chance at playing in the NBA when his career was beginning and now has a Hall of Fame resume at 29.\n\nThe other players with three MVP trophies in a four-year span are James, Johnson, Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Chamberlain and Russell. And Jokic becomes the fifth player to be first or second in the MVP voting in four consecutive years -- joining Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Russell and Tim Duncan.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander had perhaps the best feel-good story in the NBA this season, helping Oklahoma City to the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference by averaging 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds and 6.2 assists. The Thunder won 57 games, 17 more than they did last season and 33 more than they did two years ago, their rise coinciding with Gilgeous-Alexander's emergence as one of the game's elite players.\n\n\"There is not a night when I don't feel like we have the best player on the floor. ... There's no one I'd rather have on our team than him,\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault, the league's coach of the year this season, said last month.\n\nDoncic made a case for the MVP award by posting the first season in NBA history in which a player averaged 34 points, nine rebounds and nine assists per game. There had been 14 instances before this year in which a player averaged that many points and rebounds in a season -- of those, five had resulted in MVP wins, including last season when Philadelphia's Joel Embiid averaged 33 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nAnd this was the second time ever that a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists per game. The other was in 1972-73, when Kansas City's Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11 assists. He finished third in that season's MVP voting, just like Doncic did this season.\n\nBut in the end, it was Jokic who stood above all others -- and the vote wasn't close.\n\n\"I think he's stated his case pretty well,\" Nuggets guard Jamal Murray said. \"He does it every night. It's hard to do what he does and face the kind of pressure that he does each and every game. He does it with a smile on his face. He makes everybody around us better. And he's a leader on the court and somebody that we expect greatness from every time he steps on the court and he's delivered.\"", "source": {"uri": "ksltv.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Prior to that, he covered the Nets, Knicks and the NBA for nearly a decade. He joined ESPNNewYork.com after working at the New York Daily News for almost 12 years and is a graduate of Michigan State University.\n\nFollow him on Twitter \" Ohm's chat archive \"\n\nDenver Nuggets superstar Nikola Jokic continued to add to his legacy as one of the best NBA players ever Wednesday by winning his third Most Valuable Player trophy.\n\nJokic won the award for the third time in four seasons, succeeding last season's MVP, Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid. He topped Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder and Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks, who finished second and third, respectively, in the voting.\n\n\"It's got to start with the teammates, without them, I cannot do nothing,\" Jokic said on TNT after earning the award on Wednesday. \"Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, strength coaches, development coaches. It is all one big circle. But I cannot be whatever I am without them.\"\n\nJokic's third MVP victory wasn't close. He garnered 79 first-place votes and a total of 926 points. Gilgeous-Alexander received 15 first-place votes and 640 points. Doncic got four first-place votes and 566 points. The Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo finished fourth and New York Knicks guard Jalen Brunson was fifth in voting.\n\n\"There's a lot of players that deserve it,\" Jokic said of the MVP race. \"It's probably details and the small things [that determine it].\"\n\nJokic is the first center in six decades to win MVP three times in four seasons; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did it from 1973-74 to 1976-77.\n\n\"It's hard to differentiate greatness from greatness from greatness,\" Denver head coach Michael Malone said in early April of how Jokic has gotten better from previous MVP seasons. \"And then that's what he's been over multiple years now. I know the last six years now, we've had by far the best record in the Western Conference and only second of the NBA behind, I think Milwaukee in that time.\"\n\nIn his ninth season, Jokic played 79 games, his most since playing 80 games during the 2018-19 season. He joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to finish top-five in total points (fifth), rebounds (third) and assists (second) in multiple seasons, according to research by ESPN Stats & Information. Elgin Baylor is the only other player to do so once.\n\nJokic is also the second player to record 2,000 points, 900 rebounds and 600 assists in a season, joining Oscar Robertson.\n\nJokic averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists -- all top 10 in each statistical category. He had 25 triple-doubles, second only to Sacramento's Domantas Sabonis (26), while averaging 58.3% shooting from the field and 35.9% from behind the arc.\n\nPowered by Jokic, Denver finished the season fifth in offensive efficiency, eighth in defensive efficiency, and fourth in net rating. The Nuggets were one of four teams to rank top-10 in all three, along with the Celtics, Knicks and Thunder.\n\nWhile Denver boasted the best starting five in the league, Jokic's value was undeniable to Denver. The Nuggets posted a plus-11.8 net efficiency when Jokic was on the court but a minus-8.6 when he was off. Jokic led the NBA with a plus-682 plus-minus. The Nuggets were minus-251 with their franchise player off the court.\n\nOf course, the humble Jokic often says he doesn't care about individual honors as much as he covets the championship. Jokic is trying to lead the Nuggets to a repeat as world champs.\n\nShould he do so, the Nuggets big man will have put together a four-year run that only four other all-time greats have ever done. LeBron James, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Bill Russell are the only players to win three regular-season MVPs and two titles in a four-year span.\n\n\"Nikola has matured, his ability to continue to make everyone around him better,\" Malone said. \"And when you win a championship, and we're going to run it back, but in place of Bruce [Brown] and Jeff [Green], we're going to try to put young players in and the fact that we have a better record than we did last year.\n\n\"And we've had Jamal Murray miss [23] games. It speaks to Nikola understanding it's still my responsibility as a great player to help [the younger role players] as well as all the other guys to understand what their roles are, how to play on both ends of the floor, and most importantly, make those guys better.\"", "source": {"uri": "africa.espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Jokic beat out Oklahoma City Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks in final voting for the award.\n\nIn another season in which Jokic managed to make brilliance almost look routine, he became the second player, after Oscar Robertson, to record 2,000 points, 900 rebounds and 600 assists in a season.\n\nHis 25 triple-doubles and 68 double-doubles were both second in the league.\n\nJokic enters elite territory with a third MVP crown. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's six MVPs are the most ever. Bill Russell and Michael Jordan won five apiece and Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James four.\n\nJokic joins Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson as three-time winners after earning 79 first place votes compared to 15 for Gilgeous-Alexander and four for Doncic.\n\n\"We've got to start with the teammates. Without them I cannot do anything,\" Jokic said in the MVP announcement broadcast on TNT when asked to reflect on yet another plum.\n\n\"Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, across time coaches, development coaches -- it's all one big circle that I cannot be wherever I am without them.\"\n\nBehind Jokic, the 57-25 Nuggets matched the franchise high for victories in a season -- although they were tied for best record in the West with Oklahoma City and ended up with the second seed behind the young Thunder team.\n\nAs always, the MVP award offered plenty of scope for argument.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander, a 25-year-old Canadian, averaged 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds, 6.2 assists and 2.0 steals per game for upstarts Oklahoma City and had a league-high 51 30-point games.\n\nSlovenia's Doncic led the league in scoring with 33.9 points per game and ranked second in assists with 9.8 per game. He averaged 9.2 rebounds per game and became the third player to average a 30-point triple-double after the All-Star break after Oscar Robertson (1961-62) and Russell Westbrook (2016-17).\n\nBut Nuggets coach Mike Malone was in no doubt that Jokic's third MVP was richly deserved.\n\n\"I don't know if I can put that into words what his greatness means to every team,\" Malone said last month, adding that he particularly admired the fact that winning the award was \"not his motivation.\"\n\n\"When he gets up in the morning ... he's not doing it for the individual accolades and recognition,\" Malone said. \"He's doing it for the collective to win and hopefully win another championship. That's what he's all about.\"\n\nMalone said Jokic was a classic example of a player who makes the rest of his team better.\n\nWhen Jokic won the 2022 MVP he was already back home in Sombor, Serbia, in the wake of the Nuggets' playoff exit.\n\nWhether Jokic will be able to combine an MVP award and the title this season remains to be seen.\n\nThe Nuggets dropped the first two games of their Western Conference semi-final series to the Minnesota Timberwolves and face the tough task of trying to claw back on the Timberwolves' home court starting on Friday.\n\nJokic's victory marks the sixth straight season that the MVP award has gone to a player born outside the United States. The last US-born player to win was James Harden in 2018.", "source": {"uri": "manilastandard.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manila Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Jokic topped Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder and Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks, who finished second and third, respectively, in the voting.\n\n\"It's got to start with the teammates; without them, I cannot do nothing,\" Jokic said Wednesday on TNT after being named MVP. \"Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, strength coaches, development coaches. It is all one big circle. But I cannot be whatever I am without them.\"\n\nJokic's third MVP victory wasn't close. He garnered 79 first-place votes and a total of 926 points. Gilgeous-Alexander received 15 first-place votes and 640 points. Doncic claimed four first-place votes and 566 points. The Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo finished fourth, and New York Knicks guard Jalen Brunson was fifth in voting.\n\n\"There's a lot of players that deserve it,\" Jokic said of the MVP race. \"It's probably details and the small things [that determine it].\"\n\nJokic is the first center in six decades to win MVP three times in four seasons; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did so from 1973-74 to 1976-77. Jokic also is the ninth player in the NBA history to win at least three MVPs, joining Abdul-Jabbar (6 total), Michael Jordan (5), Bill Russell (4), LeBron James (4), Wilt Chamberlain, Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson.\n\n\"It's hard to differentiate greatness from greatness from greatness,\" Denver coach Michael Malone said in early April of how Jokic has gotten better from previous MVP seasons. \"And then that's what he's been over multiple years now. I know the last six years now, we've had by far the best record in the Western Conference and only second of the NBA behind, I think, Milwaukee in that time.\"\n\nThe humble Jokic often says he doesn't care about individual honors as much as he covets the championship. Jokic is trying to lead the Nuggets to a repeat as world champs.\n\nShould he do so, the Nuggets big man will have put together a four-year run that only four other all-time greats have done.

And the MVP trophy is his again.\n\nJokic, the Denver Nuggets star from Serbia, was announced Wednesday night as the NBA's Most Valuable Player -- his third time winning the award in the past four seasons, a feat that just six other players in league history have accomplished.\n\nHe averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists. Others averaged more in each category -- and Jokic has had better years in each of those categories -- but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season.\n\nJokic got 79 of a possible 99 first-place votes from the panel of reporters and broadcasters who cast ballots on awards when the regular season ended.\n\nTheNightlyGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\n\"It's got to start with your teammates,\" Jokic said on TNT, where the award was announced. \"Without them, I'm nothing. Without them, I cannot do nothing. Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, development coaches ... I cannot be whoever I am without them.\"\n\nIt likely was not a coincidence that Jokic appeared on television for the award announcement wearing a T-shirt commemorating the life of one of his mentors, Golden State assistant coach Dejan Milojevic, who died earlier this year after a heart attack on a road trip.\n\nOklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was second and Dallas' Luka Doncic was third, both getting into the top three of MVP voting for the first time. With Jokic from Serbia, Gilgeous-Alexander from Canada and Doncic from Slovenia, it marked the third consecutive season that three players born outside the U.S. finished 1-2-3 in the MVP balloting.\n\nThis time, the foreign dominance atop the NBA was even more pronounced: Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is from Greece, was fourth -- so this became the first time in the award's 69-year history that international players went 1-2-3-4 in the voting. It also became the sixth consecutive year that a player born outside the U.S. won the award.\n\nJokic appeared on all 99 ballots, with 18 second-place votes and two third-place votes. Gilgeous-Alexander also appeared on every ballot, with 15 first-place votes, 40 second-place, 40 third-place, three fourth-place and one fifth-place nod.\n\nDoncic was on all but one ballot and got four first-place votes. Antetokounmpo got one first-place vote on his way to fourth. New York's Jalen Brunson was fifth, followed by Boston's Jayson Tatum, Minnesota's Anthony Edwards, Sacramento's Domantas Sabonis and Phoenix's Kevin Durant.\n\n\"Some people say it's the best player on the best team,\" Jokic said, when asked to define an MVP. \"To me, it's the guy who's the most valuable, the team couldn't play without him.\"\n\nJokic is now the ninth player to win the MVP award at least three times. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won it six times, Bill Russell and Michael Jordan each won five, Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won four, and Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are the other three-time winners.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails", "source": {"uri": "thewest.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The West Australian"}, "authors": [],

Jokic, who was a finalist for the award alongside Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic, has now won three of the last four MVP awards. Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid claimed the award during the 2022-23 season.\n\nNamed the NBA's MVP for the third time in the last four years, Jokic now joins Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, and LeBron James as the only players in league history to achieve such a feat in a four-year span.\n\nThis season, Jokic played in a total of 79 games, averaging 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 9.0 assists per game while shooting 58.3 percent from the floor and 35.9 percent from three-point range. Although none of these averages were career highs for Jokic, the Serbian big man was once again the most efficient player in the league. He finished the year ranking 10th in scoring, fourth in rebounding, third in assists, and first in virtually every advanced metric.\n\nEarlier in the season, Nuggets head coach Michael Malone explained why Jokic proved to once again be the NBA's MVP after a 26-point, 18-rebound, and 16-assist triple-double against the Cleveland Cavaliers on March 31.\n\n\"It speaks to why he's going to be a three-time MVP. It speaks to his understanding that it's not just about Nikola. That's what I love about him probably more than anything is how selfless he is,\" Malone explained. \"It's not about him getting 26-18-16. He was so into the game tonight, so into the huddles, talking to guys and being vocal on the court. That shows you the investment, that shows you how much he cares about this team.\"\n\nJokic recorded a total of 68 double-doubles and 25 triple-doubles this season, finishing behind only Sacramento Kings center Domantas Sabonis in both categories. His 130 total career triple-doubles trail only Magic Johnson (138), Oscar Robertson (181), and Russell Westbrook (199) for the most in league history.\n\nAnother dominant season has resulted in Jokic claiming the NBA MVP award over the likes of Gilgeous-Alexander and Doncic, two very deserving finalists.\n\nJokic outlasts Gilgeous-Alexander, Doncic for MVP\n\nJokic has won his third MVP award in the last four seasons. However, Doncic and Gilgeous-Alexander each put together fantastic seasons of their own and received consideration for this award.\n\nDoncic led the Mavericks to an 18-9 record out of the All-Star break, averaging 33.2 points, 10.3 assists, and 10.1 rebounds per game in that stretch. Luka led the league in scoring during the regular season at 33.9 points per game for the first time in his career. Dallas ended up finishing 50-32 on the season, claiming the 5-seed in the Western Conference and defeating the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder to a 57-25 record. They claimed the 1-seed in the Western Conference over the Nuggets as a result of picking up three victories over Jokic during the regular season. At 25 years old, Shai has elevated his game to new heights and has all of a sudden put a young Thunder team in a position where they can contend for a championship.\n\nOver the course of 75 games, Gilgeous-Alexander averaged 30.1 points, 6.2 assists, 5.5 rebounds, and 2.0 steals per game while shooting 53.5 percent from the floor. He also scored at least 30 points in a league-high 51 total games, according to StatMuse.\n\nJokic has now etched his name next to some of the greatest of all time after claiming his third NBA MVP award. At 29 years old, he will undoubtedly enter the 2024-25 season as the favorite to once again claim the league's most distinctive honor.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news",

Gilgeous-Alexander and Doncic round out top 3", "body": "Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic drops back to defend during the second half of Game 2 of an NBA basketball second-round playoff series against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Monday, May 6, 2024, in Denver.\n\nNikola Jokic did it all again. And the MVP trophy is his again.\n\nJokic, the Denver Nuggets star from Serbia, was announced Wednesday night as the NBA's Most Valuable Player -- his third time winning the award in the past four seasons, a feat that just six other players in league history have accomplished.\n\nHe averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists. Others averaged more in each category -- and Jokic has had better years in each of those categories -- but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season.\n\nJokic got 79 of a possible 99 first-place votes from the panel of reporters and broadcasters who cast ballots on awards when the regular season ended.\n\nOklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was second and Dallas' Luka Doncic was third, both getting into the top three of MVP voting for the first time. With Jokic from Serbia, Gilgeous-Alexander from Canada and Doncic from Slovenia, it marked the third consecutive season that three players born outside the U.S. finished 1-2-3 in the MVP balloting.\n\nThis time, the foreign dominance atop the NBA was even more pronounced: Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is from Greece, was fourth -- so this became the first time in the award's 69-year history that international players went 1-2-3-4 in the voting. It also became the sixth consecutive year that an player born outside the U.S. won the award.\n\nJokic is now the ninth player to win the MVP award at least three times. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won it six times, Bill Russell and Michael Jordan each won five, Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won four, and Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are the other three-time winners.\n\nJokic's surprise rise to superstardom has been chronicled time and again over the years: He was the 41st overall pick in the 2014 draft, didn't even think he had a realistic chance at playing in the NBA when his career was beginning and now has a Hall of Fame resume at 29.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nThe other players with three MVP trophies in a four-year span are James, Johnson, Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Chamberlain and Russell. And Jokic becomes the fifth player to be first or second in the MVP voting in four consecutive years -- joining Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Russell and Tim Duncan.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander had perhaps the best feel-good story in the NBA this season, helping Oklahoma City to the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference by averaging 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds and 6.2 assists. The Thunder won 57 games, 17 more than they did last season and 33 more than they did two years ago, their rise coinciding with Gilgeous-Alexander's emergence as one of the game's elite players.\n\n\"There is not a night when I don't feel like we have the best player on the floor. ... There's no one I'd rather have on our team than him,\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault, the league's coach of the year this season, said last month.\n\nDoncic made a case for the MVP award by posting the first season in NBA history in which a player averaged 34 points, nine rebounds and nine assists per game. There had been 14 instances before this year in which a player averaged that many points and rebounds in a season -- of those, five had resulted in MVP wins, including last season when Philadelphia's Joel Embiid averaged 33 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nAnd this was the second time ever that a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists per game. The other was in 1972-73, when Kansas City's Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11 assists. He finished third in that season's MVP voting, just like Doncic did this season.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs

He has already cemented himself as the greatest second-round pick of all time and, as he continues to pile up accolades, adds to a resume comparable to the all-time greats.\n\nHere is where Jokic's MVP awards stack up among some of the greatest to ever play the game.\n\nMORE: Could NBA players play in the NFL?

After being a runner-up to Joel Embiid in the MVP race in the 2022-23 NBA season, Jokic is back on top, as he garnered a total of 79 first-place votes and 926 overall points in the voting. Winning the award again adds to the ever-growing legacy of Jokic in the NBA, but everyone close to or at least followed him from afar knows that individual awards don't excite him as much as team success.\n\n\"To be honest, I liked last year when I didn't win it and we won a championship much better,\" Jokic said Wednesday night shortly after it was announced that he would be receiving his third Most Valuable Player award (h/t DNVR Nuggets).\n\nJokic faced competition for the award mainly from the pair of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder and Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks but based on the final MVP voting result, there seems to be barely any doubt in the collective thinking of the voters that the Serbian superstar is still the best player in the league today. Gilgeous-Alexander was second in the voting with 640 points, mostly from his 15 first-place votes. Doncic was third with 566 points and just four first-place votes.\n\nFor what it's worth, Jokic received more first-place this season than Embiid did a year ago, with the Sixers star collecting 73 No. 1 votes at that time. Jokic is the single biggest part that makes the Nuggets machine go. This season, he averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 9.0 assists across 79 games, while also connecting on 58.3 percent of his shots from the field and 35.9 percent from behind the arc.\n\nFor what it's worth, Nikola Jokic received more first-place this season than Embiid did a year ago, with the Sixers star collecting 73 No. 1 votes at that time.

Jokic also posted career-highs in Win Shares (17.0) and Value Over Replacement Player or VORP with 10.6.\n\nWhether Nikola Jokic made it a personal mission to reclaim the MVP status many others thought should have been his instead of Embiid's in the 2022-23 campaign, his on-court production and effectiveness on the floor this season undeniably were a big reason why the Nuggets are still playing this deep into May.\n\nAlso, behind Jokic's silent leadership, the Nuggets finished second in the Western Conference standings this season and eliminated the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round of the 2024 NBA Playoffs.\n\nNikola Jokic's true focus is on willing the Nuggets to another title\n\nWith his third MVP award already in the bag, Nikola Jokic can now turn his full attention again on helping the Nuggets. The Jokic and the defending NBA champs have their backs pressed hard against the wall in the second round versus the Minnesota Timberwolves, who have taken both of the first two games of the series in Mile High City. But so long as Denver has Jokic healthy and suiting up, it can't lose hope. Back in 2020 during the bubble, the Nuggets successfully won two series despite falling down a 3-1 hole in both of them.\n\nSo far in the playoffs, Jokic is averaging 27.0 points, 15.0 rebounds, and 9.4 assists per game.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rexwell_villas@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Rexwell Villas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_over_replacement_player", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Value over replacement player"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Nuggets-news-Nikola-Jokics-MVP-admission-perfectly-summarizes-his-mindset.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

The 29-year-old Serbian star, who won the award in 2021 and 2022, finished runner-up in the voting in 2023 but had the satisfaction of leading the Nuggets to a first NBA title.\n\nThis season he averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists in the regular season and beat out Oklahoma City Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks in final voting for the award.\n\nIn another season in which Jokic managed to make brilliance almost look routine, he became the second player, after Oscar Robertson, to record 2,000 points, 900 rebounds and 600 assists in a season. His 25 triple-doubles and 68 double-doubles were both second in the league.\n\nJokic enters elite territory with a third MVP crown. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's six MVPs are the most ever. Bill Russell and Michael Jordan won five apiece and Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James four. Jokic joins Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson as three-time winners after earning 79 first-place votes compared to 15 for Gilgeous-Alexander and four for Doncic.\n\n\"We've got to start with the teammates. Without them I cannot do anything,\" Jokic said in the MVP announcement broadcast on TNT when asked to reflect on yet another MVP. \"Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, across time coaches, development coaches - it's all one big circle that I cannot be wherever I am without them.\"\n\nBehind Jokic, the 57-25 Nuggets matched the franchise high for victories in a season -- although they were tied for best record in the West with Oklahoma City and ended up with the second seed behind the young Thunder team.\n\nAs always, the MVP award offered plenty of scope for argument. Gilgeous-Alexander, a 25-year-old Canadian, averaged 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds, 6.2 assists and 2.0 steals per game for upstarts Oklahoma City and had a league-high 51 30-point games. Slovenia's Doncic led the league in scoring with 33.9 points per game and ranked second in assists with 9.8 per game. He averaged 9.2 rebounds per game and became the third player to average a 30-point triple-double after the All-Star break after Oscar Robertson (1961-62) and Russell Westbrook (2016-17).\n\nBut Nuggets coach Mike Malone was in no doubt that Jokic's third MVP was richly deserved. \"I don't know if I can put that into words what his greatness means to every team,\" Malone said last month, adding that he particularly admired the fact that winning the award was \"not his motivation.\" \"When he gets up in the morning ... he's not doing it for the individual accolades and recognition,\" Malone said. \"He's doing it for the collective to win and hopefully win another championship. That's what he's all about.\"\n\nMalone said Jokic was a classic example of a player who makes the rest of his team better. \"That is what I marvel at, most importantly with Nikola as a player. Just the consistent greatness and how he finds ways to every single night, no matter who is available around him, to bring that level of excellence every night,\" Malone said. \"Basically, put that team on his back and make each and every one of his teammates that much better.\"\n\nWhether Jokic will be able to combine an MVP award and the title this season remains to be seen. The Nuggets dropped the first two games of their Western Conference semi-final series to the Minnesota Timberwolves and face the tough task of trying to claw back on the Timberwolves' home court starting on Friday.\n\nJokic's victory marks the sixth straight season that the MVP award has gone to a player born outside the United States.

Without them I cannot do anything,\" Jokic said in the MVP announcement broadcast on TNT when asked to reflect on yet another MVP.\n\n\"Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, across time coaches, development coaches -- it's all one big circle that I cannot be wherever I am without them.\"\n\nBehind Jokic, the 57-25 Nuggets matched the franchise high for victories in a season -- although they were tied for best record in the West with Oklahoma City and ended up with the second seed behind the young Thunder team.\n\nAs always, the MVP award offered plenty of scope for argument.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander, a 25-year-old Canadian, averaged 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds, 6.2 assists and 2.0 steals per game for upstarts Oklahoma City and had a league-high 51 30-point games.\n\nSlovenia's Doncic led the league in scoring with 33.9 points per game and ranked second in assists with 9.8 per game. He averaged 9.2 rebounds per game and became the third player to average a 30-point triple-double after the All-Star break after Oscar Robertson (1961-62) and Russell Westbrook (2016-17).\n\nBut Nuggets coach Mike Malone was in no doubt that Jokic's third MVP was richly deserved.\n\n\"I don't know if I can put that into words what his greatness means to every team,\" Malone said last month, adding that he particularly admired the fact that winning the award was \"not his motivation.\"\n\n\"When he gets up in the morning ... he's not doing it for the individual accolades and recognition,\" Malone said. \"He's doing it for the collective to win and hopefully win another championship. That's what he's all about.\"\n\nMalone said Jokic was a classic example of a player who makes the rest of his team better.\n\n\"That is what I marvel at, most importantly with Nikola as a player. Just the consistent greatness and how he finds ways to every single night, no matter who is available around him, to bring that level of excellence every night,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Basically, put that team on his back and make each and every one of his teammates that much better.\"\n\nWhen Jokic won the 2022 MVP he was already back home in Sombor, Serbia, in the wake of the Nuggets' playoff exit.\n\nWhether Jokic will be able to combine an MVP award and the title this season remains to be seen.\n\nThe Nuggets dropped the first two games of their Western Conference semi-final series to the Minnesota Timberwolves and face the tough task of trying to claw back on the Timberwolves' home court starting on Friday.\n\nJokic's victory marks the sixth straight season that the MVP award has gone to a player born outside the United States. The last US-born player to win was James Harden in 2018.\n\n- \u00a9 AFP 2024", "source": {"uri": "the42.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The42"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Prior to that, he covered the Nets, Knicks and the NBA for nearly a decade. He joined ESPNNewYork.com after working at the New York Daily News for almost 12 years and is a graduate of Michigan State University.\n\nFollow him on Twitter \" Ohm's chat archive \"\n\nDenver Nuggets superstar Nikola Jokic continued to add to his legacy as one of the best NBA players ever Wednesday by winning his third Most Valuable Player trophy.\n\nJokic won the award for the third time in four seasons, succeeding last season's MVP, Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid.\n\nHe topped Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder and Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks, who finished second and third, respectively, in the voting. Jokic earned 926 total points (79 first-place votes), while Gilgeous-Alexander earned 640 points (15 first-place votes) and Doncic earned 566 (four first-place votes).\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo finished fourth while earning one first-place vote, and New York Knicks guard Jalen Brunson was fifth.\n\nJokic is the first center in six decades to win MVP three times in four seasons; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did it from 1973-74 to 1976-77.\n\n\"It's hard to differentiate greatness from greatness from greatness,\" Denver head coach Michael Malone said in early April of how Jokic has gotten better from previous MVP seasons. \"And then that's what he's been over multiple years now. I know the last six years now, we've had by far the best record in the Western Conference and only second of the NBA behind, I think Milwaukee in that time.\"\n\nIn his ninth season, Jokic played 79 games, his most since playing 80 games during the 2018-19 season. He joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to finish top-five in total points (fifth), rebounds (third) and assists (second) in multiple seasons, according to research by ESPN Stats & Information. Elgin Baylor is the only other player to do so once.\n\nJokic is also the second player to record 2,000 points, 900 rebounds and 600 assists in a season, joining Oscar Robertson.\n\nJokic averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists -- all top 10 in each statistical category. He had 25 triple-doubles, second only to Sacramento's Domantas Sabonis (26), while averaging 58.3% shooting from the field and 35.9% from behind the arc.\n\nPowered by Jokic, Denver finished the season fifth in offensive efficiency, eighth in defensive efficiency, and fourth in net rating. The Nuggets were one of four teams to rank top-10 in all three, along with the Celtics, Knicks and Thunder.\n\nWhile Denver boasted the best starting five in the league, Jokic's value was undeniable to Denver. The Nuggets posted a plus-11.8 net efficiency when Jokic was on the court but a minus-8.6 when he was off. Jokic led the NBA with a plus-682 plus-minus. The Nuggets were minus-251 with their franchise player off the court.\n\nOf course, the humble Jokic often says he doesn't care about individual honors as much as he covets the championship. Jokic is trying to lead the Nuggets to a repeat as world champs.\n\nShould he do so, the Nuggets big man will have put together a four-year run that only four other all-time greats have ever done. LeBron James, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Bill Russell are the only players to win three regular-season MVPs and two titles in a four-year span.\n\n\"Nikola has matured, his ability to continue to make everyone around him better,\" Malone said. \"And when you win a championship, and we're going to run it back, but in place of Bruce [Brown] and Jeff [Green], we're going to try to put young players in and the fact that we have a better record than we did last year.\n\n\"And we've had Jamal Murray miss [23] games. It speaks to Nikola understanding it's still my responsibility as a great player to help [the younger role players] as well as all the other guys to understand what their roles are, how to play on both ends of the floor, and most importantly, make those guys better.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Closer look at selection process for Michael Jordan trophy winner", "body": "The NBA MVP award has become a polarizing award in recent seasons, as fans akways have something to say about it. Every season, a host of players give their all to win this honor, however, only one can take it home at the end of the campaign.\n\nSince the 2022-23 season, the best player in the NBA receives the Michael Jordan Trophy, named after the Chicago Bulls legend, who was a five-time MVP himself while becoming one of the best players ever. Joel Embiid became the first person to win the revamped award. Before this, the trophy was named after former NBA commissioner Maurice Podoloff.\n\nMany people wonder how the process of deciding who's the NBA MVP award recipient unfolds and who has a vote on who wins the prize. Here's a detailed explanation on how the NBA MVP award winner is selected.\n\nWho votes for NBA MVP?\n\nUntil the 1979-80 season, NBA players were in charge of voting for the MVP award. In the following campaign, the league decided to change this and gave the responsibility to a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters across the United States and Canada.\n\nThe process to vote for MVP consists of 100 media members voting for their top 5 candidates. The first-place votes are worth 10 points, the second-place votes are worth seven points, the third-place votes are worth five points, the fourth-place votes are worth three points and the fifth-place votes are worth one point.\n\nThe player with the most cumulative points wins the award.\n\nWho are the strongest candidates to win the MVP award this season?\n\nAfter a season with several stars showing up for their teams, three players were named finalists to win the NBA MVP trophy. Luka Doncic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Nikola Jokic are the shortlisted candidates this season.\n\nLuka Doncic's game improved this season, with the Slovenian star averaging 33.9 points, 9.8 assists and 9.2 rebounds per game in 70 matchups for the Dallas Mavericks. He took his team to the No. 5 seed in the West, which could hurt his case against the other two candidates.\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander took his team from the No. 10 overall spot last season to the top position in the West standings this season. The Canadian guard played 75 games, averaging 30.1 points, 6.2 assists and 5.5 rebounds per game for the OKC Thunder.\n\nLast but not least, Nikola Jokic once again proved that he's an elite player in the NBA, playing even better than last season when he won his first NBA championship. The Serbian center played in 79 games, averaging 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists per game with the Denver Nuggets.\n\nAll season long, these three engaged in fierce competition. Now, it's time to know who takes the MVP award. Doncic and Gilgeous-Alexander would win their first MVP award, while this could be Jokic's third MVP award and first since it was renamed as the Michael Jordan trophy.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "orlando_silva@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Orlando Silva", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Podoloff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maurice Podoloff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner_of_the_NBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commissioner of the NBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Awards", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Awards", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/20611575-1715195169.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

On Wednesday, Nikola Jokic joined those NBA legends as three-time winners of the league's most coveted individual honor.\n\nJokic, 29, the Denver Nuggets superstar born in Sombor, Serbia, was named NBA MVP for the third time in four seasons, defeating finalists Oklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Dallas' Luka Doncic. Jokic earned 79 first-place votes, while Gilgeous-Alexander earned 15. Doncic had four, while the Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo had one.\n\n\"When I won the award the first time, I said, 'This is cool.' When I won the second time, the list got shorter, and now the third time, the list is short short. And it's a great list to be on,\" Jokic said. \"I think I'm going to be proud of my legacy when my career is done, but in the moment, this is something to be very proud of.\"\n\nComing off the only campaign in the last four in which he didn't win MVP (he was runner-up to Joel Embiid in 2023 but won NBA Finals MVP last summer after leading the Nuggets to their first championship), Jokic tied for 11th in the league in scoring at 26.4 points per game. But he was fourth in the league with 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists per game -- illustrative of the remarkable diversity in his game considering his 6-foot-11, 284-pound frame.\n\nBasketball players this good are often identified by a single name, and Jokic is certainly in that rarified air. Joker, (and Magic, Bird and Moses) trails only Kareem, MJ, Russell, LeBron and Wilt for the most NBA MVPs.\n\n\"He's one of the best players to ever play this game, it's that simple,\" LeBron James said of Jokic last month on the eve of a playoff series between the Nuggets and LeBron's Lakers, which Denver won in five games.\n\nJokic and the Nuggets currently trail the Minnesota Timberwolves 2-0 in a Western Conference semifinal series. During the regular season, he posted 23 triple-doubles in 79 regular-season games. He is the fourth player in league history with multiple seasons of 20 or more triple-doubles, joining Oscar Robertson, Russell Westbrook and Wilt Chamberlain.\n\nAn analytics marvel, Jokic again led the NBA in many advanced metrics -- which he's done for the last four years. No player contributes more to winning or creates more value over a replacement player than Jokic. He's also a 36 percent 3-point shooter, an 82 percent foul shooter and shoots nearly 63 percent on shots from inside the arc. He cut down on his turnovers from last season, averaged 1.5 steals and nearly one blocked shot per game; he increased his scoring and rebounds from a season ago.\n\n\"Last year I didn't win it, but we won the championship, and that was much better,\" Jokic said. \"It's been a journey and a process. I was able to trust in my dream, and it's been a collective effort with help from a lot of people to get to this point. The players and the coaches and the medical staff have been behind me, and I'm so appreciative of everyone who has helped me get here.\"\n\nFor the second consecutive year, Jokic was the anchor of the NBA's best starting lineup. He's a center who can run a fast break with the ball, initiate the offense, pass out of or over any double-team and step back with a lofty, high-arcing 3-pointer to break an opponent's proverbial back.\n\n\"The most important thing is he changes the way his teammates think about their own play,\" James said last month. \"When you're able to inspire your teammates to play at a level that sometimes they don't even feel like they can play at, that's the true testament of a great one.\"\n\nJokic held off two worthy candidates for MVP. Not only was Doncic the NBA's leading scorer at 33.9 points per game, but he was second with 9.8 assists, behind only Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton. In 23 games after the All-Star break, Doncic averaged 33.2 points, 10.1 boards and 10.3 assists.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander, meanwhile, slipped from historic production ever so slightly toward the end of the season, finishing third in the league in scoring (30.1 points) and second in steals (2.5 per game) for the top seed in the Western Conference.", "source": {"uri": "westhawaiitoday.com",

And the MVP trophy is his again.\n\nJokic, the Denver Nuggets star from Serbia, was announced Wednesday night as the NBA's Most Valuable Player -- his third time winning the award in the past four seasons, a feat that just six other players in league history have accomplished.\n\nHe averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists. Others averaged more in each category -- and Jokic has had better years in each of those categories -- but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season.\n\nJokic got 79 of a possible 99 first-place votes from the panel of reporters and broadcasters who cast ballots on awards when the regular season ended.\n\n\"It's got to start with your teammates,\" Jokic said on TNT, where the award was announced. \"Without them, I'm nothing. Without them, I cannot do nothing. Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, development coaches ... I cannot be whoever I am without them.\"\n\nIt likely was not a coincidence that Jokic appeared on television for the award announcement wearing a T-shirt commemorating the life of one of his mentors, Golden State assistant coach Dejan Milojevic, who died earlier this year after a heart attack on a road trip.\n\nOklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was second and Dallas' Luka Doncic was third, both getting into the top three of MVP voting for the first time. With Jokic from Serbia, Gilgeous-Alexander from Canada and Doncic from Slovenia, it marked the third consecutive season that three players born outside the U.S. finished 1-2-3 in the MVP balloting.\n\nThis time, the foreign dominance atop the NBA was even more pronounced: Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is from Greece, was fourth -- so this became the first time in the award's 69-year history that international players went 1-2-3-4 in the voting. It also became the sixth consecutive year that a player born outside the U.S. won the award.\n\nJokic appeared on all 99 ballots, with 18 second-place votes and two third-place votes. Gilgeous-Alexander also appeared on every ballot, with 15 first-place votes, 40 second-place, 40 third-place, three fourth-place and one fifth-place nod.\n\nDoncic was on all but one ballot and got four first-place votes. Antetokounmpo got one first-place vote on his way to fourth. New York's Jalen Brunson was fifth, followed by Boston's Jayson Tatum, Minnesota's Anthony Edwards, Sacramento's Domantas Sabonis and Phoenix's Kevin Durant.\n\n\"Some people say it's the best player on the best team,\" Jokic said, when asked to define an MVP. \"To me, it's the guy who's the most valuable, the team couldn't play without him.\"\n\nJokic is now the ninth player to win the MVP award at least three times. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won it six times, Bill Russell and Michael Jordan each won five, Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won four, and Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are the other three-time winners.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person",

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won it six, Bill Russell and Michael Jordan each won five, and Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won four. Moses Malone, Larry Bird, and Magic Johnson are the other three-time winners.\n\nJokic's surprise rise to superstardom has been chronicled time and again over the years: He was the 41st overall pick in the 2014 draft, didn't even think he had a realistic chance at playing in the NBA when his career was beginning, and now has a Hall of Fame resume at 29.\n\nThe other players with three MVP trophies in a four-year span are James, Johnson, Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Chamberlain, and Russell. And Jokic becomes the fifth player to be first or second in the MVP voting in four consecutive years -- joining Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Russell, and Tim Duncan.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander had perhaps the best feel-good story in the NBA this season, helping Oklahoma City to the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference by averaging 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 6.2 assists. The Thunder won 57 games, 17 more than they did last season and 33 more than they did two years ago, their rise coinciding with Gilgeous-Alexander's emergence as one of the game's elite players.\n\n\"There is not a night when I don't feel like we have the best player on the floor. ... There's no one I'd rather have on our team than him,\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault, the league's coach of the year, said last month.\n\nDoncic made a case for the MVP award by posting the first season in NBA history in which a player averaged 34 points, 9 rebounds, and 9 assists per game. There had been 14 instances before this year in which a player averaged that many points and rebounds in a season -- of those, five had resulted in MVP wins, including last season when Philadelphia's Joel Embiid averaged 33 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nAnd this was the second time ever that a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists per game. The other was in 1972-73, when Kansas City's Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11 assists. He finished third in that season's MVP voting, just like Doncic did this season.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's six MVPs are the most ever. Bill Russell and Michael Jordan won five apiece and Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James four.\n\nDenver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic was named NBA Most valuable Player for the third time in four seasons on Wednesday.\n\nThe 29-year-old Serbian star, who won the award in 2021 and 2022, finished runner-up in the voting in 2023 but had the satisfaction of leading the Nuggets to a first NBA title.\n\nThis season he averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists in the regular season and beat out Oklahoma City Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks in final voting for the award.\n\nIn another season in which Jokic managed to make brilliance almost look routine, he became the second player, after Oscar Robertson, to record 2,000 points, 900 rebounds and 600 assists in a season.\n\nHis 25 triple-doubles and 68 double-doubles were both second in the league.\n\nJokic enters elite territory with a third MVP crown. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's six MVPs are the most ever. Bill Russell and Michael Jordan won five apiece and Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James four.\n\nJokic joins Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson as three-time winners after earning 79 first-placed votes compared to 15 for Gilgeous-Alexander and four for Doncic.\n\n\"We've got to start with the teammates. Without them I cannot do anything,\" Jokic said in the MVP announcement broadcast on TNT when asked to reflect on yet another MVP.\n\n\"Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, across time coaches, development coaches -- it's all one big circle that I cannot be wherever I am without them.\"\n\nBehind Jokic, the 57-25 Nuggets matched the franchise high for victories in a season -- although they were tied for best record in the West with Oklahoma City and ended up with the second seed behind the young Thunder team.\n\nAs always, the MVP award offered plenty of scope for argument.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander, a 25-year-old Canadian, averaged 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds, 6.2 assists and 2.0 steals per game for upstarts Oklahoma City and had a league-high 51 30-point games.\n\nSlovenia's Doncic led the league in scoring with 33.9 points per game and ranked second in assists with 9.8 per game. He averaged 9.2 rebounds per game and became the third player to average a 30-point triple-double after the All-Star break after Oscar Robertson (1961-62) and Russell Westbrook (2016-17).\n\nBut Nuggets coach Mike Malone was in no doubt that Jokic's third MVP was richly deserved.\n\n\"I don't know if I can put that into words what his greatness means to every team,\" Malone said last month, adding that he particularly admired the fact that winning the award was \"not his motivation.\"\n\n\"When he gets up in the morning ... he's not doing it for the individual accolades and recognition,\" Malone said. \"He's doing it for the collective to win and hopefully win another championship. That's what he's all about.\"", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [{"uri": "siddarth_sriram@news18.com", "name": "Siddarth Sriram", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bill Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilt_Chamberlain", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wilt Chamberlain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moses Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Larry Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Malone_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Malone (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Awards", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/04/ap24102181598235-fotor-20240411155837-2024-04-548df1494af7708f68c89de18853967b-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

The NBA announced earlier that Jokic was awarded the 2023-24 MVP award and his supporters couldn't be happier. Former Denver Nuggets coach George Karl also reflected on the Serbian big man's career.\n\nJokic outperformed his fellow finalists, Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the OKC Thunder. He helped the Nuggets secure the second spot in the Western Conference, which earned him his third MVP nod in four years.\n\nThe Nuggets posted a video on X (formerly Twitter), which his wife, Natalija, narrated. In the video, they showed what Jokic went through from an overlooked late pick to now one of the best players in the world.\n\nAfter seeing the video, Karl couldn't help but admire the European center. He joined in on the celebration of Jokic winning another MVP award and even mentioned that everyone's lucky to be witnessing his stellar career so far.\n\n\"One of the most special and unique stories in the history of a beautiful game . We are all lucky to witness it!!\" Karl wrote. \"Celebrate Jokic and Keep Climbing!!\n\nJokic averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds, and nine assists to secure his third MVP award.\n\nAlso read: 5 reasons why Luka Doncic should have won MVP award over Nikola Jokic\n\nNikola Jokic credits his teammates after winning the MVP\n\nWinning the MVP award has never been easy, but Nikola Jokic makes it look like it is. Jokic is now the ninth player to win the award three times. Despite it being an individual award, the Nuggets star didn't forget his teammates. He credited his teammates for helping him win the award for the third time in four years.\n\n\"It's a journey, it's a process, it's trusting in your teammates, your teammates trusting in you. It's a whole collective effort that put me in the bright spotlight,\" Jokic said.\n\nJokic also credited the Nuggets' coaching staff for how they've helped him become the star that he is today. With him as their best player, they were able to win it all last year and he earned his first Finals MVP award, beating the Miami Heat in five games.\n\nDenver is down 0-2 in the best-of-seven series, failing to win the first two home games against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Because of the hounding defense of the Wolves, the Nuggets have struggled to execute their game plan. Many are expecting Jokic to perform like an MVP as they travel to Minnesota and try to get back in the series.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reign_amurao@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Reign Amurao", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Karl", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Karl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Awards_and_Bestsellers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Awards and Bestsellers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Awards", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Awards", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/32243-17152176440718-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

The honor places him in elite company alongside only eight other players in league history who have won the award three times: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Russell, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Wilt Chamberlain, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Moses Malone.\n\nMore from Sportico.com\n\nJokic averaged 26.4 points, 9.0 assists and 12.4 rebounds per game in the 2023-24 season. The 29-year-old finished top five in the NBA in totals for those three categories, becoming the first player to accomplish that since Chamberlain in the 1960s. Jokic also finished top 10 in steals.\n\nGiven the above figures, it's no surprise that Jokic also led the league in Box Plus/Minus (BPM), an all-in-one player metric based solely on box score statistics. The NBA leader in BPM has won the MVP in 13 of the past 16 seasons, with Joel Embiid's win over Jokic last year being one of the few exceptions. That's a shift from earlier eras of NBA history, when that advanced stat would have predicted fewer than half of MVP winners.\n\nDenver outscored opponents by 12.6 points per 100 possessions this season with Jokic in the game, but were outscored by 11.1 points per 100 possessions with Jokic on the bench. That difference of 23.7 is the largest for any player who played at least 1,000 minutes, according to Cleaning the Glass.

Since the 2018-19 season, Jokic has been selected to six All-Star games and five All-NBA teams and won two MVPs.\n\nAdditionally, he led the Nuggets to the 2023 NBA title, which marked the first championship in franchise history.\n\nMiller on Jokic\n\nDespite all that the Serbian has accomplished during his pro career, Reggie Miller believes that he still needs to do more to be perceived as one of the greatest players in NBA history.\n\n\"I think if he wins his third MVP in four years, obviously if he wins a championship, he'll probably win Finals MVP. He's in a different door of the Hall of Fame and the greatest players and mentioning in that way, because we view him a little bit different. In terms of centers, he's on the shortlist,\" Miller said on The Dan Patrick Show.\n\n\"You've got Wilt [Chamberlain], Shaq (Shaquille O'Neal), Kareem [Abdul-Jabbar], Hakeem [Olajuwon], and then, I mean, you can put Moses Malone maybe in there. But he's gonna be in a very short list if he can win another title, Finals MVP, and obviously a regular-season MVP. This'll be three in four years,\" the Indiana Pacers legend added.\n\nThe 2024 MVP?\n\nWhile the winner of the 2023-24 MVP award has yet to be announced, Jokic is one of the three finalists for the award, along with Luka Doncic and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.\n\nAccording to an article from the Miami Herald that was last updated earlier this month, Jokic is the betting favorite to win the award at a -150.\n\nDuring the regular season, the Serbian big man averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 9.0 assists per game across 79 games played with the Nuggets and guided Denver to a 57-25 record, which was tied with the Oklahoma City Thunder for the best record of any team in the Western Conference.\n\nNuggets fans will have to wait until Wednesday to find out if Jokic will win his third MVP award in four years, but they should feel optimistic about his chances of taking home the award.\n\nIf that happens, Nikola will become only the ninth player in NBA history with three or more regular-season MVPs. He'll also be one step closer to becoming an all-time great, even though many already think he belongs in that company.\n\nRelated: Rasheed breaks down why NBA teams will ditch the small ball concept: \"Everybody wants to be like Steph, but none of this MFs can shoot like Steph\"", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jesse_cinquini@postandcourier.com", "name": "Jesse Cinquini", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Olajuwon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Olajuwon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moses Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dan_Patrick_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Dan Patrick Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilt_Chamberlain", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wilt Chamberlain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Herald", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Herald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/52/f5227140-de1c-5d51-8bed-d55568ae22f6/6639f67f52aec.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo was second in points and sixth in rebounds per game, and Sacramento's Domantas Sabonis led the league in rebounds per game while ranking sixth in assists per contest.\n\nThere's a reasonable chance that Victor Wembanyama - the No. 1 pick in last year's draft by San Antonio, along with the rookie of the year winner and runner-up to Minnesota's Rudy Gobert for defensive player of the year this season - wins the MVP award one day.\n\nDenver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic drops back to defend during the second half of Game 2 of an NBA basketball second-round playoff series against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Monday, May 6, 2024, in Denver. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)\n\nBut Nikola Jokic's win this year extended an unusual streak.\n\nFor the 11th straight year, the MVP award was claimed by someone who wasn't a No. 1 overall draft pick. That's the longest such run in NBA history; the last No. 1 to win was LeBron James, then of Miami, in 2013.\n\nNikola Jokic is the fifth player in NBA history to finish first or second in the MVP balloting in at least four consecutive seasons. He won the award in 2021, 2022 and this year, and was second to Philadelphia's Joel Embiid in 2023.\n\nBoston Celtics greats Bill Russell and Larry Bird each were first or second in the balloting in six consecutive seasons. Russell won in 1958, 1961, 1962 and 1963, while finishing second in 1959 and 1960; Bird was second in 1981, 1982 and 1983 before winning in 1984, 1985 and 1986.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar (1971-74) and Tim Duncan (2001-04) are the other players with four straight top-two finishes.\n\nDallas\u00b4 Luka Doncic averaged 33.9 points, 9.2 rebounds and 9.8 assists per game this season. There had never been a season in NBA history in which someone finished with all those averages.\n\nAnd he still didn\u00b4t win MVP.\n\nThere were 14 previous instances of someone averaging at least 33 points and nine rebounds; those stats were enough to MVP five times (Joel Embiid in 2023, Bob McAdoo in 1975, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1972, Wilt Chamberlain in 1960 and 1966).\n\nOf course, it should be noted that Chamberlain had some years when he was even more dominant and didn\u00b4t win MVP - including five consecutive seasons in which he averaged at least 34 points and 22 rebounds but didn't get the trophy in any of them. Elgin Baylor averaged at least 34 points and 14 rebounds in three seasons when he wasn\u00b4t MVP, and Rick Barry had a 35.6-point, 9.2-rebound year that didn\u00b4t get him the award, either.\n\nBefore Doncic this year, there was just one season in which a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists. That was 1972-73 when Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11.4 assists for Kansas City. He was third in the MVP voting that season.\n\nNikola Jokic\u00b4s win means a player who is listed at 6-foot-10 or taller - Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2019 and 2020, Jokic in 2021, 2022 and now 2024, and Joel Embiid in 2023 - has won the MVP award in six consecutive seasons.\n\nThat\u00b4s a first for the NBA. But that doesn\u00b4t mean this is the first dominant stretch for big men. Far from it.\n\nThere was a 16-year stretch from 1964-65 through 1979-80 when players generally considered to be centers or at least power forwards won the award each year. Not all were at least 6-10, but all were considered big men.\n\nThe last guard to win the MVP award was James Harden, then of Houston, in 2018.\n\nMilwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo got one first-place vote. It mattered.\n\nAntetokounmpo has now gotten at least one first-place MVP vote in six consecutive seasons, extending the longest such streak in the league.\n\nIt's the longest first-place-vote streak since LeBron James got a first-place vote in eight consecutive years from 2008 through 2015. That run ended when Golden State's Stephen Curry became the first - and still only - unanimous MVP in 2016.\n\nDenver's Nikola Jokic has gotten a first-place vote in each of the last four years. Philadelphia's Joel Embiid had first-place votes in each of the previous three seasons but was ineligible for consideration this year because of the league's new rule mandating that players must appear in a certain number of games before getting onto the ballot.\n\nLeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers didn't get a vote in the MVP balloting this season. It's only the second time in his 21-year career that has happened; the other was last season, ending an unprecedented 19-year streak of getting at least one vote. (The panel of reporters and broadcasters who vote on awards rank their top five MVP choices on their ballots.)\n\nHe is the only player in NBA history to appear in the MVP results in 19 different seasons. When the All-NBA team is revealed later this month, James could make a 20th appearance, which would extend his record.\n\nNo other player has more than 15 All-NBA nods.\n\nHere's a wrapup of all the NBA awards that have been announced to this point:\n\n- Most Valuable Player, Nikola Jokic, Denver.\n\n- Most Improved Player, Tyrese Maxey, Philadelphia.\n\n- Rookie of the Year, Victor Wembanyama, San Antonio.\n\n- Defensive Player of the Year, Rudy Gobert, Minnesota.\n\n- Sixth Man of the Year, Naz Reid, Minnesota.\n\n- Clutch Player of the Year, Stephen Curry, Golden State.\n\n- Coach of the Year, Mark Daigneault, Oklahoma City.\n\n- Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year, Mike Conley, Minnesota.\n\n- Executive of the Year, Brad Stevens, Boston.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA\n\nDallas Mavericks' Luka Doncic, left, congratulates teammate Kyrie Irving as Irving speaks to the media after beating the Los Angeles Clippers 114-101 in Game 6 of an NBA basketball first-round playoff series Friday, May 3, 2024, in Dallas.

Without them, I cannot do nothing,\" Jokic said on TNT's \"Inside the NBA\" on Wednesday after earning the award. \"So coaches, players, organization, medical staff, development coaches, it's all one big circle. But I cannot be whatever I'm without them.\"\n\nREQUIRED READING: Nuggets' Nikola Jokic wins third NBA MVP award in four seasons\n\nThe nine-year NBA veteran beat out Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in the voting by a total of 286 votes (64 first-place votes) for the award. The Dallas Mavericks' Luka Donic, Knicks' Jalen Brunson and the Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo rounded out the top five in the voting.\n\nJokic is averaging 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and nine assists per game this season. He brings 25 triple-doubles into Thursday's Game 3 against the Minnesota Timberwolves, in which the Nuggets look to avoid going down 3-0.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Jokic's MVP history:\n\nAfter being recognized as the 2024 NBA MVP, Jokic has now won the award three times, including in three of the last four seasons (2021, 2022 and 2024). The only year he did not win it was in 2023, as Philadelphia 76ers forward Joel Embiid won the award.\n\nAs noted by ESPN, \"the Joker\" is the first center since Baketball Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to win the MVP award three times in a four-year span.\n\nJokic joins an elite class of NBA players with his third award, becoming just the ninth player to win three or more MVP awards in the history of the NBA. He is the first since LeBron James did it in 2012 as a member of the Miami Heat.\n\nHere's the full list of NBA players who have won the MVP award on three or more occasions according to the NBA:", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_NBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inside the NBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

A throng of Wizards fans flocked to the corner of their arena where Jokic would disappear down the tunnel toward the locker room. The enemy sent him off with an ovation. \"There's a lot of talented players in this league,\" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said afterward, \"but if you don't love Nikola Jokic, I don't know what you're looking for.\"\n\nJokic, 29, was named Most Valuable Player in the NBA for the third time in his career Wednesday night, beating out finalists Luka Doncic (Dallas Mavericks) and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Oklahoma City Thunder) for the 2023-24 prize.\n\nHe is the ninth three-time MVP in league history, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Russell, Michael Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, LeBron James, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Moses Malone.

He amassed 926 points. Gilgeous-Alexander was the runner-up with 640 points.\n\nSince the implementation of a media voting panel in 1980-81, only three players have finished top-two in MVP voting four consecutive years: Bird, Tim Duncan and now Jokic. Russell and Abdul-Jabbar accomplished the feat under the old voting system.\n\nJokic finished the regular season ranked fifth in total points, third in total rebounds and second in total assists -- top-five in all three categories for the second time in his career. He averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and nine assists per game, compiling 25 triple-doubles and shooting 58.3% from the field. His true shooting percentage eclipsed 65% for the third consecutive season.\n\n\"I think he's stated his case pretty well,\" longtime teammate Jamal Murray said Wednesday before the award was announced amid an awkward backdrop: Denver trailing a playoff series 2-0. \"He does it every night. It's hard to do what he does and face the kind of pressure that he does each and every day. He does it in the smallest ways. He makes everybody around us better. He's a leader on the court and someone we expect greatness from every time he steps on the court. And he's delivered. ... He's been so consistent all his career, all his MVP runs. He's been so consistent. So I don't expect one or two bad games to sway that in any way.\"\n\nWhen Jokic was on the court this season, the Nuggets outscored their opponents by 11.8 points per 100 possessions. When he was off the court, they were outscored by 8.6 points per 100 possessions, amounting to a 20.4-point difference in net rating. Denver's 122.4 offensive rating with Jokic on the floor was more efficient than the best offensive team in the league, the Celtics (122.2). Denver's 104.1 offensive rating without Jokic was lower than the worst offensive team in the league, the Grizzlies (106.8).\n\nThe Nuggets finished in a tie for the best record in the Western Conference. Their 57-25 regular season tied a franchise wins record. Jokic is the team's only starter who has been named an All-Star in his career.\n\nHe averaged 101.3 touches per game, nearly 10 more than any other individual in the league, and 75.1 passes per game, 3.5 more than any other player. He led the NBA in most advanced metrics including player efficiency rating (31.0), win shares (17.0), win shares per 48 minutes (.299), offensive box plus/minus (9.0), defensive box plus/minus (4.2) and value over a replacement player (10.6).\n\n\"To be honest, I liked last year when I didn't get it and then we won a championship. Much better,\" Jokic said. \"But I don't know what to say. It's a journey. It's a process. It's trusting your teammates; teammates trusting you. It's just a whole collective effort that put me in front of, like, the bright spotlight.\"\n\nJokic's first two MVPs were bestowed before he had won a championship, or even reached the NBA Finals. Each was accompanied, therefore, by a fair degree of scrutiny. He didn't have the winning reputation to correspond with his individual accolades.\n\nThat's different this time. Jokic owns a Finals MVP trophy. A month before the startling round of applause he received in Washington, another unusual scene paralleled it, speaking volumes about the growth of Jokic's eminence outside Denver. It was Dec. 12 in Chicago, and for the second time in three weeks, Jokic had just been tossed from a game after arguing with referees.\n\nThis time, as he sauntered toward the locker room to serve his sentence, the crowd started booing. Not at Jokic. At the officials. Only one technical foul prompted the ejection. Disappointment and disgust permeated through United Center as Bulls fans watched the reason they'd purchased their tickets disappear for the night.", "source": {"uri": "lamarledger.com", "dataType":

Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo was second in points and sixth in rebounds per game, and Sacramento's Domantas Sabonis led the league in rebounds per game while ranking sixth in assists per contest.\n\nTOP PICK DROUGHT\n\nThere's a reasonable chance that Victor Wembanyama -- the No. 1 pick in last year's draft by San Antonio, along with the rookie of the year winner and runner-up to Minnesota's Rudy Gobert for defensive player of the year this season -- wins the MVP award one day.\n\nBut Nikola Jokic's win this year extended an unusual streak.\n\nFor the 11th straight year, the MVP award was claimed by someone who wasn't a No. 1 overall draft pick. That's the longest such run in NBA history; the last No. 1 to win was LeBron James, then of Miami, in 2013.\n\nFINISHING TOP 2\n\nNikola Jokic is the fifth player in NBA history to finish first or second in the MVP balloting in at least four consecutive seasons. He won the award in 2021, 2022 and this year, and was second to Philadelphia's Joel Embiid in 2023.\n\nBoston Celtics greats Bill Russell and Larry Bird each were first or second in the balloting in six consecutive seasons. Russell won in 1958, 1961, 1962 and 1963, while finishing second in 1959 and 1960; Bird was second in 1981, 1982 and 1983 before winning in 1984, 1985 and 1986.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar (1971-74) and Tim Duncan (2001-04) are the other players with four straight top-two finishes.\n\n33, 9 AND 9 NOT ENOUGH\n\nDallas' Luka Doncic averaged 33.9 points, 9.2 rebounds and 9.8 assists per game this season. There had never been a season in NBA history in which someone finished with all those averages.\n\nAnd he still didn't win MVP.\n\nThere were 14 previous instances of someone averaging at least 33 points and nine rebounds; those stats were enough to MVP five times (Joel Embiid in 2023, Bob McAdoo in 1975, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1972, Wilt Chamberlain in 1960 and 1966).\n\nOf course, it should be noted that Chamberlain had some years when he was even more dominant and didn't win MVP -- including five consecutive seasons in which he averaged at least 34 points and 22 rebounds but didn't get the trophy in any of them. Elgin Baylor averaged at least 34 points and 14 rebounds in three seasons when he wasn't MVP, and Rick Barry had a 35.6-point, 9.2-rebound year that didn't get him the award, either.\n\nBefore Doncic this year, there was just one season in which a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists. That was 1972-73 when Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11.4 assists for Kansas City. He was third in the MVP voting that season.\n\nREACHING HEIGHTS\n\nNikola Jokic's win means a player who is listed at 6-foot-10 or taller -- Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2019 and 2020, Jokic in 2021, 2022 and now 2024, and Joel Embiid in 2023 -- has won the MVP award in six consecutive seasons.\n\nThat's a first for the NBA. But that doesn't mean this is the first dominant stretch for big men. Far from it.\n\nThere was a 16-year stretch from 1964-65 through 1979-80 when players generally considered to be centers or at least power forwards won the award each year. Not all were at least 6-10, but all were considered big men.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nThe last guard to win the MVP award was James Harden, then of Houston, in 2018.\n\nGIANNIS' STREAK\n\nMilwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo got one first-place vote. It mattered.\n\nAntetokounmpo has now gotten at least one first-place MVP vote in six consecutive seasons, extending the longest such streak in the league.\n\nIt's the longest first-place-vote streak since LeBron James got a first-place vote in eight consecutive years from 2008 through 2015. That run ended when Golden State's Stephen Curry became the first -- and still only -- unanimous MVP in 2016.\n\nDenver's Nikola Jokic has gotten a first-place vote in each of the last four years. Philadelphia's Joel Embiid had first-place votes in each of the previous three seasons but was ineligible for consideration this year because of the league's new rule mandating that players must appear in a certain number of games before getting onto the ballot.\n\nNO LeBRON\n\nLeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers didn't get a vote in the MVP balloting this season. It's only the second time in his 21-year career that has happened; the other was last season, ending an unprecedented 19-year streak of getting at least one vote. (The panel of reporters and broadcasters who vote on awards rank their top five MVP choices on their ballots.)\n\nHe is the only player in NBA history to appear in the MVP results in 19 different seasons. When the All-NBA team is revealed later this month, James could make a 20th appearance, which would extend his record.\n\nNo other player has more than 15 All-NBA nods.\n\nALL THE AWARDS\n\nHere's a wrapup of all the NBA awards that have been announced to this point:\n\n-- Most Valuable Player, Nikola Jokic, Denver.\n\n-- Most Improved Player, Tyrese Maxey, Philadelphia.\n\n-- Rookie of the Year, Victor Wembanyama, San Antonio.\n\n-- Defensive Player of the Year, Rudy Gobert, Minnesota.\n\n-- Sixth Man of the Year, Naz Reid, Minnesota.\n\n-- Clutch Player of the Year, Stephen Curry, Golden State.\n\n-- Coach of the Year, Mark Daigneault, Oklahoma City.\n\n-- Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year, Mike Conley, Minnesota.\n\n-- Executive of the Year, Brad Stevens, Boston.\n\nAP NBA:

Only Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is North American, but not American (he was born in Toronto, Canada).\n\nJokic's victory also marks the sixth consecutive season that the MVP award has gone to a player born outside the United States. The last American-born player to win the award was James Harden in 2018.\n\nThe 2.11-metre centre, who was born on 19 February 1995 in Sombor, Serbia, managed to make brilliance look routine, becoming only the second player after Oscar Robertson to record 2,000 points, 900 rebounds and 600 assists in a season.\n\nThe fact that Colorado finished with the second-best record of all 30 NBA teams (57-25, behind only the Celtics' 64-18 and tied with the Thunder) was crucial. His 25 triple-doubles and 68 double-doubles speak for themselves.\n\nJokic enters elite territory with his third regular-season MVP crown. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's six MVPs are the most ever. Bill Russell andMichael Jordan each won five, while Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James are ahead of the Serb, who still has plenty of years ahead of him.\n\n\"You have to start with your teammates. I can't do anything without them,\" Jokic said during the MVP announcement on TNT when asked to reflect on another MVP.\n\n\"Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, developmental coaches over time, it's all a big circle that I couldn't be where I am without them.\n\nAs always, the MVP award was a controversial one. Canadian Gilgeous-Alexander averaged 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds, 6.2 assists and 2.0 steals per game for Oklahoma City and had 51 games of at least 30 points, the most in the league.\n\nSlovenian Luka Doncic, a former Real Madrid player, led the league in scoring with 33.9 points per game and was second in assists with 9.8 per game. He averaged 9.2 rebounds per game and became the third player to average a 30-point triple-double after the All-Star break, joining Oscar Robertson (1961-62) and Russell Westbrook (2016-17).\n\nHowever, Nuggets coach Mike Malone had no doubt that Jokic deserved his third MVP. \"When he gets up in the morning... he's not doing it for the individual accolades and recognition,\" Malone said. \"He does it for the collective to win and hopefully win another championship. That's what it's all about.\"\n\nAwards aside, Tuesday's loss means the Nuggets have lost the first two games of their Western Conference semifinal series against the Minnesota Timberwolves and face the daunting task of trying to bounce back on the road starting on Friday.", "source": {"uri": "insidethegames.biz", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.insidethegames.biz"}, "authors": [{"uri":

This stirred a controversial debate since many believed other stars like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Luka Doncic deserved the trophy.\n\nJokic finally came out and spoke on winning the award, sharing an incredibly humble response to winning his third league MVP.\n\n\"To be honest. I liked last year when I didn't win it and we won a championship much better,\" said Jokic, via Sideline Sources on Instagram.\n\nThis truly shows Jokic's modest attitude with a team-first mentality. The Nuggets were able to go all the way in the 2023 season, winning the NBA title behind Jokic and company.\n\nJokic has never been a player that attempts to take over the spotlight. He's fine with basketball being his day job, and keeping the rest of his life private.\n\nHe's a generational player, but the bright lights don't benefit Jokic. Denver's star has one goal in mind each season, and that's to win an NBA championship.\n\nRelated: Shaquille O'Neal Sends Five-Word Message To NBA MVP Nikola Jokic\n\nRelated: Everyone's Saying The Same Thing About Nikola Jokic Winning NBA MVP", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_escarpio@postandcourier.com", "name": "Max Escarpio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ball Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/27/327d34ad-27fa-5bb2-a77b-3cc2709042aa/663c3a617dae2.image.jpg?crop=1199%2C629%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Bill Russell and Michael Jordan won five apiece and Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James four.\n\nJokic joins Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson as three-time winners after earning 79 first-placed votes compared to 15 for Gilgeous-Alexander and four for Doncic.\n\nAs always, the MVP award offered plenty of scope for argument.\n\nBut Jokic was not offended during the TNT interview when it was suggested that Gilgeous-Alexander might have been a more worthy winner.\n\n\"There are a lot of players who deserve it,\" he said. \"It's probably the details and the small things.\"\n\nGilgeous-Alexander, a 25-year-old Canadian, averaged 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds, 6.2 assists and 2.0 steals per game for upstarts Oklahoma City and had a league-high 51 30-point games.\n\nSlovenia's Doncic led the league in scoring with 33.9 points per game and ranked second in assists with 9.8 per game, behind the Indiana Pacers' Tyrese Haliburton (10.9).\n\nBut Nuggets coach Mike Malone was in no doubt that Jokic's third MVP was richly deserved.\n\n\"I don't know if I can put that into words what his greatness means,\" he said.\n\n\"When he gets up in the morning... he's not doing it for the individual accolades and recognition. He's doing it for the collective to win and hopefully win another championship. That's what he's all about.\n\n\"That is what I marvel at. Just the consistent greatness and how he finds ways to every single night, no matter who is available around him, to bring that level of excellence.\"\n\nThe Nuggets, meanwhile, dropped the first two games of their Western Conference semi-final series to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and face the tough task of trying to claw back on the Timberwolves' home court starting on May 10.

With different opinions comes different criteria for winning the prestigious award. Charles Barkley, the winner of the 1993 NBA MVP award, also has his views on it, which he candidly discussed just like he does about all things related to basketball.\n\nOn a recent episode of Shannon Sharpe's Club Shay Shay podcast, the former Sixers forward revealed his distaste for the MVP selection process. \"The MVP has never went to the best player. Never. It goes to the best player on the best team,\" said Chuck. He further added, \"Because nobody in their right mind thinks Steve Nash is better than Shaq and Kobe [Bryant].\"\n\nOn the flip side, Sir Charles also praised some instances where he believed the deserving candidate won the award. In 2011, Derrick Rose won the NBA MVP over LeBron James and, to Barkley, that was fair because of the Bulls' 62-20 record. He also discussed the candidates for this season and delivered his verdict on the 2024 NBA MVP race.\n\nThis year's NBA MVP race was one for the ages. After the reigning MVP, Joel Embiid was deemed ineligible due to his injury and the 65-game rule, Nikola Jokic remained in the pole position to earn a third MVP award. Luka Doncic and Shai-Gilgeous Alexander are also in the mix. But according to Charles Barkley, Jalen Brunson is the one he backs for the Michael Jordan trophy.\n\n\"What Brunson did this year for the Knicks was incredible, to get them to the second seed without Robinson being out for most of the year, without Randle [out] most of the year, OG [Anunoby] was out for a period of time,\" said Barkley.\n\nHe added that his and Magic Johnson's race in the 1990 NBA MVP race was close, but this year will be the closest one ever. With Jokic and SGA tied with a 57-25 record this season, it will indeed be a close one, just as Charles Barkley predicted.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sami_haider@totalprosports.com", "name": "Sami Haider", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_Sharpe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shannon Sharpe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Nash", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Nash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1762634241-scaled-e1715062356576.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

And while few were surprised, many were upset that Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander did not receive the honor.\n\nHall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal was among the first to express his displeasure with Gilgeous-Alexander missing out on the award, and many basketball fans on social media soon followed.\n\nBased on precedent, O'Neal and the fans on social media have a right to be displeased.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder to a 57-25 record and the West's No. 1 seed while averaging 30.1 points and turning in a franchise-record 51 games with 30-plus points. The 25-year-old is the first player since 1967 to average 30-plus points per game on the West's top seed and not win MVP, per StatMamba.\n\nWith Gilgeous-Alexander's case in mind, it's important to note that Jokic led Denver to an identical 57-25 record with impressive averages, eye-popping advanced stats and 25 triple-doubles during the 2023-24 season.\n\nAs each star put together a compelling case to win the award, here's how their numbers and MVP cases measure up.\n\nMORE: Complete list of winners for NBA's end-of-season awards\n\nBased on counting stats, Gilgeous-Alexander gets the edge in scoring and steals while Jokic averaged more rebounds and assists on slightly more efficient shooting splits.\n\nBoth players were largely available throughout the 2023-24 season, which shows their value to their respective teams.\n\nTo get more granular, Jokic has the edge on Gilgeous-Alexander in the advanced stats realm. Given how close many of the counting stats were, Jokic was able to create some separation with his advanced numbers.\n\nMORE: Where Nikola Jokic's three MVP awards rank on all-time list\n\nDenver went 2-1 without Jokic during the 2023-24 NBA season. The Nuggets were 55-24 with their MVP in the lineup.\n\nJokic was almost always available for his team during the regular season, missing just three of 82 games. He did not miss consecutive games.\n\nDenver's lone loss without Jokic came against the Thunder on Jan. 31. Behind 34 points from Gilgeous-Alexander, OKC earned a five-point home win over Denver.\n\nOklahoma City was 2-5 without Gilgeous-Alexander during the 2023-24 season. The Thunder were 55-20 when SGA was available.\n\nSix of Gilgeous-Alexander's seven absences came toward the end of the season as he battled a quad injury. He appeared in 70 of the team's first 71 games before sitting out six out of seven games between March 27 and April 7.\n\nOklahoma City's wins without Gilgeous-Alexander came at home against Phoenix and on the road against Charlotte.\n\nMORE: Why Shaq said SGA deserved 2024 NBA MVP over Nikola Jokic\n\nGilgeous-Alexander finished second to Jokic in 2024 NBA MVP award voting.\n\nJokic received 79 of 99 possible first-place votes while Gilgeous-Alexander received 15 first-place votes. Luka Doncic (four) and Giannis Antetokounmpo (one) were the only other players to receive first-place votes.\n\nHere is a look at how MVP voting shook out based on first-place votes:\n\nSecond-place votes are worth seven points, third-place votes are worth five points, fourth-place votes are worth three points and fifth-place votes are worth one point.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Alexander_Technique", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Alexander Technique", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-05/GettyImages-1753036435%20%281%29.jpg?itok=juVA4F9_", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-27", "dateEnd": "2024-04-07", "textStart": 2539, "textEnd": 2559}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-31", "textStart": 2114, "textEnd": 2121}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

With Jokic from Serbia, Gilgeous-Alexander from Canada and Doncic from Slovenia, it marked the third consecutive season that three players born outside the U.S. finished 1-2-3 in the MVP balloting.\n\nThis time, the foreign dominance atop the NBA was even more pronounced: Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is from Greece, was fourth -- so this became the first time in the award's 69-year history that international players went 1-2-3-4 in the voting. It also became the sixth consecutive year that an player born outside the U.S. won the award.\n\nJokic is now the ninth player to win the MVP award at least three times. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won it six times, Bill Russell and Michael Jordan each won five, Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won four, and Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are the other three-time winners.\n\nJokic's surprise rise to superstardom has been chronicled time and again over the years: He was the 41st overall pick in the 2014 draft, didn't even think he had a realistic chance at playing in the NBA when his career was beginning and now has a Hall of Fame resume at 29.\n\nThe other players with three MVP trophies in a four-year span are James, Johnson, Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Chamberlain and Russell. And Jokic becomes the fifth player to be first or second in the MVP voting in four consecutive years -- joining Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Russell and Tim Duncan.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander had perhaps the best feel-good story in the NBA this season, helping Oklahoma City to the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference by averaging 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds and 6.2 assists. The Thunder won 57 games, 17 more than they did last season and 33 more than they did two years ago, their rise coinciding with Gilgeous-Alexander's emergence as one of the game's elite players.\n\n\"There is not a night when I don't feel like we have the best player on the floor. ... There's no one I'd rather have on our team than him,\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault, the league's coach of the year this season, said last month.\n\nDoncic made a case for the MVP award by posting the first season in NBA history in which a player averaged 34 points, nine rebounds and nine assists per game. There had been 14 instances before this year in which a player averaged that many points and rebounds in a season -- of those, five had resulted in MVP wins, including last season when Philadelphia's Joel Embiid averaged 33 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nAnd this was the second time ever that a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists per game. The other was in 1972-73, when Kansas City's Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11 assists. He finished third in that season's MVP voting, just like Doncic did this season.", "source": {"uri": "chatnewstoday.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CHAT News Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

He averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and nine assists per game, compiling 25 triple-doubles and shooting 58.3% from the field. His true shooting percentage eclipsed 65% for the third consecutive season.\n\n\"I think he's stated his case pretty well,\" longtime teammate Jamal Murray said Wednesday before the award was announced amid an awkward backdrop: Denver trailing a playoff series 2-0. \"He does it every night. It's hard to do what he does and face the kind of pressure that he does each and every day. He does it in the smallest ways. He makes everybody around us better. He's a leader on the court and someone we expect greatness from every time he steps on the court. And he's delivered. ... He's been so consistent all his career, all his MVP runs. He's been so consistent. So I don't expect one or two bad games to sway that in any way.\"\n\nWhen Jokic was on the court this season, the Nuggets outscored their opponents by 11.8 points per 100 possessions. When he was off the court, they were outscored by 8.6 points per 100 possessions, amounting to a 20.4-point difference in net rating. Denver's 122.4 offensive rating with Jokic on the floor was more efficient than the best offensive team in the league, the Celtics (122.2). Denver's 104.1 offensive rating without Jokic was lower than the worst offensive team in the league, the Grizzlies (106.8).\n\nThe Nuggets finished in a tie for the best record in the Western Conference. Their 57-25 regular season tied a franchise wins record. Jokic is the team's only starter who has been named an All-Star in his career.\n\nHe averaged 101.3 touches per game, nearly 10 more than any other individual in the league, and 75.1 passes per game, 3.5 more than any other player. He led the NBA in most advanced metrics including player efficiency rating (31.0), win shares (17.0), win shares per 48 minutes (.299), offensive box plus/minus (9.0), defensive box plus/minus (4.2) and value over a replacement player (10.6).\n\n\"What I marvel at most importantly with Nikola the player is just the consistent greatness,\" Malone said during the last week of the regular season, when he predicted Jokic would win the MVP again. \"How he finds ways to, every single night, no matter who's available around him, to bring that level of excellence every night and basically put that team on his back.\"\n\nJokic's first two MVPs were bestowed before he had won a championship, or even reached the NBA Finals. Each was accompanied, therefore, by a fair degree of scrutiny. He didn't have the winning reputation to correspond with his individual accolades.\n\nThat's different this time. Jokic owns a Finals MVP trophy. A month before the startling round of applause he received in Washington, another unusual scene paralleled it, speaking volumes about the growth of Jokic's eminence outside Denver. It was Dec. 12 in Chicago, and for the second time in three weeks, Jokic had just been tossed from a game after arguing with referees.\n\nThis time, as he sauntered toward the locker room to serve his sentence, the crowd started booing. Not at Jokic. At the officials. Only one technical foul prompted the ejection. Disappointment and disgust permeated through United Center as Bulls fans watched the reason they'd purchased their tickets disappear for the night.", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType":

Oklahoma City guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (15 first-place votes, 640 points) was second, and Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic (4, 566) was third.\n\nJokic averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 9.0 assists in 79 games this season. He had 25 triple-doubles, second in the league behind Domantas Sabonis (26) of the Sacramento Kings.\n\n\"It's got to start with your teammates, you know,\" Jokic said on TNT. \"Without them, I cannot do nothing. Coaches, players, organizations, medical staff, strength coaches, development coaches. It's all one big circle, but I cannot be whatever I am without them.\"\n\nALSO READ: Rudy Gobert named 2024 NBA Defensive Player of the Year\n\nLast season, Jokic was the runner-up behind Joel Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers. Jokic won the award in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 seasons.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar holds the record of six MVP awards. Michael Jordan and Bill Russell won it five times, while Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James each won four.\n\nJokic is tied with Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and Moses Malone as three-time winners.\n\nThough Jokic won the award comfortably, he wasn't offended when it was suggested that Gilgeous-Alexander might have been a more worthy winner.\n\n\"There are a lot of players who deserve it,\" Jokic said. \"It's probably the details and the small things.\"\n\nJokic led the Nuggets to the NBA title last season and helped Denver compile a 57-25 record in the 2023-24 regular season.\n\nThe Nuggets beat the Los Angeles Lakers in five games in the Western Conference first round but now are facing a tough situation after losing the first two games against the Minnesota Timberwolves in the second round. The series now shifts to Minneapolis for the next two games.\n\n\"Tomorrow, we leave and go to Minnesota and try to get the series back to Denver,\" Jokic said.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo (one, 192) finished fourth in this season's balloting, and New York Knicks guard Jalen Brunson (142) was fifth.\n\nLatest on SportstarNBA: Nuggets star Nikola Jokic wins MVP for third

Not only that, but they lost both games at home and now face the daunting prospect of must win games on the road. But prior to Game 3 tipoff, the Nuggets received good news when it was announced that Nikola Jokic had won his third MVP Award. Video caught the moment when Jokic found out the news and it he celebrated the award in true Jokic fashion.\n\nJokic, who has famously endeared himself among NBA fans for not getting very hyped about much, reacted to the MVP news wit ha simple grin and a fist bump in the air while among family and team staff. His one word answer to the win: 'excited.'\n\nJokic won his first MVP award during the 2021-22 season. He followed that up with back to back wins during the 2022-23 season. Ever since the Nuggets were eliminated in the Western Conference Finals during the 2020 playoffs, Jokic has been on a tear.\n\nJokic finished with 79 first place votes for MVP. He was followed by Oklahoma City Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander who finished second and Dallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic who finished third. The top five was rounded out by Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokoumpo and New York Knicks star Jalen Brunson.\n\nNikola Jokic cementing himself as Nuggets GOAT\n\nThe Nuggets have had a few Hall of Fame caliber players suit up for the franchise such as David Thompson, Alex English, Carmelo Anthony, Dan Issel, Dikembe Mutombo and Fat Lever to name a few. But when it's all said and done, Nikola Jokic will go down as the greatest player to ever play for the Nuggets.\n\nThe main thing Jokic has going for him is that he is the only star that brought the Nuggets a championship. Prior to last season, the Nuggets had never even appeared in the NBA Finals. During the 2022-23 playoff run, Jokic averaged 30.0 points per game, 13.5 rebounds, 9.5 assists, 1.1 steals and 1.0 blocked shots with splits of 54.8 percent shooting from the field, a playoff career high 46.1 percent shooting from the three point line and 79.9 percent shooting from the free throw line.\n\nDuring the past couple of seasons, Jokic has also etched his name in the NBA history books by matching or surpassing a few records that were held by the late Wilt Chamberlain.\n\nAnd now, Jokic can truly prove his greatness if he is able to lead the Nuggets out of this 0-2 hole the currently find themselves in. During the 2024 playoffs so far, Jokic has been averaging 27.0 points per game, 15.0 rebounds, 9.4 assists and 1.3 steals with splits of 54.2 percent shooting from the field, 28.6 percent shooting from the three point line and a playoff career high 95.1 percent shooting from the free throw line.\n\nJokic has been named to six consecutive All-Star appearances now and that number will only continue to grow as he is in the prime of his career. Whenever he retires, he will be a first ballot Hall of Famer.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's six MVPs are the most ever. Bill Russell and Michael Jordan won five apiece and Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James four.\n\nJokic joins Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson as three-time winners after earning 79 first-placed votes compared to 15 for Gilgeous-Alexander and four for Doncic.\n\nBehind Jokic, the 57-25 Nuggets matched the franchise high for victories in a season -- although they were tied for best record in the West with Oklahoma City and ended up with the second seed.\n\nWhether Jokic will be able to combine an MVP award and the title this season remains to be seen.\n\nThe Nuggets dropped the first two games of their Western Conference semi-final series to the Minnesota Timberwolves and face the tough task of trying to claw back on the Timberwolves' home court starting on Friday.\n\nJokic's victory marks the sixth straight season that the MVP award has gone to a player born outside the United States.

Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo was second in points and sixth in rebounds per game, and Sacramento's Domantas Sabonis led the league in rebounds per game while ranking sixth in assists per contest.\n\nThere's a reasonable chance that Victor Wembanyama -- the No. 1 pick in last year's draft by San Antonio, along with the rookie of the year winner and runner-up to Minnesota's Rudy Gobert for defensive player of the year this season -- wins the MVP award one day.\n\nBut Nikola Jokic's win this year extended an unusual streak.\n\nFor the 11th straight year, the MVP award was claimed by someone who wasn't a No. 1 overall draft pick. That's the longest such run in NBA history; the last No. 1 to win was LeBron James, then of Miami, in 2013.\n\nNikola Jokic is the fifth player in NBA history to finish first or second in the MVP balloting in at least four consecutive seasons. He won the award in 2021, 2022 and this year, and was second to Philadelphia's Joel Embiid in 2023.\n\nBoston Celtics greats Bill Russell and Larry Bird each were first or second in the balloting in six consecutive seasons. Russell won in 1958, 1961, 1962 and 1963, while finishing second in 1959 and 1960; Bird was second in 1981, 1982 and 1983 before winning in 1984, 1985 and 1986.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar (1971-74) and Tim Duncan (2001-04) are the other players with four straight top-two finishes.\n\nDallas' Luka Doncic averaged 33.9 points, 9.2 rebounds and 9.8 assists per game this season. There had never been a season in NBA history in which someone finished with all those averages.\n\nAnd he still didn't win MVP.\n\nThere were 14 previous instances of someone averaging at least 33 points and nine rebounds; those stats were enough to MVP five times (Joel Embiid in 2023, Bob McAdoo in 1975, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1972, Wilt Chamberlain in 1960 and 1966).\n\nOf course, it should be noted that Chamberlain had some years when he was even more dominant and didn't win MVP -- including five consecutive seasons in which he averaged at least 34 points and 22 rebounds but didn't get the trophy in any of them. Elgin Baylor averaged at least 34 points and 14 rebounds in three seasons when he wasn't MVP, and Rick Barry had a 35.6-point, 9.2-rebound year that didn't get him the award, either.\n\nBefore Doncic this year, there was just one season in which a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists. That was 1972-73 when Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11.4 assists for Kansas City. He was third in the MVP voting that season.\n\nNikola Jokic's win means a player who is listed at 6-foot-10 or taller -- Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2019 and 2020, Jokic in 2021, 2022 and now 2024, and Joel Embiid in 2023 -- has won the MVP award in six consecutive seasons.\n\nThat's a first for the NBA. But that doesn't mean this is the first dominant stretch for big men. Far from it.\n\nThere was a 16-year stretch from 1964-65 through 1979-80 when players generally considered to be centers or at least power forwards won the award each year. Not all were at least 6-10, but all were considered big men.\n\nThe last guard to win the MVP award was James Harden, then of Houston, in 2018.\n\nMilwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo got one first-place vote. It mattered.\n\nAntetokounmpo has now gotten at least one first-place MVP vote in six consecutive seasons, extending the longest such streak in the league.\n\nIt's the longest first-place-vote streak since LeBron James got a first-place vote in eight consecutive years from 2008 through 2015. That run ended when Golden State's Stephen Curry became the first -- and still only -- unanimous MVP in 2016.\n\nDenver's Nikola Jokic has gotten a first-place vote in each of the last four years. Philadelphia's Joel Embiid had first-place votes in each of the previous three seasons but was ineligible for consideration this year because of the league's new rule mandating that players must appear in a certain number of games before getting onto the ballot.\n\nLeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers didn't get a vote in the MVP balloting this season. It's only the second time in his 21-year career that has happened; the other was last season, ending an unprecedented 19-year streak of getting at least one vote. (The panel of reporters and broadcasters who vote on awards rank their top five MVP choices on their ballots.)\n\nHe is the only player in NBA history to appear in the MVP results in 19 different seasons. When the All-NBA team is revealed later this month, James could make a 20th appearance, which would extend his record.\n\nNo other player has more than 15 All-NBA nods.\n\nHere's a wrapup of all the NBA awards that have been announced to this point:\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Moses Malone, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, and LeBron James are the eight players to receive the award three or more times. Jokic becomes the ninth player to do so.\n\nJokic finished the 2023-24 regular season with 79 games played, a career high in total minutes, and mostly replicated his per game averages of the last four years that made him so valuable in the first place. He produced 26.4 points, 12.0 rebounds, 9.0 assists, and 1.4 steals per game, very much in line with what many expect of him. While Jokic has never led in any one category, it's his versatility to impact all categories that makes him so unique, On the season, Jokic ranked fifth in the entire NBA in total points scored, third in total rebounds, second in total assists, and eighth in total steals.\n\nVia Denver Nuggets PR:\n\nJoki\u0107 registered 25 triple-doubles, one shy of the NBA lead and 68 double-doubles, the most double-doubles in a season in franchise history. He now has had 20+ triple-doubles in consecutive seasons, becoming one of four players in NBA history (Robertson, Westbrook, Chamberlain) to record 20+ triple-doubles in multiple seasons. Joki\u0107 finished with a career-high 708 assists, passing Wilt Chamberlain for the most by a center in a single season in NBA history and moved him into second place all-time for most assists by a center. It also marks his fifth straight season with 550+ assists, tying Fat Lever for most such seasons in franchise history.\n\nThe Nuggets as a whole won 57 games, tying a franchise record. They ultimately finished as the second seed in the Western Conference, though they flirted with first place for much of the year as well. Somehow, there are no other Nuggets in consideration for other awards with no other All-Stars, All-Defensive Players, or any other national recognitions for the rest of the team. And yet, the Nuggets still found a way to dominate for most of the year. That's because they have Jokic, who has operated and handled as much responsibility as any one player should have to carry for a long time.\n\nThis season doesn't seem like it's going to go Denver's way, but that shouldn't take away from the season Jokic had. It's funny, the three times over the last four years that Jokic has won the award appear to be heading toward disappointment. The one year that Jokic probably should have won, the Nuggets won a championship.\n\nIt's an unfortunate quirk, but that appears to be Jokic and Denver's lot in life.\n\nPerhaps this moment can serve as a catalyst to turn around Denver's playoff series against the Minnesota Timberwolves where they currently trail 2-0. But even if it doesn't, it's important to appreciate these moments along the way. These opportunities are fleeting, and they deserve to be cherished. Jokic will only ever be in the prime of his career once, and it's important to value that as much as the Nuggets - the organization and the fans - possibly can.", "source": {"uri": "milehighsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mile High Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_blackburn@milehighsports.com", "name": "Ryan Blackburn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilt_Chamberlain", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wilt Chamberlain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moses Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_NBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inside the NBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magic Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_Lever", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fat Lever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Awards", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://milehighsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/USATSI_17763082-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Prior to that, he covered the Nets, Knicks and the NBA for nearly a decade. He joined ESPNNewYork.com after working at the New York Daily News for almost 12 years and is a graduate of Michigan State University.\n\nFollow him on Twitter \" Ohm's chat archive \"\n\nDenver Nuggets superstar Nikola Jokic continued to add to his legacy as one of the best NBA players ever Wednesday by winning his third Most Valuable Player trophy.\n\nJokic is the first center in six decades to win MVP three times in four seasons; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did it from 1973-74 to 1976-77.\n\n\"It's hard to differentiate greatness from greatness from greatness,\" Denver head coach Michael Malone said in early April of how Jokic has gotten better from previous MVP seasons. \"And then that's what he's been over multiple years now. I know the last six years now, we've had by far the best record in the Western Conference and only second of the NBA behind, I think Milwaukee in that time.\"\n\nIn his ninth season, Jokic played 79 games, his most since playing 80 games during the 2018-19 season. He joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to finish top-five in total points (fifth), rebounds (third) and assists (second) in multiple seasons, according to research by ESPN Stats & Information. Elgin Baylor is the only other player to do so once.\n\nJokic is also the second player to record 2,000 points, 900 rebounds and 600 assists in a season, joining Oscar Robertson.\n\nJokic averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists -- all top 10 in each statistical category. He had 25 triple-doubles, second only to Sacramento's Domantas Sabonis (26), while averaging 58.3% shooting from the field and 35.9% from behind the arc.\n\nPowered by Jokic, Denver finished the season fifth in offensive efficiency, eighth in defensive efficiency, and fourth in net rating. The Nuggets were one of four teams to rank top-10 in all three, along with the Celtics, Knicks and Thunder.\n\nWhile Denver boasted the best starting five in the league, Jokic's value was undeniable to Denver. The Nuggets posted a plus-11.8 net efficiency when Jokic was on the court but a minus-8.6 when he was off. Jokic led the NBA with a plus-682 plus-minus. The Nuggets were minus-251 with their franchise player off the court.\n\nOf course, the humble Jokic often says he doesn't care about individual honors as much as he covets the championship. Jokic is trying to lead the Nuggets to a repeat as world champs.\n\nShould he do so, the Nuggets big man will have put together a four-year run that only four other all-time greats have ever done. LeBron James, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Bill Russell are the only players to win three regular-season MVPs and two titles in a four-year span.\n\n\"Nikola has matured, his ability to continue to make everyone around him better,\" Malone said. \"And when you win a championship, and we're going to run it back, but in place of Bruce [Brown] and Jeff [Green], we're going to try to put young players in and the fact that we have a better record than we did last year.\n\n\"And we've had Jamal Murray miss [23] games. It speaks to Nikola understanding it's still my responsibility as a great player to help [the younger role players] as well as all the other guys to understand what their roles are, how to play on both ends of the floor, and most importantly, make those guys better.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

His comments to Jokic may frustrate Nuggets fans, but at least he did not try to avoid the subject after his previous comments.\n\n\"I felt Shai deserved it,\" Shaq said after the initial announcement. \"I've been number two a lot, and I played my a** off number two so the fact that he has to start all over next year and try to win it again... I know this is going to be hurtful for him, hopefully he uses this to motivate him and win a championship.\n\n\"But I thought, and again no disrespect to the Joker (Nikola Jokic), best big man in the league by far... I thought Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was going to win it by far. But congratulations to the Joker, I'm happy for him.\"\n\nNikola Jokic wins his third MVP\n\nShaq may not have thought Jokic should have won, but there is no question that the Nuggets star enjoyed a tremendous campaign. He was initially selected as a finalist alongside Gilgeous-Alexander and Dallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic. Gilgeous-Alexander ultimately finished second in voting while Luka ended up in the third position.\n\nJokic, 29, already has three MVP awards now for his career. He is unquestionably on a Hall of Fame path.\n\nIn 2023-24, Jokic recorded 26.4 points per game on 58.3 percent field goal and 35.9 percent three-point shooting. He also recorded 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists per outing.\n\nThe Nuggets technically finished as the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference behind the Thunder. Denver and Oklahoma City finished the regular season with the exact same record, however. The Thunder earned the No. 1 seed because of a tiebreaker.\n\nRegardless, Jokic led the Nuggets to another stellar all-around campaign. Denver has developed a winning team that often produces impressive results. Jokic's teammates perform at a higher level when he is on the floor. He is a big man who is more than capable of getting everyone involved.\n\nIn all reality, each of the finalists had strong cases to win the award. Gilgeous-Alexander and Doncic both performed at elite levels throughout the 2023-24 campaign. It would not have been surprising to see either star end up winning the award.\n\nThe voters clearly felt that Nikola Jokic was deserving of winning the NBA MVP for the third time, however.\n\nDo you think Jokic was the MVP, or should Gilgeous-Alexander or Doncic have won the award?", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joey_mistretta@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Joey Mistretta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_NBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inside the NBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Alexander_Technique", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Alexander Technique", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Awards", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Nikola-Jokic-hit-with-brutally-honest-Shaquill-ONeal-take-over-MVP-win.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo was second in points and sixth in rebounds per game, and Sacramento's Domantas Sabonis led the league in rebounds per game while ranking sixth in assists per contest.\n\nBut Nikola Jokic's win this year extended an unusual streak.\n\nFor the 11th straight year, the MVP award was claimed by someone who wasn't a No. 1 overall draft pick. That's the longest such run in NBA history; the last No. 1 to win was LeBron James, then of Miami, in 2013.\n\nFINISHING TOP 2\n\nNikola Jokic is the fifth player in NBA history to finish first or second in the MVP balloting in at least four consecutive seasons. He won the award in 2021, 2022 and this year, and was second to Philadelphia's Joel Embiid in 2023.\n\nBoston Celtics greats Bill Russell and Larry Bird each were first or second in the balloting in six consecutive seasons. Russell won in 1958, 1961, 1962 and 1963, while finishing second in 1959 and 1960; Bird was second in 1981, 1982 and 1983 before winning in 1984, 1985 and 1986.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar (1971-74) and Tim Duncan (2001-04) are the other players with four straight top-two finishes.\n\n33, 9 AND 9 NOT ENOUGH\n\nDallas' Luka Doncic averaged 33.9 points, 9.2 rebounds and 9.8 assists per game this season. There had never been a season in NBA history in which someone finished with all those averages.\n\nAnd he still didn't win MVP.\n\nThere were 14 previous instances of someone averaging at least 33 points and nine rebounds; those stats were enough to MVP five times (Joel Embiid in 2023, Bob McAdoo in 1975, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1972, Wilt Chamberlain in 1960 and 1966).\n\nOf course, it should be noted that Chamberlain had some years when he was even more dominant and didn't win MVP -- including five consecutive seasons in which he averaged at least 34 points and 22 rebounds but didn't get the trophy in any of them. Elgin Baylor averaged at least 34 points and 14 rebounds in three seasons when he wasn't MVP, and Rick Barry had a 35.6-point, 9.2-rebound year that didn't get him the award, either.\n\nBefore Doncic this year, there was just one season in which a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists. That was 1972-73 when Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11.4 assists for Kansas City. He was third in the MVP voting that season.\n\nREACHING HEIGHTS\n\nNikola Jokic's win means a player who is listed at 6-foot-10 or taller -- Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2019 and 2020, Jokic in 2021, 2022 and now 2024, and Joel Embiid in 2023 -- has won the MVP award in six consecutive seasons.\n\nThat's a first for the NBA. But that doesn't mean this is the first dominant stretch for big men. Far from it.\n\nThere was a 16-year stretch from 1964-65 through 1979-80 when players generally considered to be centers or at least power forwards won the award each year. Not all were at least 6-10, but all were considered big men.\n\nThe last guard to win the MVP award was James Harden, then of Houston, in 2018.\n\nGIANNIS' STREAK\n\nMilwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo got one first-place vote. It mattered.\n\nAntetokounmpo has now gotten at least one first-place MVP vote in six consecutive seasons, extending the longest such streak in the league.\n\nIt's the longest first-place-vote streak since LeBron James got a first-place vote in eight consecutive years from 2008 through 2015. That run ended when Golden State's Stephen Curry became the first -- and still only -- unanimous MVP in 2016.\n\nDenver's Nikola Jokic has gotten a first-place vote in each of the last four years. Philadelphia's Joel Embiid had first-place votes in each of the previous three seasons but was ineligible for consideration this year because of the league's new rule mandating that players must appear in a certain number of games before getting onto the ballot.NO LeBRON\n\nLeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers didn't get a vote in the MVP balloting this season. It's only the second time in his 21-year career that has happened; the other was last season, ending an unprecedented 19-year streak of getting at least one vote. (The panel of reporters and broadcasters who vote on awards rank their top five MVP choices on their ballots.)\n\nHe is the only player in NBA history to appear in the MVP results in 19 different seasons. When the All-NBA team is revealed later this month, James could make a 20th appearance, which would extend his record.\n\nHere's a wrapup of all the NBA awards that have been announced to this

That's the longest such run in NBA history; the last No. 1 to win was LeBron James, then of Miami, in 2013.\n\nFINISHING TOP 2\n\nNikola Jokic is the fifth player in NBA history to finish first or second in the MVP balloting in at least four consecutive seasons. He won the award in 2021, 2022 and this year, and was second to Philadelphia's Joel Embiid in 2023.\n\nBoston Celtics greats Bill Russell and Larry Bird each were first or second in the balloting in six consecutive seasons. Russell won in 1958, 1961, 1962 and 1963, while finishing second in 1959 and 1960; Bird was second in 1981, 1982 and 1983 before winning in 1984, 1985 and 1986.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar (1971-74) and Tim Duncan (2001-04) are the other players with four straight top-two finishes.\n\n33, 9 AND 9 NOT ENOUGH\n\nDallas' Luka Doncic averaged 33.9 points, 9.2 rebounds and 9.8 assists per game this season. There had never been a season in NBA history in which someone finished with all those averages.\n\nAnd he still didn't win MVP.\n\nThere were 14 previous instances of someone averaging at least 33 points and nine rebounds; those stats were enough to MVP five times (Joel Embiid in 2023, Bob McAdoo in 1975, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1972, Wilt Chamberlain in 1960 and 1966).\n\nOf course, it should be noted that Chamberlain had some years when he was even more dominant and didn't win MVP -- including five consecutive seasons in which he averaged at least 34 points and 22 rebounds but didn't get the trophy in any of them. Elgin Baylor averaged at least 34 points and 14 rebounds in three seasons when he wasn't MVP, and Rick Barry had a 35.6-point, 9.2-rebound year that didn't get him the award, either.\n\nBefore Doncic this year, there was just one season in which a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists. That was 1972-73 when Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11.4 assists for Kansas City. He was third in the MVP voting that season.\n\nREACHING HEIGHTS\n\nNikola Jokic's win means a player who is listed at 6-foot-10 or taller -- Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2019 and 2020, Jokic in 2021, 2022 and now 2024, and Joel Embiid in 2023 -- has won the MVP award in six consecutive seasons.\n\nThat's a first for the NBA. But that doesn't mean this is the first dominant stretch for big men. Far from it.\n\nThere was a 16-year stretch from 1964-65 through 1979-80 when players generally considered to be centers or at least power forwards won the award each year. Not all were at least 6-10, but all were considered big men.\n\nThe last guard to win the MVP award was James Harden, then of Houston, in 2018.\n\nGIANNIS' STREAK\n\nMilwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo got one first-place vote. It mattered.\n\nAntetokounmpo has now gotten at least one first-place MVP vote in six consecutive seasons, extending the longest such streak in the league.\n\nIt's the longest first-place-vote streak since LeBron James got a first-place vote in eight consecutive years from 2008 through 2015. That run ended when Golden State's Stephen Curry became the first -- and still only -- unanimous MVP in 2016.\n\nDenver's Nikola Jokic has gotten a first-place vote in each of the last four years. Philadelphia's Joel Embiid had first-place votes in each of the previous three seasons but was ineligible for consideration this year because of the league's new rule mandating that players must appear in a certain number of games before getting onto the ballot.\n\nNO LeBRON\n\nLeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers didn't get a vote in the MVP balloting this season. It's only the second time in his 21-year career that has happened; the other was last season, ending an unprecedented 19-year streak of getting at least one vote. (The panel of reporters and broadcasters who vote on awards rank their top five MVP choices on their ballots.)\n\nHe is the only player in NBA history to appear in the MVP results in 19 different seasons. When the All-NBA team is revealed later this month, James could make a 20th appearance, which would extend his record.\n\nNo other player has more than 15 All-NBA nods.\n\nALL THE AWARDS\n\nHere's a wrapup of all the NBA awards that have been announced to this point:\n\n-- Most Valuable Player, Nikola Jokic, Denver.\n\n-- Most Improved Player, Tyrese Maxey, Philadelphia.\n\n-- Rookie of the Year, Victor Wembanyama, San Antonio.\n\n-- Defensive Player of the Year, Rudy Gobert, Minnesota.\n\n-- Sixth Man of the Year, Naz Reid, Minnesota.\n\n-- Clutch Player of the Year, Stephen Curry, Golden State.\n\n-- Coach of the Year, Mark Daigneault, Oklahoma City.\n\n-- Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year, Mike Conley, Minnesota.\n\n-- Executive of the Year, Brad Stevens, Boston.\n\nAP NBA:

While this was a closely-contested race, this seems to make up for Jokic losing to Joel Embiid last season and instantly winning the title.\n\nIt's become increasingly rare to see players win both the regular season MVP and an NBA title in the same season. The last player to achieve this feat was Stephen Curry in 2015 after his first MVP win culminated with his first NBA title win. Since then, we have seen two reigning MVPs knocked out in the first round (including Jokic) while only one of them even made the Finals (Curry in 2016).\n\nJokic won two MVPs and won a title after losing the chance to win three MVPs in a row. Giannis Antetokounmpo followed the same trajectory before Jokic, winning the 2019 and 2020 MVPs before winning the title in 2021 when he lost the MVP to Jokic.\n\nThe Nuggets Title Hopes Are Looking Weak\n\nThe Denver Nuggets have to overcome an extremely difficult road to defend their NBA Championship. They're currently down 0-2 to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the second round, losing two home games to open the series. Out of the 22 instances of a home team falling to a 0-2 deficit in a series, only four times has a comeback been successful.\n\nThe last time we saw a successful 0-2 comeback after losing two home games was in 2021 when the Clippers beat the Mavericks in the first round. The Mavericks were massive underdogs who had shocked the world by jumping out to a 2-0 lead before Kawhi Leonard had the greatest series of his career to will the Clippers into making a comeback.\n\nThe Timberwolves are a far more complete team than that Mavericks roster, so trusting them to convert a 2-0 lead into a series win is easier. But the Nuggets do have the consensus best player in the world over the last couple of seasons in Nikola Jokic.\n\nJokic has never beaten a 50+ win team in a playoff series, so coming back from down 0-2 as the home team would be a fantastic way to cross that achievement of his list as well. If the Nuggets can turn this around against the Wolves, most people would continue holding them as title favorites even with the dominance of the OKC Thunder and Boston Celtics in the Playoffs.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ishaan_bhattacharya@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Ishaan Bhattacharya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://fadeawayworld.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzAzNjM0OTk5MjIzNDcy/usatsi_23116135.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.615686274509804, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

With Jokic in the middle of his prime, the Serbian center reflected on how much longer he'll continue competing at the highest level and what would take for him to consider retiring.\n\n\"I'm not going to take a spot from some young guy or put the franchise down. As long as I can play at the highest level and help the team win, I think that's gonna be my, I'm going to play until then.\"\n\nJokic averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 9.0 assists this season, his 10th year in the NBA. He's 29 years old, so he could play for another decade if he wanted to, similar to LeBron James. However, it doesn't look like Jokic is motivated to play at the highest level once his skills wane with age.\n\nHe's such a fundamental big that Jokic could extend his career like LeBron. His playmaking talent will make him an asset until he retires and it's not like Jokic's game will be adversely affected as his athletic tools start to disappear with age. He has a soft touch that will stay with him and his basketball IQ is far too incredible for him to not be effective as he goes through his 30s.\n\nVoter fatigue alone will ensure Jokic doesn't climb to the level of Jordan or Kareem. We've seen players affected by the same. But can Jokic unquestionably prove he deserves another MVP next season? We don't anticipate a drop-off in Jokic's production, especially if the Nuggets maintain their core regardless of what happens in the 2024 Playoffs.\n\nNBA voters will likely start looking at the next generation of MVP candidates. Jokic's win means that the last six MVP awards have been shared by just three players, including Jokic, Joel Embiid, and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Many wanted to see Luka Doncic or Shai Gilgeous-Alexander win the award, but the two finalists were not as favored as Jokic.\n\nWith the two finalists from this year hoping to win their first award and other young stars like Anthony Edwards, Jayson Tatum, and Victor Wembanyama in search of the same, it seems Jokic's win this year could usher in a new era from next season onward.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ishaan_bhattacharya@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Ishaan Bhattacharya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wembanyama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victor Wembanyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Awards", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://fadeawayworld.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzAyNTUxMDU2ODUyMTQ0/usatsi_23148368.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

That's the longest such run in NBA history; the last No. 1 to win was LeBron James, then of Miami, in 2013.\n\nFINISHING TOP 2\n\nNikola Jokic is the fifth player in NBA history to finish first or second in the MVP balloting in at least four consecutive seasons. He won the award in 2021, 2022 and this year, and was second to Philadelphia's Joel Embiid in 2023.\n\nBoston Celtics greats Bill Russell and Larry Bird each were first or second in the balloting in six consecutive seasons. Russell won in 1958, 1961, 1962 and 1963, while finishing second in 1959 and 1960; Bird was second in 1981, 1982 and 1983 before winning in 1984, 1985 and 1986.\n\nDallas' Luka Doncic averaged 33.9 points, 9.2 rebounds and 9.8 assists per game this season. There had never been a season in NBA history in which someone finished with all those averages.\n\nAnd he still didn't win MVP.\n\nThere were 14 previous instances of someone averaging at least 33 points and nine rebounds; those stats were enough to MVP five times (Joel Embiid in 2023, Bob McAdoo in 1975, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1972, Wilt Chamberlain in 1960 and 1966).\n\nOf course, it should be noted that Chamberlain had some years when he was even more dominant and didn't win MVP -- including five consecutive seasons in which he averaged at least 34 points and 22 rebounds but didn't get the trophy in any of them. Elgin Baylor averaged at least 34 points and 14 rebounds in three seasons when he wasn't MVP, and Rick Barry had a 35.6-point, 9.2-rebound year that didn't get him the award, either.\n\nBefore Doncic this year, there was just one season in which a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists. That was 1972-73 when Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11.4 assists for Kansas City. He was third in the MVP voting that season.\n\nREACHING HEIGHTS\n\nNikola Jokic's win means a player who is listed at 6-foot-10 or taller -- Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2019 and 2020, Jokic in 2021, 2022 and now 2024, and Joel Embiid in 2023 -- has won the MVP award in six consecutive seasons.\n\nThat's a first for the NBA. But that doesn't mean this is the first dominant stretch for big men. Far from it.\n\nThere was a 16-year stretch from 1964-65 through 1979-80 when players generally considered to be centers or at least power forwards won the award each year. Not all were at least 6-10, but all were considered big men.\n\nMilwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo got one first-place vote. It mattered.\n\nAntetokounmpo has now gotten at least one first-place MVP vote in six consecutive seasons, extending the longest such streak in the league.\n\nIt's the longest first-place-vote streak since LeBron James got a first-place vote in eight consecutive years from 2008 through 2015. That run ended when Golden State's Stephen Curry became the first -- and still only -- unanimous MVP in 2016.\n\nDenver's Nikola Jokic has gotten a first-place vote in each of the last four years. Philadelphia's Joel Embiid had first-place votes in each of the previous three seasons but was ineligible for consideration this year because of the league's new rule mandating that players must appear in a certain number of games before getting onto the ballot.\n\nNO LeBRON\n\nLeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers didn't get a vote in the MVP balloting this season. It's only the second time in his 21-year career that has happened; the other was last season, ending an unprecedented 19-year streak of getting at least one vote. (The panel of reporters and broadcasters who vote on awards rank their top five MVP choices on their ballots.)\n\nHe is the only player in NBA history to appear in the MVP results in 19 different seasons. When the All-NBA team is revealed later this month, James could make a 20th appearance, which would extend his record.\n\nHere's a wrapup of all the NBA awards that have been announced to this

The votes were cast shortly after the regular season and there was no debate who deserved the honor.\n\nFrom start to finish, there was nobody better. Both on a per-minute and cumulative basis. Beyond just the raw counting stats, which we'll get into, Jokic was once again the NBA's leader in Win Shares, Box Plus-Minus (BPM), and virtually every advanced statistic - on top of missing only three games.\n\nHe played more minutes this season (2,737) than any other year of his career. Between the availability and night-to-night consistency, there isn't a better floor-raiser in the league.\n\nThis particular award elevates him to another tier, especially when discussing his legendary status.\n\nJokic is now the ninth player in NBA history to win at least three MVPs in their career. He joins Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Russell, Michael Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, LeBron James, Moses Malone, Larry Bird, and Magic Johnson on the list of 3-time MVP winners.\n\nHaving just turned 29 years old, Jokic is on pace with the basketball icons that came before him. He's the same age Jordan was during the 1992 season, when MJ captured his third MVP trophy and was trying to lead Chicago to back-to-back championships:\n\nWith Denver (mostly) having its core solidified long-term and their front office believing in continuity, Jokic will have plenty of opportunities to compete for more MVPs.\n\nAnd even if the Nuggets fall short during this run, they are still a force to be reckoned with in the West for years to come -- with Jokic and his leadership being the root cause.\n\nThis MVP, coming a year after one of the most dominant playoff runs the game has ever seen, cements Jokic a top 18-20 player of all time. He was likely already there for some, but it's now ironclad.\n\nIt won't be long before he's approaching the likes of Kevin Durant and Hakeem Olajuwon on the historical pyramid.\n\nOnly in his ninth season, Jokic has built a resume that only a short list of players can touch. Plus, with his playstyle not being tied to extreme athleticism, there's plenty reason to believe he can perform at this level for the next six to eight years. Barring injuries -- and he's been one of the most available and durable players in the league -- Jokic could have a career that resembles Tim Duncan's by the time it's over.\n\nDigging into his 2024 season and why he was ultimately the pick, he just didn't have many weaknesses. There weren't many holes to poke in his case. After all, his co-star Jamal Murray missed over a month of action and Jokic still pushed the Nuggets to 57 wins, which was four more than last year and on par with the No. 1 seed.\n\nBu the crazy part is, Jokic didn't have as stellar of a season as he did a year ago, when he probably should've won his third straight MVP in hindsight.\n\nStill, he averaged 28.4 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 9.6 assists on a per-75 possession scale. Those are just preposterous numbers for a center and that's before you get into his off-the-chart efficiency.\n\nJokic shot 70.2% at the rim, an absurd 61.7% in the floater range, 44% on mid-range jumpers, and 37.7% on above-the-break threes.\n\nFor context on how lethal his floater touch is: Among all players to attempt at least 300 shots from that tricky in-between range, Kawhi Leonard was second at 56.5% -- Jokic was far more efficient and took 218 more shots.\n\nJalen Brunson, who might be the master of the floater among guards, took roughly the same number of shots (524) from that distance. But he finished at a 51.7% clip ... nearly 10 percentage points below Jokic.\n\nThere hasn't been a seven-footer throughout history with a better scoring touch.\n\nJokic also posted the lowest turnover rate of his career (12.9%), more than four percentage points better than last season. He threw 708 assists to just 143 bad-pass turnovers, which almost seems like a Chris Paul or Steve Nash ratio. But that's the beauty of being a point center -- one with an exquisite eye for detail and a basketball IQ that's unparalleled in today's game.\n\nThe NBA has its own version of Will Hunting. That's precisely what Jokic is. He's an expert problem-solver that always finds a way offensively, and he combines that with an unselfish approach that teammates constantly rave about.\n\nBetween his scoring and passing, he created 50.5 points per 36 minutes of action. That's while serving as the number one playmaking hub in the league and averaging north of 74.9 passes per game, the most in the league and far more than any point guard.\n\nNobody was more valuable to his team in the regular season in terms of the on-court impact. With Jokic on the floor, Denver outscored teams by 11.8 points per 100 possessions. That included a 122.4 offensive rating and 110.6 defensive rating during his minutes. For context, the league's best offensive team this year was at 122.2 points per 100 and the best defensive team held teams to 108.4 points per 100. So, the Nuggets were on the verge of No. 1 overall performance -- on both ends -- when he played.\n\nConversely, Denver's efficiency fell off a cliff when Jokic had to rest. Their 104.1 offensive rating with him on the bench would've ranked dead last in the NBA this season (Memphis was 30th at 106.8), along with their 53.5% true shooting percentage.\n\nThe Nuggets had a -8.6 net rating in the 1,200 minutes Jokic sat. It wasn't quite as harmful as last season (-10.4), but that's still paints the picture of how reliant they are on his halfcourt brilliance. Generating quality looks becomes a chore when he's not out there dictating the flow, screening for his teammates, and delivering on-target passes.\n\nThere will be voices that try to downplay the significance of Jokic's three MVP awards. Frankly, there are critics who believe he doesn't belong in that illustrious group of three-time winners, with their primary talking point being his lone championship and Finals appearance.\n\nIt can't be forgotten, though: The MVP is a regular season honor. And until someone clearly outshines him from October to April and lifts their team to a substantially better record, Jokic will keep adding to the trophy case.\n\nThis year's winner was a no-brainer, as it was the previous two times.\n\nOptimistically, Jokic is only halfway through his career. Regardless of what happens in this playoff run, he's holding the title of 'best player alive' and that shouldn't change.\n\nFor him to already be inching his way closer to the NBA's pantheon of legends, Jokic is on a rapid trajectory. We should appreciate what we're seeing in real time. Because this pace isn't normal.\n\nThen again, nothing about Jokic's abilities or greatness feels normal when you watch him. And that's what makes him special.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107",

O'Neal picked an odd time to address his feeling about this year's winner, Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic.\n\nO'Neal told Jokic he felt Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander should have won the honor. It occurred when O'Neal was interviewing Jokic Wednesday during the TNT broadcast, creating awkward moment.\n\n\"Joker, as the president of the 'Big Man Alliance' ... you know I love you, the best player in the league,\" O'Neal told Jokic. \"I want to congratulate you, but I want you to hear it from me first. I thought that SGA [Gilgeous-Alexander] should have been the MVP. That's no disrespect to you, but congratulations.\"\n\nJokic is the ninth player in league history to win at least three MVPs, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan, Bill Russell, LeBron James, Wilt Chamberlain, Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson.\n\nJokic finished with a 926 points, including 79 first-place votes. Gilgeous-Alexander had 640 points and 15 first-place votes. Many felt he was the most deserving of the three finalists (Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic was the other).\n\nGilgeous-Alexander led an epic turnaround this season, leading the Thunder to the playoffs as the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference. He averaged 30.1 points, 6.2 assists and 5.5 rebounds. Despite the on-air slight from O'Neal, Jokic handled it well.\n\n\"Thank you, Shaq,\" Jokic said. \"We don't judge people here, that's fine -- that's your opinion. I'm joking.\"\n\nShandel Richardson is the publisher of Back In The Day NBA.

Jayson Tatum", "body": "The NBA's Conference Semifinals have just begun but some oddsmakers are already looking ahead to who has the highest NBA Finals MVP Odds. Of course, for any of these players to even get a chance to win the award, they'll need to lead their respective teams past the semis, the Conference Finals and then win the title.\n\nThese odds might have come a little too early but one of the joys of sports is predicting how things are going to go. Here are the players who have the highest NBA Finals MVP Odds as per Bovada.\n\nTop 10 NBA players who are leading the NBA Finals MVP Odds\n\n#10 Kyrie Irving (+5500)\n\nMaybe he's the Robin to Luka's Batman, maybe it's the other way around. Regardless of how you look at it, Kyrie Irving's contributions will be key if the Dallas Mavericks hope to win a chip.\n\nIrving has been there before. He knows what it takes to win a title and he's after that second ring. For them to get there, he'll need to get over the inconsistency that has plagued him this postseason. If he can do that, the Mavs could become favorites to win the title and Irving will climb higher in the NBA Finals MVP Odds.\n\nDerrick White was arguably the best player for the Boston Celtics against the Miami Heat in their opening-round series and is perhaps the team's biggest X-factor.\n\nHe can go underappreciated by some because he does not put up the same kind of highlights or have similar numbers as Tatum or Brown but he's a vital cog to the Celtics machine. Should they get out of the East, White could very well be in the top five of NBA Finals MVP Odds.\n\nKAT's appearance in the top ten of the NBA Finals MVP Odds is perhaps the most surprising. He does not stand out in any statistical categories and he does not possess the same kind of star factor as the other players on this list.\n\nBut make no mistake, the Wolves are where they are right now because of what he does, especially on offense. His floor spacing has opened up the floor for Anthony Edwards to get looks from anywhere and he has allowed Gobert to focus all his attention on defense.\n\nNikola Jokic is the single most skilled player in the NBA right now. What he lacks in athleticism and explosiveness, he makes up for with elite vision and a high IQ.\n\nHis current position on the NBA Finals MVP Odds list can only be explained by his team's struggles against the Timberwolves in the Conference Semis. However, if they can turn things around and advance to the next round, Jokic should climb higher in the NBA Finals MVP Odds ranking.\n\nThe Boston Celtics are perhaps the most stacked team in the Playoffs as evidenced by the number of players they have in the top ten of the NBA Finals MVP Odds.\n\nJaylen Brown has been criticized for his weaknesses but when he's on fire, Boston looks unstoppable. Should they win a chip, there will be plenty of debate on who should have won the Finals MVP award and Brown could be one of those guys.\n\nSince entering the league in 2018, Luka Doncic has inserted himself into the conversation for some of the league's most prestigious awards. This year is no different as he not only placed himself as one of the finalists for the regular season MVP, but he is also among the leaders in the NBA Finals MVP Odds.\n\nOf course, he will need to prove he belongs by not only leading his squad to the NBA Finals but also securing his first NBA Title.\n\nJalen Brunson has emerged as a true superstar this season. His style of play might be exciting but he is also a tough and gritty competitor. Even without Julius Randle, he has willed the team to the second seed and onto the Conference Semis.\n\nThe Knicks franchise could make their first Finals appearance since 1999 all thanks to the work Brunson has done in leading the team.\n\nThe OKC Thunder could be in for a tough battle against a more experienced Dallas Mavericks squad and it's a good time for them to truly prove their doubters wrong.\n\nTheir young core still has much to learn but already, they're looking like one of the best teams in the league behind Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's leadership. If they make it out of the West, SGA might just climb to one or two in the NBA Finals MVP Odds list.\n\nEverything the Minnesota Timberwolves have accomplished thus far would be impossible if it wasn't for Anthony Edwards. Yes, that team has enjoyed contributions from several important players but he is the most impactful out of all of them.\n\nEdwards has risen as one of the best two-way superstars in the league. His contributions on both ends of the floor have got the Denver Nuggets on the ropes and he's got the Wolves looking nearly unstoppable.\n\nThe Boston Celtics were the only 60-win team in the regular season and are highly favored to win the Eastern Conference. Throughout their dominant run, Jayson Tatum remains the team's best player.\n\nConsidering the Celtics' position and the high expectations of them, it only makes sense that Tatum is leading the NBA Finals MVP Odds.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "miguel_de_guzman@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Miguel De Guzman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/90f1e-17151148208172-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo was second in points and sixth in rebounds per game, and Sacramento's Domantas Sabonis led the league in rebounds per game while ranking sixth in assists per contest.\n\nThere's a reasonable chance that Victor Wembanyama -- the No. 1 pick in last year's draft by San Antonio, along with the rookie of the year winner and runner-up to Minnesota's Rudy Gobert for defensive player of the year this season -- wins the MVP award one day.\n\nBut Nikola Jokic's win this year extended an unusual streak.\n\nFor the 11th straight year, the MVP award was claimed by someone who wasn't a No. 1 overall draft pick. That's the longest such run in NBA history; the last No. 1 to win was LeBron James, then of Miami, in 2013.\n\nNikola Jokic is the fifth player in NBA history to finish first or second in the MVP balloting in at least four consecutive seasons. He won the award in 2021, 2022 and this year, and was second to Philadelphia's Joel Embiid in 2023.\n\nBoston Celtics greats Bill Russell and Larry Bird each were first or second in the balloting in six consecutive seasons. Russell won in 1958, 1961, 1962 and 1963, while finishing second in 1959 and 1960; Bird was second in 1981, 1982 and 1983 before winning in 1984, 1985 and 1986.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar (1971-74) and Tim Duncan (2001-04) are the other players with four straight top-two finishes.\n\nDallas' Luka Doncic averaged 33.9 points, 9.2 rebounds and 9.8 assists per game this season. There had never been a season in NBA history in which someone finished with all those averages.\n\nAnd he still didn't win MVP.\n\nThere were 14 previous instances of someone averaging at least 33 points and nine rebounds; those stats were enough to MVP five times (Joel Embiid in 2023, Bob McAdoo in 1975, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1972, Wilt Chamberlain in 1960 and 1966).\n\nOf course, it should be noted that Chamberlain had some years when he was even more dominant and didn't win MVP -- including five consecutive seasons in which he averaged at least 34 points and 22 rebounds but didn't get the trophy in any of them. Elgin Baylor averaged at least 34 points and 14 rebounds in three seasons when he wasn't MVP, and Rick Barry had a 35.6-point, 9.2-rebound year that didn't get him the award, either.\n\nBefore Doncic this year, there was just one season in which a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists. That was 1972-73 when Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11.4 assists for Kansas City. He was third in the MVP voting that season.\n\nNikola Jokic's win means a player who is listed at 6-foot-10 or taller -- Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2019 and 2020, Jokic in 2021, 2022 and now 2024, and Joel Embiid in 2023 -- has won the MVP award in six consecutive seasons.\n\nThat's a first for the NBA. But that doesn't mean this is the first dominant stretch for big men. Far from it.\n\nThere was a 16-year stretch from 1964-65 through 1979-80 when players generally considered to be centers or at least power forwards won the award each year. Not all were at least 6-10, but all were considered big men.\n\nThe last guard to win the MVP award was James Harden, then of Houston, in 2018.\n\nMilwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo got one first-place vote. It mattered.\n\nAntetokounmpo has now gotten at least one first-place MVP vote in six consecutive seasons, extending the longest such streak in the league.\n\nIt's the longest first-place-vote streak since LeBron James got a first-place vote in eight consecutive years from 2008 through 2015. That run ended when Golden State's Stephen Curry became the first -- and still only -- unanimous MVP in 2016.\n\nDenver's Nikola Jokic has gotten a first-place vote in each of the last four years. Philadelphia's Joel Embiid had first-place votes in each of the previous three seasons but was ineligible for consideration this year because of the league's new rule mandating that players must appear in a certain number of games before getting onto the ballot.\n\nLeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers didn't get a vote in the MVP balloting this season. It's only the second time in his 21-year career that has happened; the other was last season, ending an unprecedented 19-year streak of getting at least one vote. (The panel of reporters and broadcasters who vote on awards rank their top five MVP choices on their ballots.)\n\nHe is the only player in NBA history to appear in the MVP results in 19 different seasons. When the All-NBA team is revealed later this month, James could make a 20th appearance, which would extend his record.\n\nNo other player has more than 15 All-NBA nods.\n\nHere's a wrapup of all the NBA awards that have been announced to this point:", "source": {"uri": "apnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AP NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Others averaged more in each category -- and Jokic has had better years in each of those categories -- but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season.\n\nJokic got 79 of a possible 99 first-place votes from the panel of reporters and broadcasters who cast ballots on awards when the regular season ended.\n\nOklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was second and Dallas' Luka Doncic was third, both getting into the top three of MVP voting for the first time.\n\nWith Jokic from Serbia, Gilgeous-Alexander from Canada and Doncic from Slovenia, it marked the third consecutive season that three players born outside the U.S. finished 1-2-3 in the MVP balloting.\n\nThis time, the foreign dominance atop the NBA was even more pronounced: Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is from Greece, was fourth -- so this became the first time in the award's 69-year history that international players went 1-2-3-4 in the voting. It also became the sixth consecutive year that an player born outside the U.S. won the award.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJokic is now the ninth player to win the MVP award at least three times. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won it six times, Bill Russell and Michael Jordan each won five, Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won four, and Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are the other three-time winners.\n\nJokic's surprise rise to superstardom has been chronicled time and again over the years: He was the 41st overall pick in the 2014 draft, didn't even think he had a realistic chance at playing in the NBA when his career was beginning and now has a Hall of Fame resume at 29.\n\nThe other players with three MVP trophies in a four-year span are James, Johnson, Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Chamberlain and Russell. And Jokic becomes the fifth player to be first or second in the MVP voting in four consecutive years -- joining Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Russell and Tim Duncan.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander had perhaps the best feel-good story in the NBA this season, helping Oklahoma City to the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference by averaging 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds and 6.2 assists. The Thunder won 57 games, 17 more than they did last season and 33 more than they did two years ago, their rise coinciding with Gilgeous-Alexander's emergence as one of the game's elite players.\n\nDoncic made a case for the MVP award by posting the first season in NBA history in which a player averaged 34 points, nine rebounds and nine assists per game. There had been 14 instances before this year in which a player averaged that many points and rebounds in a season -- of those, five had resulted in MVP wins, including last season when Philadelphia's Joel Embiid averaged 33 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nAnd this was the second time ever that a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists per game. The other was in 1972-73, when Kansas City's Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11 assists. He finished third in that season's MVP voting, just like Doncic did this season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMAVERICKS-THUNDER: As Oklahoma City prepared to host the Dallas Mavericks in Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals, Thunder Coach Mark Daigneault was asked how his team would brace for Luka Doncic's physical style.\n\nDaigneault quipped that he just needed lockdown defender Lu Dort to show up on time for the game.\n\nDort did more than just arrive on time. He was the defensive catalyst as the Thunder held Doncic, the league's regular-season scoring leader, to 19 points on 6-for-19 shooting in Oklahoma City's 117-95 victory on Tuesday night.\n\nDoncic has been nursing a knee injury since the first round of the playoffs. It could be affecting him, though he refused to make excuses after Game 1.\n\nThat doesn't mean Oklahoma City is off the hook, though -- Kyrie Irving is fully capable of scoring more. He often defers to Doncic, but he might not do that so much if his teammate struggles early in Game 2 on Thursday in Oklahoma City.\n\nDaigneault said he's prepared if Irving chooses to shoulder more of the offensive load. Irving is averaging 25.6 points per game on 51.2% shooting in the playoffs. He scored 20 in the opener against the Thunder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We're expecting that pitch in Game 2 and Game 3 and so on and so forth,\" Daigneault said.\n\nIrving, who won a championship with Cleveland in 2016, didn't make much of the opening loss.\n\n\"We just have to adjust to the team we're playing against,\" Irving said. \"I think that's the most important thing. This Game 1 is done. We didn't play as well as we would have liked. We failed on a lot of our coverages. And we didn't come in with the attitude that was necessary.\"\n\nDaigneault expects a difficult Game 2.\n\n\"We know they're going to come out aggressively, confidently,\" he said. \"They've got a lot of experience under their belt. They're not going to be rattled by one playoff loss. And so we've got to rise to that.\"\n\nBUCKS: Indianapolis police announced they've opened an investigation into an \"NBA player and citizen\" altercation that happened at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on the night Bucks guard Patrick Beverley threw a ball at a fan in the final minutes of a season-ending loss to the Pacers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice said in a news release the case has been forwarded to detectives, \"who are currently investigating this situation and take all accusations seriously.\"\n\nDetectives will present the case to the Marion County Prosecutor's Office at the conclusion of the investigation, the release stated.\n\nCameras showed Beverley sitting on the bench and tossing a ball into the stands, hitting a fan in the head with about 2 1/2 minutes left in the game on May 2. After a different fan threw the ball back to Beverley, who was holding his arm out for it, the Bucks' guard fired it back at that spectator.\n\nBeverley spoke about his behavior on an episode of \"The Pat Bev Podcast\" that was released Wednesday. He said he was called a word that he'd never been called before, but added that his own actions were \"still inexcusable.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Downing-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFor the third time in his career, Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokic was named the NBA's MVP. Jokic joins an exclusive list of NBA legends with three career MVP awards, and remains in pursuit of another Finals MVP award this postseason as his team tries to battle back from an 0-2 deficit to the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nJokic joined the NBA on TNT crew following the announcement that he had won the award, and had a strange interaction with Shaquille O'Neal, who said Shai Gilgeous-Alexander should have won MVP.\n\n\"You know I love you,\" O'Neal said to Jokic. \"You're the best player in the league. I want to congratulate you. But I want you to hear it from me first. I thought that SGA should have been the MVP. That's no disrespect to you.\"\n\nWhile this is O'Neal's opinion, and Gilgeous-Alexander was certainly a worthy candidate, this felt like the wrong moment to make such a statement. Jokic deservingly won the award, even if the other finalists were also worthy candidates. Jokic was respectful and playful with O'Neal following this statement, but there was no real need to tell the Nuggets star that in a moment where he joined the show to celebrate winning the award.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Jokic and the Nuggets are now focused on getting back on track in their series vs. Minnesota.\n\nMichael Malone Reveals Hilarious Moment With Nikola Jokic After Ejection\n\nVictor Wembanyama Makes History vs. Nuggets", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_on_TNT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA on TNT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Malone_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Malone (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4690,h_2638,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_nuggets/01hxdamdqjgyqqy8h1y4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Three international players, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Oklahoma City Thunder), Nikola Jokic (Denver Nuggets) and Luka Doncic (Dallas Mavericks) were named as MVP Finalists. While San Antonio Spurs' Victor Wembanyama was named Rookie of the Year on Monday, May 6 with a 99% vote rate in favor of the Spurs' rookie.\n\nWembanyama (France; ties to the Democratic Republic of Congo) and Kia NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award finalist Miami Heat's Bam Adebayo (U.S.; ties to Nigeria) were the only two players with ties to Africa who were named finalists for this season's Kia NBA Awards.\n\nMore than 50 players from Africa and with ties to the continent participated in the NBA regular season with eight players from five different countries advancing to the first round of the NBA Playoffs. Over 140 games were broadcast across the continent seeing a 41% year-on-year increase in viewership and close to six million watch hours this season.\n\nThe second round of the NBA Playoffs continues this week on NBA League Pass.\n\nAlex Isaboke, Capital FM (Kenya): My MVP will go to Jokic. Once again he has proved to be the best over the rest, with his stardom inspiring the Nuggets into the playoffs and on track to defending the title. His name is on the list for several major counting stats - he's fifth in total points, second in total assists, third in total rebounds - he remains my favorite.\n\n**\n\nMor Bassine, Record (Senegal): I choose Luka Don\u010di\u0107 of the Dallas Mavericks for the MVP trophy. His statistics are above average - 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists per game. He is well ahead of players like OKC's Gilgeous-Alexander's 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds, 6.2 assists or even last season's Finals MVP, Nikola Jokic who averaged, 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds.\n\n**\n\nSindiswa Mabunda, The Big Tip Off (South Africa): I believe Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (SGA) will win the MVP award. The Canadian guard had a breakout season last year and continued with his impressive form this year, ending the regular season with an average of 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 6.2 assists per game especially with the Thunder emerging as the number one seed led by SGA.\n\nSGA has established himself as the leader of the best team in the West, with the second-best record in the league overall. He has also proven himself to be a top perimeter defender, leading the league in steals with an average of 2 per game. Additionally, he was the third-highest scorer in the league.\n\n**\n\nTosin Abayomi, Pulse Nigeria (Nigeria): All three MVP nominees had extraordinary campaigns over 82 games of the regular season. However, the winner will be Jokic who has taken the mantle as the best basketball player in the world. His control of the game from the center position is unprecedented, while Doncic has better stats in a loaded Western Conference.", "source": {"uri": "capitalfm.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title":

Others averaged more in each category -- and Jokic has had better years in each of those categories -- but he was the only player to rank in the NBA's top 10 in points, rebounds and assists per game this season.\n\nJokic got 79 of a possible 99 first-place votes from the panel of reporters and broadcasters who cast ballots on awards when the regular season ended.\n\nOklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was second and Dallas' Luka Doncic was third, both getting into the top three of MVP voting for the first time.\n\nWith Jokic from Serbia, Gilgeous-Alexander from Canada and Doncic from Slovenia, it marked the third consecutive season that three players born outside the U.S. finished 1-2-3 in the MVP balloting.\n\nThis time, the foreign dominance atop the NBA was even more pronounced: Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is from Greece, was fourth -- so this became the first time in the award's 69-year history that international players went 1-2-3-4 in the voting. It also became the sixth consecutive year that an player born outside the U.S. won the award.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJokic is now the ninth player to win the MVP award at least three times. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won it six times, Bill Russell and Michael Jordan each won five, Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won four, and Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are the other three-time winners.\n\nJokic's surprise rise to superstardom has been chronicled time and again over the years: He was the 41st overall pick in the 2014 draft, didn't even think he had a realistic chance at playing in the NBA when his career was beginning and now has a Hall of Fame resume at 29.\n\nThe other players with three MVP trophies in a four-year span are James, Johnson, Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Chamberlain and Russell. And Jokic becomes the fifth player to be first or second in the MVP voting in four consecutive years -- joining Bird, Abdul-Jabbar, Russell and Tim Duncan.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander had perhaps the best feel-good story in the NBA this season, helping Oklahoma City to the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference by averaging 30.1 points, 5.5 rebounds and 6.2 assists. The Thunder won 57 games, 17 more than they did last season and 33 more than they did two years ago, their rise coinciding with Gilgeous-Alexander's emergence as one of the game's elite players.\n\nDoncic made a case for the MVP award by posting the first season in NBA history in which a player averaged 34 points, nine rebounds and nine assists per game. There had been 14 instances before this year in which a player averaged that many points and rebounds in a season -- of those, five had resulted in MVP wins, including last season when Philadelphia's Joel Embiid averaged 33 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nAnd this was the second time ever that a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists per game. The other was in 1972-73, when Kansas City's Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11 assists. He finished third in that season's MVP voting, just like Doncic did this season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMAVERICKS-THUNDER: As Oklahoma City prepared to host the Dallas Mavericks in Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals, Thunder Coach Mark Daigneault was asked how his team would brace for Luka Doncic's physical style.\n\nDaigneault quipped that he just needed lockdown defender Lu Dort to show up on time for the game.\n\nDort did more than just arrive on time. He was the defensive catalyst as the Thunder held Doncic, the league's regular-season scoring leader, to 19 points on 6-for-19 shooting in Oklahoma City's 117-95 victory on Tuesday night.\n\nDoncic has been nursing a knee injury since the first round of the playoffs. It could be affecting him, though he refused to make excuses after Game 1.\n\nThat doesn't mean Oklahoma City is off the hook, though -- Kyrie Irving is fully capable of scoring more. He often defers to Doncic, but he might not do that so much if his teammate struggles early in Game 2 on Thursday in Oklahoma City.\n\nDaigneault said he's prepared if Irving chooses to shoulder more of the offensive load. Irving is averaging 25.6 points per game on 51.2% shooting in the playoffs. He scored 20 in the opener against the Thunder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We're expecting that pitch in Game 2 and Game 3 and so on and so forth,\" Daigneault said.\n\nIrving, who won a championship with Cleveland in 2016, didn't make much of the opening loss.\n\n\"We just have to adjust to the team we're playing against,\" Irving said. \"I think that's the most important thing. This Game 1 is done. We didn't play as well as we would have liked. We failed on a lot of our coverages. And we didn't come in with the attitude that was necessary.\"\n\nDaigneault expects a difficult Game 2.\n\n\"We know they're going to come out aggressively, confidently,\" he said. \"They've got a lot of experience under their belt. They're not going to be rattled by one playoff loss. And so we've got to rise to that.\"\n\nBUCKS: Indianapolis police announced they've opened an investigation into an \"NBA player and citizen\" altercation that happened at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on the night Bucks guard Patrick Beverley threw a ball at a fan in the final minutes of a season-ending loss to the Pacers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice said in a news release the case has been forwarded to detectives, \"who are currently investigating this situation and take all accusations seriously.\"\n\nDetectives will present the case to the Marion County Prosecutor's Office at the conclusion of the investigation, the release stated.\n\nCameras showed Beverley sitting on the bench and tossing a ball into the stands, hitting a fan in the head with about 2 1/2 minutes left in the game on May 2. After a different fan threw the ball back to Beverley, who was holding his arm out for it, the Bucks' guard fired it back at that spectator.\n\nBeverley spoke about his behavior on an episode of \"The Pat Bev Podcast\" that was released Wednesday. He said he was called a word that he'd never been called before, but added that his own actions were \"still inexcusable.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link Invalid username/password.\n\nSuccess.

While his numbers and performance speak for themselves, the race was supposed to be a close one, with Shai-Gilgeous Alexander and Luka Doncic in the running. But the results show a completely different picture, where the Nuggets center was miles ahead in the voting process from his counterparts. This has become a big issue for some, a Shaquille O'Neal-sized issue.\n\nOn a recent episode of NBA On TNT, Shaq took a massive issue with the result of the prestigious award. \"I don't like to rain on people's parade, but I'm not happy with this one. ...I felt Shai deserved it.\" He even drew parallel with himself saying that he was robbed of the award multiple times and feels for Shai in that regard.\n\nThe Big Diesel didn't stop there as he also said the same thing right on the face of Nikola Jokic when the Serbian was connected to the analyst panel for a congratulatory session. \"I want you to be the first to hear this from me, but I believe SGA (Shai Gilgeous-Alexander) should have clinched the MVP,\" said Shaq while congratulating Jokic.\n\nBut what does the \"Big Man Alliance\" vice president have to say about his accomplishment? To nobody's surprise, he addressed it in the most Nikola Jokic way possible.\n\nThe Denver Nuggets are 2-0 down in the series against the Minnesota Timberwolves, but that didn't dampen the mood of the MVP winner. Talking about it During a press conference on Wednesday, Jokic said, \"It's been three, four years now. I think I'm kinda used to it, so I didn't even pay attention anymore. Probably a good problem to have.\" He further added that not winning the award and taking the NBA championship home was a better scenario for him.\n\nThe Denver stalwart averaged 26.4 points per game, 12.4 rebounds, 9.0 assists, 1.4 steals, and 0.9 blocks in 79 regular season games. His postseason performance has also been brilliant so far despite back-to-back losses to the Timberwolves. His 27 points per game from 54.2% shooting from the field, along with 15 rebounds and 9.4 assists, indicates a dominant playoff run so far, but it was only limited to the Lakers series.\n\nJokic and Co. will be desperate to catch up with their Western Conference semifinal opponents on Friday when the two teams will meet for game 3 at the Target Center.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sami_haider@totalprosports.com", "name": "Sami Haider", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Center", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Target Center"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FotoJet-33-e1715249248671-1024x563.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Downing-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDenver Nuggets star Nikola Jokic is widely considered the best player in all of basketball. Having just won his third league MVP award, Jokic joined a very exclusive group of players with three MVPs, and an even more exclusive group that also has a Finals MVP award.\n\nMany have wondered how long Jokic plans to play in the NBA, and when asked about that following his latest MVP award, Jokic revealed that he plans to play as long as he can remain at the highest level.\n\nJokic has the style of game that projects to age gracefully. Not reliant on athleticism or quickness, Jokic relies on his unmatched basketball IQ and feel for the game. This should make it easy for the Nuggets star to remain at a high-level deep into his career.\n\nDenver currently trails the Minnesota Timberwolves 0-2 in their Western Conference Semi-Finals matchup, and will look to get back into the series in games three and four. It will not be easy, as Denver will have to win two games on the road in order to avoid a 3-1 deficit, but this is a proven group with championship DNA.\n\nWith a star like Jokic, the Nuggets have a chance in any game and any series. They have dug themselves quite the hole, especially losing their first two games at home, but Denver believes that they can come back and win this series.\n\nWATCH: Shaq Sends Shocking Message to Nikola Jokic After Winning MVP\n\nHall-of-Fame NBA Coach Drops Controversial LeBron James Statement", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5030,h_2829,x_0,y_524/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_nuggets/01hxf8c9y106dv1thnpm.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

He led the NBA in several categories, including win shares (17) and Value Over Replacement Player (10.6).\n\nThe Serbian's win continues a run of six straight MVPs born outside of the United States.

Knicks guard Jalen Brunson received the most votes of all American players, garnering three second-place selections as part of a total of 142 points, good for fifth overall.", "source": {"uri": "thescore.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "theScore.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets-cms.thescore.com/uploads/image/file/623262/w768xh576_GettyImages-2064222900.jpg?ts=1713470003", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6784313725490196, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

The Nuggets finished 57-25, tied for the second-best record in the league, and they earned the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference. He became just one of four players to have multiple seasons with 20-plus triple-doubles.\n\nDuring a stretch earlier in the season, Jokic became the first player in NBA history to record at least 14 rebounds and at least 14 assists in three consecutive games and just the second player since steals became an official stat 50 years ago to have at least 30 points, 15 rebounds, 15 assists and four steals in a game.\n\nThis third MVP solidifies Jokic's spot as one of the most gifted and skilled big men in NBA history. He has the ability to score inside and outside, pass and rebound. He combines extraordinary footwork, a soft touch and incredible vision into an offensive force that is difficult to defend, creating scoring opportunities for himself and teammates.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander finished second and Doncic third.\n\nDoncic led the league in scoring with a career-high 33.9 points per game and was a triple-double threat every game at 9.8 assists and 9.2 rebounds per game and a career-high 38.2% on 3-pointers. Gilgeous-Alexander led the young Thunder to the No. 1 seed in the West and posted 30.1 points, 6.2 assists, 5.5 rebounds and 2.0 steals per game and shot 53.5% from the field and 35.3% on 3s.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_zillgitt@usatoday.com", "name": "Jeff Zillgitt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moses Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilt_Chamberlain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wilt Chamberlain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/08/USAT/73620531007-jokic.jpg?crop=4677,2632,x0,y169&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nMULTIPLE TOP 10s\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDenver's Nikola Jokic was the only player in the league to rank among the top 10 in points (10th), rebounds (4th) and assists (3rd) per game this season, which surely went a long way toward voters giving him the MVP award for the third time in four years.\n\nThere were only three other players who ranked among top 10 in two of those categories.\n\nDallas' Luka Doncic won the scoring title and was second in assists per game. Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo was second in points and sixth in rebounds per game, and Sacramento's Domantas Sabonis led the league in rebounds per game while ranking sixth in assists per contest.\n\nTOP PICK DROUGHT\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThere's a reasonable chance that Victor Wembanyama -- the No. 1 pick in last year's draft by San Antonio, along with the rookie of the year winner and runner-up to Minnesota's Rudy Gobert for defensive player of the year this season -- wins the MVP award one day.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut Nikola Jokic's win this year extended an unusual streak.\n\nFor the 11th straight year, the MVP award was claimed by someone who wasn't a No. 1 overall draft pick. That's the longest such run in NBA history; the last No. 1 to win was LeBron James, then of Miami, in 2013.\n\nFINISHING TOP 2\n\nNikola Jokic is the fifth player in NBA history to finish first or second in the MVP balloting in at least four consecutive seasons. He won the award in 2021, 2022 and this year, and was second to Philadelphia's Joel Embiid in 2023.\n\nBoston Celtics greats Bill Russell and Larry Bird each were first or second in the balloting in six consecutive seasons. Russell won in 1958, 1961, 1962 and 1963, while finishing second in 1959 and 1960; Bird was second in 1981, 1982 and 1983 before winning in 1984, 1985 and 1986.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar (1971-74) and Tim Duncan (2001-04) are the other players with four straight top-two finishes.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n33, 9 AND 9 NOT ENOUGH\n\nDallas' Luka Doncic averaged 33.9 points, 9.2 rebounds and 9.8 assists per game this season. There had never been a season in NBA history in which someone finished with all those averages.\n\nAnd he still didn't win MVP.\n\nThere were 14 previous instances of someone averaging at least 33 points and nine rebounds; those stats were enough to MVP five times (Joel Embiid in 2023, Bob McAdoo in 1975, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1972, Wilt Chamberlain in 1960 and 1966).\n\nOf course, it should be noted that Chamberlain had some years when he was even more dominant and didn't win MVP -- including five consecutive seasons in which he averaged at least 34 points and 22 rebounds but didn't get the trophy in any of them. Elgin Baylor averaged at least 34 points and 14 rebounds in three seasons when he wasn't MVP, and Rick Barry had a 35.6-point, 9.2-rebound year that didn't get him the award, either.\n\nBefore Doncic this year, there was just one season in which a player averaged at least 33 points and nine assists. That was 1972-73 when Tiny Archibald averaged 34 points and 11.4 assists for Kansas City. He was third in the MVP voting that season.\n\nREACHING HEIGHTS\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nNikola Jokic's win means a player who is listed at 6-foot-10 or taller -- Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2019 and 2020, Jokic in 2021, 2022 and now 2024, and Joel Embiid in 2023 -- has won the MVP award in six consecutive seasons.\n\nThat's a first for the NBA. But that doesn't mean this is the first dominant stretch for big men. Far from it.\n\nThere was a 16-year stretch from 1964-65 through 1979-80 when players generally considered to be centers or at least power forwards won the award each year. Not all were at least 6-10, but all were considered big men.\n\nThe last guard to win the MVP award was James Harden, then of Houston, in 2018.\n\nGIANNIS' STREAK\n\nMilwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo got one first-place vote. It mattered.\n\nAntetokounmpo has now gotten at least one first-place MVP vote in six consecutive seasons, extending the longest such streak in the league.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIt's the longest first-place-vote streak since LeBron James got a first-place vote in eight consecutive years from 2008 through 2015. That run ended when Golden State's Stephen Curry became the first -- and still only -- unanimous MVP in 2016.\n\nDenver's Nikola Jokic has gotten a first-place vote in each of the last four years. Philadelphia's Joel Embiid had first-place votes in each of the previous three seasons but was ineligible for consideration this year because of the league's new rule mandating that players must appear in a certain number of games before getting onto the ballot.\n\nNO LeBRON\n\nLeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers didn't get a vote in the MVP balloting this season. It's only the second time in his 21-year career that has happened; the other was last season, ending an unprecedented 19-year streak of getting at least one vote. (The panel of reporters and broadcasters who vote on awards rank their top five MVP choices on their ballots.)\n\nHe is the only player in NBA history to appear in the MVP results in 19 different seasons. When the All-NBA team is revealed later this month, James could make a 20th appearance, which would extend his record.\n\nNo other player has more than 15 All-NBA nods.\n\nALL THE AWARDS\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHere's a wrapup of all the NBA awards that have been announced to this point:\n\n-- Most Valuable Player, Nikola Jokic, Denver.\n\n-- Most Improved Player, Tyrese Maxey, Philadelphia.\n\n-- Rookie of the Year, Victor Wembanyama, San Antonio.\n\n-- Defensive Player of the Year, Rudy Gobert, Minnesota.\n\n-- Sixth Man of the Year, Naz Reid, Minnesota.\n\n-- Clutch Player of the Year, Stephen Curry, Golden State.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n-- Coach of the Year, Mark Daigneault, Oklahoma City.\n\n-- Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year, Mike Conley, Minnesota.\n\n-- Executive of the Year, Brad Stevens, Boston.\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA", "source": {"uri": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Without him, Denver might not even make the postseason.\n\nHowever, NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal is not happy that Jokic got this year's NBA MVP award. While he's typically biased towards the big men, O'Neal thinks another Western Conference star should've received the award this year: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\n\"I don't like to rain on people's parade, but I'm not happy with this one,\" Shaq said during NBA on TNT. \"...I felt Shai deserved it.\"\n\nO'Neal believes Gilgeous-Alexander met all the criteria of winning the award. He argues that Gilgeous-Alexander is far more important to the Thunder's success than Jokic is for the Nuggets.\n\nThe Oklahoma City star was one of the best scores in the NBA during the regular season, dropping 30.1 points per game. He added 6.2 assists, 5.5 rebounds and 2.0 steals per contest.\n\nJokic and Gilgeous-Alexander are both deserving, but only one player can win the award.\n\nIt's says a lot, though, that a legendary big man like O'Neal believes a guard was more deserving of the MVP award than a big man.

That means he's spending a little more time thinking about the future, the kind long after his playing days are done.\n\n\"When you're older, you don't want them to look at your videos or whatever and say that you were bad,\" Jokic said. \"Hopefully, I can talk all the trash when my kid or my nephews grow up.\"\n\nDenver's beloved do-it-all center isn't leaving much room for backtalk. He was the Finals MVP in the franchise's first championship run, and Joker's joining a group of guys who only need one name to be recognized.\n\n\"When I won the first time, I was like 'OK, this is cool. This is nice.' When I won a second, the list was way shorter. Now, the list is kind of short, short. I'm just happy to be part of that group of guys, which is not a bad group of guys, right?\" Jokic said.\n\n\"It's a legacy for after the career. I think I'm going to be more, maybe, proud of myself after career than right now.\"\n\nAfter Philadelphia center Joel Embiid prevent Jokic from going four in a row by winning the 2023 award. Jokic reclaimed the award by averaging 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds, 9 assists and 1.4 steals, all team-highs as Denver matched its franchise record for wins in a regular season.\n\n\"After winning a championship and being a Finals MVP, he's had an even better season,\" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \"He continues to push the envelope. He's never satisfied, and that's what all the great players have in common. They're always striving to become even better.\"\n\nJokic received 926 total points in the voting, to clear Oklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (640) and Dallas's Luka Doncic (566).\n\n\"He's out there every game, scoring, assisting, defending, doing a little bit of everything for this team. It feels like he's available for every single game. He battles. He works. (He) works on his body. All that, while being a really good dude off the court, being a good person in the locker room, being a good person to whoever he runs into,\" Christian Braun said after Denver's practice Wednesday.\n\n\"He makes his own case, obviously. ...

His wife, Natalija, narrated a video produced and released by the team and was a part of a small group to celebrate another accomplishment at Ball Arena on Wednesday night.\n\n\"To others, an unmatched talent. To us, an unselfish family man,\" she said. \"Outsiders may see him as unconventional or unorthodox, but we have always seen him as unbelievable. It may be unlikely that a proud Serbian, drafted as the overlooked 41st pick, would achieve a status only a few have reached, but when you play your cards right, anything is likely. Behind the scars and the smile lies the work, lies the belief that you will be great. We will always believe in our now three-time MVP.\"\n\nJokic's brothers Strahinja and Nemanja chimed in, using the native tongue, to share their pride, and his young daughter Ognjena closed the video with a brief message and a blown kiss.\n\n\"Volimo te, tata,\" the two-year-old said.\n\nThe phrase translates to \"We love you, dad.\" Jokic bent down to kiss his daughter on the head after watching the video with her. That might come in handy years down the road should there be any debate as the Jokic family tree grows.\n\n\"I'm going to be a cool grandpa,\" Jokic said.\n\n***\n\nThe NBA players with the most MVP

Jokic has now won the award in three of the past four seasons, making him the first player to do since LeBron James. He is the seventh player overall to win three MVPS in four years, joining Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and James to do so, and he is the ninth player to win three MVP awards overall, with Michael Jordan and Moses Malone rounding out that list.\n\nJokic made a real run at winning four MVPs in a row, but lost a competitive race to Joel Embiid last season. Embiid was favored earlier this season, but when a torn meniscus sidelined him, Jokic took control of the race and never surrendered it. Jokic finished the regular season having averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and nine assists per game. As he does almost every year, Jokic led the league in almost every major advanced metric, including, but not limited to, PER, Win Shares, Offensive Win Shares, Win Shares Per 48 Minutes, Box Plus-Minus, Offensive Box Plus-Minus, Defensive Box Plus-Minus and Value Over Replacement Player.\n\nAs the defending Finals MVP, Jokic entered this season with higher expectations than he's ever faced. He handled them brilliantly in the regular season. The Nuggets ultimately won 56 games and earned the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference despite losing key reserves Bruce Brown and Jeff Green to free agency and playing 23 games without top teammate Jamal Murray due to injury. Jokic and the Nuggets, however, are facing their toughest challenge of their last two playoff runs at the moment. They trail the Minnesota Timberwolves, 2-0, ahead of Game 3 on Friday.\n\nAs dominant as Jokic has been, he faced serious competition from across the NBA. Giannis Antetokounmpo became the first player in NBA history to average 30 points per game on 60% shooting from the field. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the youngest team in NBA history to ever earn a No. 1 seed. And Luka Doncic was the first player in NBA history to average 33 points, nine rebounds and nine assists per game over a full season.\n\nIndividually, each had compelling cases, but all three had flaws as well. Doncic is not known for his defense, and his team was a No. 5 seed. As well as Antetokounmpo played, his team's season was chaotic at best and included a midseason coaching change. Gilgeous-Alexander dealt with a quad injury down the stretch that limited his impact on the final few weeks of the season.\n\nJokic's case was bulletproof. He was the best player in the NBA on opening night, and to most, he remains the best player in the NBA today. He's leading the team most expect to win the Western Conference and perhaps the championship. Jokic may have narrowly missed out on four straight MVPs, but three in four years puts him in very impressive company. Jokic is already an all-time legend, and he's still smack dab in the middle of his prime. He's only going to continue climbing that historical ladder and joining more and more exclusive clubs. If it gets any better than three MVPs in four years, you can bet Jokic will find a way to show us what that looks like.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_quinn@cbssports.com", "name": "Sam Quinn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win_Shares", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Win Shares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moses Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilt_Chamberlain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wilt Chamberlain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magic Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_over_replacement_player", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Value over replacement player"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Green_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Green (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/08/cfddc3fd-d1c4-477f-ba46-fdf7dd4bfa6c/thumbnail/1200x675/c3e7ae6018f530c923a107df923bd695/jokic-smiles-getty.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Hate might be a strong word there... he's just indifferent about it (he'd rather be paying attention to his race horses).\n\nThe sport of basketball has never really seen a player like Nikola Jokic, who by the way, was drafted during a Taco Bell commercial. Seriously... they didn't even bother to cut from commercial when the Nuggets selected him in the 2014 NBA Draft. Unlike going to Taco Bell, it ended up being a great decision for the franchise.\n\nSince then, the \"Joker\" hasn't stopped winning NBA MVP awards, being named an all-star, and even recently bringing Denver an elusive NBA Championship in 2023. The Nuggets are currently in a tough spot (down 0-2) in a series with the Minnesota Timberwolves, but despite that, some good news did come today for the mile-high team.\n\nNikola Jokic was named NBA MVP for a third time, and the 7-foot Serbian celebrated in a way that only he could (not seemingly caring that much about it):\n\nHilarious.\n\nJokic was then probably forced to sit down with the NBA on TNT crew for an interview about the prestigious award, and that's when things got a little weird. It would have been awkward anyways, just because it's Jokic, but Shaquille O'Neal decided to double down on the awkwardness by telling Jokic that he shouldn't have won the award straight to his face:\n\n\"Joker, as the President of the Big Man Alliance, you know I love you. You're the best player in the league. I want to congratulate you. But I want you to hear from me first, I thought SGA (Shai Gilgeous-Alexander) should have been MVP. That's no disrespect to you. But congratulations.\"\n\nYikes...\n\nNikola Jokic handled it with class, and even laughed it off. But it was still a little cringey... even more so because Shaw said, \"You're the best player in the league,\" then said he didn't think Jokic was the MVP.

I thought Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was gonna win it.\"\n\nThis is not a new stance from O'Neal.

The Sporting News breaks down the stats below.\n\nMORE: Where Nikola Jokic's three MVP awards rank on all-time list\n\nO'Neal went on to explain Gilgeous-Alexander's MVP case. SGA had 51 games with at least 30 points -- the most in a single season since James Harden in 2018.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder to the No. 1 seed when \"no one expected it,\" O'Neal continued. Oklahoma City won the tiebreaker with Denver (57-25) for the best record in the West.\n\nIn the preseason, the Thunder were projected to win just 43 games and had +7500 odds to win the NBA Finals. Behind Gilgeous-Alexander's superstar season, OKC blew that projection out of the water with 57 wins. They are currently listed at +700 to win the NBA Finals, per BetMGM.\n\nThe Nuggets, on the other hand, were expected to be the best team in the West again. They were pegged to win 54 games and had +450 odds to win the NBA Finals. Denver ended up hitting the over with a 57-25 record.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander finished with averages of 30.1 points, 6.2 assists, 5.5 rebounds, 2.0 steals and 0.9 blocks per game.

On Wednesday, two days before the Nuggets fight for their season, Jokic's status as the MVP once again was revealed and it wasn't a huge surprise to anyone.\n\nThe voting results show an overwhelming blowout in favor of Jokic. He received 79 first-place votes, beating out Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who was second with just 15 votes for first. Luka Doncic and Giannis Antetokounmpo came in third and fourth place, respectively. In total, the Nuggets star tallied 926 points.\n\nThe Joker now joins Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, LeBron James, Moses Malone, Larry Bird, and Magic Johnson as the only 3x MVP winner and it was well-earned. Through 79 games, he averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 9.0 assists per game on 58.3% shooting while leading the Nuggets to a top-three seed in the West.\n\nOn social media, the discourse was interesting to watch. While some critics tried to take away from the moment, most fans and experts congratulated the Joker for his momentous achievement and have embraced his status as one of the game's all-time greats.\n\nWith his latest MVP win in the books, Jokic's greatness cannot be denied and his place in history is forever marked as a 3x MVP. Of course, at only 29 years old, he may not even be done competing for MVPs and proving himself at the highest level.\n\nAs impressive as this run has been for Jokic, it's in serious jeopardy of being tainted if the Nuggets get swept in this second-round series. The team, and Jokic in particular, looked rattled in Game 2 (where he shot 38% from the field) and many believe they will not recover in this series.\n\nCan Nikola Jokic Save The Nuggets' Season?\n\nAs the reigning MVP, Nikola Jokic should be celebrating this victory but all anyone can talk about regarding the Nuggets is their impending playoff doom. After winning the championship last season and looking so dominant for so long, nobody was expecting the Nuggets to look so outmatched against the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nThe Timberwolves' size, length, and physicality are pushing the Nuggets to their limit and Jokic is finding it harder than ever to orchestrate the offense amid, arguably, one of the best defensive performances in modern NBA history.\n\nThe Timberwolves held the Nuggets to just 80 points in Game 2 and Jamal Murray was on the verge of a suspension for throwing objects towards the officials. All around, the Nuggets are showing signs of frustration and the cracks are beginning to show.\n\nEven so, down 2-0, the Nuggets still have a chance to come back and prove everyone wrong.

In a nod to his Draft spot, we created a compilation of 41 fun facts, interesting stats and incredible plays to help explain the narrative of Jokic's uniqueness.\n\n1. Discovered in Serbian newspaper. Jokic was playing for a small club in Serbia when European's most famous basketball manager, Miodrag 'Misko' Raznatovi, took notice of him through a box score in a newspaper. Jokic signed with Raznatovi's agency and became a professional shortly after.\n\n2. Professional. Jokic was 17 when he became a pro, leaving home to join KK Mega Basket.\n\n3. Late start to rookie season. Jokic is the first MVP winner to spend the year he was drafted playing in another basketball league. The second-round pick continued to play overseas after the Nuggets selected him in the 2014 draft.\n\n5. Sodas in Serbia. It's not common for a future NBA superstar to drink three liters of Coke every day before practice. The carbonated beverage was Jokic's addiction, which he quit while on his flight to Denver.\n\n6. Injured hand because of autographs. Jokic has been durable throughout his NBA career, but he once missed a week of practice and a couple of games overseas due to inflammation in his right hand -- a quirky cost of signing too many autographs for fans.\n\n7. Almost pulled from NBA Draft. Roughly two weeks before the 2014 NBA Draft, Jokic's name was temporarily removed from the pool of candidates, a decision his agent tweeted about at the time.\n\nThe Nuggets would subsequently promise to select the Serbian prospect at pick 41 if he reentered the Draft pool.\n\n8. Almost skipped the NBA again. While continuing to play in Europe as an NBA Draft pick, Jokic nearly signed with another professional basketball club instead of joining the team that drafted him. \"A deal with Barcelona was in place,\" Jokic's agent said. \"An unfortunate event happened in his last game before signing the contract, which proved to be a blessing in disguise. He played before Barcelona representatives and the signing of the contract was postponed.\"\n\n9. Point center. In the eyes of many, Jokic is the best passing big man the league has ever seen. This season he accounted for over 40% of the field goals his teammates made while he was on the court, which is the highest assist percentage in NBA history from a center.\n\n10. Pick-and-roll. The 6-foot-11 Serbian can score in the interior -- he finished second in points scored via post-ups -- but he skillfully operates as a playmaker in Denver's offense. Finding a center who runs effective pick-and-rolls as the ball handler isn't something you see every night, unless you're in the Mile High City:\n\n11. Body transformation. It's uncommon for an MVP to transform his body in the way Jokic did, reportedly shedding around 30 pounds when he first came to the states, then slimming down even more during the NBA stoppage. \"He sent me a picture,\" Nuggets president Tim Connelly said last June. \"No shirt on. He's got abs. I've never seen him have abs before.\"\n\n12. Mascot mugger. If only there was footage, but Jokic once ripped the head off a Koala mascot and wore it during a spirited child basketball game. Who knew he had a little Robin Lopez in him.\n\n13. \"Somber shuffle.\" How many MVPs created their signature move because of an injury? While rehabbing his left ankle, Jokic tried not to put weight on his compromised foot as he got shot ups in practice. He ultimately developed a new unorthodox move that would later torment defenses.\n\n14. Marvelous in mid-range. Those plays also illustrate his mid-range touch, which is among the best in the NBA. Jokic shot 121-for-235 (51.5%) from that distance during his MVP campaign. To put that into context: Only 16 players made at least 100 mid-range shots this season, and only elite point guards Kyrie Irving (54.4%) and Chris Paul (51.6%) connected at a higher clip.\n\n15. Limited-time dunker. Jokic ranked 60th in the NBA in dunks this season with 45, the lowest total for a frontcourt MVP since Dirk Nowitzki (20) in 2006-07.\n\n16. GOAT comparisons. Not to Jordan or LeBron, but Tom Brady. Jokic has been referenced to TB12 by his teammates because of his elite passing and signal calling as the quarterback to Denver's offense. Brady was a sixth-round NFL draft pick, which is practically equivalent to Jokic being selected at No. 41. Furthermore, neither of them are athletically gifted and received doubts from pre-draft scouts because of their physique. None of that matters when you can deliver touchdowns.\n\n17. Answered the call. Jokic received significant playing time at the start of his career following an injury to Jusuf Nurkic (There it is again: Brady-Bledsoe?). He took advantage of the opportunity by averaging 10 points per game on 51.2% shooting and making the NBA All-Rookie First Team.\n\n18. Rare superstar personality. Jokic is one of the most taciturn MVPs since Tim Duncan. He stays to himself and off social media platforms. Unlike the other MVP finalists, Jokic never voiced his desire to win the award. Duncan loves watching him play, but his quiet disposition is likely admired, too.\n\n19. 'I want to come off the bench'. How many MVPs have ever volunteered to be a reserve? When Nurkic became healthy and coach Mike Malone wanted to experiment having him and Jokic in the same lineup, Jokic thought the pairing wasn't effective and asked Malone to let him come off the bench. Eventually, Denver traded Nurkic, who the team had drafted 25 spots ahead of the Joker.\n\n20. Already a Nuggets pioneer. He is not only the first MVP in franchise history, but Jokic is already the team's all-time leader in career double-doubles and triple-doubles.\n\n21. Leader. Jokic became the first player in NBA history to lead his team in points, rebounds and assists for four straight seasons.\n\n22. Water-polo aficionado. Jokic often pins the ball with one hand -- away from defenders -- and keeps his upper body straight when making passes. These are two unique techniques that likely stem from his upbringing around water polo, one of the top sports in Serbia.\n\n23. Deflections. For a player not known for his defense, Jokic's active hands allowed him to rank top five in total deflections (199) during his MVP season. Tracking data for deflections did not become available until 2016, but none of the five prior MVPs reached the feat during their respective award-winning campaigns. He finds ways to touch the ball.\n\n24. Touches. That brings us to this point. Nothing emphasizes Jokic's \"value\" to his team more than his gargantuan number of touches on offense. Denver's system is run through Jokic, who touched the ball 7,269 times this season, over a thousand more than the next player (Russell Westbrook, 6,192).\n\n26. Clutch. Jokic finished the season with 4.2 points in clutch situations, which is when the score is within five points in the final five minutes. The last time a center averaged at least four points in clutch time (min. 25 games) was when Hakeem Olajuwon did so in 1996-97.\n\n27. Double-digit dimes. In April, Jokic recorded his 81st career game with at least 10 assists, passing Wilt Chamberlain for the most such games in NBA history among centers.\n\n28. Horsepower. Jokic was once stuck between wanting to race horses or play basketball. In fact, as a pre-teen, he once quit basketball and left a game at halftime for a chariot horse race.\n\n29. Historic. Jokic is one of three players in NBA history to average at least 25 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists for a season, joining Oscar Robertson and Russell Westbrook.\n\n30. Didn't grow up watching the NBA. It wasn't until YouTube came into Jokic's life at age 14 that he discovered NBA talent. He began with watching highlights of Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan, then eventually drifted to the likes of Hakeem Olajuwon and Magic Johnson.\n\n31. No-look Nikola. Judging by the footwork and pass, those Olajuwon and Magic highlights stuck with him. The average MVP doesn't make this flashy of a pass when double teamed.\n\n32. Advanced metric king. Jokic ended his MVP campaign as the league leader in player efficiency rating (PER), win shares, offensive win shares, box plus-minus, offensive box plus-minus and value over replacement player (VORP).\n\n33. European star. Jokic is the first player from Serbia to win the league MVP award (much to the delight of fellow Serbian NBA players) and the third European to do so, joining Giannis Antetokounmpo and Nowitzki.\n\n34. Pot of gold. Jokic puts a rainbow arc on his shots like no other, and it often requires the camera to adjust.\n\n35. Young Olympian. As the youngest player on the Serbian National Team at the 2016 Summer Olympics, Jokic led the team in rebounds and helped secure a silver medal for his country.\n\n36. Elite company. This season Jokic became the first center with at least 50 points and 10 assists in a game since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on Jan. 19, 1975.\n\n37. Floaters. Another tool in Jokic's bag of tricks: Because opponents respect his perimeter shooting (39% this season), Jokic has mastered the pump-fake that allows him to drive in the lane and knock down silky floaters.\n\n38. Triple-doubles. Jokic logged his 50th career triple-double this season, joining four-time MVP Wilt Chamberlain as the only centers in history to reach such a milestone. It took Chamberlain 703 games, while Jokic accomplished the feat in 416.\n\n39. Mamba mentality. The last Most Valuable Player to suit up for every contest was Kobe Bryant during the 2007-08 season. Two years ago, Kobe gave Jokic a challenge: Win MVP.\n\n40. Big man back. At a time when the game began to drift away from big men, Jokic became the first center since Shaquille O'Neal to win the MVP award. \"Because of you, the big man is back,\" O'Neal told him.",

With Jokic leading the way, Denver finished as the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference with an overall record of 57-25.\n\nIn terms of advanced stats, Jokic led all NBA players in total win shares (17.0), Player Efficiency Rating (31.0), box score plus-minus (13.2) and Value over Replacement Player (10.6).\n\nJokic is the ninth player in NBA history to take home the award three separate times, and the first player since LeBron James to win three times in a four-year stretch.\n\nHere is a look at the eight other players in NBA history who have earned at least three MVPs.\n\nThe NBA record-holder for Most Valuable Player awards with six, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was an All-Star in each of his 20 seasons and the most dominant big man in the league throughout the 1970s.\n\nIt didn't take long for Abdul-Jabbar to make an impact after Milwaukee drafted him in 1969. After finishing third in MVP voting as a rookie in 1969-70, the 7-footer won the award in three of the next four seasons and five times over a seven-year span. Despite the impressive personal numbers, Abdul-Jabbar only won one NBA championship over his first 10 NBA seasons -- doing so alongside Oscar Robertson in 1970-71 in his second year with the Bucks.\n\nIt was Abdul-Jabbar's 11th season that brought him his sixth and final MVP, as well as his second championship, this time as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers. During the season, Kareem averaged 24.8 points, 10.8 rebounds, 4.5 assists and a league-high 3.4 blocks per game.\n\nThe second half of Abdul-Jabbar's career was almost the antithesis of his first 10 years. Playing for the Lakers, Kareem won five NBA titles from 1980-88 while Los Angeles won the Western Conference eight times across the decade.\n\nWhen Abdul-Jabbar retired in 1989, he did so as the NBA's all-time leader in points (38,387), field goals made (15,837) and minutes played (57,446). He still holds the latter two records to this day.\n\nThe NBA's first two-way star at center, Bill Russell won more titles during his career than anyone else (11) -- the final two as a player-coach -- and dominated the league throughout the 1960s with the Boston Celtics.\n\nLike Abdul-Jabbar, Russell earned his first MVP in his second season in 1957-58 while averaging 16.7 points and 22.7 rebounds per game. Ironically, this was the only year from 1957-1966 where the Celtics didn't win the NBA championship. They lost in the Finals to the St. Louis Hawks, who were led by Hall-of-Famer and two-time MVP Bob Pettit.\n\nFrom the start of the 1958-59 season to the end of 1964-65, Russell won four MVPs and averaged 16.6 points and a league-high 23.9 rebounds per game. And while blocks weren't kept as an official stat until 1973, many experts believe he averaged between six and eight per game, which would smash the current NBA record of 3.5 by Mark Eaton.\n\nOn top of his achievements as a player and coach, Russell is also considered an early civil rights pioneer in basketball. He is widely considered the first Black superstar in NBA history and was the first Black MVP in league history.\n\nHe is also responsible for organizing the first player boycott in league history after an October 1961 incident where Celtics players Sam Jones and Tom Sanders were refused service in a hotel cafe in Lexington, Ky., because they were Black.\n\nIn 1967, Russell joined Abdul-Jabbar, NFL running back Jim Brown and many others at an event called the Cleveland Summit where they voiced support for Muhammad Ali's decision not to serve in the Vietnam War.\n\nWidely considered basketball's GOAT (Greatest Of All Time), Michael Jordan won all five of his Most Valuable Player awards as a member of the Chicago Bulls. After earning All-Star honors in each of his first two seasons in the league, Jordan had his best scoring year in 1986-87 when he exploded for 37.1 points per game, the most by any player since Wilt Chamberlain averaged 44.8 in 1962-63.\n\nJordan earned his first MVP award in 1987-88 and finished among the top-three players in voting in each of the next two seasons, but things completely changed in 1990-91 when the superstar guard won his second MVP while leading the Bulls to their first NBA championship.\n\nChicago was the dynasty of the 1990s, winning three championships in a row on two separate occasions -- from 1991-93 and from 1996-98. Jordan was crowned the league's Most Valuable Player four times during the decade, including twice after taking a year away from the team to pursue a career in baseball. His final MVP came in his last year with the Bulls in 1997-98, when he averaged 28.7 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game and played all 82 regular season games for the first time since 1990-91.\n\nAfter three seasons away from the game, Jordan returned for two final years with the Washington Wizards. Playing at the ages of 39 and 40, he still managed to average 21.2 points, 5.9 rebounds and 4.4 assists per game.\n\nWhile many regard Jordan as the best scorer in NBA history, he is also one of the most underrated defensive players of all time. He was named the league's Defensive Player of the Year in 1987-88 and led the league in steals on three separate occasions up until his first retirement in 1993.\n\nJordan was also the majority owner of the Charlotte Hornets, formerly known as the Charlotte Bobcats, from 2010 to 2023. He bought the team from Robert Johnson, who was the first Black majority owner in league history in 2004.\n\nThe NBA leader in several per-game statistical categories, Wilt Chamberlain was the best player in the league from the moment he stepped on the floor as a rookie in 1959. In his first year with the Philadelphia Warriors in 1959-60, Chamberlain won league MVP honors after leading the NBA in points (37.6) and rebounds (27.0) per game.\n\nChamberlain wouldn't win MVP again until 1966-68, when he took home the award three years in a row, but he was the most statistically dominant player in the league throughout the 1960s. He led the NBA in scoring seven times in his first 10 seasons, including averaging an NBA-record 50.4 points per game in 1961-62. Despite doing that and averaging 24.3 rebounds per game, Wilt finished second that year in MVP voting behind Russell.\n\nArguably the most famous moment of Chamberlain's entire career came in March 1962, when he scored 100 points in a win over the New York Knicks. Wilt made 36-of-63 field goals in the game and was 28-of-32 from the free-throw line. Chamberlain's 100 points are still a record to this day for the most in a single game. The closest anyone has come was when Kobe Bryant scored 81 on the Raptors in January 2006.\n\nWhen he retired, Chamberlain did so as a 13-time All-Star, 11-time league leader in rebounds and a seven-time leader in points scored. He ranks first in NBA history in total rebounds with 23,924 -- which is over 2,000 more than the next closest player -- and seventh in league history in total points with 31,419.\n\nA little-known fact about Chamberlain is that he actually started his professional basketball career with the Harlem Globetrotters in 1958-59. Wilt left the University of Kansas after his junior year, but he wasn't able to play in the NBA yet because of a rule barring players from joining until after their college class had graduated. Chamberlain made $50,000 in his lone year with the Globetrotters and regularly returned to perform with the team after his retirement from the NBA.\n\nThe greatest player of the 2000s so far, LeBron James lived up to the hype as a high-school prodigy that jumped straight to the NBA in 2003. In his first five seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers, James won Rookie of the Year and was an All-Star four times.\n\nHe finally broke through to win his first MVP in 2008-09 while with the Cavaliers. That year, he averaged 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.2 assists per game while leading Cleveland all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals against the Orlando Magic. And despite winning MVP again the following season, LeBron famously took his \"talents to South Beach\" in the summer of 2010 by joining the Miami Heat.\n\nJames' first year in Miami (2010-11) was ultimately one to forget in the grand scheme of things, as he finished third in MVP voting and the Heat lost the NBA Finals to the Dallas Mavericks. But the next two years saw LeBron win his final two Most Valuable Player awards while also winning his first two titles and first two Finals MVPs. During his four-year stretch with the Heat, he averaged 26.9 points, 7.6 rebounds and 6.4 assists per game while shooting 54.3% from the field.\n\nLeBron's homecoming to Cleveland commenced in the summer of 2014, and the next four years saw James lead the Cavs to four-straight Finals appearances. In 2016, Cleveland did the improbable by upsetting the Golden State Warriors -- who won 73 games during the regular season -- in the NBA Finals. In the seven-game series, LeBron averaged 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds and 8.9 assists per game and was named Finals MVP.\n\nAfter the 2017-18 season, James signed a free-agent deal with the Lakers, and this season was his sixth in Los Angeles. In 2019-20, LeBron led the Lakers to an NBA Finals win over the Denver Nuggets. That season's playoffs were played in the Bubble, a biosecure facility at Walt Disney World in Florida, to protect players from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDuring the 2023-24 season, LeBron broke Abdul-Jabbar's record for total points in a career. He is the only player in league history to score at least 40,000 points.\n\nThe lynchpin of the \"Showtime\" Lakers, Magic Johnson's career was full of flashy passes and transition wizardry, but he was also the heart of his Los Angeles team throughout the 1980s.\n\nJohnson was thrust into the fire immediately to start his career, as he had to start at center for an injured Abdul-Jabbar in Game 6 of the 1980 NBA Finals against the Philadelphia 76ers. Playing out of position, the 6-foot-9 Johnson totaled 42 points, 15 assists and 12 rebounds to clinch the title for the Lakers. He earned Finals MVP honors for his troubles.\n\nAfter Johnson's rookie year, an injured knee caused him to miss 45 games during the 1980-81 season. But he came back strong the next season and helped lead Los Angeles to five straight Finals appearances and two NBA titles.\n\nJohnson won his first MVP in 1986-87 after averaging 23,9 points, 12.2 assists and 6.3 rebounds per game during the regular season. He also won Finals MVP that season after leading the Lakers to a 4-2 series win over the Celtics.\n\nMagic won three more titles from 1988-91 and the MVP award in 1990, but his career was abruptly halted after the 1990-91 season after he was diagnosed with HIV. Johnson missed each of the next four seasons but did return for one final year in 1995-96, when he played 32 games and averaged 14.6 points, 6.9 assists and 5.7 rebounds per game.\n\nKnown as \"The Hick from French Lick,\" Larry Bird debuted in the NBA the same season as Johnson, and their careers were inextricably linked for the next decade after meeting in the 1979 NCAA Tournament Finals as members of Indiana State and Michigan State, respectively.\n\nKnown as one of the best shooters in NBA history, Bird finished top five in MVP voting in each of his first nine seasons in the league, winning the award three years in a row from 1984-1986. During that three-year stretch, Bird averaged 26.2 points, 10.1 rebounds and 6.7 assists per game while shooting 50.4% from the field.\n\nDuring Bird's career, the Celtics made the NBA Finals five times in seven years from 1981-87. They won the championship three times during that span (1981, 1984 and 1986), and Bird won the Finals MVP award in 1984 and 1986.\n\nBird was also a fairly underrated defender. While he wasn't the most agile one-on-one defender, his basketball IQ was off the charts and he excelled at help defense. He was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team three times in his career.\n\nOne of the most underrated players in NBA history, Moses Malone played his first two professional seasons in the ABA before the two leagues merged in 1976.\n\nMalone spent his first six seasons in Houston, where he averaged 23.9 points, 14.9 rebounds and 1.6 blocks per game while shooting 51.4% from the floor. He won the MVP award twice during that span in 1979 and 1982, though the Rockets only made the Finals once -- when they lost 4-2 to the Celtics in 1981.\n\nAfter the 1981-82 season, Malone signed as a free agent with the Philadelphia 76ers, who were coming off a loss to the Lakers in the Finals. During his first year in Philadelphia, Malone won his third and final MVP award while averaging 24.5 points, 15.3 rebounds and 2.0 blocks per game. The 76ers swept the Lakers in the 1983 Finals against the Lakers, and Malone was named Finals MVP for his contributions.\n\nMalone played the next three seasons in Philadelphia and led the league in rebounding on two separate occasions. He was ultimately traded to the Washington Bullets after the 1985-86 seasons as Philly decided to build around Charles Barkley. After two All-Star seasons with the Bullets, Malone made his last All-Star team in 1988 while playing for the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nMalone's numbers dropped off dramatically after the 1991-92 season, as a herniated disc in his back caused him to miss the majority of 1992-93 season. He closed out his career by playing 17 games for the Spurs in 1994-95 as a backup to David Robinson.\n\nIn his 20-year career, Malone averaged 20.3 points and 12.3 rebounds per game. He led the league in boards six times, was a two-time All-Defensive team member and an eight-time All-NBA honoree.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting

The Denver Nuggets player equals the three awards of Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and Moses Malone to be among the best in history of the NBA.\n\nThe Serbian asserted his status as favorite and achieved 926 points in the final vote. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Oklahoma City Thunder), who finished second, obtained 640 votes, while former Madrid player Luka Doncic (Dallas Mavericks), third, achieved 566 points. In addition to the three of them, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jalen Brunson, Jayson Tatum, Anthony Edwards, Domantas Sabonis and Kevin Durant also received votes for MVP.\n\nJokic's numbers leave little doubt about his third MVP in the last four years. The Joker has averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9 assists this season. Likewise, he has recorded 68 double-doubles and 25 triple-doubles. His team's record has also helped, as the Nuggets have finished the regular season in second place, with 57 wins and 25 losses.\n\nThe third award places him among the best in history, since above him are only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, with six MVPs, Michael Jordan and Bill Russell, with five, and Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James, with four. The next on this list full of legends is Nikola Jokic, who still has several years left at the highest level.\n\n\"When I won the MVP the first time I thought it was cool. When I won the second one, the list got shorter (players with more MVPs than him). Now, with the third, the list is even shorter. I'm just happy to be part of this group. \"The Joker joked after matching Bird, Magic and Moses Malone.\n\n\"We have to start with my teammates, without them I can't do anything. Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, strength coaches, development coaches... It's all one big circle. But I can't be what I am without them,\" commented Jokic, in gratitude to all the people who have accompanied him this season.\n\nThe Nuggets player also responded elegantly to Shaquille O'Neal, who said that Shai deserved to win the MVP: \"There are many players who deserve the MVP. It's probably the details and the little things that decide it.\"\n\nDespite Jokic's historic third MVP, the party is postponed in Denver, since ahead are the Conference semifinals, where the Colorado team is trailing on the scoreboard against the Wolves (0-2). The Minnesota team has won both matches at the Ball Arena, which forces Michael Malone's team to win two away games to regain the home court factor.\n\nThe Knicks are closer to the Conference Final after defeating the Indiana Pacers 130-121 at Madison Square Garden. Jalen Brunson, fifth in the MVP voting, scored 24 of his 29 points after halftime, after not playing in the second quarter due to injury.\n\nIn addition to the former Dallas player, the New York team featured OG Anunoby, with 28 points, DiVincenzo, also with 28, and Josh Hart, who had 19 points and 15 rebounds in 48 minutes of play. For his part, Haliburton shone in Indiana, but his 34 points were not enough to defeat the Knicks on the way to their first Conference Finals in 24 years.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net",

Denver would tie for the best record in the Western Conference, despite point guard Jamal Murray missing 23 games.\n\nThe 29-year-old Serbian passed NBA greats Jason Kidd and Lebron James in triple-doubles this season, moving into fourth-most all-time with 130. He also became the youngest player in league history to record at least 13,000 points, 6,000 rebounds, and 4,000 assists.\n\nDallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic and Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander were the other finalists for the award. The MVP is awarded based on performance during the regular season.\n\nJokic won his first MVP in 2020-21, when he earned 91 of the 100 first-place votes for the award. He earned a second straight MVP honor in 2021-22, earning 65 first-place votes. Joel Embiid finished second in the voting in both years.\n\nEmbiid won the award last year, with Jokic finishing in second.\n\nAs Jokic is crowned with the league's highest individual honor again, the defending-champion Nuggets find themselves in a precarious situation in the postseason.

Shaq congratulated Jokic, before essentially saying he didn't deserve it.\n\n\"You know I love you. You're the best player in the league. I want to congratulate you, but I want you to hear it from me first: I thought SGA should have been the MVP. That's no disrespect to you.\"\n\nThis clearly caught Jokic off-guard, as his smile transformed to a black stare as O'Neal rained on his parade.\n\nJokic won with 79 first place votes, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander finishing second with 15 votes -- followed by the four Dallas media members (presumably) who picked Luka Doncic to be MVP. It came after weeks of speculation had SGA being on the inside track for the award.\n\nIt was an interesting call. If we look at the head-to-head between SGA and Joker this season it's a serious toss-up between who was the best individual player.\n\nNikola Jokic: 26.4 pts (.583 FG%), 12.4 rebs, 9.0 ast -- 57-25 record with Nuggets\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander: 30.1 pts (.535 FG%), 5.5 rebs, 6.6 ast -- 57-25 record with Thunder\n\nThe rub comes anecdotally. This was more-or-less identical statistically to Jokic's numbers when he won in 2020-21, but more importantly he's playing on a championship team. There's no doubt that he's the most critical part of the Nuggets, but he essentially put in another brilliant season on one of the NBA's best teams, whereas SGA lifted the Thunder from 10th in the West, to first -- and team improvement has been a significant factor in past MVP votes.\n\nIn a lot of ways this feels like the make-good for voters picking Joel Embiid over Jokic in 2022-23, which is leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth. Jokic carried the Nuggets to their first championship in franchise history after Embiid got the award, and it left many people believing it should have been Jokic's MVP all along.\n\nThat said, no matter what Shaq believes, it's pretty ridiculous to tell Jokic this on live TV -- whether you believe it or not. Now, you could say it was honorable of O'Neal to be up-front with Joker, knowing he was going to advocate for SGA, but he could have sent him a text message. He could have talked with him off the air.\n\nThe result, as aired, was that Shaq came off as being extraordinarily bitter at Jokic winning MVP -- and told him. This was even more bizarre after preceding it by calling Joker the best player in the NBA.\n\nIt was enough that even Ernie Johnson seemed mad, and Ernie rarely gets mad.\n\nThere was a lot of hedging by Shaq here. Lots of \"taking nothing away from Jokic\" talk, but that's exactly what he did. It's not like Jokic was out here campaigning the voters to be the MVP for a third time, they simply felt he deserved it -- and SGA won't be the last borderline player to be snubbed in end of season awards.\n\nIt was fine of Shaq to advocate for his pick, but not in this way or at this time.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_dator@sbnation.com", "name": "James Dator", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KK_Joker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KK Joker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Johnson_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ernie Johnson Jr."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BnMTl-oxa3cRzteiHDnDoClqreU=/0x76:2804x1478/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25440467/Screen_Shot_2024_05_09_at_12.18.41_PM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The Denver Nuggets center beat out fellow finalists Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder and Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks for the award.\n\nOne MVP is enough to solidify someone's legacy, a second puts a player in rarified air and a third places a player in even more exclusive company. All 14 players with multiple MVPs before Jokic were named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. In addition, they are all either in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame or headed there once their playing days are finished.\n\nHere's a look at the players with the most NBA MVPs now that Jokic has collected his third:\n\n1971, 1972, 1974, 1976, 1977, 1980\n\nAbdul-Jabbar won three of his MVPs with the Milwaukee Bucks and three more with the Los Angeles Lakers. Along with being the all-time leader in MVP awards, the legendary center remained the league's all-time leading scorer up until 2023.\n\n1958, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1965\n\nRussell was the first NBA player to win three straight MVPs. Making those seasons better? His Boston Celtics won the NBA Finals in each of those years, helping him accumulate an insurmountable 11 championships as a player.\n\n1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, 1998\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Jordan dominated MVP voting in the 1990s considering his Chicago Bulls did the same throughout the decade. His first MVP came a few years prior, when he averaged 35.0 points, 5.9 assists, 5.5 rebounds and 3.2 steals per game in 1987-88, just his fourth NBA season.\n\n1960, 1966, 1967, 1968\n\nChamberlain was the second player to three-peat as MVP. If not for Russell, Chamberlain could be even higher on this list. The Philadelphia and San Francisco Warriors center didn't win MVP in seasons where he averaged 50.4 and 44.8 points per game, as the league handed the award to his Celtics counterpart.\n\n2009, 2010, 2012, 2013\n\nJames' longtime status as the best player in basketball netted him four MVPs over a five-year stretch. Despite leading the Cleveland Cavaliers and Lakers to championships since his last MVP, he has not taken home the award since his days with the Miami Heat.\n\n1979, 1982, 1983\n\nMoses Malone started a stretch in which three marquee players took home nine of 12 MVPs. He won his first two awards with the Houston Rockets before winning his third in his first season with the Philadelphia 76ers, who won the 1983 NBA Finals.\n\n1984, 1985, 1986\n\nBird took the torch from Moses Malone starting in 1984. The Celtics forward became the most recent player to collect three straight MVPs, doing so from 1984 to 1986 as Boston won two championships.\n\n1987, 1989, 1990\n\nIn 1987, Bird's rival took the torch. Johnson won three MVPs from 1987 to 1990 but was unable to win all three in consecutive seasons. Instead, Johnson's Lakers repeated as champions in 1987 and 1988.\n\n2021, 2022, 2024\n\nJokic became the ninth player to be named MVP three times. After winning the season-long award in 2020-21 and 2021-22, Jokic won a different MVP award in 2023: NBA Finals MVP. He got back on the board for NBA MVP in 2023-24.\n\n1956, 1959\n\nPettit made history as the first MVP in NBA history, taking home the honor in 1956. After a pair of Celtics earned the award in 1957 and 1958, the St. Louis Hawks big man became the first two-time MVP in 1959.\n\n1997, 1999\n\nKarl Malone alternated MVPs with Jordan from 1996 to 1999, though Jordan got the last laugh. The Bulls beat Malone's Jazz in consecutive NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998, with Jordan citing Malone's 1997 MVP as fuel for Chicago's championship victory.\n\n2002, 2003\n\nDuncan was the first of six players to win multiple MVPs in the 21st century, and they all did it in consecutive seasons. The power forward capped off his second MVP season by leading the San Antonio Spurs to a 2003 Finals triumph over the New Jersey Nets.\n\n2005, 2006\n\nSpeaking of the Nets, their former head coach has two MVPs in his trophy room. Despite owning the two lowest-scoring seasons for an MVP since Wes Unseld in 1969, Nash led the NBA in assists in 2005 and 2006 on his way to the award.\n\n2015, 2016\n\nCurry's first MVP came in 2015, as he won his first NBA title with the Warriors. His second one was even more impressive, leading Golden State to an unprecedented 73-9 regular season record and becoming the first unanimous MVP in league history.\n\n2019, 2020\n\nAntetokounmpo was a two-time MVP at age 25, earning the award in 2019 and 2020. The Greek Freak put together his greatest accomplishment in 2021, though, leading the Bucks to their first title since 1971, which also happened to be Abdul-Jabbar's first MVP season.", "source":

But not as deserving as Mavericks superstar Doncic, whose historic season for the ages inexplicably was deemed not good enough.\n\nFirst player in NBA history to average at least 33 points (a league-leading 33.9), nine assists (9.8, second in the NBA) and nine rebounds (9.2): Not good enough.\n\nHad the highest average of combined points, rebounds and assists (52.9) since the 1971-72 season MVP Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 56.0; and the highest combined points and points created from assists (57.2) in history: Not good enough.\n\nHoisted an injury-ravaged Mavericks team onto his back for the first half of the season; ultimately led them to 50 victories and went 46-24 when he played: Not good enough.\n\nLed the league in 30-point triple-doubles (16), 35-point triple-doubles (11), 40-point triple-doubles (two) and produced the season's best singular performance by dropping 73 points on Atlanta, fourth-most in history: Not good enough.\n\nTim Reynolds, respected longtime Associated Press NBA reporter and fellow awards voter, summed up the Doncic paradox with this Wednesday morning tweet:\n\n\"Expect some outrage tonight if/when Luka Doncic doesn't win MVP after posting the first season in NBA history of averaging 33, 9 and 9. It's a Wilt-type stat oddity.\n\n\"Wilt averaged at least 34 points and 22 rebounds in five consecutive seasons and didn't win MVP in any of them.\"\n\nThere are other factoids that show Doncic's season to be superior -- and more valuable -- compared with Jokic's but numbers aren't the only unfortunate part of this outcome for those of us who watched virtually every pass, dribble and shot of Doncic's 70 games played.\n\nBy all indications, Jokic began this season as the heavy favorite to win MVP, largely based on his having led Denver to its first NBA title last June.\n\nJokic maintained that status even when Oklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander entered the MVP conversation by midseason and Doncic earned West Player of the Month awards in February and March.\n\nLook, I get it. Voting for end-of-season awards is a privilege and a responsibility, one I take seriously. No matter which team I cover, no matter how much more I get to watch a particular player (Doncic) than another (Jokic), I'm not going to cast a vote that I don't truly believe is deserved.\n\nAs of mid-March, with a month left in the season, I would have voted for Jokic. Doncic had checked most of the boxes for being a leading MVP candidate, except for a vital one: team success. As of March 16, the Mavericks were eighth in the West and on a 45-victory pace.\n\nNo matter how dominant a player's numbers are, there's nothing all that valuable about piling up stats for a team that is clawing to avoid the play-in tournament.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nThe Mavericks' 16-2 run from March 7 to April 10 clinched my vote for Doncic, but did little to change the larger narrative, especially among national TV analysts, that Jokic had the MVP locked up.\n\nOn April 10 in Miami, before Dallas' third-to-last game and what would be Doncic's last of the regular season, Mavericks players and staff wore gray \"Pravi MVP\" T-shirts -- \"pravi\" being Slovenian for \"real\" or \"true.\"\n\n\"I wish we had worn these in March,\" coach Jason Kidd said that night, adding that he feared that MVP voters and fans were taking Doncic's greatness for granted because he makes the game look too easy.\n\n\"We've joked around that we might have to do the Larry Bird game and play left-handed. But he might make that look easy, too.\"\n\nKidd, unfortunately, was correct. It seems many of the 100 MVP voters made up their mind before Dallas' 16-2 run, never mind that it essentially encompassed the last quarter of the season.\n\nPut it this way: If Jokic and Doncic lined up for a 100-meter race, Jokic got a 10-meter head start because of Denver's 2023 title -- and the finish line was moved up 10 meters because it appears many voters had made up their minds.\n\nIf Wednesday evening's vote reveal was dismaying to Mavericks fans, imagine how Doncic feels. Last summer he ramped up his training, hired a body team and chef, carried the short-handed Mavericks into January and produced a season for the ages.\n\nNot good enough.\n\nMy MVP ballot\n\n1.

Nikola Jokic, Nuggets trying to defy recent history as they face 0-2 deficit vs. Wolves - CBSSports.com", "body": "The league's MVP winners have made it out of the second round only once over the past five years Getty Images\n\nTo say Game 3 between the Nuggets and Timberwolves on Friday is a must-win for Denver would be the understatement of the year. There were some people -- like yours truly -- who picked the Wolves to beat the Nuggets, but no one could've predicted we'd be throwing around the word \"sweep\" just two games into this heavyweight NBA playoff series. But that's what the Nuggets are up against, and not only are they hoping to avoid a sweep, but they're also looking to defy some recent history that suggests there could be a curse with winning the MVP award.\n\nOf the past five MVP winners, only one of them has advanced past the second round of the playoffs. With Nikola Jokic's Nuggets staring at an 0-2 deficit after he earned his third MVP award earlier this week, he's on the brink of becoming the fifth straight in the past six years.\n\nNBA MVP playoff successYearPlayerPlayoff result\n\n2023-24\n\nNikola Jokic\n\n?\n\n2022-23\n\nJoel Embiid\n\nLost in second round\n\n2021-22\n\nNikola Jokic\n\nLost in second round\n\n2020-21\n\nNikola Jokic\n\nLost in second round\n\n2019-20\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo\n\nLost in Eastern Conference finals\n\nEven more interestingly, in each of the three years that Jokic has won MVP, his team has not made it out of the second round of the playoffs. When the Nuggets won an NBA championship last season, he finished second in voting behind Joel Embiid. Some may see that as an indictment of Jokic, but the Serbian big man is the only MVP since 1984 who has never had any teammates earn All-Star, All-NBA or All-Defensive honors (h/t Tom Haberstroh).\n\nDigging even deeper into the numbers, according to CBS Sports' senior research editor Doug Clawson, if Jokic and Denver get bounced by the Timberwolves in the second round, it will extend the record for most consecutive seasons an MVP hasn't made the conference finals. It's currently at five seasons, with Giannis Antetokounmpo being the last one to do so in 2019 when he and the Bucks fell to the eventual champion Toronto Raptors.\n\nIt would also extend the current record of seven consecutive seasons since an MVP has taken his team to the NBA Finals, with Stephen Curry being the last to do so in 2016. And if Denver loses this round or even in the conference finals if they're able to overcome this deficit, it would break the record for most consecutive seasons of an MVP not winning an NBA title, with Curry also being the last to do that in 2015 when the Warriors won it all. Currently, there are two separate eight-season streaks where an MVP hasn't won a championship in the same season, from 2004-11, and from 1972-79. If Jokic and the Nuggets don't repeat as champions this would set the current streak over the edge to nine consecutive seasons.\n\nLast MVP to...Playoff resultPlayer (Year)\n\nMake conference finals\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo (2019)\n\nMake NBA Finals\n\nStephen Curry (2016)\n\nWin NBA Finals\n\nStephen Curry (2015)\n\nCasting an even wider net, over the past 20 years, only three MVP winners have won an NBA championship, with Curry doing it in 2015 and LeBron James doing it in back-to-back years in 2012 and 2013.\n\nSo what does all this mean? In the grand scheme of things not much to the Nuggets. Worrying trend or not, they've simply been outplayed by the Timberwolves. All the length in the frontcourt is bothering Jokic, Jamal Murray looks downright flustered against lockdown defenders in Jaden McDaniels and Nickiel Alexander-Walker, and through two games Denver has failed to crack the 100-point mark. Anthony Edwards looks unstoppable against the Nuggets, regardless of who's in front of him, and the Wolves look like a team perfectly assembled to take down Denver.\n\nBut at the very least, while this likely doesn't matter to the Nuggets, this trend shows how winning the MVP in the regular season doesn't equate to automatic postseason success, at least recently.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jasmyn_wimbish@cbssports.com", "name": "Jasmyn Wimbish", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaden_McDaniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaden McDaniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/09/f38e7372-a597-4a66-838b-54b0625c67c8/thumbnail/1200x675/d9ae9c591c6e052a5dad365126c3f95f/jokic-nuggets-g2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

That's how this thing works. League MVPs are named each season, and every player in the NBA will have to rewrite their resumes next year to be awarded the MVP.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that Jokic received 79 first-place votes for MVP while Gilgeous-Alexander received the second most, with 15.\n\nShaq calling Gilgeous-Alexander a stat stuffer while comparing him to Jokic is also laughable - which Ernie Johnson rightfully called him out for - given that nobody puts up numbers quite like the Denver big man.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander finished the regular season averaging 30.1 points, 6.2 assists, and 5.5 rebounds. Jokic finished the campaign averaging 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 9.0 assists per contest.\n\nO'Neal, who is paid to watch and talk about the NBA, may not have paid too close attention to the league standings throughout the year, either.

He earned 79 first-place votes to 15 first-place votes for the runner-up, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nFor his part, O'Neal was not at all happy with the results. He believed that Gilgeous-Alexander should have won MVP, and let it be known ... during his interview with Jokic.

I thought SGA should have won MVP. That's no disrespect to you.\"\n\nJokic mostly laughed off O'Neal's comments, saying, \"That's your opinion,\" before adding that he was just joking. But O'Neal was still criticized for the comments. Many believed that O'Neal had taken away from Jokic's moment and should have expessed his opinion at a more appropriate time and place. Others thought that it was just harmless banter, especially since O'Neal and Jokic have historically been friendly with each other.\n\nFor what it is worth, Jokic's Nuggets finished with the exact same record as Gilgeous-Alexander's Thunder this season (57-25), but the Thunder got the No. 1 seed in the West thanks to a tiebreaker. While Jokic's numbers were more impressive (26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 9.0 assists per game), many thought that Gilgeous-Alexander did a better job leading a young, dark-horse Thunder team to the No. 1 seed in the West.\n\nOn O'Neal's end, his reputation probably didn't do him any favors when it came to the public perception of his comments.

He hoped SGA would use the perceived snub as fuel to win a championship.\n\n\"No disrespect to Joker, but me personally, I would have given it to Shai,\" Shaq declared.\n\nO'Neal said the same thing during an interview with Jokic, who didn't seem to mind.\n\n\"We don't judge people here, so that's fine.

I think I'm not going to take (a) spot from a young guy and put the franchise down,\" the 29-year-old Jokic said. \"As long as I can play at a high level and help the team, I think I'm going to play until then.\"\n\nTwenty seasons of Joker ball sounds pretty dang good to the rest of us, if you don't mind.\n\nBut 18 (like Hakeem Olajuwon) or 19 (like Tim Duncan) would do.\n\nKareem. Russell. Jordan. Wilt. LeBron. Bird. Moses Malone. Magic. In a game driven by stars more than the other games, those are the men with three-plus MVP awards to their name.\n\nAnd Joker.\n\nThe others thrived in the bright lights of New York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, L.A. Jokic is making history in Colorado and, boy, does he fit in here. True to form, Jokic shrugged when asked what it meant to have his family at Ball Arena: \"I didn't invite them. They just show up.\"\n\nQuestions about his legacy might as well be another red scratch down his tree-trunk arms. He loathes them. But Joker's legacy, in his mind at the moment, concerns his family.\n\n\"Hopefully (one day) I can talk a lot of trash to my nephews,\" he said. \"I'm going to be a cool grandpa.\"\n\nNone of this is meant to dismiss the Nuggets' 0-2 deficit to the Timberwolves in a Western Conference semifinal. The Nuggets just played the worst playoff game in the Jokic era, a 106-80 loss that showed a Nuggets team that knows it is not good enough to survive the T-Wolves.\n\nAthletes always know, and the Nuggets know.\n\n\"Do these guys believe?\" Michael Malone said prior to Game 3 in Minneapolis. \"They say they do. But we'll find out Friday night.\"\n\nBut even a postseason meltdown can't overshadow what Jokic has done or is going to do. The young man turns 30 next February.\n\nJokic is still evolving, as a player and as a humble representative of the city he calls \"a second home.\"\n\nSign Up for Pikes Peak 5 Game analysis and insights from The Gazette sports staff including columns by Woody Paige and Paul Klee.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Featured Local Savings\n\nAt first he shied away from the combative MVP conversation that consumes the NBA season.\n\n\"I can control it, but I cannot control it,\" Jokic said.\n\nBut his actions off the court suggest a man who's embraced the spotlight -- to a degree. He agreed to appear in a hotels.com commercial with teammate Peyton Watson and, of course, a miniature horse. He finally has his own sneaker, the Big3 Future High from 361. He chose to sign with the brand, in part, because he viewed it as an up-and-coming company.\n\n\"Maybe I can help them, too, in some ways,\" Jokic says.\n\nThis season he led the Nuggets in points, rebounds, assists, steals, minutes played and one-liners. He won the Michael Jordan Trophy -- the new name for the MVP award -- by a solid chunk. His 79 first-place votes cleared Oklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (15) and close friend Luka Doncic (four) of Dallas. Anthony Edwards finished seventh in voting.\n\nYes, the young fellas are coming for Joker's throne. Fair warning: Jokic is a load to move.\n\n\"To be honest I liked last year when I didn't get it and then we won a championship much better,\" Jokic said.\n\nThere are myriad ways to explain and marvel at Joker ball, but you've read all about and witnessed them for nine seasons now. The underappreciated one is the greatest of abilities -- reliability.\n\nHe's averaged 75 (out of 82) games per season. Jokic skipped the load-management memo.\n\n\"There has to be times when he's tired. And he's still running the court every time,\" Nuggets general manager Calvin Booth told me the other day. \"And he's still making tough shots that a lot of people wouldn't make when they're dead tired. His resilience and toughness are the things that stand out the most.\"\n\nWhile it's an unusual gait alongside the best athletes in the world, Joker can run forever.\n\nHere's hoping he will play here forever -- like Russell in Boston, Magic in Los Angeles, Duncan in San Antonio. Or Elway and Sakic here.\n\n\"This is going to be my second home. Hopefully I'm going to come here after I finish my career and still have fans here,\" Jokic said.\n\nWash Park has been a Jokic family staple since he arrived as a pudgy 20-year-old from Sombor, Serbia, in the fall of 2015. Back then he would play pickup with his two older brothers, wrestling matches disguised as basketball games. Now it's to stroll by the south lake with his pride and joy, daughter Ognjena, who turns 3 next September.\n\n\"I'm hanging in Washington Park and everybody is treating me like they're really respectful. Nobody's really... aggressively bugging me,\" he said. \"Does that make sense?\"\n\nSure does.

Victor Wembanyama took home Rookie of the Year, Rudy Gobert earned Defensive Player of the Year, Naz Reid won Sixth Man of the Year, Tyrese Maxey won Most Improved Player, and Mark Daigneault won Coach of the Year, leaving the most contentious awards race for last.\n\nNikola Jokic, Luka Doncic, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander were the three finalists, and all had strong cases. SGA was the best player on the West's best team, putting up astronomical numbers on offense while providing the best defensive impact of the top MVP candidates. Doncic made a late charge for the award, as he had the best second half of the finalists to help the Mavs earn the 5-seed in the West. Jokic, meanwhile, put forth another preposterous regular season and, fresh off a championship, had gotten rid of any lingering questions about his impact on winning at the highest level.\n\nUltimately, the voters chose Jokic, as the Nuggets star picked up his third MVP in the last four years.\n\nJokic averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 9.0 assists per game on 58.3/35.0/81.7 shooting splits, leading the Nuggets to the 2-seed in the West. The timing of the announcement was maybe not the best to get a big reaction from the star center, as he and the Nuggets have had their hands full with the Wolves, going down 2-0 in the first two games in Denver.

With Jokic giving his full attention, O'Neal told him that he would have voted for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander as the MVP and that he deserved the award more than the Nuggets superstar.\n\n\"You know I love you. You're the best player in the league. I want to congratulate you,\" said Shaq. \"But I want you to hear it from me first; I thought that SGA should have been the MVP, that's no disrespect to you.\"\n\nJokic did fire back a little with a quick retort, but he otherwise seemed unbothered by the comment, which is fitting for his MO as a natural and reserved superstar.\n\n\"Thank you Shaq, we don't judge people here so that's fine, it's your opinion,\" said Jokic with a laugh.\n\nYou have to credit Shaq for his honesty here, and Nikola handled it pretty well, considering he was put on the spot on national television. O'Neal probably had an innocent intent, but the statement came off as abrasive and rude to many fans who felt that he crossed the line.\n\nWhile the court of public opinion has been harsh on Shaq tonight, it should be noted that he has this treatment with every modern player. As he's stated before, his way of spreading the love is to push you as a player and he's never going to mince words about what he sees on the court.\n\nOf course, since O'Neal doesn't have an MVP vote, his opinion did not get factored into this year's debate. Of course, O'Neal is not the only one to feel that Shai deserved MVP, but he clearly falls into the minority given how overwhelming the support was for Jokic in the polls.\n\nNikola Jokic's Legacy Is On The Line\n\nAs an NBA champion, 3x MVP, 6x All-Star, and 5x All-NBA player, Nikola Jokic is already on track to be one of the greatest players ever. At 29 years old, he's arguably got the best resume in the league of anyone not named LeBron James or Stephen Curry.\n\nRegarding this year's MVP race, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had a solid case to win, and he's following up on his performance with a dominant post-season. Jokic managed to win over the voters with his sheer impact and efficiency on the court and now he's among elite company as a 3x MVP winner.\n\nBut even after all he's done, The Joker's legacy could take a dark turn if the Nuggets lose in 4 or 5 to the Timberwolves. After losing Game 2 in epic fashion on Monday, Jokic looked completely lost and defeated with no answers on how to turn the tide.\n\nIf they lose now, like this, the haters and doubters will come out in full force and Jokic's place as the best in the league will be challenged like never before. How he responds this upcoming summer will determine a lot about how his career is remembered and it could make or break his all-time legacy.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nico_martinez@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Nico Martinez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Drills_and_Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Drills and Coaching", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://fadeawayworld.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4Nzc2NzA0MDA3Njc3NzAz/jokaq.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

O'Neal included \"The Joker\" even before the Denver Nuggets superstar won the championship.\n\nWhen Jokic eventually led the Nuggets to its first franchise crown at the expense of the Miami Heat, O'Neal was proud. He was convinced that his group just got more illustrious and exclusive with the player he considered the best in the NBA.\n\nThis year, Nikola Jokic was once again named the regular-season MVP (for the third time in the last four years). Only Joel Embiid's win last season prevented it from a four-year romp by the quiet and unassuming Serbian. Shaquille O'Neal had this to say to Jokic after the award was announced:\n\n\"Joker [Jokic], as president of the 'Big Man Alliance,' you're the vice president of the 'Big Man Alliance,' you know I love you, the best player in the league. I wanna congratulate you but I want you to hear from me first, I thought that SGA [Gilgeous-Alexander] should have been the MVP. That's no disrespect to you and congratulations.\"\n\nO'Neal's comment was a little bit confusing. He said Nikola Jokic was the \"best player in the league,\" but he thought Shai Gilgeous-Alexander should have won MVP. The LA Lakers legend has often said that the award should go to the best player in the NBA so his statement was a bit of a contradiction.\n\nJokic took it in a stride and subtlety pushed back:\n\n\"Thank you Shaq, we don't judge people here. That's fine, it's your opinion.\"\n\nNikola Jokic did concede that SGA and a few others deserved to go home with the Michael Jordan Trophy. \"The Joker\" insisted that the difference was in the \"details\" and the \"small things.\" He was happy that he won the award, but he was more concerned about where the Denver Nuggets are right now in the playoffs.\n\nFor Shaquille O'Neal, the OKC Thunder guard was more deserving as Oklahoma topped the Western Conference over Jokic's Nuggets. He said he didn't want to \"rain on people's parades\" and that he was \"not happy\" with the result.\n\nNikola Jokic tells Shaquille O'Neal his attention is only on the Timberwolves\n\nThe Denver Nuggets stunningly lost back-to-back games at home, a place where they often run their opponents to the ground. Game 2 of the series was even more embarrassing for Nikola Jokic and Co. as Rudy Gobert did not play and still Minnesota whipped them 106-80. A win by the Timberwolves on Friday will make it nearly impossible for the Nuggets to retain their title.\n\nJokic had a matter-of-fact answer to Shaquille O'Neal regarding his focus and Denver's goal:\n\n\"We had a tough stretch, we lost two games at home against Minnesota. Tomorrow we leave and we're going to Minnesota to try [and] get back the series to Denver.\"\n\nO'Neal wasn't happy Jokic took home another MVP trophy, but the Serbian did not seem like he cared about others' opinions about the win. He only has his sights on the Timberwolves as the Nuggets desperately hope to break through against their opponents.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_macasero@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Michael Macasero", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Awards", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Awards", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/ca192-17152166603048-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5372549019607844, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won it six times, Bill Russell and Michael Jordan each won five, Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won four, and Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are the other three-time winners.", "source": {"uri": "nationalpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moses Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilt_Chamberlain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wilt Chamberlain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 53}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-02", "dateEnd": "-03-04", "textStart": 873, "textEnd": 880}], "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe NBA world isn't in agreement that Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic should have been named league MVP.\n\nMany NBA experts and NBA fans are upset that he won the award and thought that Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder should have won the award.\n\nOn Thursday's episode of ESPN's Get Up, Andraya Carter made a case for SGA.\n\nCarter's case is that Alexander led the league's youngest team to the No. 1 seed in the West while averaging 30 points per game. He was also third in points per game, first in 30-point games, and tied for first in steals per game.\n\n\"It's not even close,\" says Carter. \"I think it's an MVP season.\"\n\nAfter he was awarded MVP, Jokic said that although he was honored to win his third MVP, he'd rather win another championship.\n\nThe controversy has many NBA fans and experts questioning the MVP voting process. But when you look at Jokic's stats, you can't really make an argument against him.\n\nJockic averaged almost a triple-double this season with 27 points, 12 rebounds, and nine assists. Alexander will have plenty of years ahead for him to win a league MVP and, like Jockic, he is probably more interested in winning an NBA championship than an MVP trophy.", "source": {"uri": "thecomeback.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Comeback"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stacey_mickles@thecomeback.com", "name": "Stacey Mickles", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont\u00e9_Morris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mont\u00e9 Morris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_One_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capital One Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Wizards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Wizards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn1.thecomeback.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/19447434-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-11-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Denver Nuggets big man picks up third of career\n\nO'Neal's main point is based on the season Gilgeous-Alexander has put together, one in which he has guided OKC to the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference. Gilgeous-Alexander, who lost by 286 votes to Jokic in MVP voting (including a 64 first-place vote differential), is averaging 30.1 points (third best in the NBA), 6.2 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game while shooting 53.5% from the field.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander, who earned his second straight All-Star nod this season, is averaging 27.6 points in five games these playoffs for the Thunder.

But me personally, I would've given it to Shai.\"\n\nShortly after learning word that he became the ninth player in NBA history to win three or more MVP awards, Jokic joined the \"Inside the NBA\" crew. And though O'Neal, who won the MVP award in 2000, congratulated Jokic by naming him \"vice president of the Big Man Alliance,\" he did not change his stance on Gilgeous-Alexander as his pick.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Reggie Miller warns Knicks fans ahead of MSG return: 'The Boogeyman is coming'\n\n\"Joker, as the president of the Big Man Alliance, you are the vice president of the Big Man Alliance.

But not as deserving as Mavericks superstar Doncic, whose historic season for the ages inexplicably was deemed not good enough.\n\nFirst player in NBA history to average at least 33 points (a league-leading 33.9), nine assists (9.8, second in the NBA) and nine rebounds (9.2): Not good enough.\n\nHad the highest average of combined points, rebounds and assists (52.9) since the 1971-72 season MVP Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 56.0; and the highest combined points and points created from assists (57.2) in history: Not good enough.\n\nHoisted an injury-ravaged Mavericks team onto his back for the first half of the season; ultimately led them to 50 victories and went 46-24 when he played: Not good enough.\n\nLed the league in 30-point triple-doubles (16), 35-point triple-doubles (11), 40-point triple-doubles (two) and produced the season's best singular performance by dropping 73 points on Atlanta, fourth-most in history: Not good enough.\n\nTim Reynolds, respected longtime Associated Press NBA reporter and fellow awards voter, summed up the Doncic paradox with this Wednesday morning tweet:\n\n\"Expect some outrage tonight if/when Luka Doncic doesn't win MVP after posting the first season in NBA history of averaging 33, 9 and 9. It's a Wilt-type stat oddity.\n\n\"Wilt averaged at least 34 points and 22 rebounds in five consecutive seasons and didn't win MVP in any of them.\"\n\nThere are other factoids that show Doncic's season to be superior -- and more valuable -- compared with Jokic's but numbers aren't the only unfortunate part of this outcome for those of us who watched virtually every pass, dribble and shot of Doncic's 70 games played.\n\nBy all indications, Jokic began this season as the heavy favorite to win MVP, largely based on his having led Denver to its first NBA title last June.\n\nJokic maintained that status even when Oklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander entered the MVP conversation by midseason and Doncic earned West Player of the Month awards in February and March.\n\nLook, I get it. Voting for end-of-season awards is a privilege and a responsibility, one I take seriously. No matter which team I cover, no matter how much more I get to watch a particular player (Doncic) than another (Jokic), I'm not going to cast a vote that I don't truly believe is deserved.\n\nAs of mid-March, with a month left in the season, I would have voted for Jokic. Doncic had checked most of the boxes for being a leading MVP candidate, except for a vital one: team success. As of March 16, the Mavericks were eighth in the West and on a 45-victory pace.\n\nNo matter how dominant a player's numbers are, there's nothing all that valuable about piling up stats for a team that is clawing to avoid the play-in tournament.\n\nThe Mavericks' 16-2 run from March 7 to April 10 clinched my vote for Doncic, but did little to change the larger narrative, especially among national TV analysts, that Jokic had the MVP locked up.\n\nOn April 10 in Miami, before Dallas' third-to-last game and what would be Doncic's last of the regular season, Mavericks players and staff wore gray \"Pravi MVP\" T-shirts -- \"pravi\" being Slovenian for \"real\" or \"true.\"\n\n\"I wish we had worn these in March,\" Coach Jason Kidd said that night, adding that he feared that MVP voters and fans were taking Doncic's greatness for granted because he makes the game look too easy.\n\n\"We've joked around that we might have to do the Larry Bird game and play left-handed. But he might make that look easy, too.\"\n\nKidd, unfortunately, was correct. It seems many of the 100 MVP voters made up their mind before Dallas' 16-2 run, never mind that it essentially encompassed the last quarter of the season.\n\nPut it this way: If Jokic and Doncic lined up for a 100-meter race, Jokic got a 10-meter head start because of Denver's 2023 title -- and the finish line was moved up 10 meters because it appears many voters had made up their minds.\n\nIf Wednesday evening's vote reveal was dismaying to Mavericks fans, imagine how Doncic feels. Last summer he ramped up his training, hired a body team and chef, carried the short-handed Mavericks into January and produced a season for the ages.\n\nNot good enough.", "source": {"uri": "arkansasonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArkansasOnline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_play-in_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA play-in tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/static-4/ao_redesign/graphics/adgog.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "-03-07", "dateEnd": "2024-04-10", "textStart": 3093, "textEnd": 3112}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-16", "textStart": 2825, "textEnd": 2833}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-10", "textStart": 3266, "textEnd": 3274}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

No matter which team I cover, no matter how much more I get to watch a particular player (Doncic) than another (Jokic), I'm not going to cast a vote that I don't truly believe is deserved.\n\nAs of mid-March, with a month left in the season, I would have voted for Jokic. Doncic had checked most of the boxes for being a leading MVP candidate, except for a vital one: Team success. As of March 16 the Mavericks were eighth in the West and on a 45-victory pace.\n\nNo matter how dominant a player's numbers are, there's nothing all that valuable about piling up stats for a team that is clawing to avoid the play-in tournament.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Mavericks' 16-2 run from March 7 to April 10 clinched my vote for Doncic, but did little to change the larger narrative, especially among national TV analysts, that Jokic had the MVP locked up.\n\nOn April 10 in Miami, before Dallas' third-to-last game and what would be Doncic's last of the regular season, Mavericks players and staff wore gray \"Pravi MVP\" T-shirts -- \"pravi\" being Slovenian for \"real\" or \"true.\"\n\n\"I wish we had worn these in March,\" coach Jason Kidd said that night, adding that he feared that MVP voters and fans were taking Doncic's greatness for granted because he makes the game look too easy.\n\n\"We've joked around that we might have to do the Larry Bird game and play left-handed. But he might make that look easy, too.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKidd, unfortunately, was correct. It seems many of the 100 MVP voters made up their mind before Dallas' 16-2 run, never mind that it essentially encompassed the last quarter of the season.\n\nPut it this way: If Jokic and Doncic lined up for a 100-meter race, Jokic got a 10-yard head start because of Denver's 2023 title -- and the finish line was moved up 10 yards because it appears many voters had made up their minds.\n\nIf Wednesday evening's vote reveal was dismaying to Mavericks fans, imagine how Doncic feels. Last summer he ramped up his training, hired a body team and chef, carried the short-handed Mavericks into January and produced a season for the ages.\n\nNot good enough.\n\nAdvertisementMy MVP ballot\n\n1.

He pointed out how the 25-year-old led a young OKC Thunder team to the top of the Western Conference, all while averaging league-high stats in steals and 30.1 points per game.\n\n\"I don't like to rain on people's parade, but I'm not happy with this one. Congratulations to the Joker, you're the best big man in the league but... I felt Shai Alexander deserved it,\" O'Neal said. \"The fact that he has to start all over next year and try to win it all over again, I know it's gonna be hurtful for him. I thought Shai Gilgeous Alexander, one of only a few players that had 30 points 50 times, stat stuffer, great season. His team is No. 1. Nobody expected them to be No. 1.\"\n\nO'Neal didn't hesitate to tell his feelings to The Joker\n\nInstead of keeping his thoughts to himself or discussing them with the panel, Shaq shared his views directly with The Joker during their interview. The 52-year-old openly expressed to Jokic that he believed Shai deserved the MVP award over him.\n\nHowever, unlike some players who might have taken offense, the Serbian center responded with humility.\n\n\"We don't judge people here, so that's fine. That's your opinion,\" Jokic responded. \"I think that there's a lot of players that deserve it.\"\n\nShai might have a more impactful season than Jokic\n\nWhile Jokic maintained an impressive near triple-double average of 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 9.0 assists per game this season, it was less remarkable than his stats from the 2021-22 season when he won his second MVP award.\n\nMeanwhile, the Canadian star showed significant improvement in his numbers, increasing his rebounds from 4.8 to 5.5 and his assists from 5.5 to 6.2 compared to last season. Shai's performance stands out even more because of his leadership role in leading the OKC Thunder from the 10th seed in the 2022-23 season to the 2nd seed in the 2023-24 season.\n\nDespite Jokic winning his 3rd MVP award in four years, the harsh reality looms over him that his Nuggets are 2-0 down against the Timberwolves. In contrast, Shai has led his Thunder to take a 1-0 lead against the Mavs in their second-round series. While the 2-time All-Star might have missed out on the highest individual award, he could still achieve something even greater this season.", "source": {"uri": "basketballnetwork.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Basketball Network - Your daily dose of basketball"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yakshpat_bhargava@basketballnetwork.net", "name": "Yakshpat Bhargava", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_on_TNT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA on TNT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joker_(Steve_Miller_Band_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Joker (Steve Miller Band song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Awards_and_Bestsellers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Awards and Bestsellers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Awards", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Honors_and_Awards", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Honors and Awards", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.basketballnetwork.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA0NzU0NDczMDQ0NjgyMjMy/jokic-and-shaq.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Howard thought that Shai Gilgeous-Alexander should have won it this season, but changed his tune on how he tweeted after watching Shaquille O'Neal's viral video.\n\nIn a post on his official X account, Howard explained why he had to delete a couple of tweets regarding his thoughts on \"The Joker.\" He doesn't want to be like Shaq, who told Jokic in an interview on \"Inside the NBA\" that SGA should have been the MVP.\n\n\"I saw that video of Superman and I had to delete my tweets because I can't be like that! I'm proud of Joki\u0107! Im just saying now you gotta say he top 5 all time! 3 MVPs? Shai had my vote but he a killer! So I know he'll be back next year,\" Howard wrote.\n\nWhat were Dwight Howard's deleted tweets about Nikola Jokic?\n\nDwight Howard deleted a couple of tweets related to his feelings about Nikola Jokic becoming a three-time NBA MVP. One of the tweets was about calling for Batman because \"The Joker\" was stealing the award.\n\nThe other deleted tweet mentioned Joel Embiid, who was the runner-up on Jokic's 2021 and 2022 MVP wins. Howard felt that Embiid got robbed in one of those years, while also saying that Shai Gilgeous-Alexander suffered the same fate.\n\nSGA finished second in MVP voting, receiving 15 first-place votes compared to Jokic's 79. The OKC Thunder star had a total of 640 total points behind Jokic's 926. Luka Doncic came in third followed by Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jalen Brunson.\n\nWhat did Shaquille O'Neal say about Nikola Jokic?\n\nThe main reason why Dwight Howard retracted his tweets about Nikola Jokic was Shaquille O'Neal's viral video. Shaq told Jokic that Shai Gilgeous-Alexander should have won the MVP award just minutes after Charles Barkley announced that the Denver Nuggets superstar is now a three-time Michael Jordan Award winner.\n\n\"Joker as the president of the Big Man Alliance - you are the vice president of the Big Man Alliance - you know I love you. The best player in the league, I want to congratulate you. I want you to hear it from me first, I thought SGA should have been the MVP. That's no disrespect to you, but congratulations,\" O'Neal said.\n\nA lot of fans were shocked by Shaq's comments because it came out as bitter from one of the greatest players ever. Some fans even pointed out that the LA Lakers legend is still fuming that he came second in MVP voting when Steve Nash won the award in 2005.\n\nFor those who don't know, as great as Shaq was, he only won the league MVP once in 2000.

The Serbian center quietly became one of the best players in the world as the years went by. This season was no exception and Jokic won another trophy with the Denver Nuggets.\n\nWinning an NBA MVP is a hard job for many players. Now, when we talk about winning three of them, the job gets extremely hard. Jokic became only the ninth player to achieve this feat, joining eight legends that left a huge mark on the game.\n\nToday, we're going to take a look at all the players who have managed to win at least three NBA MVPs during their careers.\n\nThe Houston Rockets and Philadelphia 76ers legend was one of the best players in his position during his best days. Malone won his first award in the 1978-79 season, averaging 24.8 points, 17.6 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game.\n\nA couple of seasons later in 1981-82, he would get his second MVP trophy, posting 31.1 points, 14.7 rebounds and 1.8 assists.\n\nAnd the next year, he would win his third and final award, recording 24.5 points, 15.3 rebounds and 1.3 assists with the 76ers.\n\nMagic Johnson\n\nMagic Johnson dominated the NBA MVP scene in the late 80s, winning three awards in a span of five years. The Los Angeles Lakers legend bagged his first award in 1987, averaging 23.9 points, 6.3 rebounds and 12.2 assists per game.\n\nTwo years later, Magic would get his second award after posting 22.5 points, 7.9 rebounds and 12.8 rebounds per outing.\n\nThen, in 1990, he would get the third MVP of his career, averaging 22.3 points, 6.6 rebounds and 11.5 assists per game with the Purple and Gold.\n\nLarry Bird\n\nLarry Bird owns a terrific record in the NBA as the last person to win three consecutive MVP awards. The Boston Celtics legend took over from Moses Malone, winning three straight MVP awards from 1984 through 1986.\n\nDuring his first triumphant campaign, Bird averaged 24.2 points, 10.1 rebounds and 6.6 assists per game. The following season, he would go for 28.7 points, 10.5 rebounds and 6.6 assists per outing.\n\nTo complete the three-peat, Larry Legend posted 25.8 points, 9.8 rebounds and 6.8 per game. In addition to the individual accolades, Bird led the Celtics two NBA championships during this time.\n\nNikola Jokic\n\nNikola Jokic joined this exclusive list after beating Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Luka Doncic, respectively, to reclaim the throne Joel Embiid took away from him last season.\n\nDuring the 2020-21 NBA season, Jokic would take over Giannis Antetokounmpo, winning his first Most Valuable Player award after averaging 26.4 points, 10.8 rebounds and 8.3 assists. In the next campaign, he improved the first two stats, which grew to 27.1 points, 13.8 rebounds, while dishing 7.9 assists per outing.\n\nThis season, he nearly averaged a triple-double, posting 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists per game.\n\nWilt Chamberlain\n\nWilt Chamberlain is one of the three NBA players who won three consecutive MVP awards. His first award came as a rookie when he was a member of the Philadelphia Warriors in 1960, averaging 37.6 points, 27.0 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game.\n\nSix years later, now with the 76ers, Wilt would bag his second award, posting 33.5 points, 24.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists per contest.\n\nThe following season, his scoring production dipped a little bit, dropping 24.1 points. His rebounding stats were still outstanding, though, with Wilt averaging 24.2 boards per game and 7.8 assists. His final award arrived one season later, where he averaged 24.3 points, 23.8 rebounds and 8.6 assists per match,\n\nBill Russell\n\nBill Russell was the player who inaugurated the three-peat MVP club during his magical days with the legendary Boston Celtics. The late center captured his first trophy in 1958, averaging 16.6 points, 22.7 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game.\n\nIn 1961, he would bag his second MVP, posting 16.9 points, 23.9 rebounds and 3.4 assists for the Celtics. Russell's points and assists would get better the next season, recording 18.9 points, 23.6 rebounds and 4.5 dimes per match.\n\nFor his fourth Most Valuable Player award, he would average 16.8 points, 23.6 rebounds and 4.5 assists with the Celts in the 1964-65 season.\n\nLeBron James\n\nBefore Jokic made his way to this list, LeBron James remained the most recent member of the club. The King has won four MVP awards during his career, and if it wasn't for a young Derrick Rose, he could have gotten five consecutive trophies.\n\nJames' first MVP-winning season came in 2009 when he posted 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds and 8.6 assists for the Cleveland Cavaliers. The next season, his scoring average went higher, recording 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 8.6 assists per matchup.\n\nTwo years later, after taking his talents to the Miami Heat, James would get his third award after averaging 27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds and 6.2 assists per outing. The following year, he would average 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds and 7.3 assists per match with the Floridian team.\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nMichael Jordan must have done something remarkable if the NBA named its top trophy after him. The Chicago Bulls legend believed he was deserving of this award on more occasions, but he still managed to get five of them during his illustrious career.\n\nJordan would become the Most Valuable Player for the first time in 1988, averaging 35.0 points, 5.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists per game. His Airness then had to wait three years to win the coveted prize for a second time. He averaged 31.5 points, 6.0 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game. The next year, Jordan would repeat as MVP, posting 30.1 points, 6.4 rebounds and 6.1 assists with the Chicago Bulls.\n\nFour years later, amid his second three-peat, Jordan would average 37.7 points, 6.6 rebounds and 4.3 assists per outing en route to another award. Two years later he would win his fifth and final MVP award, averaging 28.7 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar\n\nNo matter how hard he tried, Michael Jordan could never emulate Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who still owns the record for the most MVP awards in NBA history. The Milwaukee Bucks and Los Angeles Lakers legend won six of these awards, starting in 1971.\n\nKareem averaged 31.7 points, 16.0 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game for the Bucks that year. The following season, he improved those numbers, scoring 34.8 points per game, grabbing 16.6 rebounds and dishing out 4.6 assists. During the 1973-74 season, the six-time NBA champion won his third MVP award, posting 27.0 points, 14.5 rebounds and 4.8 assists per game.\n\nHe would win three more awards with the Lakers, starting in 1976, where he averaged 27.7 points, 16.9 rebounds and 5.0 assists. The following year, Abdul-Jabbar would score 26.2 points, 13.3 rebounds and 3.9 assists per match with the Purple and Gold. His sixth and final award came in 1980, where he averaged 24.8 points, 10.8 rebounds and 4.5 assists per game.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"},

Third place went to Luka with four votes (566 points).\n\nAfter the results were announced, the 1999-00 MVP, Shaquille O'Neal did not shy away from expressing his thoughts, while doing an interview with the Serbian big man on the TNT broadcast.\n\n\"I want to congratulate you,\" Shaq said to Jokic. \"But I want you to hear it from me first, I thought SGA should have been the MVP. That's no disrespect to you.\"\n\n\"I don't like to rain on people's parade, but I'm not happy with this one,\" Shaq said on TNT's Inside The NBA. \"Congratulations to Joker, you are the best big man in the league, but based on everybody's criteria, my criteria, stats, your guys' criteria, number-one seed, which team has the better record, I felt Shai Alexander deserved it.\"\n\nGilgeous-Alexander was famously traded from the Los Angeles Clippers to the Thunder ahead of the 2019-20 season. The trade package included the Clippers giving up seven first round draft picks and pick swaps, in addition to SGA and Danillo Gallinari in exchange for Paul George. Important to remember, during the 2021 and 2022 seasons, the Thunder combined for 46 wins, and now SGA, in his sixth season, has led the team to be atop of the Western Conference standings this season with a 57-25 record.\n\nThat is to say, Jokic's Denver Nuggets also finished with the exact same record (57-25; Home 33-8, Away 24-17); nevertheless, the first-seeded Thunder had a better division record, while also winning the season series, 3-1 vs. the second-seeded Nuggets.\n\nAs the playoff race is currently unfolding, SGA's Thunder are 1-0 in their second-round matchup with the Dallas Mavericks, while the Nuggets are trailing the Timberwolves 2-0 in their semi-finals series.\n\nShaq went on to defend SGA, \"I've been number two a lot, when I played my a** off, number two, so the fact that he has to start all over next year and try to win it again, I know that's going to be hurtful for him. Hopefully he uses this to motivate him to win a championship.\"\n\n\"I felt I was robbed two or three times,\" O'Neal said. \"Don't name it 'most valuable player' then. It goes to the most valuable player in the league, and that was me, the most valuable player in the league [this season], that was Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.\"\n\nWith this in mind, Shaq finished runner-up for the award during the 1995 season, as a player for the Orlando Magic, in addition to also finishing in second during the 2005 MVP voting, the year he won a championship with the Miami Heat. As he notably won the award during the 2000 season with the Lakers, averaging 29.7 points (57.4 FG%), 13.6 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 3.0 blocks per game.\n\nShaq referenced that 25-year-old, SGA scored 30+ points in 46 games this season, averaging 30.1 points (53.6% FG; 35.3% 3PT), 5.5 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 2.0 steals (tied for league-best) and 0.9 blocks.\n\nAfter hearing Shaq give his thoughts, the Nuggets' big man stated, \"There's alot of players that deserve it. You know it's probably [is decided by] the details and small things.\"\n\nAs the MVP, in his ninth season, Jokic averaged 26.4 points (58.3% FG; 35.9% 3PT), 12.4 rebounds, 9.0 assists, 1.4 steals and 0.9 blocks. To note, he had 25 triple-doubles this season, 130 throughout his career, which ranks him fourth on the all-time list. Not to mention, after playing in 79 games this season, Jokic now joins Wilt Chamberlain as the only other player with multiple seasons being top-5 in the three major categories: points (5th), rebounds (3rd), and assists (2nd).\n\n\"It's got to start with the teammates; without them, I cannot do nothing,\" Jokic said Wednesday on TNT after being announced as the MVP. \"Coaches, players, organization, medical staff, strength coaches, development coaches.

The Nuggets descended into the valley from the Rocky Mountains for the annual NBApalooza, also known as Summer League. The buzz was significant. The Nuggets were bringing their highest draft pick in over a decade, the new face of the franchise and the player everyone expected to guide the franchise back to a perennial playoff team. Now, if you're reading the lede and aren't familiar on the Nuggets in the mid 2010s, you'd probably assume I'm talking about the now three -time MVP Nikola Jokic, and I am, but he was not that player I mentioned. That player was Emmanuel Mudiay. Jokic was the 41st pick in the draft the year prior making his summer league debut in addition to Mudiay after spending one final season in Europe after the Nuggets drafted him. If you were to just look at the stats, you'd be confused as to why Jokic's stint in Summer League is something of legend. He finished fifth on Denver in assists, fourth in rebounds and didn't even register on the leaderboard for points or minutes per game. Unlike Mudiay, Denver didn't say they'd seen enough and rest him for the second half of the tournament. Jokic played all five games of the summer league, the only other player who could say the same that actually made the roster was Erick Green...who was on the roster for three games. Jokic is incredibly unexpected.\n\nHowever, despite not putting up a ton of points, or even assists, the flashes were there. Guys would cut into the lane and Jokic would toss these soft lobs into traffic that seemed like they were guaranteed to be stolen only they weren't. They dropped perfectly into the arms of the guy he was passing to. He flashed his footwork in the post, his ability to stretch and run the floor. From there we know the story. Joker establishes himself in the rotation by the end of his rookie year, by the middle of his second season he was inserted into the starting lineup and by his third season Mudiay was traded for a Devin Harris rental and Nikola was the engine that ran everything the Nuggets did. From there its been a consistent ascent to becoming the best basketball player on earth. That ascent continued right up to Wednesday night when it was announced Jokic won his third MVP award, something now only nine players have ever accomplished. Each one a hall of famer and many spoken about in the greatest of all time conversation. Think about that. Thousands upon thousands of players have come into the league and Jokic accomplished something only eight others did before him. It's stunning and the fact that it's happening in Denver, a \"flyover\" franchise that never won anything more than a division title before Nikola's arrival, makes it incredibly special for all of us who rock the blue and gold. Jokic is incredibly remarkable.\n\nIt's not that the Nuggets haven't had great players. After this year's induction ceremony there will be a baker's dozen players who played for the Nuggets at some point in their career and are in the hall of fame. However many were here for less storied portions of their career (Allen Iverson, Chauncey Billups, Bobby Jones, George McGinnis, Walter Davis, Charlie Scott, Spencer Haywood) and others still were really only here for a cup of coffee and their time as Nuggets had nothing to do with their hall of fame consideration (Sarunas Marciulionis, Tim Hardaway). Of the thirteen, there are four who you can argue are truly Nuggets hall of famers: Alex English, David Thompson, Dan Issel and Dikembe Mutombo and honestly Issel's career peak was with the Kentucky Colonels and Mutombo's was with the Atlanta Hawks. English and Thompson really are the only two who through and through are Denver players. English is also Denver's only first ballot hall of famer. Think about that, a franchise that has existed for over half a century has one first ballot hall of famer and while Carmelo Anthony has a good shot to go in first ballot as well, he has shown that his loyalty lies with the New York Knicks and not the Nuggets. Jokic has long stated he wants to end his career in Denver and he could retire tomorrow and be a lock to go into the HOF on his first try. This is not normal, particularly in Denver. Jokic is incredibly special.\n\nWhat makes it even more special is Nikola is the first Nugget to ever reach even close to the heights he has accomplished. When he won his first MVP back in 2021 he became the first ever Denver player to do it in the NBA (shoutout to Haywood and his remarkable single ABA season with the Denver Rockets in 1970). Two years later he led the Nuggets to the franchise's first championship during a dominant run that saw him crowned Finals MVP. No one has even come close to what Nikola has accomplished in Denver and he's doing it all while pronouncing love for the city and the franchise. That makes it the most special of all. This is a franchise that is often overlooked, that goes into free agency knowing there is almost no chance of landing the biggest names. A place that we've been told is boring and lacks the appeal of a Los Angeles, Miami or New York. Hell, people would talk about Dallas as a marquee destination over Denver and no offense meant for Dallas, fine city, but I won't be convinced it's demonstrably better than the city that sits at the base of the Rocky Mountains. Nikola gives two shits about developing a brand or spending every night in the action out on the town. In fact he seems to loathe things like attention and outward admiration. His personality is perfectly suited for Denver and the beautiful, but oft maligned in NBA circles, city is perfectly suited for him. Given the way Melo left, having the greatest player in franchise history confess his love and loyalty for the city puts Nikola in a league of his own when it comes to Nuggets lore. Jokic is incredibly loyal.\n\nIt's more than just what he does on the court or even his loyalty off it though. Jokic is simply extremely easy to root for. First and foremost he is a family man and puts his loved ones above all else. When he came to Denver he brought his two brothers to live with him. He married his high school (or whatever they call it in Serbia) sweetheart and ties his wedding ring into his shoelaces. He is a girl dad and damn proud of it, showing constant love and connection with his young daughter. There's something incredibly beautiful about a man who has reached the peak of his profession, who has all the money and attention anyone could ever ask for, and yet his very first instinct after every game is to look to the crowd, find his daughter and share a special gesture so that she knows he is thinking of her and that in an arena of thousands of people she is the most important one to him. Sometimes it can be easy to forget that players are humans and so often when we do remember that fact its in the light of a mistake they made or criticism they received. For Nikola, we see his humanity in the way he loves the people closest to him. Jokic is incredibly loving.\n\nWe also see his love of his teammates and his respect for the game. He's famous for saying he prefers to assist over scoring because an assist makes two people happy. He is the epitome of always making the right play, completely selfless with only an interest in winning. Opposing team's fans will cope by saying he doesn't care about the game, that he doesn't love the game of basketball and that's bad for the NBA, but that's just what they tell themselves while they search for a reason to dislike a player who just thoroughly dismantled their team. Fact of the matter is Nikola would prefer for his teammates to be the ones showered with admiration and credit for the team's accomplishments. Look no farther than the picture of the team after they won the championship. Jamal Murray is sitting front and center holding the Larry O'Brien trophy, next to him is coach Michael Malone...holding Nikola's finals MVP trophy, and waaaaay off to the left in the top row, practically out of the picture, with his daughter on his shoulders, is the best player on earth and the star of the championship team. I'm not going to do the research but I'd take a guess that you could go back through every championship team photo for the past thirty years and not see something like that. Jokic is incredibly selfless.\n\nAs Nuggets fans we can't take this for granted. It's easy to do when we are in the middle of Joker putting up amazing performances night in and night out. It's also easy to forget how amazing he is when he only puts up sixteen points and sixteen rebounds in a tough loss in the playoffs, but his greatness is something Nuggets fans will likely never see again in their lifetime. Of the other eight players to win three MVPS, only three franchises saw multiple members on that list play for them, and realistically it's just two (the Philadelphia 76ers snuck in with Wilt Chamberlin and one season of Moses Malone) and they're the two franchises who consistently get the most attention from free agents to MVP voters alike: the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics. Jokic also turns thirty next season, a stark reminder that there is a time limit on his greatness and we are in all likelihood already halfway through it. We can't waste these moments as Nuggets fans. We were gifted a basketball savant that no one saw coming because he doesn't jump high or run very fast. We were gifted the most uniquely talented player in the NBA, perhaps ever, who is simply better than everyone else because he's the most fundamentally sound player in the league. He's remarkable to watch and we are ridiculously lucky to call him ours. Jokic is incredibly unique.", "source": {"uri": "denverstiffs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Denver Stiffs"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zach_mikash@denverstiffs.com", "name": "Zach Mikash", "type":

He is now part of a very exclusive club with some of the best athletes to ever touch a basketball. It is such a unique achievement that Jokic's wife, Natalija, narrated a beautiful tribute to her husband to commemorate the momentous occasion.\n\nBut not everyone thought Jokic deserved to win this year's MVP.\n\nThat, to be very clear, is completely fine! Everyone has their own opinions and this is just sports, something that is mostly trivial in the grand scheme of things. The concept of \"having your own opinion\" takes a different tact when you're telling the athlete to their face that they didn't deserve their incredible accomplishment ... on national television.\n\nThis is what Shaquille O'Neal did during the NBA on TNT pregame show while talking directly to Jokic. C'mon, man:\n\n\"No disrespect\" (Says something disrespectful.)\n\nIt's one thing to share your opinion about the NBA or any sports with your friends and with people who aren't remotely involved. It's crossing a major line to tell someone in a happy moment of their career and their life -- on national television, no less -- that, actually, they shouldn't have achieved what they achieved. It's not the time or the place. Kudos to Jokic for taking it in stride and praising other deserving players. He took the high road.\n\nIf you want to tell Jokic that someone else deserved it to his face (which still isn't great!), at least have the decency to tell him in private. Instead, O'Neal made the moment about himself in front of millions of people.\n\nThis was a classless move by O'Neal and I can't imagine Jokic appreciated it in the slightest.\n\nFeatured image courtesy of NBA on TNT\n\nNBA fans couldn't believe Shaq told Nikola Jokic he didn't deserve his MVP to his face on live TV", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_zeglinski@ftw.usatoday.com", "name": "Robert Zeglinski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_on_TNT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA on TNT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-08-at-6.26.02-PM-e1715214396812.png?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

If not for Joel Embiid bringing home the bacon last year, the Serbian might have made it four in a row.\n\nWhile many anticipated the result, a handful thought that Jokic should not have been given another Michael Jordan Trophy. Shaquille O'Neal, who congratulated the Denver Nuggets center on national TV, pointedly told the big man that Shai Gilgeous-Alexander should have been the winner. Dwight Howard later followed on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nHoward posted back-to-back tweets that have since been deleted.\n\n\"Call Batman up the Joker out here robbing\"\n\nThe former NBA player who called himself \"Superman\" added:\n\n\"First Joel now Shai? Don't get me wrong Joker was cooking this year but Shai was Killing !\"\n\nDwight Howard didn't like the response to those tweets so he took them down and explained:\n\n\"I saw that video of Superman and I had to delete my tweets because I can't be like that! I'm proud of Joki\u0107! Im just saying now you gotta say he top 5 all time! 3 MVPs? Shai had my vote but he a killer! So I know he'll be back next year\"\n\nIn the first two years of Nikola Jokic's MVP run, Joel Embiid finished second. While most agreed he was the deserving winner in 2021, the following year was an entirely different story. Some thought that \"The Process\" was robbed of the award. In 2023, Embiid finally got his but Jokic was in striking distance.\n\nThis year, Embiid was on a historic tear and was the clear race leader before he suffered a knee injury in January. When he couldn't play enough games to be eligible, Nikola Jokic was again in pole position with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Luka Doncic chasing him.\n\nWhile fans and even former players are hotly debating the issue, \"The Joker\" is taking everything in stride. He wouldn't have objected to Joel Embiid winning in 2022 and probably this year. He probably never listens to the noise and only cares about winning the championship.\n\nDwight Howard could complain again in 2025 if Nikola Jokic gets his second back-to-back MVP season\n\nShaquille O'Neal and Dwight Howard are convinced that Shai Gilgeous-Alexander will use this year's supposed \"snub\" as fuel for next season. \"SGA\" could eventually get his first Michael Jordan Trophy but no one can still count out Nikola Jokic.\n\nIf the Denver Nuggets get swept in the second round versus the Minnesota Timberwolves, look for the Serbian to be even more engaged and driven next season.\n\nThere may be such a thing as \"voter fatigue\" when it comes to naming the MVP but anything is still possible. If Nikola Jokic puts together another mind-boggling season and ties LeBron James and Bill Russell for four MVPs in five years, Howard could complain again.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_macasero@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Michael Macasero", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Howard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dwight Howard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Alexander_Technique", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Alexander Technique", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/9d664-17152285445520-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Look at those names! It's stunning company.\n\nNow consider that this was Jokic's third MVP in four years, and in the one season he didn't take home the league's most prestigious individual honor, he came in second and ended up winning his first Finals MVP. It's a ridiculous stretch of dominance. At 29 years old, Jokic has the highest regular-season and postseason PER on record; he's a mountainous efficiency machine who doubles as an all-time passer, strategist, and symbol of selfless basketball.\n\nBut this MVP comes at an awkward time, with Jokic's Denver Nuggets down 0-2 against a ravenous Minnesota Timberwolves team that was constructed to humble them. This series deficit is unlike the Nuggets' 2022 first-round bout against the Warriors or the infamous \"Suns in four\" sweep in the 2021 conference semifinals, when Denver was dramatically short-handed due to injuries. Besides Jamal Murray's strained calf, which hasn't kept him out of the action but helps explain the noticeable drop in production and potency, the Nuggets are at full strength. And still, Jokic is pressed in a way he hasn't been in a long time, if ever.\n\nThrough two games, Jokic is averaging 24 points, 12 rebounds, and 8.5 assists with a pedestrian 54.3 true shooting percentage. Those are incredible numbers for pretty much anyone, but Jokic's production belies a palpable discomfort that's entirely foreign to his reign as the world's best player. The three-time MVP can inflict pain on an opponent in so many ways -- from the post, coming off a screen, orchestrating from the nail, or grabbing a rebound and going coast to coast -- but he's most devastating on the short roll, retrieving a pocket pass and tossing up a cotton ball that hugs the rim before falling through. That's where most of his shots came from this year, and how most of those back-breaking lobs to Aaron Gordon are born. Plays like this have become synonymous with Denver's success:\n\nBut that play from Game 1 is literally the only chance Jokic has had to nibble on his bread and butter. Instead, the Timberwolves keep tackling the waiter on his way to the table, deploying enough size, length, and effort to bother Jokic's shots while also decapitating the head of Denver's snake (Murray). During the regular season, Jokic made 61.7 percent of his attempts in the non-restricted area of the paint, and actually shot 62.8 percent against the Timberwolves. In this series, he's just 4-for-14 in that floater-zone sweet spot where he typically eviscerates the defense's hope.\n\nIt's not like the Nuggets aren't trying to look like the Nuggets. In the play from Game 2 seen below, they're doing their best to stress Minnesota's defense at the point of attack. But the action malfunctions before it can get off the ground. Despite Jokic waving Michael Porter Jr. toward the corner, MPJ doesn't space all the way over, which lets Anthony Edwards stay higher up the floor and keep Murray from gaining an advantage. At the same time, Nickeil Alexander-Walker does a fantastic job trailing the ball over Jokic's screen while Naz Reid is up to touch, waiting for a pocket pass Murray throws earlier than he usually does.\n\nMurray has assisted only two Jokic baskets in the series so far. The first was in that pick-and-roll seen above. The second is below, a telling sequence where Jokic is proactive instead of his usual reactionary self -- aggressiveness that's key for Denver to get back in the series.\n\nThis is peak Denver. Jokic comes off Kentavious Caldwell-Pope's wedge screen and then immediately attacks an off-balance defender before a hard double-team can do anything to slow him down.\n\nThere hasn't been nearly enough of that decisiveness. Minnesota has spent the first two games flustering an elite, singular, and seemingly unflappable offense that's suddenly committing more unforced and (definitively) forced errors than they typically do. Denver's 16.9 turnover rate is (a lot) worse than what the 30th-ranked Utah Jazz posted during the regular season. And the makeable shots they're missing in the paint have been absolutely killer. It's hard to know which mistakes are self-sabotage and which are because Minnesota's defense is in Denver's head. Are they missing layups and giving up easy baskets in transition because they've convinced themselves someone in a Timberwolves jersey is breathing down their neck? Possibly!\n\nPossessions that were clean art during the regular season (and against the Lakers) are a discombobulated mess against the (second) house Tim Connelly built. Right now, Denver appears lethargic and antsy, two conflicting characteristics that Minnesota is happy to punish. Look at this slot cut by Christian Braun. Instead of Justin Holiday catching Jokic's pass out of the double-team, forcing Alexander-Walker's rotation, and then spraying a pass out to Porter in the weakside corner for a wide-open 3, Braun forces a traffic jam.\n\nOffense and defense have a fascinating relationship in this series. The Nuggets aren't typically desperate to attack in transition off missed shots, but it may be an essential part of any potential comeback. The issue there? Minnesota's offense is really freaking good. Edwards and Karl-Anthony Towns have played with poise, patience, and a knowing force the Nuggets haven't been able to contain. That includes Jokic, whose margin for error has never been so narrow guarding the pick-and-roll.\n\nComing off a ball screen with a live dribble, Edwards is a loose pressure valve. If Jokic is up too high in an effort to take away the pull-up 3, Ant can either turn the corner or whip a pass that exploits Denver's rotation. If Jokic is too low, an open jumper or runway into the paint spells trouble. If Jokic is in between, trying to have his cake and eat it too, he enters no-man's land and the possession ends before it begins.\n\nOverall, there are no easy answers. The Wolves are locked in on a brilliant, diversified game plan that has been in the works for over a year, when Minnesota was eliminated in last year's first round sans Jaden McDaniels and Reid (two vital cogs in their system). One early response from Michael Malone in Game 2 was a series of inverted pick-and-rolls with Jokic as the ball handler, something they didn't do much of in the first round against L.A. or Game 1 against Minnesota. It's a good way to force at least one big out of the paint -- two when Gordon sets the screen -- and put the Timberwolves' defense into a compromising rotation.\n\nWhen Jokic is in the post -- a sparkling, savage part of his skill set that almost always yields an efficient look for him or a teammate -- Minnesota has sprinkled in several different coverages. Sometimes they stay home and force him to beat either Rudy Gobert, Towns, or Reid. Sometimes they send help before he can go to work. In these spots, the Nuggets have to trust the pass. Here, with Mike Conley rotating on a string to pick up Murray, the ball needs to immediately kick out to a wide-open Caldwell-Pope.\n\nThe Timberwolves want opponents to test them at the basket. They also want Jokic to shoot a bunch of shots. They do not want him getting everyone involved. The bad news for Denver is unless Murray looks like his vintage self, Jokic probably has to take and make more contested shots than he wants to, from outside the paint, behind the 3-point line, and at the hoop.\n\nThat's what superstars do, of course. The playoffs are about overcoming seemingly insurmountable challenges, outthinking intelligent opponents, and staying one step ahead. Time is running out on Denver's ability to do this, against a defense that's had the entire league in a chokehold since opening night. But if there's any one player alive capable of lifting his team out from a shallow grave, it's a freshly minted three-time MVP, officially cemented as one of the greatest to ever do it.", "source":

He led the Nuggets to an impressive 57-25 record, ranking second in the Western Conference behind the Thunder due to a tiebreaker.\n\nDoncic and Gilgeous-Alexander remain locked into a Western Conference Semifinals matchup, with the Thunder taking Game 1 in a blowout fashion.\n\nREAD MORE: Gilgeous-Alexander Leads Thunder to Blowout Victory Over Mavs in Game 1\n\nREAD MORE: 'Thunder Win Very Easily'; Inside the NBA Previews Mavs-Thunder Series", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_NBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inside the NBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4108,h_2310,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/dallas_basketball/01hxdb5s1cnxtks9scmm.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

The league presents more of a global game than ever, and that fact has now spilled out onto the court in the coolest possible way.\n\nOn Wednesday night, after Denver Nuggets superstar Nikola Jokic won his third MVP award in four seasons, there was a lot of thoughtful reflection about what his latest achievement meant. But beyond the extremely exclusive club that Jokic is now a part of, his latest MVP win is so much bigger than him. Why? The Serbian is a non-American player who is helping to establish a bona fide international dominance alongside some of the finest talents in the league.\n\nJokic's latest MVP win continues the longest streak (six years) of non-American players to win the prestigious award in league history. This is the reality that Jokic (2021, 2022, 2024), the Philadelphia 76ers' Joel Embiid (2023), and the Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo (2019, 2020) have given us.\n\nAnd that is ... just wild to think about:\n\nSure, there were plenty of standout international players around the league over the last 40 years. You had your Hakeem Olajuwon's, Dirk Nowitzki's, and Pau Gasol's as stars. And there were, of course, other countless standout difference-makers and role players whose impact can't be forgotten.\n\nBut before the last six years, I don't think there's ever been as clear-cut of a case that most of the top players in the premier men's basketball league on this blue marble in space aren't, in fact, American.\n\nSeriously. Let's think about this.\n\nIf I ranked the current best players in the NBA, it would probably go like this, and it'd actually take a little while before we got to an American!\n\nNikola Jokic (Serbia) Joel Embiid (Cameroon) Luka Doncic (Slovenia) Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Canada) Giannis Antetokounmpo (Greece) Jayson Tatum (United States)\n\nDearest readers, the first five players on that list are a First-Team All-NBA-caliber group in any average year. And only one of them (Embiid) is in their 30s. There's still a lot of great basketball to be played within that group.\n\nThis is all a fantastic development for the NBA, which continues to expand its reach worldwide. I can't help but think about children elsewhere in the globe staying up to watch stars like Jokic, Embiid, and Antetokounmpo dominate at the top of the sport and wondering, \"Hey, that could be me one day!\" That in itself is planting a seed -- it is the game growing naturally, with kids potentially getting awesome role models who paved the way to their dreams.\n\nTo be clear, at this point in time, most of the best players in the league after the tippy-top still come from the United States. It's not all that close, either.\n\nBut this is still a dramatic shift from where the league even was in the early aughts. When I see stats like this about recent MVP winners all being from elsewhere in the globe, it makes me so excited for the future, decades from now, when the world will have potentially really caught up to the U.S., and we will see more players from other walks of life rising to well-earned superstardom.\n\nThen we'll really have a global game.", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_zeglinski@ftw.usatoday.com", "name": "Robert Zeglinski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Stern", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Stern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Olajuwon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Olajuwon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pau_Gasol", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pau Gasol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Nowitzki", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dirk Nowitzki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2024/05/USATSI_22389840-e1715282177274.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Upon Nikola Joki\u0107 securing his third MVP award in 2024, the former NBA player wanted to express his sincere congratulations to him. However, an evident confusion between 'The Joker' and his fellow countryman, Nikola Jovic, made things difficult on KG's end.\n\nThe incident surrounded one of Garnett's recent Instagram stories, applauding the monumental accomplishment of Jokic. Soon after the NBA announced the Denver Nuggets star as the 2023/24 season's MVP, he wrote, \"Congratulations To The Nikola Joker Jokic\".\n\nIn the process, KG aimed to tag Jokic's profile in his story to increase the visibility of his praise. Here, things took a turn for the worst as the 2008 champion unintentionally tagged the profile of the Miami Heat youngster, Jovic.\n\nAmidst the misunderstanding, Jovic is yet to respond to Garnett. Considering the seniority factor in their dynamics, the youngster may refrain from reacting to the mistake at all. At the same time, Garnett has not yet rectified his error. The 47-year-old is probably unaware of Jokic's absence from the platform.\n\nDespite the perplexity, KG's gesture wonderfully captured his admiration for Jokic. He had been vocal about the Serbian's influence throughout the campaign. Ahead of the playoffs, Garnett even took it up a notch, shedding light on the Nuggets star's NBA legacy during an episode of KG Certified.\n\n\"I got Joker as the MVP...What he is doing to our league is just, he is ripping the records apart...They showed a stat where he had a triple-double on every team in the league. Right now, Joker is more dominant than Wilt Chamberlain,\" he mentioned on that occasion.\n\nThus, his recent comments served as an extension of his respect towards Jokic. KG's postseason prediction came true, while the entire NBA took notice of the sustained dominance of The Joker.\n\nSoon after being announced as the regular season MVP, Jokic sat down with Inside the NBA crew for a discussion. During the interview, Shaquille O'Neal provided the Nuggets star with no time to celebrate. The Hall of Famer openly disregarded the achievement of the 29-year-old, stating the following:\n\n\"You know I love you. The best player in the league. But I want you to hear from me first. I thought that SGA [Shai Gilgeous-Alexander] should've been the MVP. That's no disrespect to you. But, congratulations.\"\n\nThis statement raised eyebrows all around, questioning the intent of Shaq.

The Nuggets center won the award quite handsomely with 926 points in the voting process, 286 points ahead of the second-placed Shai-Gilgeous Alexander.\n\nThe franchise shared a video on social media as a tribute to their center, which was narrated by Jokic's wife, Natalija. Jokic was seen watching the video with their daughter, Ognjena as her wife narrated, \"How the unlikely became like. Nikola Jokic to others, an unmatched talent, to us, an unselfish family man. outsiders may see him as unconventional or unorthodox, but we have always seen him as unbelievable.\"\n\nThe 6-time NBA All-Star by then was sharing the screen with his enthusiastic daughter as the narration continued, \"It may be unlikely that a proud Serbian drafted as the overlooked 41st pick would achieve a status only a few have reached. But when you play your cards right, anything is likely. Behind the scars and the smile lies the work, lies the belief that you will be great and we will always believe in ourselves. Now three-time MVP.\"\n\nJokic seemed emotionally overwhelmed by the end of the footage and thanked everyone for the amazing tribute. The Serbian's wife has been on his side through the highs and the lows and the special moment was no different.\n\nNikola Jokic and Natalija have known each other since their high school days. Both of them are from Sombor, Serbia, where they met sometime around their high school years back in 2012. In 2013 Natalija moved to the USA to play volleyball at Seminole State College in Oklahoma.\n\nIn 2015, Jokic got drafted by the Nuggets, and since then, the couple have stayed together in Denver. In October 2020, they tied the knot and the couple welcomed their daughter, Ognjena a year later.\n\nNatalija has been a regular in the Nuggets games, seen cheering on the team from the stands. She was also filmed during the recent altercation between a fan and Jokic's brother, Strahinja.

So, in his honor, here's a quick two-for-one. In Jokic's first eight seasons, he had two triple-doubles while also shooting 100% from the floor. He had only one game without a missed shot on double-digit attempts. So the pair of \"perfect triple-doubles\" he pulled off this season were rare even for him. Both were galvanizing landmarks, too. Against Memphis in December (26 points, 14 rebounds, 10 assists, 11 for 11), he jump-started a nine-game heater in which he shot 81%. And against Washington out of the All-Star break (21, 19 and 15 on 10-for-10 shooting), he checked off the last opponent he hadn't registered a triple-double against. It started Denver on a 21-6 run to end the season.\n\nWhen/where: Jan. 23, 2024; Gainbridge Fieldhouse\n\nWhen Golden State assistant coach Dejan Milojevic suddenly died at age 46, the entire basketball community mourned. But the loss was personal for Jokic. Milojevic was his head coach in Serbia before both made it in the NBA. As he navigated a difficult week, Jokic didn't speak publicly the first two games after Milojevic's death. The third game was a barn-burner in Indianapolis, where Jokic's 3-pointer at the shot clock buzzer put the Nuggets ahead 114-109 with 6.1 seconds remaining, icing a resilient win. Speaking about Milojevic after the 31-point triple-double, he was short and sweet: \"I love him.\"\n\nWhen/where: Oct. 27, 2023; FedExForum\n\nEven the live local broadcasts were caught asleep, adding an elusive aura to one of the finest assists of Jokic's career. During the second game of the season, he snatched the ball from an official next to Denver's bench, which was at the defensive end of the floor. While the Grizzlies were still arguing a call, he inbounded the ball with a casual Hail Mary that traveled 71 feet and 9 inches, at an average velocity of 30.6 mph, until it reached Aaron Gordon. In mid-air. Right above the rim. For an easy dunk. Jamal Murray even confessed he didn't see the alley-oop.\n\nWhen/where: Jan. 19, 2024; TD Garden\n\nIt was the halfway point of the season, and the Celtics were still undefeated at home (20-0) when the Nuggets made their annual visit to Boston. The two-man game between Jokic and Murray was not to be denied. They became the only reliable source of offense, accounting for 31 of Denver's 47 points in the second half of a 102-100 statement win. Jokic finished the night with 34 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists on 14-of-22 shooting -- the classic idea of an \"MVP moment.\"\n\nIt might age as the most replayed, revisited shot of Jokic's career. The Nuggets miraculously climbed back from an 18-point deficit in the final 6:34 of regulation, all building to a timeout in the backcourt with 3.6 seconds left. The score was 127-all. Jokic caught the inbound pass and made an unusual beeline toward a particular spot along the opposite sideline. It was far from the optimal route to get as close as possible to the basket before time expired. But Jokic's IQ evidently overruled conventional wisdom. He pulled up with a hand in his face and banked a 40-footer at the buzzer -- resulting in an image of a fierce, fervid Jokic that'll live forever in Denver.", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bennett_durando@denverpost.com", "name": "Bennett Durando", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dejan_Milojevi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dejan Milojevi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Weekend", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Weekend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedExForum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FedExForum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Grizzlies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memphis Grizzlies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_clock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shot clock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AP24005207177980.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-01-", "textStart": 2056, "textEnd": 2063}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

Then there is Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and his young Oklahoma City Thunder group looking to continue their ascent.\n\nNikola Jokic and the Nuggets are somewhere in between the old and young generation, as Jokic is younger than the LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry group, but older than the Edwards, Doncic, Gilgeous-Alexander group.\n\nFor Karl, he sees the young generation on the rise in this exciting playoff run, but still has James atop the league - even as the oldest player in the NBA.\n\nMichael Malone Reveals Hilarious Moment With Nikola Jokic After Ejection\n\nVictor Wembanyama Makes History vs. Nuggets", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Karl", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Karl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Malone_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Malone (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4858,h_2732,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_nuggets/01hxdp9fw2prggcqv8v3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

He has covered the Lakers, the Celtics and previously worked for The Boston Globe and Los Angeles Times.\n\nTHE CROWD ROARED as confetti fluttered down from the rafters and Denver Nuggets players, coaches and staff bear-hugged each other on the court, tears dripping down sweaty cheeks. Above them, videoboards at Ball Arena in Denver blinked \"2023 NBA Champions.\"\n\nAmid the joy, Nuggets star Nikola Jokic surveyed the scene, still in his jersey, awaiting the usual postgame interview. It was June 12, 2023, and Jokic had just posted 28 points and 16 rebounds in an NBA Finals-clinching Game 5 win over the Miami Heat. Moments after the buzzer kicked off a citywide celebration, Jokic was asked how it felt to finally be an NBA champion.\n\n\"It's good, it's good,\" he said. \"The job is done. We can go home now.\"\n\nHe smiled wryly and let out a half-hearted laugh. Kidding or not, returning to Sombor, Serbia, was indeed at the top of his mind. It was there where Jokic could race horses, hike in the mountains and unwind with his family, and he could do so in a country where basketball has become a celebrated national pastime -- even if it wasn't always.\n\nIndeed, well over a half-century before Jokic raised the Larry O'Brien Trophy, the sport barely registered across the region, until one player helped ignite a revolution that reshaped its future and set the foundation for countless players to follow. That includes Jokic, whose Nuggets face the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday in Game 3 of their second-round series down 2-0.\n\nThat player was named Radivoj Kora\u0107, and just like Jokic, he called the town of Sombor home.\n\nDURING WARMUPS, the 18-year-old Italian center tried to focus on his routine, but his gaze kept drifting toward the other end of the court. There, he stared in awe at a player he had only heard about and read about in newspapers. \"Everybody was scared to guard him,\" says Dino Meneghin, who was then with the Italian club team Pallacanestro Varese. It was 1968, and this was his first matchup with Kora\u0107, then with Petrarca Padova, an Italian club team.\n\nThe game was played in Meneghin's hometown of Varese, in northern Italy, and Meneghin was given the assignment of guarding the 6-foot-5 Kora\u0107, a sharpshooter from midrange who could handle the ball, score in isolation and play with his back to the basket.\n\n\"Very complete,\" Meneghin says of Kora\u0107's game.\n\nMeneghin's coach told him to try and deny Kora\u0107 the ball, so Meneghin overplayed passing lanes, but nothing seemed to work.\n\n\"I tried, but he was clever -- and smart,\" Meneghin recalls. \"For me, it was really, really hard.\"\n\nMeneghin can't remember how many points Kora\u0107 scored, but he remembered how he felt.\n\n\"I thought I was a good player, but after that game, I realized I had a lot to learn,\" says Meneghin, who would go on to become one of the greatest players in the history of Europe.\n\nKora\u0107 was even better, becoming what the late Borislav Stankovi\u0107, his former coach and the longtime secretary general of FIBA, called Europe's first basketball star. He would come to define his generation -- and the sport itself.\n\n\"If it wasn't for [Korac] and his generation, we wouldn't have Jokic and Doncic and many others.\"\n\nKora\u0107 holds the EuroLeague record for points in a game at 99, the second most at 71 and the fifth most at 60. His career scoring average in the EuroLeague is a record 43.6 points per game. He was the top scorer in professional leagues in Italy, Belgium, Yugoslavia and at the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome. He led his country to medals in the Olympics and FIBA and European championships. He was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame (and named one of its 50 best players of all time) and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. He became the only basketball player in the world to have a large international tournament named after him. He was left-handed, red-haired and known as \"Ginger.\" The French called him \"Terrible Lefty.\" The Italians called him \"Furia Rossa\" (Red Fury).\n\nBut Bogdan Tanjevi\u0107, who played with Kora\u0107 in the mid-1960s, is among a chorus of those in the international ranks who say that Kora\u0107's individual honors fall short of his impact on the game itself. Kora\u0107 grew up in the shadow of World War II, Tanjevi\u0107 says, when Yugoslavia was under communist rule and caught in a restrictive life behind the Soviet Union's Iron Curtain. But because of Kora\u0107, playground courts and sports halls sprouted across his country -- then Yugoslavia, today Serbia -- and the generations that followed grew up with the game.\n\n\"He changed the landscape of Yugoslavian basketball,\" says Zoran Radovic, a retired Serbian basketball player and a FIBA senior director.\n\n\"He was a trailblazer for all of us,\" says Vlade Divac, a Serbian center who played professionally in Europe and then in the NBA.\n\nYugoslavia broke apart in the early 1990s, separating into present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Slovenia. The region has famously developed into a basketball mecca, with dozens of its players becoming household names: There's Luka Doncic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Peja Stojakovic, Toni Kukoc, Dario Saric, Dra\u017een Petrovi\u0107, Jusuf Nurkic, Ivica Zubac, Goran Dragi\u0107, Beno Udrih, Rasho Nesterovic, Sasha Vuja\u010di\u0107, Nikola Vucevic.\n\nThe Mega Basket club team in Belgrade, Serbia, has produced 14 NBA players since 2014; the only college programs to produce more over that span are Kentucky (30), Duke (28) and UCLA (15). Thirteen players from the Balkans occupy spots on NBA rosters.\n\nBut long before that pipeline began to flow, there was Kora\u0107, a son of Sombor.\n\n\"He's a legend in our country, especially in my hometown,\" Jokic says.\n\nToday, those who knew Kora\u0107 watch Jokic with pride, knowing that history draws a straight line between the two.\n\nBut they also know that for as well-known as Kora\u0107 was during his day, he is almost forgotten now. What they want, they say, is for him to be remembered.\n\n\"If it wasn't for him and his generation,\" says Mom\u010dilo Pazman, 79, who played alongside Kora\u0107 in the 1960s, \"we wouldn't have Jokic and Doncic and many others.\"\n\nBORN IN SOMBOR on Nov. 5, 1938, Kora\u0107 began playing at age 12 in Croatia, when he was visiting his cousins' house, which was near a court.\n\n\"I spent days watching the training, and I never dared ask if I could play, too,\" he wrote in a letter. \"Those hoops had a magical power. The next morning, I was the first at the court. I threw my first ball at the basket. I missed, of course, but the magic was there.\"\n\nHoops were hard to find. \"Everybody was watching football,\" Pazman says. To compensate, Kora\u0107 and friends would take the metal rings off wooden barrels and fashion them into a hoop. Yugoslavia had a national team, which made its debut in the EuroBasket tournament in 1947 and finished 13th out of 14 teams.\n\nKora\u0107 was invited to play for his high school team, but only because he was tall, he suspected. But by 1956, he led OKK Belgrade, a local club team largely made from players around the neighborhood, to a junior championship. In one game, his team won 33-28, and Kora\u0107 had scored all 33 points.\n\nIt marked the start of an unprecedented scoring tear.\n\nA FEW HOURS before a game, Kora\u0107 completely withdrew, Pazman says. He was quiet, alone.\n\n\"We teammates didn't even try to disturb him in those moments of total concentration,\" Pazman says. \"As soon as he went out on the field, he turned into something insane when it came to scoring baskets like a fury.\"\n\nKora\u0107 said he never had a role model in basketball, that he played the way he liked. In 1960, he averaged 39.1 points for OKK Belgrade. That same year, Yugoslavia made its first appearance at the Summer Olympics, then played in Rome, and Kora\u0107 was the top scorer.\n\nThe next year, Yugoslavia won a silver medal in the European Championship in Belgrade, the country's first medal in basketball. More than 20,000 raucous fans shook the sports hall. More than 100 journalists looked on.\n\n\"Thanks to them, baskets are appearing everywhere,\" a television broadcast declared. \"New generations are coming. All these boys will have those two generations of our players as role models.\"\n\nIn 1964, Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach coached a group of NBA All-Star players against teams from across Europe. That team featured Bill Russell, Oscar Robertson, Jerry Lucas and Bob Pettit. Auerbach scouted the competition. Before one game in Belgrade, Auerbach pulled Russell aside, telling him: \"You better not let Kora\u0107 score.\" Russell held his own, and Team USA won handily 98-51, but Kora\u0107 tallied 20 points, and Auerbach later remarked that Kora\u0107 was the only international player he saw who could play in the NBA.\n\nIn 1965, Kora\u0107 scored 71 points in one game; then, seven days later, he set the EuroLeague scoring record with 99. Wherever he went, huge crowds followed. He was a sensation.\n\n\"[People] like scorers,\" Stankovic later said about Kora\u0107, \"so people were coming to see this phenomenon, the best scorer of Europe and the Olympics.\"\n\n\"People came to see him wherever basketball was played,\" Pazman recalls. \"They came to see only him.\"\n\nWhen Meneghin, who in 2003 was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, faced Kora\u0107 in Italy, his team called the rising Serbia legend \"Mr. 99,\" a nod to his historic scoring feat years earlier.\n\n\"He would've been a great, great NBA player, for sure,\" he says.\n\nDURING GAMES, Kora\u0107 played with an expression that never seemed to change -- a calm stoicism, the same sort of descriptor later famously used for Jokic.\n\n\"He was creative, a basketball genius,\" says Josip Djerdja, a former Yugoslav national team member. He had a solution for the direct opponent at any time. He'd immediately adapt to the characteristics of his opponent. He'd beat him with his own weapons.\"\n\nLike Jokic, Kora\u0107's body was covered with bruises after games, often because there had been two and three players who had fouled out trying to stop him. And when he was fouled, he proved automatic from the free throw line, where he famously shot the ball underhanded. Once, on a Belgium television show, he was asked how many free throws he could make out of 100, and he guessed between 70 and 80. Then, during a live broadcast, he made 100 in a row.\n\n\"[Korac is] a legend in our country, especially in my hometown\"\n\nAfter leaving packed arenas, he liked to gather with teammates at restaurants.\n\n\"We sat there, talking about the game, rejoicing when we won and grieving when we lost,\" Pazman says. \"Usually that seating lasted until about midnight and Kora\u0107 always left an hour early. When it was time to pay, the answer was: Kora\u0107 had already paid. That's the way he was.\"\n\nKora\u0107 won six medals with the Yugoslav national team, including an Olympic silver medal in the 1968 games in Mexico City. Like Jokic, he didn't talk about his excellence, great games or records. He didn't collect trophies and at times gave them away. He once said he didn't practice shooting any more than other players, spending only one day a week -- Saturday -- to focus exclusively on it.\n\nKora\u0107 had majored in electrical engineering but paused his studies to focus on basketball, believing he'd return to complete his degree later.\n\nHe would never have that chance.\n\nIT WAS THE evening of June 1, 1969, and Tanjevi\u0107 will never forget the sequence of events.\n\nThat day, Kora\u0107 had scored 35 in an exhibition game in Sarajevo. Afterward, he and some teammates, including Tanjevi\u0107, went out to dinner. Pazman and another teammate had decided to return to Belgrade, and they tried to persuade Kora\u0107 to join, but he said he had promised a local reporter an interview the next morning. They set out, while Kora\u0107 stayed behind. The night grew long. The group headed to a cafe, leaving in two cars.\n\nThe first, a lightning-fast Audi 100LS, was driven by Kre\u0161imir \u0106osi\u0107, who was going to play at BYU and would later be drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers. The other car was Kora\u0107's Volkswagen. Kora\u0107 warned \u0106osi\u0107, who had a reputation for driving fast, that he would die on the roads if he continued to drive so aggressively with such a fast car.\n\nKora\u0107 returned to the hotel in Sarajevo. It was after 1 a.m. The next morning, Kora\u0107 met with the journalist, then hopped in his Volkswagen for the five-hour drive back to Belgrade.\n\nThat morning dawned with rain. In front of Kora\u0107 was one of his coaches, Ranko Zeravica, and his wife, Zaga. Kora\u0107 had only started driving a year prior. A few kilometers outside of Sarajevo, Kora\u0107 tried to pass another car, but the car wouldn't let him. He tried again.\n\nAs he did, a truck came into the opposite lane.\n\nZeravica witnessed the head-on collision from his rearview mirror.\n\nTanjevi\u0107 visited the hospital where Kora\u0107 had been taken, joining hundreds who waited outside. Hours passed. Then a doctor emerged with grim news. Kora\u0107 was gone.\n\nTanjevic, then 22, and his wife, then 20, began to cry: \"We cry and cry and cry.\" They took the train to Belgrade, crying the whole way.\n\n\"I should've been with him in the car,\" Tanjevi\u0107, now 77, says from his home in Trieste, Italy, his voice breaking. \"I've been living with this for all these years.\"\n\nHe adds, \"That's in my heart. I still live it every day.\"\n\nDjurovic was at home in Belgrade when he got the call: \"He died. Car accident.\"\n\nAt first, Djurovic says he laughed in disbelief. \"Because, for me, he was something abnormal. I thought such big players cannot die, ever.\"\n\nThen, the tears came.\n\n\"I couldn't go out of my home for 10 days,\" Djurovic says. \"I cried every day.\"\n\nDjurovic had begun playing hoops at 14 and, by then, Kora\u0107, 10 years his senior, was a star. He became his teammate at 17, when Kora\u0107 was 27. He played small forward, too. He talked with him about opera, theater, philosophy, psychology and diplomacy. Kora\u0107 was his hero.\n\nFront page headlines splashed across the country: \"Basketball in Grief, Ginger is Gone,\" read one. \"You think a man like him could live 200 years,\" Meneghin says. \"He seemed immortal. You think he cannot die.\"\n\nThe next day, a 2-kilometer long column of residents walked behind his coffin in Sarajevo, stopping to leave flowers where the crash occurred. More than 100,000 attended his funeral in Belgrade.\n\nSays Pazman, \"It wasn't until the day of the funeral that I realized he was gone. The whole nation was in mourning. There's no more of the best in our sports family. No more Kora\u0107.\"\n\nHe became the first Yugoslav athlete to be buried with the highest honors in the Alley of the Illustrious in Belgrade's new cemetery. He became the first athlete to have a street named after him in Belgrade, in the neighborhood where he lived. When he died, the Olympic flag was placed over his coffin, because the Yugoslavia president said that Kora\u0107 was bigger than his country -- he belonged to the world.\n\nIn Sombor, the house where Kora\u0107 was born became a landmark. In Belgrade, a memorial was created and a sports hall bears his name. Eight streets in eight cities across Serbia bear his name. There are men's and women's club teams that bear his name. Two years after his passing, FIBA founded the \"Kora\u0107 Cup,\" an international tournament that lasted until 2003, when the Basketball Federation of Serbia and Montenegro renamed its national cup the Radivoj Kora\u0107 Cup, a domestic tournament that continues. A memorial for him lives inside FIBA's Geneva headquarters. The Yugoslav Basketball Federation declared that games would no longer be played on June 2, the day that he died. OKK Belgrade retired his No. 5, and, today, the gym where they play is named after him. A photo of him hangs in front of their arena. And, each year, the team returns to his grave in Belgrade and places flowers.\n\nStill, his name has faded with time.\n\n\"It's sad, but I did not know much about him growing up,\" says Darko Milicic, a Serbian player and the No. 2 pick in the 2003 NBA draft. \"We all heard about him, but, as the new generation, we followed what was happening now.\"\n\n\"I am sure that nobody from [the] young players knows anything about him,\" says Misko Raznatovic, a former Serbian player who has become an agent to the most prominent players from the country, including Jokic.\n\n\"He died 20 years before they were born. When I started to play in mid-'70s, nobody really talked a lot about him. I found out [his] story much later.\"\n\nTWO YEARS AFTER Kora\u0107 died, a man named Gordan Matic was born in Kragujevac, one of the larger cities in Serbia, located about 3\u00bd hours southeast from Sombor. Matic grew up in a country still mourning its fallen star. He heard people speak about how there would never be another Kora\u0107, about what a tragedy his death was.\n\nYears passed. More documentaries about great basketball players and great teams emerged. Matic grew to love the game, but he never saw anything about Kora\u0107.\n\n\"OK, I'm a filmmaker,\" he told himself. \"So why don't I make one?\"\n\nHe started in 2008. It took years to raise money, to travel across Europe and interview everyone he could -- about 130 people, all told, who knew or were affiliated with Kora\u0107.\n\nHe learned how Kora\u0107 impacted life in his country far beyond basketball, including bringing albums from new musicians -- such as the Beatles -- back to Belgrade, where he gave them to the radio station to play. He learned how Kora\u0107 was skilled at chess, math, handball, table tennis, soccer and high jumped competitively. He learned how Kora\u0107 never went anywhere without a book, that he loved Faulkner and Joyce, that he took his teammates to the ballet, opera and concerts. He learned that Kora\u0107 spoke English, Italian and French and grew close with Nobel Prize-winning author Ivo Andric.\n\nMore than anything, Matic learned why basketball became the country's national sport.\n\nIn February 2012, 4,000 people filled the Sava Center in Belgrade to watch Matic's film, \"Ginger: More than a Game.\" It was an emotional affair. Members of FIBA attended, the president of Serbia attended, even teammates from his national teams attended. Tanjevi\u0107 organizes dinners in Belgrade with players from that era, and, every time, there are more and more empty seats.\n\nAfter playing with Kora\u0107, Djurovic began coaching. His career spanned a half-century on teams across Europe. He traveled around the world, and he'd find himself still talking about Kora\u0107. Even just a few years ago, Djurovic was in Singapore, addressing a team, and he mentioned Kora\u0107 -- how he practiced, how he played.\n\n\"Nobody knows him,\" he told himself. \"I'm crazy. I'm still talking about Kora\u0107.\"\n\nIn 2012, Djurovic got a call about a 17-year-old who was playing for Mega Basket of the Adriatic League. He watched the young player in a scrimmage.\n\n\"He was so abnormal,\" Djurovic says. \"He was so smart. He played with everybody. He really passes. No quickness, no jumping, no power, and he played fantastic.\"\n\nTODAY, AT 75, Djurovic watches Jokic at 4 a.m., along with so many others across Serbia.\n\nHe and others who played with or knew Kora\u0107 make clear that there is no competition: Jokic is the better player. \"Jokic, it is incredible what he's doing with his body,\" Djurovic says. \"His body is not good at all -- not only for basketball, for anything. But when you play him and you go to the basket, he is a wall. He's heavy. He's strong.\n\n\"But, technically, his thinking is very quick, very smart. Kora\u0107 is the same.\"\n\nJokic' basketball IQ is perhaps the trait that is highlighted the most. Before a March 2 game at Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles, Nuggets coach Michael Malone was asked to compare Lakers star LeBron James, who was about to break the 40,000-point mark, and Jokic. Malone focused on their intellect, on their ability to see plays before they happened.\n\nThe Nuggets won the game 124-114, their eighth straight win over the Lakers, and Jokic overshadowed James' milestone with 35 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists.\n\nAfter the game, in the hallway near the Nuggets' locker room, a Serbian reunion began to form.\n\nThere was Jokic. There was Divac, now 56, who was born one year before Kora\u0107 died. There was Marko Jaric, who played for the LA Clippers, Timberwolves and Memphis Grizzlies. There was Ognjen Stojakovi\u0107, a former Serbian coach who is now a Nuggets assistant coach. And there was Novak Djokovic, the dominant Serbian tennis star.\n\nThey stood together, talking, laughing and speaking their native language.\n\n\"He is probably the bright star for most people back home,\" Jokic said of Djokovic. \"They see him as a winner. He puts our country on top of the world many, many times. He put Serbia on top for a lot of years.\"\n\nBut the same is no doubt true for Jokic.\n\nIn 2022, he won his second consecutive NBA MVP, and, as fate would have it, Kora\u0107 was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame just a few months later. The taped enshrinement speech was delivered by his brother, Djordje. Nine months later, Jokic led the Nuggets to their first championship, earning Finals MVP honors.\n\nAnd one month after that title, the Basketball Federation of Serbia raised a banner on the facade of the West Gate tower in Belgrade, a 36-story skyscraper that, for decades, was the country's tallest building.\n\nThe banner spanned 85 feet wide and 226 feet tall and required eight hours of work from eight workers to install. It aimed to honor the 100th year anniversary of basketball in the country, where an American Red Cross worker first introduced the sport in 1923.\n\n\"Longer than a century, more than a game,\" the banner read.\n\nIt also featured two players whose likeness -- and the motto -- would be shown on 70 billboards in 25 major cities across Serbia.\n\nOne of those players was, of course, Jokic.\n\n\"It means a lot just to feel appreciated,\" Jokic says. \"It's always nice to feel the love from the country and the city.\"\n\nThe other player on the banner, just beside Jokic, was another fabled son of

Milojevi\u0107, part of the staff that helped the Warriors win the 2022 NBA championship, was 46.\n\nCoach Deki was known for calling everyone on the team 'brate,' which means brother in Serbian.\n\nTo honor his memory, the Warriors all wore 'brate' shirts when they returned to practice following Milojevi\u0107's death. The shirts also have a heart on the upper left side with Milojevi\u0107's initials.\n\nWarriors head coach Steve Kerr said in January that the team would be sending the shirts around the NBA to \"anyone who knew him and loved him.\"\n\n\"To be honest, I'm wearing this shirt pretty much every day, especially when I'm in the training facility,\" Jokic, who is also from Serbia, told the Associated Press. \"Deki was the guy who gave me the freedom. He showed me the way how you're supposed to do things -- act, train, workout. ... He trusted me and I can just say, 'thank you.'\"\n\nJokic became the first player in Nuggets franchise history to win the league's MVP award in 2021 and repeated in 2022.

He joins an exclusive club of players who won three or more MVPs that includes only eight others in NBA history. So just how well does the Joker's four-year run stack up against the other greats' best? Here's a look:\n\nMuch like his rival, Wilt Chamberlain, the challenge with Russell is picking which four-year run is his apex -- and with limited numbers to do so. The NBA didn't count blocks or steals and didn't select an All-Defensive team during his time. Nor was there player tracking data or advanced numbers that could account for things like his one-on-one defense. Still, Russell leads in the stat that matters: four championships in four years, which was part of a run of eight straight from 1959 to '66. Nobody touches that.\n\nThe honors: 3x MVP, 1x NBA champion, 3x All-NBA First Team, 1x scoring champion, 4x rebounding champion\n\nAgain, good luck picking out which four-year run was Wilt's best. Certainly, he had better stretches in terms of scoring (42.9 points/game from 1959-63). But this particular four-year window in the late '60s is notable for a few reasons. First, he won three straight MVPs from 1966 to '68. Second, he became one of the game's most accomplished passers. His minutes-played numbers are incredible, especially in an era when players flew commercial on the road. Wilt missed five games during this period. Total.\n\nThe honors: 3x MVP, 1x NBA champion, 1x Finals MVP, 4x All-NBA First Team, 2x All-Defense (1x First Team), 2x scoring champion\n\nThe best run of Kareem's career is missing some context. The NBA didn't count blocks and steals until the 1973-74 season, and he led the league in blocks/game four times after that. Still, his win shares per 48 minutes -- an advanced stat that attempts to quantify a player's overall impact on winning -- is the best of any player in this group. Five of his six NBA championships came later, but helping Oscar Robertson win one in Milwaukee deserves a tip of the cap. He also won three of his six MVPs.\n\nThe honors: 2x MVP, 1x NBA champion, 1x Finals MVP, 2x All-NBA First Team, 2x All-NBA Second Team, 1x All-Defense (First Team), 3x rebounding champion.\n\nLess celebrated than his contemporaries, the 6-foot-10 Malone was easily the most dominant rebounder of his era and a load in the paint. While his advanced stats trail nearly everyone on this list, this particular four-year run saw him nab two of his three MVP awards, culminating with the \"Fo' Fo' Fo'\" 76ers rampaging to an NBA championship. The center opposite him in those NBA Finals that ended in a four-game sweep? Some guy named Kareem.\n\nThe honors: 3x MVP, 2x NBA champion, 2x Finals MVP, 4x All-NBA First Team, 1x All-Defense (Second Team)\n\nBird became just the third player in NBA history to win three straight MVPs during this four-year stretch -- a feat that hasn't been accomplished since. This period is, of course, defined by Bird's rivalry with Magic Johnson, with the Celtics and Lakers meeting three times in the NBA Finals and Magic's Lakers coming out on top twice. It's been argued that the 1985-86 Celtics -- 67-15, 40-1 at home -- represent the greatest team in NBA history. That was also the last of the Legend's three MVPs.\n\nThe honors: 3x MVP, 2x NBA champion, 1x Finals MVP, 4x All-NBA First Team, 1x assist champion.\n\nThe other half of one of the NBA's great rivalries, Magic assumed control of the NBA by the latter half of the 1980s. At this point, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was on the tail end of his career, and Magic was entering his prime with three MVP awards in four seasons (Michael Jordan won the other). Known for his ability to orchestrate an offense, he was the NBA's assist leader just once over this four-year run, but his scoring peaked as he became an efficient shooter who was near automatic at the free-throw line (87.6%).\n\nThe honors: 2x MVP, 3x NBA champion, 3x Finals MVP, 4x All-NBA First Team, 4x All-Defense (First Team), 4x scoring champion\n\nHad Jordan played four full seasons around his second three-peat, there might be a debate over which is his best four-year span. Even then, probably not. Not only did Jordan claim the first of two three-peats during this stretch, but he was also the scoring champ all four seasons and All-Defense all four seasons while twice leading the league in steals and games played. Throw in his playoff numbers (34.3 points, 6.6 rebounds, 6.6 assists, 50.1% shooting over 74 games) and this run is unassailable.\n\nThe honors: 3x MVP, 2x NBA champion, 2x Finals MVP, 4x All-NBA First Team, 4x All-Defense (First Team)\n\nThe ascent of King James begins here, when LeBron made \"The Decision\" and broke Cavaliers fans' hearts by taking his talents to South Beach. The efficiency and two-way consistency speak volumes as a four-time All-NBA and All-Defense selection. But playoff pitfalls -- a 4-2 Celtics series loss to end his first Cleveland stint, and an NBA Finals no-show vs. the Mavs in 2010-11 -- haunt this period of LeBron's career. Oddly enough, he hasn't won another MVP since claiming No. 4 in 2012-13.\n\nThe honors: 3x MVP, 1x NBA champion*, 1x NBA Finals MVP*, 3x All-NBA First Team, 1x All-NBA Second Team\n\nAn argument could be made that this four-year stretch is as good or better than any in NBA history. Ignore, for a moment, that Jokic fell one spot shy of becoming the first player to win four straight NBA MVP awards (thanks, Joel Embiid). Instead focus on the advanced stats. Jokic's 66.3 true shooting percentage is the best of the lot. His win shares per 48 trails only Kareem. And his Box Plus/Minus (BPM) number is easily the best -- although that obviously doesn't include Wilt, Russell or Kareem. Simply put, Jokic has been no joke.\n\nSource: basketball-reference.com", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_schubert@denverpost.com", "name": "Matt Schubert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilt_Chamberlain", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wilt Chamberlain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magic Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TDP-L-NUGGETS-LAKERS_AAO3329xx-1.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

He also took a massive leap in his career by becoming the latest NBA superstar with his own signature sneaker, a long overdue eventuality. He recently opened up about his brand, 361, and why he chose them above some of the more recognizable names in the game. Check out our Sneakers news for more upcoming releases and breaking content!\n\nNikola Jokic announced his brand partnership with Chinese sportswear brand 361 Degrees around the holidays in December 2023. It was a move that shocked the basketball world as most fans expected sneaker giants like Nike or Adidas to snag the then two-time MVP. Teammate Aaron Gordon has been signed to the brand for quite some time, so it makes sense that the connection was made through someone close to Jokic.\n\nFast forward to 2024, and 361 has released several models for Jokic under the BIG3 silhouette, which he's been favoring in the meantime before his own signature model drops. With the Nuggets still fighting in the Playoffs, expect the roll-out for Jokic's first signature shoe to come sometime in the offseason.\n\nThe 2024 MVP recently opened up about what drew him towards 361 as a brand. Typically staying out of the limelight and keeping his endorsements to a minimum, Jokic has been vocal about how pleased he's been with the brand and most of all, the caliber of the footwear.\n\n\"361 showed up with great respect for me...they're very popular and actually an upscaling brand. Maybe I can help them in some ways.\"\n\nWhen speaking further on the deal, it's clear the most important aspect was the actual performance and feel of the shoe for Jokic. \"They really made a shoe where the comfort is there and they did a really good job.\"\n\nPrior to signing with 361 Degrees, Jokic was seen wearing different high-top basketball sneakers from Nike and even rocking some Adidas models earlier in his playing days with Denver. It's been a longtime coming for him to receive his own shoe and now that it's finally here, the \"Joker\" can begin fully building his brand outside of just basketball.\n\nWith Nike and Adidas already being home to so many NBA stars as an endorser, growing numbers of players have wandered off the beaten path and sought sneaker partnerships from overseas brands. Lakers' Austin Reaves signed a six-figure deal with Rigorer and took over as one of their Chief Creative Officers. Mavericks' Kyrie Irving walked his own path after leaving Nike, becoming Creative Director and the face of sportswear brand ANTA. Many players continue to do the same and with the MVP of the league signing with a smaller, more unique brand like 361, it could open the floodgates for other players around the league to do the same.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dominik_zawartko@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Dominik Zawartko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sneakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/361\u02da", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "361\u02da"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportswear", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sportswear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footwear", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Footwear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Reaves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin Reaves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Branding", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Branding", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Footwear", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Footwear", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/7382857237.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

While Jokic did outplay him in that series, the gap between both superstars' production wasn't exactly that wide.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Karl", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Karl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walt Disney World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EQZ00Usqu2RHKYtMwCkGdQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03MjA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/lebron_wire_usa_today_sports_articles_234/d3cf25faf92c2ca8c22dfb828316a86b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

Credits: USA TODAY Sports\n\nNikola Jokic winning his third regular season MVP award in the last four years seems to have ruffled some feathers. After Shaquille O'Neal's initial outburst upon congratulating the Denver Nuggets star, Dwight Howard has joined the bandwagon. The former NBA star expressed his disappointment on X, while also name-dropping some former and current NBA stars who were snubbed from winning the coveted title.\n\nThe MVP title has become polarizing in the last few years, attracting controversies following the announcement. This time it was no different. In the standard voting process, Jokic received 926 points with 79 people putting him at the top.\n\nThe runner-up and Shaq's MVP choice Shai Gilgeous-Alexander received 640 points with only 15 voters deeming him fit for the first position. It's unclear who Howard was rooting for in the MVP race, but he seems to have raised a fair question. He wrote,\n\n\"First off I think it's still a lack of clarity of what \"MVP\" means and the way it's voted on. Is it the best player? Or the player who has the most value to his teams success?\"\n\nHoward also outlined that players like Shaq and the late, great Kobe Bryant only won one MVP title in their illustrious careers, \"It still intrigues me that Kobe & even Shaq only have 1 MVP. Also it's crazy that Bron doesn't have more MVP's than anyone else... he's probably the most snubbed.\"\n\nHe also expressed concern over Dwyane Wade and Jerry West never winning the award in their careers. While his confusion and questions are understandable, the process is fairly easy. Additionally, until 1980, the players were responsible for voting the MVP title. So, that clears out any controversy regarding 'The Logo' not winning it even once.\n\nFollowing that, the NBA handed this responsibility to a large group of journalists who get to rank their own top five. The number one spot is worth 10 points, number two is seven points, number three is five points, number four is three points, and number five is one point.\n\nBased on the rankings a player receives from the media members, a cumulative score is generated, and the player with the highest score wins the title. The lengthy post from Howard begs a question, is he alluding that he was also snubbed in the process?\n\nWhen Howard was with the Magic in 2011, he had his closest shot to becoming a league MVP. According to Stat Muse, Superman averaged 22.9 points, 14.1 rebounds, and 2.4 blocks in 78 games. He made the All-Star selection for the fifth time in his career and won his third DPOY. Despite clocking a special season, Howard finished second on the final list by a huge margin.\n\nDerrick Rose beat him for the title, who averaged 25.0 points, 7.7 assists, and 4.1 rebounds in 81 games. On the final scoresheet, Rose accumulated 1182 points with 113 media members putting him up for the first spot. Howard couldn't even give a decent challenge to Rose, finishing with 643 points with only three people putting him in first place.\n\nThere is a lot of speculation about Rose winning the title that season, as it overshadowed Howard's efforts to bring the injury-ridden Orlando Magic to the playoffs and LeBron James' incredible run to the finals. Thus, there might be chances that Howard has a personal reason here.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prateek_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Prateek Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Howard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dwight Howard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dwyane Wade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_West", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerry West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/0aea25b2-untitled-design-2024-05-09t212024.084.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1}

The questions included below are paraphrased for brevity and clarity, and Jokic's responses are shortened in some cases.\n\nYou're never shy about your disinterest in the MVP race. How have your feelings toward the award changed since the first time you won? Have you accepted more that it's a part of your annual reality now, or do you feel more opposed to it than you did the first time?\n\nJokic: \"I cannot control it. I mean, I can control it. But I cannot control it. So if they're gonna put me in that conversation -- it's been three or four years now -- I think I'm kind of used to it, so I don't even pay attention anymore. So probably a good problem to have.\"\n\nWhen you were playing in Serbia, how beyond the realm of possibility did it feel to someday be the best player in the NBA, let alone make it to the league?\n\nJokic: \"To be honest, I liked last year when I didn't get (the MVP) and then we won a championship. Much better. But I don't know what to say. It's a journey. It's a process. It's trusting your teammates, teammates trusting you. It's just a whole collective effort that put me in front of, like, the bright spotlight. And I'm kind of the guy, but there's a lot of people, players, coaches, strength coaches, development coaches, medical staff behind me. Family, of course. You guys don't see it, and I'm just one of them.\"\n\nWhat does it mean to have family here at Ball Arena for the moment of the announcement?\n\nJokic: \"I didn't invite them. They just showed up. I'm like, who wants to drive 45 minutes here to get it? ... It's nice. It's a special moment that probably I'm gonna remember my whole life.\"\n\nWill there be a time when you stop to think about your place in history, being one of nine players to win three MVPs?\n\nJokic: \"When I won the first time, I was like, 'OK, this is cool. This is nice.' When I won the second time, the list was way shorter. And now the list is kind of short short. So I'm just happy to be part of that group of guys, which is not a bad group of guys, right? ... It's a legacy for after the career, and I think I'm gonna be more, maybe, proud of myself after my career than I am right now.\"\n\nHas fatherhood changed how you view legacy at all?\n\nJokic: \"Yes, in a good way. Basketball doesn't mean that much. And probably that helps me, too. It's a job. It's a thing that I like, of course. I like to play the game. Everything else, eh. But yes, being a father, that means that you don't play just for yourself or just the teammates you have. ... Maybe when you're older, you don't want (your children and grandchildren) to look at your videos or whatever and say that you were bad. Hopefully I can talk a lot of trash when my kids or my nephews grow up. So I'm gonna be a cool grandpa.\"\n\nWhat did Dejan 'Deki' Milojevic mean to you? (Jokic's former coach in Serbia, who died this year when he was an assistant coach for the Warriors)\n\nJokic: \"He meant to me more now when he was not a coach to me anymore. He was my friend. He was our family friend. He was always in my house when he was here, and we were always going to his house when we were in Golden State. So it was just like a really, really quality friendship, with a lot of telling truth between each other and being honest. I think Deki was a guy who you always want to have as a friend. Someone who's going to tell you how it is with no lying and no trying to hide anything.\"\n\nYou're wearing your warm-up shirt that pays tribute to Milojevic. Is today a day to reflect on people like him who have helped your development? How significant was he in that regard?\n\nJokic: \"To be honest, I'm wearing this shirt pretty much every day. Especially when I'm in the training facility. Deki was a guy who gave me freedom. He showed me the way how you're supposed to do things: act, train, work out, having positive energy, having positive attitude. You can just see how many players and people he affected. He had a positive effect on me, like I said, probably more now as a friend than when he was my coach. But yes, basketball-wise, he gave me the freedom to do whatever I want to do. And he trusted me, and I can just say thank you.\"\n\nPeople often debate the greatest athletes in Denver sports history, whether it's John Elway or Joe Sakic. What does it mean to be in a conversation with those local figures?\n\nJokic: \"I've heard about them. It's -- (laughs) -- I don't want to start this conversation. Can we not? You know, living in Denver, whatever, being a part of Denver, I think it's cool to have, even hockey right now. I think it's just, enjoy the moment. Because I was here when we were not that good. And everybody was talking bad to us and thinking bad of us. So just enjoy the moment. Enjoy the process. Because it's gonna pass, probably. Everything passes. This is gonna pass, too. So I think enjoy the moment and be happy.\"\n\nWhat's your relationship to how beloved you've become in Denver with this fanbase?\n\nJokic: \"This is gonna be my second home (someday), and hopefully I'm gonna come one time here after I finish career and still have friends here. I feel the respect that they show me. I'm hanging at Washington Park and everybody's treating me -- like, they're really respectful. And I really appreciate it. Nobody's really, I'm gonna say, aggressively bugging me. Does that make any sense? Because I'm with a kid, and they really respect me, and I really appreciate that. They're a really good fanbase. I'm really happy that they're on our side every time, when we are down or up. They're our sixth player. And people in Denver, I think they are really, really, really chill.\"\n\nThere's a chance Avalanche center Nathan MacKinnon wins the MVP award in the NHL. What are your thoughts on there potentially being two MVPs in the same building?\n\nJokic: \"I watched a game back in February. They lost last night (in Game 1 vs. Dallas), right? They won? I didn't watch it because I had other things to do. But I love the sport, first of all, and I love even being a fan. Like, when I'm going to the games. I'm a fan of the Avalanche. ... And they're trusting their players and they're trusting Nathan. And he's playing good. He's really fast on those skates. It's really, really fast, right? Because I don't know how to skate. And how physical, how much energy (there) is when they play. It's much better live than when you watch it on TV.\"\n\nHow does this compare to the surprise party the Nuggets gave you in Serbia when you won MVP?\n\nJokic: \"I mean, doesn't mean that we're not gonna do it (again). Maybe just not right away. But maybe when everything's finished. Why not?\"\n\nAs much as you've accomplished before the age of 30, have you thought about how long you want to play? What will determine when you retire someday?\n\nJokic: \"Hopefully I'm gonna be ready. I think that the determination is gonna be if I can perform at a high level or not. I think I'm not gonna take a spot from some young guys or put the franchise down. As long as I can play on the highest level and help the team, I think I'm gonna play until then.\"", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bennett_durando@denverpost.com", "name": "Bennett Durando", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dejan_Milojevi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dejan Milojevi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ball Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Sakic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Sakic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Elway", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Elway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TDP-L-NUGGETS-JOKIC-MVPAO2_4803xxx.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550375", "eventUri": "eng-9550375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 452987966, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 201, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 201}}}

for the sale and shipment of Iranian commodities on behalf of MODAFL to jurisdictions including China, Russia and Venezuela, were also targeted.\n\nAn Iran-based company involved in the procurement and development of unmanned aerial vehicles, its leadership and an Iranian cargo airline were also among those hit with sanctions.\n\nThe U.S. earlier this month had warned it would impose further sanctions on Iran following its unprecedented attack on Israel.\n\nWashington has since taken measures, including targeting Iran's drone program, steel industry and cyber actors.\n\nIran this month launched more than 300 drones and missiles against Israel, its first direct attack on the country, in retaliation for a suspected Israeli airstrike on its embassy compound in Damascus on April 11 that killed elite military officers.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

US Treasury Department in a statement said the action, taken in coordination with the United Kingdom and Canada, targets over one dozen entities, individuals, and vessels it accused of playing a key role in facilitating and financing the clandestine sale of Iranian unmanned aerial vehicles to Iran's Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL).\n\nMODAFL in turn supports Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a US-designated terrorist organization, and Russia's war in Ukraine, the Treasury said.\n\n\"Iran's Ministry of Defense continues to destabilize the region and world with its support to Russia's war in Ukraine, unprecedented attack on Israel, and proliferation of UAVs and other dangerous military hardware to terrorist proxies,\" Treasury's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian Nelson, said.\n\nWashington also targeted two companies and a vessel involved in the shipment of Iranian commodities, the Treasury said.\n\n\"The United States, in close coordination with our British and Canadian partners, will continue to use all means available to combat those who would finance Iran's destabilizing activities,\" Nelson said.\n\nIran's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Treasury said it targeted Sahara Thunder, accusing it of being a main front company that oversees MODAFL's commercial activities in support of the IRGC and Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nIt said the company plays a key role in Iran's design, development, manufacture, and sale of thousands of drones, many of them ultimately transferred to Russia for use against Ukraine.\n\nAs of 2022, Russian officials were negotiating a deal for Sahara Thunder to deliver and produce thousands of drones per year at a facility in Russia under US sanctions, the Treasury said.\n\nSahara Thunder's leadership and shipping network, which the Treasury said the company relied on for the sale and shipment of Iranian commodities on behalf of MODAFL to jurisdictions including China, Russia, and Venezuela, were also targeted.\n\nAn Iran-based company involved in the procurement and development of unmanned aerial vehicles, its leadership, and an Iranian cargo airline were also among those hit with sanctions.\n\nThe US earlier this month had warned it would impose further sanctions on Iran following its unprecedented attack on Israel.\n\nWashington has since taken measures, including targeting Iran's drone program, steel industry, and cyber actors.\n\nIran this month launched more than 300 drones and missiles against Israel, its first direct attack on the country, in retaliation for a suspected Israeli air strike on its embassy compound in Damascus on April 11 that killed IRGC officers.", "source": {"uri": "algemeiner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Algemeiner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The US Department of Treasury said these companies, individuals and vessels have played a central role in facilitating and financing the clandestine sale of Iranian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nWhile Sahara Thunder has been identified as the main front company that oversees Iran's commercial activities in support of these efforts, the three India-based companies to have been slapped with sanctions for supporting Sahara Thunder are Zen Shipping, Port India Private Limited, and Sea Art Ship Management (OPC) Private Limited.\n\nIranian military entity Sahara Thunder relies on a vast shipping network involved in the sale and shipment of Iranian commodities on behalf of Iran's Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) to multiple jurisdictions including the People's Republic of China (PRC), Russia, and Venezuela, the Treasury said.\n\n\"Sahara Thunder has entered into time-charter contracts with India-based Zen Shipping and Port India Private Limited for the Cook Islands-flagged vessel CHEM (IMO 9240914), which is managed and operated by UAE-based Safe Seas Ship Management FZE,\" it said.\n\n\"Sahara Thunder has used the CHEM to conduct multiple shipments of commodities since 2022. Iran-based Arsang Safe Trading Co. has provided ship management services in support of several Sahara Thunder-related shipments, including those by the CHEM,\" the Treasury said.\n\nAccording to the Treasury, Iran-based Asia Marine Crown Agency has served as the port agent in Bandar Abbas, Iran supporting several Sahara Thunder shipments.\n\n\"India-based Sea Art Ship Management (OPC) Private Limited and UAE-based company Trans Gulf Agency LLC have worked together to provide ship management services in support of Sahara Thunder. The UAE and Iran-based Coral Trading EST. have purchased Iranian commodities from Sahara Thunder,\" it said.\n\n\"Iran's Ministry of Defence continues to destabilise the region and world with its support to Russia's war in Ukraine, unprecedented attack on Israel, and proliferation of UAVs and other dangerous military hardware to terrorist proxies,\" said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson.\n\n\"The United States, in close coordination with our British and Canadian partners, will continue to use all means available to combat those who would finance Iran's destabilising activities,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_held_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Privately held company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sahara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Front organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_E._Nelson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian E.

playing a key role in facilitating and financing the clandestine sale of Iranian unmanned aerial vehicles to Iran's Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL).\n\nMODAFL in turn supports Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) and Russia's war in Ukraine, the Treasury said.\n\nUS Announces New Sanctions on Iran After Missile and Drone Strike on Israel\n\n\"Iran's Ministry of Defense continues to destabilize the region and world with its support to Russia's war in Ukraine, unprecedented attack on Israel, and proliferation of UAVs and other dangerous military hardware to terrorist proxies,\" Treasury's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian Nelson, said.\n\nWashington also targeted two companies and a vessel involved in the shipment of Iranian commodities, the Treasury said.\n\n\"The United States, in close coordination with our British and Canadian partners, will continue to use all means available to combat those who would finance Iran's destabilizing activities,\" Nelson said.\n\nIran's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSAHARA THUNDER PLAYING KEY ROLE\n\nThe Treasury said it targeted Sahara Thunder, accusing it of being a main front company that oversees MODAFL's commercial activities in support of the IRGC and Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nIt said the company plays a key role in Iran's design, development, manufacture and sale of thousands of drones, many of them ultimately transferred to Russia for use against Ukraine.\n\nAs of 2022, Russian officials were negotiating a deal for Sahara Thunder to deliver and produce thousands of drones per year at a facility in Russia under U.S. sanctions, the Treasury said.\n\nSahara Thunder's leadership and shipping network, which the Treasury said the company relied on for the sale and shipment of Iranian commodities on behalf of MODAFL to jurisdictions including China, Russia and Venezuela, were also targeted.\n\nAn Iran-based company involved in the procurement and development of unmanned aerial vehicles, its leadership and an Iranian cargo airline were also among those hit with sanctions.\n\nThe U.S. earlier this month had warned it would impose further sanctions on Iran following its unprecedented attack on Israel.\n\nWashington has since taken measures, including targeting Iran's drone program, steel industry and cyber actors.\n\nIran this month launched more than 300 drones and missiles against Israel, its first direct attack on the country, in retaliation for a suspected Israeli air strike on its embassy compound in Damascus on April 11 that killed elite military officers.\n\nVIDEO: Islamic Republic Officials Are Accused of Crimes Against Humanity\n\n(Reporting by Daphne

The US has penalised Iran for support to non-state proxy groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and Palestine Islamic Jihad, which it sees as terrorist organisations.\n\nThe US Department of Treasury said these companies, individuals and vessels have played a central role in facilitating and financing the clandestine sale of Iranian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to Russia's war in Ukraine. Iranian military entity Sahara Thunder has been identified as the main front company that oversees Iran's commercial activities in support of these efforts. Russia has been accused of sourcing weapons from other sanctioned countries like North Korea and Iran to replenish its artillery requirements in Ukraine.\n\nAdditionally, the three India-based companies to have been slapped with sanctions for supporting Sahara Thunder are Zen Shipping, Port India Private Limited, and Sea Art Ship Management (OPC) Private Limited. Sahara Thunder relies on a vast shipping network involved in the sale and shipment of Iranian commodities on behalf of Iran's Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) to multiple jurisdictions including the People's Republic of China (PRC), Russia, and Venezuela, the Treasury said.\n\n\"Sahara Thunder has entered into time-charter contracts with India-based Zen Shipping and Port India Private Limited for the Cook Islands-flagged vessel CHEM (IMO 9240914), which is managed and operated by UAE-based Safe Seas Ship Management FZE,\" it said. \"Sahara Thunder has used the CHEM to conduct multiple shipments of commodities since 2022. Iran-based Arsang Safe Trading Co. has provided ship management services in support of several Sahara Thunder-related shipments, including those by the CHEM.\"\n\n\"India-based Sea Art Ship Management (OPC) Private Limited and UAE-based company Trans Gulf Agency LLC have worked together to provide ship management services in support of Sahara Thunder. The UAE and Iran-based Coral Trading EST. have purchased Iranian commodities from Sahara Thunder,\" it further said.\n\nUnder Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E Nelson asserted that Iran is working on destabilising the region and the world by supporting Russia's war on Ukraine and the unprecedented attack on its arch-nemesis Israel earlier this month that raised fears of a wider war in the Middle East.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the US warned Pakistan of massive sanctions, if it considers any business deal with Iran. \"Just let me say broadly, we advise anyone considering business deals with Iran to be aware of the potential risk of sanctions,\" Vedant Patel, Deputy Spokesperson of the US State Department. This came during Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi's visit to Pakistan.\n\nIt is worth mentioning Iran and Pakistan had signed a multi-billion dollar to build a gas pipeline in June 2009. Although Tehran had finished installing a 900 km pipeline on its side by 2011, Islamabad is yet to finish the project of installing 80 km on its side. After missing multiple deadlines, an annoyed Tehran warned Islamabad that it would drag it into the international court and also alerted to impose a fine of $18 billion. Although Pakistan has recently pledged to finish the project by September this year, it is unlikely Islamabad will complete it.\n\nThe US and UK imposed a fresh round of sanctions on Iran in response to Tehran's unprecedented attack on Israel over the weekend, when it launched hundreds of drones and missiles in response to a suspected Israeli attack on the Iranian embassy in Syria on April 1. US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control targeted 16 people and two entities in Iran that produce engines that power the drones used in the April 13 attack on Israel.\n\nEU leaders have also vowed to ramp up sanctions on Iran, targeting its drone and missile deliveries to proxies in Gaza, Yemen and Lebanon. The bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the existing EU sanctions regime would be strengthened and expanded to punish Tehran and help prevent future attacks on Israel. At the same time, he said, Israel needed to exercise restraint.\n\n(with inputs from agencies)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [],

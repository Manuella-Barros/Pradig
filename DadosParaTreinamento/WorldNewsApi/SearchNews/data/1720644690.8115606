At the start of April last year, outlets began reporting that Taylor and Joe had split after six years together. At the time, a source said: \"It was not dramatic. The relationship had just run its course. It's why [Alwyn] hasn't been spotted at any [Eras Tour] shows.\" Then, almost exactly a year later, Taylor broke her silence on their split with her new album and the gut-wrenching lyrics that it contains. Taylor dated British actor Joe for a long time and spent six years living with him in London before a seemingly acrimonious breakup at the start of last year. For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US. READ MORE: Taylor Swift seemingly references Joe Alwyn breakup with heartbreaking lyrics from new album In her track So Long, London, which is track number five on TTPD, Taylor can be heard bidding a sad farewell to their relationship. Taylor croons: \"I\u2019m p---ed off you let me give you all that youth for free.\" She then shares the visions she had of the pair tying the knot, as she continues: \"You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues? I died on the altar waiting for the proof.\" Also in the track, Taylor appears to hit out at Joe for forcing her to leave the city she loves. She sings: \"I\u2019m just mad as hell \u2018cause I loved this place.\" This isn't the first time that Taylor has hinted at wanting to marry Joe in a song. In her Midnights track You're Losing Me, which was written in 2021 and released last spring, Taylor sings: \"And I wouldn't marry me either / A pathological people pleaser / Who only wanted you to see her.\" And in her 2019 title track Lover, from her album of the same name, Taylor seemingly hinted at marriage once again. \"Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?\" Taylor sings in the lovey-dovey hit, continuing to croon: \"With every guitar string scar on my hand / I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover / My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue / All's well that ends well to end up with you / Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover.\" Taylor is bringing her Eras Tour to the capital later this month when she takes to the stage at London's Wembley Arena on June 21, 22, 23. She'll then be heading further afield throughout Europe, with her due back in the capital for a further five sold-out shows (August 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20). A version of this story was first published on April 19, 2024.

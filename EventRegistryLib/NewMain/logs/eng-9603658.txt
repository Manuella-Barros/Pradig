The iPad has long been a product that is used in portrait mode, but we are using it more and more in landscape mode.\"\n\nApple product designer Molly Anderson shared (machine translated): I think it could change, I don't think it's set in stone. We are thinking about it. The iPad has long been a product that is used in portrait mode, but we are using it more and more in landscape mode. We cannot say that it is fixed.\n\nIn a recent interview with Numerama, Molly Anderson, an industrial designer at Apple, was asked about the \"upside down\" logo when the iPad is used in landscape.\n\nHer response?\n\n\"This could change\" in the future, a clear indication that a landscape logo orientation might just find its way into some future iPad models.\n\nAnderson noted that, though the iPad is engineered for use \\\"in all directions,\\\" more and more people have been using it horizontally of late.\n\nApple's actually been doing some of this work on the iPad design to landscape orientation anyway.\n\nThe new 10th-gen iPad, M2 iPad Air, and both iPad Pros now feature front cameras centred along the landscape axis.\n\nAnd since iPadOS 14.5, the logo orientation changes to match how the iPad is held during boot up.\n\nWhile a rotated logo may seem like a minor cosmetic change, it could represent a significant philosophical shift for Apple in how it envisions iPad use going forward.\n\nTraditionally, the tablet has been viewed as a content consumption device best used upright, but Apple itself now markets it as a laptop alternative suited to landscape productivity workflows.\n\nShould Apple implement this logo change, it will be interesting to see how users and critics react.\n\nSome may view it as a logical evolution acknowledging changing user behaviour.\n\nOthers may criticise it as an admission that the iPad has strayed too far from its roots as a distinctly different form of mobile computing.\n\nUltimately, only time will tell if Anderson's vague comments foreshadow an actual change.\n\nApple tends to keep mum on unreleased product plans and details.\n\nBut the shift to landscape for certain iPad features suggests Apple is at least pondering such a logo reorientation for future models.\n\nApple is considering a landscape logo to better align with the growing trend of using iPads in landscape mode, especially with accessories like the Magic Keyboard.\n\nIn an interview with Numerama, Molly Anderson suggested that the orientation of the iPad logo could change in the future to accommodate landscape usage.\n\nThe 10th-gen iPad, M2 iPad Air, and both iPad Pros feature front cameras cantered along the landscape axis, and iPadOS 14.5 changes the logo orientation during boot up to match how the iPad is held.\n\nA landscape logo could symbolize a significant shift in Apple's vision, emphasizing the iPad's role as a laptop alternative and a productivity tool.\n\nUser reactions could vary; some might see it as a logical evolution reflecting changing usage patterns, while others may view it as a departure from the iPad's original design philosophy.\n\nNo, Apple has not made any official announcements. The idea of a landscape logo was hinted at by designer Molly Anderson, but there are no confirmed plans yet.\n\nAlso Read: Apple Launches New iPad Pro and iPad Air Models With OLED Display, M4 Chipset, Apple Pencil Pro, and, More: Price in India, Features, Specs\n\nAlso Read: iPad Pro (2024): Design, Processor, Cameras, Display, and, What To Expect", "source": {"uri": "mymobileindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My Mobile"}, "authors": [{"uri": "team_my_mobile@mymobileindia.com", "name": "Team My Mobile", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_orientation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Page orientation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Product design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS_14", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Industrial design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Booting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Landscaping", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Landscaping", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Landscape", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Landscape", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.mymobileindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-1-243.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603658", "eventUri": "eng-9603658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

Soon after the release, a fresh leak hints at a new change for the upcoming iPads on the rear panel. After arranging the TrueDepth camera system in the landscape orientation, a new report now hints the company could pivot the Apple logo on the back panel of iPads to look upright in landscape orientation, similar to a MacBook.\n\nThe revelation came to the fore when French outlet Numerama interviewed three Apple employees (Apple Designers Molly Anderson and Steve Lemay and Marketing Manager Scott Brodrick) from the iPad division and discussed the design of the latest iPad Pro, the \"thinnest Apple product\". The outlet asked why is the Apple logo on the rear placed in a vertical position compared to the overall preference towards horizontal orientation.\n\nAlso Read: Apple iPad Pro 2024: OLED 120Hz Screen To M4 Processor, 5 Big Upgrades To Expect From Flagship Tablet On May 7\n\nThe response from the Apple executive hints the upcoming iPads may get a realigned logo to suit the horizontal inclination. \"I think it could change, I don't think it's set in stone. We are thinking about it. The iPad has long been a product that is used in portrait mode, but we are using it more and more in landscape mode. We cannot say that it is fixed.\" Molly Anderson said.\n\niPads currently offer an Apple logo positioned in portrait orientation. (Image:Apple)\n\nThe preference weighs as Apple launched the new iPads with a webcam moved to a horizontal position for better video calling experience. Plus, the company has marketed the capabilities of the iPad as similar to a laptop with the Magic Keyboard integration. As for the OS, since iPadOS 14.5, Apple already displays the Apple logo in a landscape position if the tablet is held horizontally, according to MacRumors.\n\nAlso Read: Apple iPad Air 2024 Launched With New 13-Inch Model, AI Features And M2 Chip; Check Price In India, Specs\n\nHowever, Brodrick claims the \"iPad is used in all directions\" and is not sure about the usefulness of the change.

While her response was somewhat vague, Apple employees usually don't talk about possible changes unless they might actually happen. This hints that Apple might be thinking about changing the logo's orientation on the back of iPads to match the MacBooks.\n\nIn 2022, with the launch of the 10th generation iPad, Apple moved the front camera to the center of the screen when the iPad is in landscape mode.

Apple revamped the base iPad in 2022 with a new design, upgraded specs, and several surprise changes. Though Apple priced the 2022 iPad at $449 at launch, it has since lowered the price to $349, making it an even stronger value. The base iPad remains an incredibly capable slate and a better choice than most other models in the same price range, which means it holds onto our Editors' Choice award for affordable tablets.\n\nDesign: An Appealing Exterior\n\nThe 10th-gen Apple iPad looks like the iPad mini ($499), iPad Air ($599), and the iPad Pro ($999). It drops the circular Touch ID button from below the screen, as well as the chunky top and bottom bezels in favor of a uniform edge-to-edge look. A large glass panel covers the display and sits within the aluminum chassis, which has flat side edges and a flat back panel. It's a solid piece of hardware that looks modern and feels well-made.\n\nSize-wise, the iPad family dimensions are nearly identical. The 10th-gen iPad measures 9.79 by 7.07 by 0.28 inches (HWD) and weighs 1.05 pounds (Wi-Fi model). Compare that with the 2024 iPad Air (9.74 by 7.02 by 0.24 inches, 1.02 pounds) and you can see that Apple likes to keep things fairly consistent across its slates. The 10th-gen iPad is small and light enough that it fits easily in backpacks, messenger bags, and even some over-the-shoulder slings, but it's not compact enough for smaller bags or purses that might otherwise accommodate an eight-inch tablet. It's far easier to tote about than the laptop-sized 13-inch iPad Pro.\n\nThe display has a new size, shape, and resolution, but the same overall pixel density year over year. The screen measures 10.9 inches across the diagonal and packs 2,360 by 1,640 pixels, for a density of 264ppi. You get an LED-backlit panel at 500 nits (maximum) brightness with a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating, sRGB color, and True Tone white balance correction. It's not laminated like the iPad Air or iPad Pro displays, nor does it have an antireflective coating -- something that became obvious when attempting to photograph the tablet outdoors. The display appears to be sunken below the protective glass by a millimeter or two, rather than sit flush as it does on the iPad Pro line. This mostly impacts Apple Pencil performance.\n\nIn terms of everyday use, the new iPad's display is great. It has no trouble with HD content from the likes of AppleTV+ or YouTube TV and is more than bright enough for indoor use most of the time. It does struggle outdoors, however, and even in bright rooms illuminated by the sun. (This is where that antireflective coating would really have helped.) It's as good as any other display at this price, though, and much better than what you'll get on a $100 to $300 tablet.\n\nOne of the biggest changes to the entry-level iPad line is also one of the least noticeable. Apple swapped out its proprietary Lightning port in favor of USB-C. (The iPad Pro and iPad Air made this change some time ago.) USB-C has become the standardized port for many electronic devices around the world and replaced Lightning on the iPhone 15 in 2023. Apple includes a USB-C-to-USB-C cable in the box. If you've invested heavily in Lightning-based accessories, the time has come to pay the piper and update your gear.\n\nApple has moved the iPad's speakers, which is a bigger deal than you might think. The outgoing model featured two speakers, but they were next to one another on the bottom edge of the tablet. This meant you'd get imbalanced sound when you tipped the iPad on its side to watch movies or TV shows. Now, the speakers are on opposite edges and this allows for true stereo sound when you hold the tablet in landscape orientation for viewing video. The speakers sound great, by the way.\n\nThe control keys and other physical aspects are about the same as on the iPad Air. A large key on one edge serves to turn off the screen or cycle the power; this key also contains the Touch ID sensor. Training the sensor takes a few moments and it's fast, but not instantaneous, for unlocking the tablet. The separate volume buttons are just around the bend from the Touch ID and work well. A physical SIM card tray is on one edge of the tablet (though the iPad also supports eSIM) and three pogo connectors on the bottom edge help snap magnetic accessories into place, such as the Magic Keyboard.\n\nIn all, the basic design and appearance across the iPad family are now mostly the same.\n\nPerformance: Enough Power for Everyday Use\n\nApple has upgraded almost everything within the confines of this slim slate, and that's good news.\n\nTo start, the 10th-gen iPad jumps one processor generation from the A13 Bionic to the A14 Bionic. It's still behind the M2 chip in the iPad Air and the M4 chip in the iPad Pro, but even one generational jump is good enough. The A14 is a six-core chip with two performance cores and four efficiency cores, as well as a four-core GPU. The A14 stands above the A13 thanks to double the number of Neural Engine cores, leaping from eight to 16. The iPad has 4GB of RAM, which is half the 8GB available to the iPad Air, and the (up to) 16GB available to the iPad Pro. Still, a modest processor jump gets you modest performance gains. This plays out in benchmarks.\n\nStarting with Geekbench 5, the iPad netted single- and multi-core scores of 1,573 and 4,097, respectively, while the 2021 iPad tallied 1,331 and 3,516 on the same test. On the Basemark Web 3.0 Safari test, the 2022 iPad scored 978.04 compared with 821.17 on the 2021 model. Other results include 2,396 on the 3DMark Wild Life Extreme test and 35.66fps on the GFXBench Aztec Ruins test.\n\nIn terms of real-world power, the base iPad has more than most people will ever need. The tablet breezed through every app and game I tried. Heavy-duty creation apps like GarageBand and iMovie flow seamlessly, and even apps that require a quick internet connection, such as Adobe Lightroom, run without a glitch. It's also up to the task when it comes to basic productivity via Google Docs, Outlook email, Slack, and other work apps. If you plan to use the iPad for browsing the web, playing simple games, or viewing the occasional YouTube video, you'll be pleased as punch with the tablet's performance.\n\nThe iPad's storage options are disappointingly carried over from the previous model. That means you get either 64GB ($349) or 256GB ($499), which is stingy, as even the base iPhone comes with 128GB of storage. With the operating system and preinstalled apps chewing through more than 20GB, you have just 40GB onboard for storing movies, games, media, files, and such (with the base model). A 128GB model priced in between makes a lot of sense to us, but apparently not to Apple.\n\nOn the plus side, the 2022 iPad gets a serious wireless upgrade. First, Apple has switched out the Wi-Fi 5 radio of the 9th-gen model in favor of Wi-Fi 6. This offers a huge boost in wireless performance. As long as you have the right Wi-Fi gear at home or work, you'll see a nice speed increase. In our tests, the iPad hit peak downloads of 637Mbps when next to a Wi-Fi 6 access point, with uploads reaching 287Mbps. Those numbers dropped to 29Mbps down and 19Mbps up when tested at the Wi-Fi network's edge, but that's still quick enough to maintain a video call.\n\nSecond, the iPad moves from 4G to 5G. Though it relies on only sub-6GHz 5G (and not mmWave), buyers who need a constant internet connection will find the generational jump a welcome one. I tested the iPad on Verizon's 5G network and found its performance to be quite good in the Northern New Jersey area.\n\nLast, Apple has stepped up the Bluetooth radio from version 4.2 to version 5.2. This should allow for more stable connections with accessories such as true wireless headphones while using less battery power.\n\nBattery Life: Just Average, But Good Enough\n\nIf there's one thing Apple hasn't improved significantly, it's battery life. In fact, iPad battery life has remained stunningly stagnant over the tablet's entire 12-year lifetime. Apple pitches 10 hours of battery life when browsing or watching videos via Wi-Fi and nine hours of battery when doing the same over cellular. Granted, 10 hours is more than enough to get you through most flights and technically meets the full workday standard, but it could be better.\n\nIn our battery rundown test, which involves streaming video over Wi-Fi with the screen brightness set to the maximum, the 10th-gen iPad lasted 5 hours and 59 minutes. That's a 41-minute improvement over the battery life of the 9th-gen model, but a solid 73 minutes behind what we achieved with the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+. In real-world usage, with the screen set to about 40% brightness, I was able to work over Wi-Fi (browsing, Slack, email, task management) from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. with about 15% battery left at the end of the day. Still, I don't think 12 hours of battery life is a big ask for a tablet.\n\nAt least Apple is nice enough to include a 20W charging brick in the box. Using the included USB-C-to-USB-C cable and charger, it takes a little more than two hours to fully recharge the iPad.\n\nCamera Quality: Better Than You'd Expect\n\nI'm pretty sure no one takes tablet cameras that seriously, but we should no longer write them off entirely -- at least if you're shooting with an iPad. The 10th-gen iPad improves the camera situation in a big way.\n\nThe rear-mounted camera jumps from an 8MP shooter at f/2.4 on the 2021 iPad to 12MP at f/1.8 on the 2022 model. This leads to sharper images that are brighter and cleaner across the board. Moreover, Apple has upgraded its HDR processing to Smart HDR 3, which does a better job of merging multiple exposures into a single take for more balanced results. The shots I took with the new iPad are perhaps a bit over-sharpened, but the clarity and color are good. This new sensor also allows the entry-level iPad to jump from just 1080p video capture to 4K video capture at multiple frame rates. The few short videos I recorded look really nice. The iPad has a better camera than many cheap smartphones.\n\nThen there's the front-facing camera. While the camera hardware itself doesn't get much of an upgrade, the user experience receives a major shot in the arm. Apple relocated the camera from the tablet's top edge to the side edge. This means the camera is centered above the screen -- rather than set off to one side -- when using the tablet like a laptop. Anyone who spends all day on video calls will flip for this change, which feels much more natural with the relocated camera. Otherwise, it looks like Apple carries over the 12MP, f/2.4 sensor. The only real added feature is for Smart HDR 3 on the software side of things. The selfies I shot with it look very good for a tablet.\n\nAccessories: Lots to Like\n\nGiven the iPad's refreshed hardware design, some new accessories are on offer.\n\nEvery tablet deserves at least some protection from the loose items in your backpack. Apple's Smart Folio ($79) offers basic front and rear protection and can serve as a makeshift stand. It attaches magnetically and automatically wakes the iPad when opened and puts it to sleep when closed. Unfortunately, it feels a lot like cardboard and has sharp edges. Literally dozens of alternatives from third parties are available directly from Apple and elsewhere for less, so we recommend you skip this one.\n\nIf you want your iPad to function as a tiny laptop during the workday, you need the Magic Keyboard Folio for iPad ($249). The Magic Folio is a two-piece system. One piece attaches magnetically to the rear and features an adjustable, flip-out stand for setting the iPad on a flat surface for viewing. I like that it supports a wide range of viewing angles. It doesn't balance well on your knees, though. The second piece is the keyboard itself. It connects to the three magnetic poles on the side edge of the iPad and swings around to protect the display when not in use. It's about 85% the size of a standard keyboard, so typing on it feels a bit cramped, but that's to be expected.\n\nWhat I like most about the keyboard is that the surface is plastic rather than covered in fabric or rubber. Travel and feedback of the keys are decent. The best feature, though, is the dedicated row of action keys for adjusting brightness, media playback, and volume (most Apple-made iPad keyboards lack action keys). The trackpad, together with iPadOS, allows you to interact with the screen without actually touching the glass. This can be faster and more precise in some use cases, such as when moving tracks around in GarageBand or clips in iMovie. The keyboard accessory is available in multiple languages but only comes in white, which gets dirty fast.\n\nConfoundingly, the 2022 iPad supports the 2015 original Apple Pencil and the USB-C version, but not the second-generation model. The original Apple Pencil has a glossy, round profile that I find to be uncomfortable and far too slippery to hold. Further, the original Apple Pencil features a male Lightning connector at the top. The most basic way to pair an original Apple Pencil with an iPad has been to insert the stylus into the Lightning port. Given the new iPad's shift to USB-C, this is no longer possible. Pairing must now be done via the iPad's Bluetooth menu (granted, it's a few simple steps). Apple has repackaged the Apple Pencil to include both Lightning and USB-C charging connectors, but you're out of luck if you lose one or the other. The USB-C version is a better choice.\n\nAs a stylus, the Apple Pencil works very well with the 10th-gen iPad. It's fast enough, responsive, and does well for taking notes and doodling. I wouldn't recommend a third-party stylus (only a few are available) because they don't enjoy the same level of direct support. If you're going to use a stylus with the iPad, definitely make it the Apple Pencil.\n\nNote that none of these accessories are included with the iPad; each is a separate purchase. Combining the price of the base model iPad, Magic Keyboard Folio, and Apple Pencil comes out to $677, which is a hefty sum. Samsung, by way of comparison, often includes a stylus and sometimes includes a folio case/keyboard in the box with its Galaxy Tab S tablets.\n\niPadOS\n\nThe 10th-gen iPad shipped with iPadOS 16 but has since been updated to iPadOS 17. It gains access to most of the new features contained therein save for the biggest one: Stage Manager. iPads equipped with M1, M2, and M4 processors can take advantage of this new tool, which lets people open and control multiple workspaces in a manner that's more similar to laptops. It's a shame the feature isn't available on the base iPad. Just about everything else is, however, including edit, undo, and mark-as-read functions in iMessage; Shared Libraries in the Photos app, which lets people instantly share photos and videos with others; and LiveText and Visual Lookup for image-based searching.\n\nVerdict: A Lower Price Makes for an Even Better Deal\n\nApple has improved just about every aspect of the entry-level iPad. The revised design is attractive, the screen is very good, the upgraded processor is faster, and the new camera configuration means better photos and more natural video calls. Wireless performance is quicker across the board, the tablet now offers true stereo sound, and Apple's accessories can transform it into a portable workstation.\n\nThere's no question that the 10th-generation iPad is the best tablet you can get for $349. It does everything a tablet should do and does it well. Apple is mostly competing against its own iPad mini, iPad Air, and iPad Pro. If you truly value the small form factor, the iPad mini is the way to go, though at three years old it is a bit outdated in terms of specs and performance. The iPad Air is a good upgrade for students and creatives who prefer more power for their applications, as well as compatibility with the new Apple Pencil Pro. Finally, serious professionals and creators who have the most demanding workflows should opt for the iPad Pro for its high-quality display and top-tier performance. Most casual users, though, will find the base iPad does everything you need just fine.

( Image Source :Getty )\n\nIn an interview with Numerama, as reported by MacRumors, Apple industrial designer Molly Anderson has hinted at a change in Apple logo in future iPad models. He mentioned that the current vertical logo might not be permanent, suggesting future changes could be on the horizon. He also discussed the orientation of the Apple logo on the iPad when used with a keyboard case or in landscape mode.\n\nThough a logo orientation change is primarily cosmetic, it would symbolise a significant update in the design language of the Apple iPad.\n\nAlso read: Sony's Rebranded ULT Series Launched In India\n\nAnderson highlighted that the Apple iPad is designed for use in any orientation, but she acknowledged a trend toward landscape usage in recent years. Her comments were somewhat ambiguous, but they do indicate that the tech giant may be considering aligning the iPad's logo orientation with that of its MacBooks.\n\nWhile Anderson's response was not definitive, Apple's usual policy is to avoid discussing potential changes unless they are seriously contemplated. This suggests a possible redesign of the iPad's logo placement to better suit landscape mode.\n\nAlso read: Samsung Galaxy F55 5G Launched In India\n\nSupporting this likely shift, Apple relocated the front camera to the center for landscape use with the 10th generation iPad that was unveiled in 2022. This change was also implemented in the newly released M2 iPad Air and M4 iPad Pro models. Additionally, since the unveiling of iPadOS 14.5, the Apple logo adjusts to match the device's orientation during startup.\n\nMeanwhile, an update to the iPad Mini, which was notably absent in the recent \"Let Loose\" Apple event, has led some industry insiders to speculate about a potential release later this year. According to Bloomberg's tech analyst Mark Gurman, there is a possibility. He has suggested that a new iPad Mini could make its debut towards the end of the year, potentially replacing the existing 2021 model.\n\nAccording to Gurman's insights shared via @appltrack, the anticipated iPad Mini refresh might not bring groundbreaking changes beyond a faster chip.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacRumors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacRumors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_orientation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Page orientation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Industrial design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer keyboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS_14", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Mini", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad Mini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Galaxy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Orienteering", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Orienteering", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Orienteering/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Orienteering/Organizations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/05/28/1798e4fa9ff16a75b976da34939770281716887871934295_original.png?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603658", "eventUri": "eng-9603658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

From the moment you pick up the ultra-thin slab of glass and aluminum to when you discover finer details in darker scenes thanks to the Tandem OLED display, such burdenless design choices make Apple's premium iPad model a justifiable option for those willing to spend the money.\n\nWith configurations ranging from $999 to $2,599, keep in mind that the higher storage tiers (1TB and 2TB) also come with double the RAM (16GB vs. 8GB) and an extra CPU core. It's a subtle, under-the-hood difference that's easy to miss, especially when cross-shopping between iPad models. If you can use the greater compute, have an offline-heavy workflow, and/or want the most future-proofed iPad on the market, it's worth the upcharge. Otherwise, the base 11- or 13-inch model will serve you just fine, as they have for me.\n\nOver the past week and a half, I've used (or attempted to use) the 11-inch iPad Pro as my primary computer for work and as a secondary, entertainment-only device. When it wasn't paired to a Wi-Fi connection 90% of the time, it ran off my phone's T-Mobile hotspot. While Apple sells an LTE version of the iPad Pro, my primary testing grounds for the device have been at home, a local caf\u00e9, and my work office -- nowhere adventurous enough to justify the always-connected upgrade.\n\nI also paired the iPad with Apple's revamped Magic Keyboard. The $299 starting price gave me pause when I first checked out the accessory, but the thinner, lighter aluminum form factor, larger trackpad, and a new row of function keys this year make the keyboard case more essential than ever for the full iPad experience.\n\nNot just any OLED panel: \"Tandem OLED\" is the term Apple uses to describe the arrangement of light panels underneath the new iPad Pro. By stacking two layers of OLED, the iPad Pro gets remarkably bright (up to 1,600 nits for HDR content) while offering the same traditional benefits of the display type, including better contrast (it's easier to discern the lighter and darker pixels on the screen) and improved color accuracy at a per-pixel level.\n\nIn practice, Tandem OLED makes the iPad Pro a phenomenal tablet for visual experiences. I've been able to complete text-heavy and photo-editing work -- which often require adequate viewing angles -- under a New York City sun that thinks it's already summer. Watching Netflix and Disney+ on the iPad is straight eye candy; colors pop, and the darker, moodier scenes have a level of shadow detail unseen on older Pro models.\n\nThis could pass as an iPad Pro Air: There's an old SNL skit about Apple making the iPhone too thin and light, and it immediately came to mind when I first held the new iPad Pro. While I've never heard someone complain about the iPad Pro being too thick, I don't mind the even slimmer form factor. Both the 11-inch and 13-inch models are thin. Super thin. So thin, in fact, that it's almost inexcusable not to pack the tablet whenever I'm traveling. Dropping the iPad when watching movies in bed also hurts a little less now.\n\nAlso: I tested the 11-inch iPad Air for a week, and it made my $1,200 Android tablet feel old\n\nThe biggest yet most subtle advantage of being nimble is how much more burdenless it feels to carry the iPad around while it's encased in a folio or keyboard cover.\n\nEveryone benefits from the M4: The subtle wins carry over to the new M4 chip that powers the iPad Pro, from supporting the Tandem OLED's variable refresh rate (10Hz to 120Hz) to enhancing the accuracy of Face ID, which captures from a front-facing camera situated on the longer side of the iPad now -- I've dug that design change since testing the iPad in 2022.\n\nAlso: iPad Pro (2024) vs. iPad Air (2024): Which Apple tablet is best for you?\n\nA more efficient processor means the iPad absolutely speeds through app load times, 4K video exports, detecting and cropping subjects out of images, and more. On a recent flight, I played 30 minutes of Genshin Impact at max graphics settings, 120fps and all, and the iPad got lukewarm at its worst -- a major improvement over my 2022 model, which would overheat after 10 minutes.\n\nProfessionals will notice the performance gains even more, with services such as Final Cut Pro (for iPad) gaining new capabilities like Live Multicam and color grading. I'm not exactly sure how many creatives can or have already switched to an iPad-iPhone-only workflow, but it feels less challenging now than ever before. This ultimately lowers the barrier to entry for videographers, digital artists, and other content creators, which is never a bad thing.\n\nMore flexible software: The limitations of iPadOS remain with every generation of iPad reviewed; I can talk all day about how lovely it'd be to have native apps that give me something remotely close to their desktop counterparts or how every iPadOS update feels like another small step towards an ever-distant touchscreen MacBook dream.\n\nAlso: The M4 iPad Pro's true potential will be realized at WWDC, and AI will have a lot to do with it\n\niPadOS 17 still has some kinks to work out, and several missing features. For example, text sizing on Safari is inconsistent across split-screen mode, floating windows, and Stage Manager. There are also moments when I need to import and export large files, and a compulsive swipe-out to a different app is all it takes to put those tasks on pause. In an ideal world, some memory -- which the iPad Pro has plenty of -- should be dedicated to keeping those processes running in the background.\n\nI'm also aware that Apple sells iPads like no other tablet maker, generating an underwhelming $5.6 billion in revenue last quarter. So it doesn't surprise me that Apple continues to distance the iPad and Mac experiences to satisfy the greater portion of the two user bases, beyond the tech enthusiasts who want one device to rule them all.\n\nMore ports, even if they're not on the iPad: Adding more port options, from an extra USB-C to MicroSD/SD to a headphone jack, may be a potential fix for professionals who want to make the most of Apple's magical glass slab. The ability to quickly import photos and videos via an SD card and then edit them on Lightroom or Final Cut Pro/Premiere Rush would be helpful for creatives; a 3.5mm headphone jack would solve any audio latency and quality issues that engineers and sound designers face; and an extra USB-C port would give users more flexibility to charge and connect the iPad to other devices.\n\nOf course, slimming down the iPad Pro means Apple likely won't move towards adding ports. Given how essential the Magic Keyboard is to the iPad, however, it could be even more so with the additional I/O.\n\nApple's tablet lineup is ultimately (and has always been) confined by an operating system that promotes flexibility and ease of use over high-power multitasking. That balance may shift come WWDC, should the company pitch a more ambitious, AI-driven version of iPadOS.\n\nRegardless, the future of the iPad shouldn't be a dealbreaker because the iPad Pro is, for all intents and purposes, an iPad -- a tablet you carry around for getting certain tasks done and for consuming content. For many, being the best tablet on the market -- not the best laptop or PC -- is more than enough.", "source": {"uri": "zdnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ZDNet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_factor_(design)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Form factor (design)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPods", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AirPods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_key", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Function key"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchpad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LTE (telecommunication)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multi-core processor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer keyboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Variable refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_ID", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face ID"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet_PCs", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet PCs", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/PTC_Pro_Engineer", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/PTC Pro Engineer", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/6604ea21b4dffacbfbd64a2dcb1f4861d7096d81/2024/05/23/b87890bc-c277-4f36-8505-fb67615efbf6/dsc00516-2.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603658", "eventUri": "eng-9603658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

The logo is still in a vertical arrangement, although this could change.\n\nAn Apple industrial designer named Molly Anderson has assured that the company could change the orientation of the iPad logo to be horizontal.\n\nThe problem is that there will always be a time when the apple logo will be in the wrong orientation, since the iPad is a device that can be used in different positions.\n\nWhen the iPad was born in 2010 it was primarily intended for use in portrait orientation. But little by little, over the years, the way of using the iPad changed in a very natural way.\n\nWhen writing, playing games, on video calls... everything seems much more suitable for using the iPad in a horizontal position. Furthermore, with the arrival of the Magic Keyboard keyboards and the increase in productivity use in landscape orientation became even more common. But when you place the tablet in that position, the layout of the logo is upside down, vertical.\n\nIt is not a serious problem, it is rather aesthetic, and reminds us of when the MacBook's apple logo was upside down until it changed with the launch of the Powerbook G4. Now a member of Apple's design team has assured that the position of the iPad logo could soon change.\n\nMolly Anderson, an industrial designer at Apple, has spoken at an interview with Numerama with the aim of telling more curiosities about the ultra-thin design of the 2024 iPad Pro.\n\nAfter the new iPad Air and iPad Pro models have a front camera arranged horizontally (on the longest side of the iPad), Molly Anderson was asked about the position of the bitten apple logo on the back.\n\nAccording to the designer, \"this could change\" in the future and the logo in a vertical position would become horizontal. Molly Anderson indicated that the iPad is a device that can be used in all directions, but Apple knows that users use it more in landscape mode. So the logo in portrait orientation won't stay that way forever.\n\nI personally think The iPad logo should be in the same position as the MacBook logo since many years. But it is also true that the moment you hold an iPad in a vertical position, the logo will once again be in the wrong or inappropriate orientation.\n\nSince some years, When you turn on the iPad, the logo on the login screen automatically appears in the position in which you are using the device.

Apple slashed the price of its 10th Gen iPad to $350 after its recent iPad event, so it was already fairly cheap for what you get.

Here's my review of the iPad (10th generation) to help you decide if it's the right model for you.\n\nWhy you should buy the Apple iPad 10th Generation right now\n\nOf course, Apple just released its latest and greatest iPads, but that launch only included the iPad Pro and iPad Air. Yes, the 10th Gen version is two years old at this point, but despite that, it's still a device we'd recommend picking up if you are in the market for a new tablet. Apple overhauled the design in this version, which resulted in logical, highly sought-after changes. That includes better camera placement and a larger display with a 2,360 x 1,460 resolution. It also features True Tone and an anti-fingerprint coating for better viewing.\n\nThe iPad 10th Gen uses an A14 Bionic chip, which is a step up from the previous version and still plenty powerful. The battery life is quite good and it can also charge via USB-C, which is much more convenient.

The Cupertino-based brand has become synonymous with the tablet market, with the range offering a sleek design and great usability.\n\nThe latest models - the iPad Pro M4 and the iPad Air M2 - both earned five-star reviews when T3's team of top testers got their hands on them. Now, in an interview with a French outlet called Numerama, an Apple product designer has hinted at a big design change for future models.\n\nWhen questioned on the orientation of the Apple logo on the rear of the device, product designer, Molly Anderson, suggested that it could be set to move 90\u00b0. She said, \"I think it could change, I don't think it's set in stone. We are thinking about it. The iPad has long been a product that is used in portrait mode, but we are using it more and more in landscape mode.\"\n\nThat could prove to be a more significant change than it seems on the face of it. For many years now, the iPad appears to have been edging into territory which had previously been occupied by their MacBook range.\n\nWith devices like the Magic Keyboard, many users have migrated over to using the iPad as a laptop replacement. That's a large part of the reason why discussions around the logo orientation even came about.\n\nAs the iPad range continues to grow in this direction, it raises one question - is the end of the MacBook near? It's certainly an interesting thing to ponder. The continued growth of both the iPad range and the high end Apple desktop computing products like the Mac Mini and the Mac Studio certainly suggest their laptops could lose ground.\n\nStill, it's hard to say with any certainty. All we know for now is that there's a chance the Apple logo could turn to suit the more common landscape orientation in the future - and that certainly makes sense.", "source": {"uri": "t3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "T3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_cross@t3.com", "name": "Sam Cross", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_orientation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Page orientation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mac Studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Mini", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mac Mini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eADfyZs8YYs6v6NLgtqCJH-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603658", "eventUri": "eng-9603658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

The iPad Air M2 (2024) now comes in two sizes, a first for the series, while the iPad Pro M4 is the thinnest Apple product ever and now rocks an OLED display. Plus, Apple shifted the front-facing camera to the side on all four new models, which brings us to the next piece of news.\n\nFuture iPads might see a small yet logical tweak: rotating the Apple logo on the back panel to align with the new front-facing camera orientation. In an interview with French media Numerama, shared by the Apple-focused tech website iMore, three top Apple employees hinted at this possible change for the next iPad models. While they didn't spill too much about upcoming devices, it looks like Apple could be rotating its iconic logo 90 degrees to match the landscape orientation most users prefer.\n\nIn the interview with Apple's designers, Numerama posed an interesting question: why is the Apple logo on the back of the iPad arranged vertically? While this makes sense for an iPhone, it seems odd for an iPad, especially since Apple has been pushing for horizontal use with accessories like the Magic Keyboard. As already mentioned, the webcam has even moved to a horizontal position with the 2024 models, and the Apple logo also appears horizontally during startup and updates.\n\nDuring the interview, Apple product designer Molly Anderson shared (machine translated):", "source": {"uri": "phonearena.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Phone Arena"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tsveta_ermenkova@phonearena.com", "name": "Tsveta Ermenkova", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_orientation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Page orientation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Webcam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping/Gifts", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping/Gifts", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://m-cdn.phonearena.com/images/article/158759-wide-two_1200/Is-the-Apple-logo-on-your-iPad-feeling-upside-down-Dont-worry-it-might-flip.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603658", "eventUri": "eng-9603658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

That feeling is stronger than ever since Apple released its fast, beautiful and capable new iPads. So, Apple, please make it happen.\n\nI'm writing on an iPad Pro now. I work on my iPad. Many people do. It's got a great keyboard and trackpad case. A nice, vivid OLED display. Of course it's a computer. But I know I'll inevitably drift back to my MacBook Air at some point. Maybe later today when I file this story or resolve some notes in Google Drive. My workflow will shift back.\n\nWhy does this happen? Put a MacBook and an iPad Pro with its Magic Keyboard side by side, and you have, by all appearances, two laptops in parallel evolution. They're so similar looking at first glance that you may not even know which is which.\n\nThere are some differences between them. The MacBook has a rear hinge between its keyboard and screen, no touchscreen and more ports. The iPad snaps into a floating-back keyboard case, has a single port and has a touchscreen. But in terms of hardware, I'm having a harder time telling you the differences. They both have Apple M-series processors: the M2 and M4, respectively. They both have landscape-oriented front cameras for video chats. Aren't I looking at two flavors of the same thing?\n\n\"Don't put MacOS on an iPad,\" some shout. iPadOS is fine, don't change what makes iPads great. \"iPad Pros should be Macs already,\" others yell. Microsoft's Surface Pro has existed for years with full Windows on it, and Apple is still making us buy two expensive machines when we could just have one.\n\nI'm here to argue, why can't we have both?\n\nIt's not crazy to want an iPad to be a Mac. With its keyboard on, it's like I'm looking at something with a long trunk, thick legs and big ears. But there are many voices -- including Apple's -- telling me it's not an elephant.\n\nI'm not here to say an iPad should never be an iPad. My kids use iPads. My wife uses an iPad. My mom uses an iPad. My nephews and niece have iPads. Everyone loves iPads. They're fine. And for sure, Apple shouldn't mess with that. The iPad runs tons of apps well, it's versatile, it's familiar, it's portable and it's an easy device for people who aren't techie. It's a good portable TV, game console, browser, sketchpad and even a light work machine.\n\nKeep that. Let the iPad keep getting better as chips improve, and apps can do more with AI and everything else. All that sounds great. They're clearly on that road already, and that's why Apple sells a fair amount of them each year -- iPads earn Apple an amount that hovers close to what the company earns from Macs.\n\nNow, here's the other part: For iPad Pro models in particular, they should be Macs, too.\n\n\"Macs as well, Scott? Do you mean dual-boot?\" Maybe that's a thought in your head right now.\n\nI don't know. All I do know is I want to press a button on that Magic Keyboard, and have my iPad experience suddenly transform into something indistinguishable from a Mac, or at least so close to it that it's the same thing.\n\nIs that confusing? I don't think so. It's only a refinement to what Apple already has with Stage Manager. Right now, a tap of an icon (hidden in a pull-down menu) brings up a multitasking mode where multiple apps can be resized and layered on the iPad screen plus a connected external monitor. But that multitasking mode allows a maximum of four apps, no matter how powerful or large the iPad model is, as well as four more apps on a connected monitor, no matter how large it is. App positions can be flexed in size, but not as freely as on a Mac.\n\nI want full freedom and lots of apps. I also want Mac apps, which could be enabled somehow if Apple figured it out. The Mac runs iOS apps, and Mac and iPad Pro models now have the same processors. The iPad Pro actually has a next-gen M-series chip (and a better display and front-facing camera).\n\nI also want a browser that feels exactly like the Mac. Not sort of similar; the same. I need my workflows in-browser to work, and for them to work with other browser types, too.\n\nMacOS doesn't support touchscreens, you say? Who cares? I work on the iPad Pro with a Magic Keyboard connected 95% of the time, and when I do, I'm almost never touching the screen. The iPad is already adapted to work with trackpads and keyboards, so what's the difference if I'm running a Mac app instead?\n\nPutting a touchscreen on a Mac is a harder proposition because, yes, MacOS isn't touchscreen-ready. But you can run a keyboard- and trackpad-ready Mac app on an iPad, right? I want that Mac or Mac-like mode to feel seamless and become my Pro Mode. And for anyone who wants the familiar iPad feel again? Just press that button and switch back.\n\nEven if you're not on board with making the iPad Pro feel more like a Mac at times, surely you can agree Apple hasn't made living with both the Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard feel seamless. The iPad Pro in keyboard-connected mode is very much like a laptop in form, but it's not a fun device to suddenly and spontaneously use with a Pencil.\n\nIf I want to write notes, or sketch, or use the Pencil to navigate, reaching up to the floating iPad display as it rests on the Magic Keyboard is awkward. It's a bit wobbly and too elevated. I want to bring the iPad down to a lower angle, resting over the keyboard, so I can settle down and draw. The Magic Keyboard doesn't bend that way, or even go into a folio mode, forcing me to pop the iPad out and hold it instead.\n\nWhy hasn't Apple solved this geometry yet? I expected the new Magic Keyboard would fold in a new direction to allow Pencil and keyboard flows to feel more... well, magical. There's still time to figure this out with the next version, and if Apple ever does make a touchscreen Mac, it'll be well worth figuring out.\n\nAs I said in my iPad Pro review, that device and its hardware could and should easily be my everyday computer, saving me from buying a MacBook. Apple, of course, says you can already do that. Some people do. Or, Apple suggests, you could buy both and use them together.\n\nBut why not have both in one? Cynically, I expect it's because Apple wants us to buy two devices instead of one. If that's the case, it seems ridiculous. Apple is already angling for us to consider other future products like the Vision Pro, which promises to be a computer that connects with our Macs (and hopefully, someday, iPads and iPhones). I'd be more likely to consider higher-end alternative accessories or peripherals if Apple weren't already trying to sell me two different types of increasingly similar (but not identical) computers in the iPad Pro and Mac. All these computers can get expensive, fast.\n\nMicrosoft's recent AI-infused Surface lineup keeps underlining to me that, yes, tablets and laptops can run the same software. Microsoft never figured out a good OS for mobile and tablets. And so, for better or worse, it continues using Windows across the board. Apple, however, could have it both ways. The mobile and tablet software is solid, but iPads need a dose of that desktop OS, too.\n\nThe future of Apple's computer lineup is simple, to me, and it has been for years and years: iPads and Macs need to fuse, or become so cross-compatible that they're truly interchangeable. They're closer than ever right now in 2024, but as WWDC approaches with promises of new device-transforming software (and lots of AI), I hope Apple will make the leap, at last, to let high-end iPads double as Macs.

Back in 2022, when it was released, the 10th Generation iPad was $449, with some limited-time deals dropping the price to $349 earlier this year. Right now, you can get the 64GB Wifi iPad for $299.99 after using the $29.01 on-page coupon, the lowest price it has been since its release (including Black Friday), according to price-checking tools.\n\nThe 10th-generation iPad is considered Apple's entry-level tablet and is one of the best tablets you can buy. It was considered the \"best tablet for most people\" in 2022, according to PCMag's \"excellent\" review. Back then it was not considered a \"budget\" tablet, given its higher base price when compared to previous models. However, at its current $299.99 price, it's much more affordable and trumps any tablet below the $300 price.\n\nOne of the best upgrades this iPad received is its buttonless design, which brings it in line with its higher-end Apple Pro tablet sibling. It measures 9.79 by 7.07 by 0.28 inches and includes the latest A14 Bionic chip, a 10.9-inch liquid retina display, 64GB of storage, a 12MP front and back camera, Touch ID, and a battery that Apple promises will last all day.\n\nIf you are considering this iPad, useful accessories include the Apple Magic Keyboard Folio, which will make your iPad work like a laptop, and the Apple Pencil USB-C, which will allow you to make the most of your iPad's touchscreen abilities.", "source": {"uri": "lifehacker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lifehacker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_(shopping)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Friday (shopping)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A14", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple A14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina_display", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Retina display"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_ID", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touch ID"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchscreen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet_PCs", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet PCs", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HYZXMDK1CXJME74RRMSK36T6/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603658", "eventUri": "eng-9603658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

If you follow along with Apple rumors though, you knew not to expect one. Instead, the iPad 10 stayed in Apple's lineup at a new price point of $349 instead of $449, while the iPad 9 was finally put out to pasture. Even at the new, lower price, however, it's still a mistake to buy an iPad 10 directly from Apple. That's the case with most Apple products, and it's because other retailers offer much better prices.\n\nAs I explained, the 64GB version of Apple's iPad 10th-Gen now costs $349 following Apple's price cut, but it's currently on sale for just $299.99 for the first time ever. Needless to say, that's an all-time low for this model. The deal is only available at Amazon for the time being, but Best Buy usually follows Amazon's lead. Of note, that's the lowest price ever for this model. You can also save $50 on the 256GB model if you need more storage. Or, if you want to spend even less money, the previous-generation 10.2-inch iPad 9th-Gen is also on sale starting at just $249.\n\nThere are several things that make the new iPad 10th-Gen tablet a solid upgrade from its predecessor.\n\nThe first and most obvious update is the design of the iPad 10. It has a slightly larger display than the 10.2-inch model, of course. But it also has smaller bezels because the home button underneath the screen has been removed.\n\nYou can still use Touch ID on the iPad 10, though it has simply been moved to the power button on the edge of the tablet.\n\nThis is a big deal for many Apple fans out there.\n\nYes, Face ID is great. I personally prefer it to Touch ID on my iPhone. But on an iPad, I'm not such a big fan. Sometimes, I just don't hold the iPad in a position that works well for Face ID, and it takes a few tries to unlock it.\n\nThat's not a great user experience at all. Meanwhile, Touch ID works every single time for me, without fail.\n\nApple's 10th-generation iPad also features the powerful A14 Bionic chipset in place of the A13 chip in the 9th-generation iPad. You get big speed gains as well as better battery life and more. Also of note, it's the cheapest iPad you can get that will work perfectly with the new USB-C Apple Pencil (currently $10 off). The only less expensive iPad is the 9th-gen model, but it has a Lightning port instead of a USB-C connector.\n\nThe 10.9-inch iPad now starts at $349, which is a big price cut compared to the launch price. Right now, however, Amazon's iPad 10 deals start at $299.99. You can also upgrade to the 10.9-inch iPad with 256GB for $449.99 instead of $499.\n\nAs I mentioned, however, the previous-generation iPad model is also on sale. It has been removed from Apple's lineup since the iPad 10th-Gen got a price cut. But you can still find this old model in stock with steep discounts until it sells out.\n\nYou can get the 256GB model on sale for $379 instead of $479, which is a $100 discount. Also, WiFi + Cellular models are up to $80 off right now.\n\nOr, if you want to spend as little as possible, you can opt for the base model with 64GB of storage. The 64GB iPad 9 retails for $329, but it's currently on sale for $249 for the entry-level model.\n\nThat's a nice big discount, and it matches this model's lowest price since the holidays last year.", "source": {"uri": "bgr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BGR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maren_estrada@bgr.com", "name": "Maren Estrada", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Genius_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boy Genius Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_ID", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touch ID"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_ID", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face ID"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Best Buy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Display device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A14", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple A14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A13", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple A13"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_(connector)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lightning (connector)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Boats_and_Ships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Boats and Ships", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Apple-iPad-10-10th-Gen-Tablet.jpg?resize=1200%2C628", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603658", "eventUri": "eng-9603658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Still, they're often overlooked as one-to-one replacements for their MacBook counterparts.\n\nThe change hinted at by Apple's designers would be subtle, but it would also be further evidence of Apple's desire to push its tablet as a more viable laptop replacement.\n\nSpeaking to the French outlet Numerama, the iPad's slow transition to becoming a horizontally aligned device is brought up, with the designers then asked if Apple could make it official by switching the orientation of its logo on the rear of the device from portrait to landscape.\n\nAnderson, an industrial designer and key influence in the design of Apple's new seventh-generation iPad Pro M4, responds: \"We are thinking about it. The iPad has long been a product that is used in portrait mode, but we are using it more and more in landscape mode. We cannot say that it is fixed.\"\n\niPad marketing manager Scott Broderick suggests the angle of Apple's logo isn't so important, adding \"The iPad is used in all directions, we use it vertically for FaceTime calls.\" However, while that might be true for the majority of iPad devices to date, Apple's latest batch of tablets says otherwise.\n\nIn the words of Apple's founder, Steve Jobs: \"Details matter.\"\n\nOn the face of things, a switch in official orientation for the iPad means very little. However, when you factor in other adjustments to Apple's catalog of tablets with the new iPad Air and iPad Pro, a clearer picture could begin to form.\n\nFor starters, both of Apple's latest iPads have switched the position of their front-facing camera from the \"top\" edge of the device when positioned in portrait, to the \"top\" edge when placed in landscape -- more closely mirroring the display of a traditional clamshell laptop.\n\nThe desire to replicate the laptop experience continues with the new Magic Keyboard, which more accurately emulates the deck of a MacBook Pro with function keys and a larger trackpad.\n\nFinally, the new iPad Pro is the first Apple device to be outfitted with the company's latest and most powerful M4 silicon chipset, offering the potential for MacBook rivaling performance across a growing suite of desktop-level apps making their way to the iPadOS platform.\n\nIf Apple has no intentions of positioning the iPad Pro as a potential MacBook replacement, they're unintentionally making a great case for it.\n\nInterestingly, while it would appear that Apple is presenting the iPad as a laptop replacement, under the radar or otherwise, the question of whether or not it makes for a good alternative remains.\n\nCan you replace your MacBook with an iPad? That's a question asked almost every time Apple releases a new wave of iPads and one that is often decided on a person-by-person basis. Some, like Laptop Mag editor Rami Tabari would answer with a resounding \"No.\" However, others, like myself, would say \"Yes\" -- when paired with the right accessory, anyway.\n\nHowever, for the most part, modern iPads are more than capable of satisfying the needs of the average MacBook or Windows laptop user. Though the experience might not be as satisfying for more advanced users who require access to a wider selection of apps or control over their system.\n\nIt's probably fair to say that the iPad Pro has outgrown iPadOS. However, without a tablet-friendly version of macOS to fall back on, this is all iPad users have to work with -- and it's likely one of the last remaining roadblocks to many adopting the iPad as an actual day-to-day laptop replacement.\n\nThere have been plenty of rumors in the past about a macOS \"lite\" variant making its way to iPads in the past, but we've yet to see Apple make any considerable moves in that direction.\n\nHowever, if we were to see something like that revealed, it would most likely take place during Apple's upcoming WWDC, scheduled to take place from June 10-14, 2024. Are we likely to see this happen? Not really. But we will get to see iPadOS 18, which may be much more accommodating to users looking to adopt the iPad Pro as their daily driver.", "source": {"uri": "laptopmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LaptopMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rael_hornby@laptopmag.com", "name": "Rael Hornby", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MacBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_orientation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Page orientation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_(7th_generation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad (7th generation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Industrial design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_factor_(design)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Form factor (design)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clamshell_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clamshell design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_key", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Function key"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchpad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FaceTime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MacOS"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/PTC_Pro_Engineer", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/PTC Pro Engineer", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kvQoP8eAeDGD4p4FSWi9Fi-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603658", "eventUri": "eng-9603658", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 4177, "textEnd": 4184}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Following the 10th-gen iPad's lead, Apple finally moved the camera to the longer \"landscape\" edge, making FaceTime calls much more natural when docked.\n\nHowever, while the camera placement is an obvious nod to users favoring the iPad as a landscape device, Apple didn't change the orientation of the Apple logo on the back of the device, which is the same as it has been since the original iPad launched in 2010. However, a new report from French-language site Numerama (via MacRumors) claims that Apple might be finally ready to go all-in on landscape.\n\nIn an interview with some of the members of the iPad Pro's design team, Molly Anderson talked about the possibility of rotating the Apple logo on the back of the device: \"I think this could change, I don't think it's engraved in stone. We are thinking about it. The iPad has long been a product that is used in portrait mode, but we are increasingly using it in landscape mode. We can't say it's fixed.\"\n\nSince it's translated from French, it's not clear if Anderson's words are as pointed as they seem, but it's clear that the orientation of the Apple logo is something the iPad design team considered before deciding to keep it in portrait mode. It should be noted that the logo isn't visible when docked in a Magic Keyboard, as the accessory has its own landscape-aligned Apple logo on the back.\n\nHowever, it is strange that Apple has a landscape camera on its newest iPads but keeps the Apple logo in portrait.

Priced at nearly $2,500, it prompts the question: Can the iPad Pro finally replace a traditional computer in 2024?\n\nComing to you from Scott McKenna, this detailed video examines whether the latest iPad Pro can serve as your only computer. McKenna, an entrepreneur who uses his iPad for 90% of his work, shares his experience with the previous 11-inch iPad Pro and explains why he decided to upgrade. The 11-inch model, while functional, felt too small for multitasking and more intensive tasks. The larger 13-inch screen provides a significant improvement, making the iPad Pro feel more like a laptop, especially with the enhanced Magic Keyboard.\n\nOne of the standout features of the new iPad Pro is its lighter and thinner design. McKenna previously found the 12.9-inch model too bulky but appreciates the weight reduction in the 13-inch version, making it more portable. Another crucial upgrade is the repositioned camera, now centered in landscape mode. This change improves the user experience during video calls and FaceTime, eliminating the awkward side-glance issue present in older models.\n\nThe new Apple Pencil Pro also brings significant enhancements. McKenna highlights the Pencil's improved functionality for note-taking and drawing, making it an indispensable tool for those who frequently annotate documents or create digital art. Features like the barrel roll and tool-switching capabilities enhance the user experience, adding value to the already versatile iPad Pro.\n\nDespite these improvements, McKenna addresses some limitations of the iPad Pro. File management remains a challenge compared to traditional computers. While the iPad has made strides, tasks involving extensive file handling still feel cumbersome. This issue extends to video editing, where applications like Final Cut Pro on iPad differ significantly from their Mac counterparts. The lack of customizable keyboard shortcuts and workspace management options on the iPad version of Final Cut Pro hampers efficiency for users accustomed to the Mac version.\n\nMoreover, certain applications are either unavailable or less functional on the iPad. For instance, McKenna mentions Isotope RX Advanced, an audio editing tool not available for iPadOS. These gaps necessitate retaining a traditional computer for specific tasks, despite the iPad's impressive performance capabilities. The iPad Pro's hardware is powerful, but the software limitations can be a deal-breaker for some users.\n\nNevertheless, the iPad Pro offers unique advantages. Instant accessibility with cellular connectivity, a versatile user experience, and features like a touchscreen and Apple Pencil set it apart from traditional laptops. The iPad Pro excels as a multimedia device, suitable for watching movies, drawing, and taking notes. Its powerful M4 processor, stunning display, and long battery life make it a robust device for most everyday tasks.\n\nIn conclusion, the iPad Pro can replace a traditional computer for many users, especially those whose work does not heavily rely on specific applications. For tasks involving email, web browsing, document editing, and even some forms of content creation, the iPad Pro proves to be a capable and versatile device.

Be sure to clip the on-page coupon to receive the full discount. Unfortunately, with the holiday now behind us, there's no telling exactly how long this deal will last.\n\nApple recently slashed the price of its 10th-gen iPad following the debut of the new iPad Air and iPad Pro, and now Amazon's Memorial Day sale has shrunk it even further. Despite being the affordable model in the lineup, this iPad offers pretty much everything the typical tablet user would want in a tablet.\n\nThere are a number of improvements over its predecessor, including a larger 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display, an improved 12-megapixel camera, better speakers and the A14 Bionic chip for faster performance. It's also swapped to USB-C. This model comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, as well as Center Stage, which makes it excellent for video calling. The higher-capacity variant is also seeing modest savings, with $49 off the 256GB model.\n\nHey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.\n\nIt's worth noting that this iPad is not compatible with the Apple Pencil 2 or the new Apple Pencil Pro, so you'll have to use the first-gen model and a USB-C dongle or grab the USB-C Pencil, both of which are sold separately. That said, our main gripe with this iPad was the cost over the older (but still functional) ninth-gen model -- but this price cut solves that problem.\n\nIs the basic iPad not for you?

According to the product designer of the company, Apple is considering to switch the orientation of the logo from horizontal to landscape mode. This does make sense as the tablet is used mostly in a horizontal orientation. The latest version of the iPad OS has shown the logo of the device in both portrait and landscape mode while starting (depending on the orientation).\n\nNumerama (which is a french news website) had interviewed Apple product designer Molly Anderson about the issue. Anderson mentioned that the logo on the iPad will be eventually changed to the landscape mode. While the information is not an official confirmation, it is time which will tell if the decision is taken by company or not.\n\nWell, it is important to note that Apple's current generation of iPads (except iPad Mini) offer a front-facing camera that is placed on the longer side of the device. This means that the front camera is aligned with the user's face. The iPad can also be attached to keyboard and used in the landscape mode.\n\nApple had begun checking its iPad's orientation before displaying the apple logo in landscape or portrait mode when it is booted with iPadOS 14.5 (way back in 2021). The standard iPad models as well as iPad Mini will be refreshed soon.

It offers a high-resolution 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display that outputs admirable brightness at 500 nits, which is sufficient in many scenarios. Plus, it is compatible with Apple Pencil for natural-like handwriting sketching and note-taking experience.\n\nThe iPad 10 comes with amazing battery life, too.

This is what's updated in the new Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro over the previous version.\n\nThe Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro was a statement-making accessory for Apple's premium tablet line. Magnetically holding onto the slate computer, it would hover the iPad Pro above the keyboard thanks to its floating cantilever design.\n\nIt's also Apple's first real upgrade to the accessory. Apple has made a few key changes made to it that improves the overall experience.\n\nThis is what Apple has updated in its new iPad Pro Magic Keyboard.\n\nThe original Magic Keyboard used a soft-touch material that was prone to showing finger prints and smears on the black model. The white version was also a quick collector of dirt, which spoiled the appearance.\n\nThe new version has the same soft-touch material on the outside. At a bare minimum, it's wipe-clean like the original.\n\nOn the inside, things are different. The old material covering has gone, and has been replaced by an aluminum palm rest.\n\nThis is a change that dramatically changes the rigidity of the wrist rests, but also the appearance. When opened, the aluminum offers an aesthetic that's somewhat resembling that of the MacBook Pro.\n\nThe original Magic Keyboard for iPad pulled apart fairly easily. It opens up with a round hinge to the rear, before swinging the iPad Pro into place.\n\nAt least in our testing, the new one is a bit harder to open. The metal-on-metal construction took some wrestling, and needed to be peeled at the edges to properly open.\n\nThe old metal tube hinge has been replaced by a metal one that's squashed into a thinner oval. It's not much bigger than the built-in USB-C port.\n\nUnlike the previous covered hinge, the new one is exposed. That means you're going to have to be a lot more careful placing it down, or you may scratch something.\n\nWhile Apple did add more aluminum to the accessory, it also managed to lose some of the weight. Add in the iPad Pro's weight loss, and it's a lot easier to carry around.\n\nThe old 12.9-inch Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro was 699 grams, while the new 13-inch version is 658 grams. As a package, the 12.9-inch keyboard and iPad Pro weighed 1,388 in total, but the new pairing is 1,239 grams.\n\nThe Magic Keyboard's weight loss may be fairly minor, but it still helps overall.\n\nAnother way Apple has improved the Magic Keyboard is by tweaking the trackpad. It's now substantially larger compared to the first version.\n\nApple accomplished this by moving the keyboard itself backward on the body. This made room for the new trackpad to take up space.\n\nThe larger surface makes it easier to perform multi-touch gestures on the iPad Pro without touching the display. It's not quite as expansive as a MacBook Pro, but it's a fair bit closer.\n\nThe position of the keyboard isn't just the only change. There's an entire new row of keys to play with.\n\nWhile the old keyboard's top row consisted of numbers and the delete key, the new version now has a function key row. This row is similar to a Mac keyboard, including a dedicated escape key, and buttons for brightness, volume, and media playback.\n\nThey're still backlit and use a cantilever design, so that hasn't changed either.\n\nOne thing that hasn't improved is overall sturdiness. In fact, it is a little less sturdy to use.\n\nSince the keyboard and iPad are lighter, there's less holding it down on a surface when you tap the screen. The removal of the material on the hinge also makes an impact, as well as the iPad Pro sitting further back due to the keyboard movements.\n\nThis all results in the entire assembly being more wobbly and bouncing when you tap the iPad itself. Tap a bit too aggressively, and the front can lift up as it all rolls back.\n\nApple's new Magic Keyboard results in a massively improved experience to users. The use of aluminum, the keyboard row, and the larger trackpad all make things a lot better when using it with the iPad Pro for long typing sessions.\n\nThe changes do make it a bit more flimsy to tap the iPad Pro itself, which you have to be more mindful of, though.\n\nIt even may allow some users to feel that they have the optimal mobile workstation. Something with looks approaching a mini MacBook Pro, but that can also offer stylus and touch features too.\n\nRegardless of what you think about the changes, you don't have much say in which version of the Magic Keyboard you can use with the new M4 iPad Pro. It works exclusively with the new 11-inch and 13-inch models.\n\nThe previous iteration is still available. It is only compatible with the iPad Air and older iPad Pro units, prior to the 2024 redesign.", "source": {"uri": "forums.appleinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AppleInsider Forums"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_keyboards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple keyboards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer keyboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fingerprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Porting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchpad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_key", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Function key"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esc_key", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Esc key"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylus_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stylus (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Backlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-touch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multi-touch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workstation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Workstation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Magic", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Magic", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Performing Arts", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/PTC_Pro_Engineer", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/PTC Pro Engineer", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/59827-122378-Tapping-iPad-Display-while-on-Magic-Keyboard-xl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603658", "eventUri": "eng-9603658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

A product designer at the Cupertino company recently told a publication that the company was considering switching its logo on the rear panel to a horizontal orientation, due to the increasing usage of the iPad in landscape mode. Recent versions of iPadOS also show the company's logo in portrait and landscape mode when starting the device, depending on its orientation.\n\nNumerama recently interviewed Apple product designer Molly Anderson, who said (translated from French) that the Apple logo -- currently shown as upright in portrait mode -- could eventually be rotated so that it appears upright when the tablet is used in landscape mode.\n\n\"We are thinking about it. The iPad has long been a product that can be used in portrait mode, but we are increasingly using it in landscape mode. We can't say that it's set in stone,\" Anderson told the publication (translated from French) during the interview.\n\nWhile this isn't an official confirmation from Apple on plans to change the position or orientation of its logo on upcoming iPad models, it is rare to see an Apple employee make a statement like this, considering all responses are vetted by the company.\n\nIt's also worth noting that all of Apple's current generation tablets -- except for the iPad Mini -- now have the front facing camera located on the longer edge of the device, so that it is in line with a user's face when in landscape mode. In addition to taking video calls, users could also attach their iPad to one of the company's keyboards (or third-party options) that would also place the tablet in landscape mode.\n\nMacRumours also points out that Apple began checking an iPad's orientation before displaying the company's logo in landscape mode or portrait mode when it is booted, with iPadOS 14.5, back in 2021. the iPad Mini and standard iPad models are up for a refresh, and it remains to be seen whether the company also modifies the orientation of its logo on its upcoming tablets.", "source": {"uri": "gadgets360.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV Gadgets 360"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_orientation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Page orientation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Booting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cosmetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS_14", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Mini", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad Mini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Videotelephony"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Orienteering", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Orienteering", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Orienteering/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Orienteering/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Landscape", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Landscape", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/iPad_10th-generation-10_1668678032639.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603658", "eventUri": "eng-9603658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

This is what's updated in the new Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro over the previous version.\n\nThe Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro was a statement-making accessory for Apple's premium tablet line. Magnetically holding onto the slate computer, it would hover the iPad Pro above the keyboard thanks to its floating cantilever design.\n\nIt's also Apple's first real upgrade to the accessory. Apple has made a few key changes made to it that improves the overall experience.\n\nThis is what Apple has updated in its new iPad Pro Magic Keyboard.\n\nThe original Magic Keyboard used a soft-touch material that was prone to showing finger prints and smears on the black model. The white version was also a quick collector of dirt, which spoiled the appearance.\n\nThe new version has the same soft-touch material on the outside. At a bare minimum, it's wipe-clean like the original.\n\nOn the inside, things are different. The old material covering has gone, and has been replaced by an aluminum palm rest.\n\nThis is a change that dramatically changes the rigidity of the wrist rests, but also the appearance. When opened, the aluminum offers an aesthetic that's somewhat resembling that of the MacBook Pro.\n\nThe original Magic Keyboard for iPad pulled apart fairly easily. It opens up with a round hinge to the rear, before swinging the iPad Pro into place.\n\nAt least in our testing, the new one is a bit harder to open. The metal-on-metal construction took some wrestling, and needed to be peeled at the edges to properly open.\n\nThe old metal tube hinge has been replaced by a metal one that's squashed into a thinner oval. It's not much bigger than the built-in USB-C port.\n\nUnlike the previous covered hinge, the new one is exposed. That means you're going to have to be a lot more careful placing it down, or you may scratch something.\n\nWhile Apple did add more aluminum to the accessory, it also managed to lose some of the weight. Add in the iPad Pro's weight loss, and it's a lot easier to carry around.\n\nThe old 12.9-inch Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro was 699 grams, while the new 13-inch version is 658 grams. As a package, the 12.9-inch keyboard and iPad Pro weighed 1,388 in total, but the new pairing is 1,239 grams.\n\nThe Magic Keyboard's weight loss may be fairly minor, but it still helps overall.\n\nAnother way Apple has improved the Magic Keyboard is by tweaking the trackpad. It's now substantially larger compared to the first version.\n\nApple accomplished this by moving the keyboard itself backward on the body. This made room for the new trackpad to take up space.\n\nThe larger surface makes it easier to perform multi-touch gestures on the iPad Pro without touching the display. It's not quite as expansive as a MacBook Pro, but it's a fair bit closer.\n\nThe position of the keyboard isn't just the only change. There's an entire new row of keys to play with.\n\nWhile the old keyboard's top row consisted of numbers and the delete key, the new version now has a function key row. This row is similar to a Mac keyboard, including a dedicated escape key, and buttons for brightness, volume, and media playback.\n\nThey're still backlit and use a cantilever design, so that hasn't changed either.\n\nOne thing that hasn't improved is overall sturdiness. In fact, it is a little less sturdy to use.\n\nSince the keyboard and iPad are lighter, there's less holding it down on a surface when you tap the screen. The removal of the material on the hinge also makes an impact, as well as the iPad Pro sitting further back due to the keyboard movements.\n\nThis all results in the entire assembly being more wobbly and bouncing when you tap the iPad itself. Tap a bit too aggressively, and the front can lift up as it all rolls back.\n\nApple's new Magic Keyboard results in a massively improved experience to users. The use of aluminum, the keyboard row, and the larger trackpad all make things a lot better when using it with the iPad Pro for long typing sessions.\n\nThe changes do make it a bit more flimsy to tap the iPad Pro itself, which you have to be more mindful of, though.\n\nIt even may allow some users to feel that they have the optimal mobile workstation. Something with looks approaching a mini MacBook Pro, but that can also offer stylus and touch features too.\n\nRegardless of what you think about the changes, you don't have much say in which version of the Magic Keyboard you can use with the new M4 iPad Pro. It works exclusively with the new 11-inch and 13-inch models.\n\nThe previous iteration is still available. It is only compatible with the iPad Air and older iPad Pro units, prior to the 2024 redesign.\n\nApple's Magic Keyboard for the M4 iPad Pro is discounted now with promo code APINSIDER at Apple Authorized Reseller Adorama. Look for a link to reveal the coupon code field during Step 4 of checkout.\n\nYou can also pick up the Magic Keyboard at Amazon, B&H and Best Buy.\n\nThose looking for the Magic Keyboard for last-gen models can snag closeout discounts at Amazon.", "source": {"uri": "appleinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AppleInsider"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_keyboards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple keyboards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer keyboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchpad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fingerprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Porting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-touch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multi-touch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_key", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Function key"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esc_key", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Esc key"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Best Buy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylus_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stylus (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Backlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workstation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Workstation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Magic", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Magic", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Performing Arts", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/PTC_Pro_Engineer", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/PTC Pro Engineer", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/59827-122377-Old-VS-New-Keyboard-Keys-xl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603658", "eventUri": "eng-9603658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Because yes, while an iPad Pro is expensive, and the addition of Pencil Pro and a Magic Keyboard only makes it even more expensive, there are natural limitations if you come straight from either MacOS or Windows. There are still tasks that an iPad either can't perform or performs in a far more cumbersome way than a traditional laptop - that's just the way it is.\n\nBut at the same time, there is a fairly large audience around the world who love to use the iPad and love to use it professionally too, and for them Apple has designed a new Magic Keyboard that virtually eliminates all the objections of the original. The starting point for this review is therefore whether the new Magic Keyboard is a solid improvement for those who already like using an iPad, and not whether it magically breaks down some of the software barriers that prevent the iPad from becoming a MacBook.\n\nBecause the new Magic Keyboard is, in many ways, quite brilliant. First of all, it's a little lighter, at just over 660 grams instead of almost 700 grams, and it's also a few millimetres thinner. But despite that, there are quite a few cool new features.\n\nFor example, we finally have function keys at the top that third parties have been offering on their iPad keyboards for years. This means you now have an Escape key, media keys and volume control without having to touch the tablet itself, making the Magic Keyboard infinitely more useful in both professional scenarios and everyday use.\n\nIn addition, the new trackpad is significantly larger, making it much, much lighter in all scenarios. No, it's not on par with what you get on a MacBook or competing laptop, but it's haptic and it's now big enough that it doesn't feel like as big a compromise. Overall, the new function keys and trackpad give the impression that there's less wasted space this time around, and along with an aluminium surface instead of rubber on the previous one, it also feels nicer.\n\nMore good news, the passthrough USB-C port now gives the iPad Pro a whopping 35W (well and truly) instead of just over 20W, which makes quite a difference.\n\nIt still costs a tad too much, \u00a3350 is a lot for an accessory, but at least they haven't tried to raise the price with this redesign, and right now both the new and the old cost the same. The only real complaint here is that you simply cannot buy this mildly improved Magic Keyboard for an older iPad Pro, not even the M2. It's almost criminal. That said, this is an essential addition to your new iPad, and this time Apple has really just improved pretty much every aspect of use.", "source": {"uri": "gamereactor.eu", "dataType": "news", "title": "GameReactor"}, "authors": [{"uri": "magnus_groth_andersen@gamereactor.eu", "name": "Magnus Groth-Andersen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_key", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Function key"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esc_key", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Esc key"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchpad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer keyboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haptic technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Magic", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Magic", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Performing Arts", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tobacco/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tobacco/Accessories", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/PTC_Pro_Engineer", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/PTC Pro Engineer", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.gamereactor.eu/media/87/ipadmagickeyboard_4258703b.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603658", "eventUri": "eng-9603658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Now that Apple fixed some of the original's problems by adding a glass trackpad, a row of function keys and an aluminum palm rest, it's even better. Especially with an improved USB-C port.\n\nBut does the functionality (and sheer coolness) justify the epic price? Read on to found out.\n\nThis post contains affiliate links. Cult of Mac may earn a commission when you use our links to buy items.\n\nAmong the best features of iPad is that it easily turns into an ultra-thin laptop. With this convertible notebook, you can lie back on the couch and watch video but also attach a keyboard and lean forward to type out emails. It's one of the main reasons I prefer iPad to MacBook.\n\nThere are plenty of keyboard/case options. Logitech and ESR each already announced their own compatible with the M4 iPad Pro.\n\nBut Apple Magic Keyboard is the 500-pound gorilla of this product category. Especially because iPad buyers get sales pressure to buy one when shopping for their tablet.\n\nAnyone tempted has to pause (and gulp) when they get to the price: $349 for the version designed for the M4 iPad Pro. The one for the 11-inch version is $299.\n\nThe 2024 version is the replacement for two earlier versions. But the second was almost identical to the first, just tweaked for the slight increase in the width of the 2022 iPad Pro. The new model is the first true redesign.\n\nI've used dozens of tablet keyboards over the years and none are as cool looking as Magic Keyboard for iPad. The way the cantilever design makes the screen seem to float over the keyboard -- brilliant. I'ver had strangers walk up and ask me where I got it as though it were some mysterious relic.\n\nThe new version doesn't fundamentally change the basic design, just makes it better.\n\nThe 13-inch M4 iPad Pro I'm using for this review weighs less than its predecessor, and that allowed Apple to move the integrated tablet stand farther back without unbalancing the accessory. Plus, Apple added a row of half-size function keys above the number/symbol keys. The result is that the bottom on the iPad crowds the letter keys less than its predecessor did. I can type away more comfortably than before.\n\nThe keyboard case offers excellent \"lapability.\" That's a portmanteau that means using the accessory in my lap is as comfortable as typing on a MacBook. More comfortable actually -- the iPad never heats up.\n\nThe 13-inch M4 iPad Pro weighs nearly a quarter of a pound less than its predecessor. The 2024 version of the Magic Keyboard comes in a half a pound less than the original. Put them together, and the new tablet in its keyboard case is 2.3 lbs, compared to just over 3 lbs. for the previous combo. It's a very noticeable difference.\n\nCompare that weight to the 2.7 pounds of the 13-inch MacBook Air and you'll see this is Apple's lightest laptop.\n\nThere's a slight size difference, too. The 2024 Magic Keyboard is 0.5 inch with the tablet inside, while the original model is 0.6 in. However, it's not quite as thin as the MacBook Air, which comes in at 0.44 inch.\n\nThe whole point of the Apple Magic Keyboard for M4 iPad Pro is to type on it. Fortunately, it's really well designed for that.\n\nI have the 13-inch version, which provides plenty of room for a keyboard. The key area is 10.6 inches wide, and most keys are 0.6 inches square. There's 0.12 inches of space between keys.\n\nApple's Magic keyboards use a scissor mechanism, not a membrane. The typing experience is smooth, not mushy. The keyboard is clicky. I asked a friend who's a fan of clicky keyboards to try it, and she said, \"10/10 recommend.\"\n\nThere's not much key travel, though -- the only downside of the design. If you're accustomed to a MacBook you probably won't notice, but many desktop keyboard offer much more key travel.\n\nApple replaced the plastic palm reset with an aluminum one in the 2024 redesign. The change makes the keyboard look far more professional. And it's easier to clean.\n\nI've already spent many hours typing on this new peripheral, and have never had it fail to register that I've typed on a key. There have been no inadvertent key repeats, either.\n\nI'm pleased with the new keyboard. It's not as nice as my desktop one -- I prefer more key travel -- but it's more than acceptable for an accessory meant to be used on the go.\n\nBelow the keyboard is a much roomier glass trackpad. This is 4.4 inches by 2.6 inches, which makes it noticeably larger than the one on the earlier Magic Keyboard for iPad version(s).\n\nThe glass trackpad doesn't move, but haptic feedback make it feel like it does when I tap on it. The surface vibrates slightly and fools my finger. This isn't new in general, but is a nice addition to the Magic Keyboard for iPad.\n\nThe trackpad registers my finger movements and taps perfectly. It's a significant improvement -- the one in the earlier Magic Keyboard from iPad was not great.\n\nThe half-size function keys across the top of the number keys are a long-overdue addition. Virtually every third-party iPad keyboard has had them for years.\n\nThey make controlling music playing in the background, adjusting the screen backlight, locking the device, or even opening the app switcher a snap. They are wonderfully convenient.\n\nI'm disappointed that Apple did not add a second USB-C port to the 13-inch iPad Pro. The Magic Keyboard adds one, which helps, but it's of limited use because all it can do is charge the tablet.\n\nI checked to be sure Apple hadn't built in a surprise, but no -- the USB-C port in the hinge of this accessory can only be used for power.\n\nFortunately, it's more functional than its predecessor. In my tests, it is able to send up to 38W of power to the iPad Pro. My earlier version of this accessory tops out at 20W.\n\nI still can't plug a screen and an SSD into my iPad without a hub, but with the Magic Keyboard I can keep the tablet charged up while I have another USB-C accessory plugged in.\n\nNot that the redesign fixed everything. Most Apple devices are beautiful. The black plastic exterior of one version of the Apple Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro is as ugly as a mud fence. I'm going to cover mine with a skin from SlackWraps.\n\nThe white plastic version looks better but really shows dirt. You can clean it -- the material doesn't stain easily. But expect to clean it frequently.\n\nThe 2024 Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro redesign takes care of a couple of my complaints with the original. The trackpad is much better, and the bottom of the tablet screen doesn't crowd the keyboard so much. I really like how slim and light it is, and that the USB-C port can bring in almost twice as much power.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nThe price tag for this accessory is a bit jaw dropping. At $350, it's a about a quarter of the cost of the base model M4 iPad Pro.\n\nBut I can't easily dismiss it as overpriced. It's beautifully designed and extremely functional. And the price isn't out of line with the competition -- the rival Logitech Combo Touch keyboard case is $230, for example.\n\nSo it comes down to your budget. Do you have the cash for a really premium iPad Pro keyboard case? Or should you go with something cheaper, like ESR's Rebound Magnetic Keyboard Case 360 at about a third of the cost?", "source": {"uri": "cultofmac.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cult of Mac"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ed_hardy@cultofmac.com", "name": "Ed Hardy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_key", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Function key"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MacBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer keyboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_keyboards", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple keyboards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchpad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logitech", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logitech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haptic technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Processor register"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Magic", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Magic", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Performing Arts", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/PTC_Pro_Engineer", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/PTC Pro Engineer", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.cultofmac.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Apple-Magic-Keyboard-iPad-Pro.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603658", "eventUri": "eng-9603658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

The 10.9-inch tablet is on sale for $300 at Amazon, which is the lowest price we've seen to date. Just note that you'll need to clip an on-page coupon to see the full discount, and that the deal only applies to the blue and silver finishes as of this writing. For reference, Apple sells the slate for $349, though we previously saw it drop around $330 a couple weeks back.\n\nBe aware that this deal is for models with 64GB of storage; if you need more space, 256GB versions are also $49 off and down to a low of $450. Again, just clip the on-page coupon to get the final price. All of these offers are available at Costco as well, but only for subscribers to that retailer's membership plan. (Amazon's deals are likely price matches.) Costco's listing says the sale will run through May 31.\n\nWe gave the 10th-gen iPad a review score of 85 back in October 2022, and it's now the budget pick in our iPad buying guide. The latter is somewhat by default, since this is the only iPad available for less than $350. Still, it's a great tablet for the money. It has a similar design as the more expensive iPad Air, with a crisp display, a clean aluminum frame, thin bezels, a Touch ID reader and a USB-C port. Its battery life is about the same at 10-ish hours, and its A14 Bionic chip remains plenty fast for the things most people do with an iPad, be it streaming Netflix, playing the occasional game or doing basic work. Like Apple's pricier tablets, its front camera is located on its long edge, which is a more natural location for group FaceTime calls.\n\nTo be clear, if you can afford one of the new iPad Airs, we think it's worth it. Those are available in 11- and 13-inch sizes and include a host of upgrades that add up to a more pleasing experience. Those include a faster and more futureproof M2 chip, double the RAM and default storage and a laminated display (which means there's no visible \"gap\" between the front glass and the display itself). The Air is also compatible with better accessories, such as the new Pencil Pro stylus. Here, you're limited to the cheaper USB-C Pencil, which lacks pressure sensitivity, or the old first-gen Pencil, which requires a mess of adapters to charge. If you can find a last-gen iPad Air for cheap before it goes fully out of stock, that should remain a better value as well. Still, if you just want a tablet for the essentials and are looking to spend as little as possible, the entry-level model gets you the core iPad experience at a good price.

Unexpectedly large demand for the groundbreaking device.\n\nOriginal iPad goes on sale internationally\n\nApple sold a massive 1 million iPads in the tablet's first month on sale, and struggled to meet the overwhelming demand. In the end, Apple had no choice but to divert some of the iPads it had earmarked for the European launch to stores in the United States. As a result, Cupertino pushed back the international launch.\n\nA Reuters story illustrated the feverish level of international excitement about the iPad launch by quoting an eager customer in Japan:\n\n\"I wanted to touch it as soon as possible. I felt real excitement when it was finally in my hands,\" said Takechiyo Yamanaka, 19, who had camped out in front of Tokyo's flagship Apple store from Wednesday evening to be the first in line.\n\nThe original iPad measured 0.5 inches thick and weighed 1.5 pounds. It boasted a 9.7-inch multitouch display and a 1GHz Apple A4 chip. Storage options ranged from 16GB to 64GB of flash memory. It did not come with a camera.

Here's how the Surfaace Pro compares versus Apple's new iPad Pro.\n\nMicrosoft's launch of its Copilot+ PC initiative included two offerings of its own. Alongside a refreshed Surface Laptop, Microsoft also updated its top-end Surface Pro.\n\nAs part of the update, the Surface Pro now benefits from improved ARM processing, with more of a leaning towards machine learning and similar AI-based tasks for apps. This is an area that Apple has extensive experience in, with the Neural Engine in its M-series and A-series chips performing such tasks for users over the last few years.\n\nWith Microsoft's latest hardware salvo, it's also a direct attack against Apple's long-running premium tablet, the iPad Pro.\n\nThis is how Microsoft's Surface Pro 11 looks compared to Apple's M4-based slate.\n\nThe iPad Pro's update brought with it a few changes, but mostly it was made to be thinner and lighter than ever before, for both 13-inch and 11-inch iterations.\n\nThe 11-inch measures 9.83 inches long and 6.99 inches wide, while the 13-inch is 11.09 inches by 8.48 inches.\n\nThe Surface Pro's 11th edition follows the same design trend, in effectively being a much chunkier iPad. This time around, it's made from aluminum alloy that uses at least 72% recycled material.\n\nAvailable only in a 13-inch screen size, the Surface Pro is 11.3 inches long and 8.2 inches wide, making it longer and narrower than the 13-inch iPad Pro.\n\nWhen it comes to thickness, there's a definitive difference. The 11-inch iPad Pro is 0.21 inches thick, while the 13-inch is 0.20, but the Surface Pro is a lot chunkier at 0.37 inches.\n\nThis also translates into weight, as the Surface Pro is 1.97 pounds. By contrast, the 11-inch iPad Pro is 0.98 pounds and the 13-inch is 1.28 pounds.\n\nThe Surface Pro weighs as much as two 11-inch iPad Pros. That said, it does have the built-in kickstand, which the iPad doesn't have at all.\n\nAs part of its 2024 shake-up, Apple updated the iPad Pro to use a new Tandem OLED display. That means two OLED layers are used instead of one.\n\nFor Apple, this translates into a thinner display without backlighting, while maintaining brightness and dynamic range. That means they can go to 1,000 nits of full-screen brightness and 1,600 bits for peak brightness.\n\nThis also increased the contrast ratio to 2,000,000:1.\n\nAt 2,420 by 1,668, the 11-inch is the lowest resolution display of the two, with the 13-inch iPad Pro offering 2,752 by 2,064 pixels.\n\nAll of Apple's Ultra Retina XDR displays also have ProMotion support, True Tone, Wide Color (P3) coverage, and an optional Nano-texture display on the 1TB and 2TB models.\n\nMicrosoft offers two different types of display for its Surface Pro. The base version is LCD, but there's also an OLED version available.\n\nMicrosoft doesn't say what the brightnesses are, but it does offer up contrast ratios. The LCD version gets to 1,200:1, while the OLED manages 1,000,000:1.\n\nThe resolution of the displays are the same at 2,880 by 1,920. The pixel density of 267 pixels per inch just edges out Apple's tablet pair, with 264 ppi apiece.\n\nBoth displays are touch-sensitive, and work with styluses. The iPad Pro use the Apple Pencil Pro and the Apple Pencil USB-C.\n\nMicrosoft added support for the second-edition Surface Slim Pen.\n\nThe M4 chip inside the new iPad Pro consists of a nine-core CPU with three performance cores, as well as six efficiency cores, in the 256GB and 512GB capacities. The 1TB and 2TB versions have an extra performance core, making it ten in total.\n\nApple also includes the Neural Engine in both, a 16-core chip for ML workloads, which can handle up to 38 trillion operations per second.\n\nThe key change Microsoft made in its Surface is to use new Qualcomm chipsets. It uses the Snapdragon X Plus with the LCD display model and the Snapdragon X Elite in the OLED version.\n\nThese consist of a ten-core Oryon CPU in the Plus, a 12-core version in the Elite, combined with an Adreno GPU. It also includes a Qualcomm Hexagon NPU for neural processing, basically acting as Microsoft's analog to the Neural Engine.\n\nThe Hexagon is capable of up to 45 trillion operations per second, a bit higher than the top-spec Neural Engine.\n\nFor memory, Apple has 8GB and 16GB capacities, depending on storage capacity, while Microsoft offers 16GB and 32GB of LPDDR5x RAM.\n\nFor benchmarking comparison, we have to look to other hardware running the Snapdragon X chipsets. According to Geekbench, there's a range of scores for the Elite version, with single core between 2,400 and 2,750 and the multi-core from 12,000 to 13,900.\n\nIn the case of the M4 in the 11-inch iPad Pro, Geekbench lists it as getting 3,694 for single-core performance, 13,405 for multi-core.\n\nThis is significant, as that means for single-core workloads, the iPad Pros will be faster. Since most tasks iPad users perform are going to be single-core in nature, this is very helpful.\n\nThe iPad Pro has a rear 12-megapixel wide camera, complete with a LiDAR sensor. This is a small downgrade from the previous generation, which had two rear cameras, including a 10MP ultra-wide.\n\nAround the front is Apple's TrueDepth camera array, featuring a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens and a 2x digital zoom out. It's also made to handle Face ID for unlocking the iPad without a passcode.\n\nMicrosoft includes a 10-megapixel \"Ultra HD\" camera on the rear of the Surface Pro. It's joined by a Quad HD Surface Studio camera on the front.\n\nThe front camera system also features Windows Hello support, Microsoft's facial recognition system for biometric security.\n\nOn audio, Apple includes four speakers, one in each corner, to provide stereo sound regardless of orientation. Four \"studio quality\" mics are used for audio capture.\n\nMicrosoft includes \"Dual Studio Mics with voice focus\" in the Surface Pro, along with 2W stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support.\n\nOn the wireless side, the iPad Pro have Wi-Fi 6E support along with Bluetooth 5.3, and configurable 5G support, albeit without mmWave.\n\nThe Surface Pro will have 5G options in the fall. In the meantime, it does have Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 support.\n\nFor physical connections, the iPad Pro has a Thunderbolt 4 port that works with USB 4, as well as a rear Smart Connector.\n\nThe Surface Pro includes two USB 4 ports, a Surface Pro Keyboard port, and a Surface Connector port.\n\nSpeaking of keyboards, Microsoft singled out its Surface Pro Flex Keyboard during launch. It's a keyboard that can be used while attached to the Surface Pro, or detatched.\n\nObviously Bluetooth keyboards exist, so detached usage isn't entirely surprising, but Microsoft's solution seems to be a decent version for both connected and detached usage.\n\nThe battery capacity of the new Surface Pro is 58 watt hours, according to the company. This is enough to last for up to 14 hours of local video playback, and up to 10 hours of active web usage.\n\nFor the iPad Pro, Apple says both can manage up to 10 hours of web surfing or watching video, or up to nine hours when on cellular.\n\nFor 2024, the 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $999 with 256GB of storage. For 512GB it's $1,199, with 1TB at $1,599 and 2TB at $1,999.\n\nThe 13-inch version's base price is $1,299 with 256GB of capacity.

But there's one secret Apple Pencil Pro feature that Apple has never talked about - until now.\n\nAfter the Apple Pencil Pro launched, users discovered that it casts a virtual shadow on the iPad's OLED display, much like a real pencil would. For example, if you're writing something by hand, the Apple Pencil Pro casts a shadow that resembles a fountain pen. If you're painting, you'll instead see the shadow of a paintbrush. It's a neat feature for sure, but why exactly did Apple implement it?\n\nWell, now we know. Speaking to French tech site Numerama (translated version), Apple user interface designer Steve Lemay described how the idea was to make the interaction between the Apple Pencil Pro and the iPad Pro feel as natural as possible.\n\n\"In the past, we had to rely on your own memory [of which tool you were using],\" such as a pen or a paintbrush, Lemay explained. \"We designed a digital shadow to make you feel like you're holding a real pencil. This convinces you it's a sheet of paper.\"\n\nIn other words, the intention is to replicate the experience you would get from using a traditional, analog pencil on a piece of paper. If it feels natural, you'll be better able to concentrate on the work you're doing rather than being distracted by a digital tool, the thinking goes.\n\nIt's little touches like this that often earn Apple plaudits and has built the company's reputation for attention to detail. And we've certainly been impressed with the Apple Pencil Pro during our time with it so far.\n\nThe souped-up stylus also has a handy new squeeze function for pulling up a 'palette tool', which lets you change the ink color or undo pen strokes. That's something we wish it had had years ago.\n\nThere are also already apps, including Goodnotes 6 and Morpholio Trace, that take advantage of the Pencil Pro's new functionality. That's assuming you have an iPad Pro 13-inch (M4), iPad Pro 11-inch (M4), iPad Air 13-inch (M2) or iPad Air 11-inch (M2), which are currently the only tablets that support the new stylus.\n\nBut the new shadow feature is also definitely a nice touch that involved a surprising amount of engineering. Developer Nicol\u00e1s \u00c1lvarez, for example, dug around in Xcode and found over ten different models that Apple used for its shadows, showcasing their incredibly detailed meshes.\n\nKnowing Apple, this sort of attention to detail shouldn't come as a surprise, but it's a good example of how even small features can add up to make a big difference.", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_blake@techradar.com", "name": "Alex Blake", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_pen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fountain pen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Analog signal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "User interface design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xcode"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stylus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual_Arts/Illustration_and_Drawing", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual Arts/Illustration and Drawing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/PTC_Pro_Engineer", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/PTC Pro Engineer", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Writing_Instruments", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Writing Instruments", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XUtpoNLo3EjgrrzHaUYeu6-1200-80.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603658", "eventUri": "eng-9603658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

First up, we have a straight up $50 price drop on Apple's new 13-inch M2 iPad Air with 256GB of memory joined by the Alpine Loop Apple Watch Ultra 2 configurations dropping to $714 shipped. But if Apple's more high-end gear isn't for you right now, the iPad 10th Gen has now dropped to its new all-time low price - that's $300 flat for a current-generation Apple tablet. Head below for everything.\n\nYou can still score the entry-level 13-inch M2 iPad Air at a $754, but we just spotted a new all-time low on the 256GB 13-inch M2 iPad Air at $849 shipped. This is a regularly $899 configuration seeing a solid $50 price drop for the lowest we have tracked since they debuted earlier this month. While for some, the smaller 11-inch or the 128GB model at a lower price point will make more sense, and understandably so, I'm starting to feel like the 256GB storage on modern tablets is the price vs. value sweet spot for me personally. Having said that, you can get a more details and a closer look at the discounted pricing on all of the standard configurations down below.\n\nJoining the blue model, Amazon just dropped the price on the iPad 10th Generation in silver down to $299.99 shipped, the lowest price have ever tracked and $29 under the previous best. Be sure to clip the on-page coupon. The iPad 10th Generation still headlines the starting lineup and now, with a lower price tag. Both configurations have officially been slashed by $100, dropping the 64GB model from $449 to $349 and the 256G from $599 to $499. With the iPad 9th Gen officially discontinued, the iPad 10th Gen is the most affordable current-generation Apple tablet\n\nAmazon is now offering the Apple Watch Ultra 2 on the Alpine Loop starting from $714 shipped. Regularly $799, this is one of the lowest prices we have tracked on an Alpine Loop configuration and matching the ongoing discount below on the Trail Loop config. Now, if you're just looking to score an Ultra 2 and then flip the band out to something else (like the amazing leather Burton Goods straps we have an exclusive offer on or the best metal bracelet models right here), then you might as well grab the configuration with the Alpine or Trail Loop at $714.\n\nFresh off all of the huge deals we tracked for Memorial Day, folks who just picked up a new Apple Watch, or perhaps one of the exclusive deals we are offering on the Burton Goods leather straps, will want to check out today's rare offer on the Twelve South TimePorter. This handy accessory is made to house your Apple Watch band collection and is now down at $24.60 with free shipping for Prime members or in orders over $35. This is a Lightning offer and will only be around through today or until stock runs dry. Regularly $30, this is a rare chance to save, the second deal we have tracked all year, and matching the best price we have seen all-time.

It's one of the best iPad stands on the market thanks to its excellent, flexible design, and its great build quality. Now, the HoverBar Duo is back in its second iteration. Sporting a new white color and a new QuickSwitch Tab, but can the second generation HoverBar Duo clean up five stars where the original only took four? Read on to find out.\n\nThe second-generation Twelve South HoverBar Duo is available directly from Twelve South for $79.99. The HoverBar Duo is also available for $79.95 directly from Apple.com, as well as most Apple stores (check your local for availability.) Finally, you can get the HoverBar Duo from Amazon. Given it's quite new, stock and pricing both remain pretty stable.\n\nOut of the box, the HoverBar Duo is incredibly easy to use. You get the base stand, the arm, and the alternative clamp attachment. There are no screws or tools required, you simply attach the arm to either the clamp or the stand using the new QuickSwitch mount, and, voila! The only \"assembly\" required is the application of the clamp to your flat surface of choice. The design features a screw with a handle that can be used to grip tightly onto the surface of a desk or bookshelf.\n\nApplying the iPad to your stand is just as easy. The iPad grip features two symmetrical arms that can be extended to slot your iPad in, before magic (or some sort of mechanism) snaps them shut again, firmly holding your iPad in place. The HoverBar Duo supports all of Apple's best iPads, including all sizes of the iPad mini, iPad Air, and iPad Pro. As a bonus, it even works with all of Apple's best iPhones including all of the iPhone 15 and 14 models, as well as some iPhone 13, 12, and SE configurations.\n\nOnce assembled, the stand can be moved around pretty much any axis to perfectly position your iPad.\n\nLike the previous model, the new HoverBar Duo boasts an impressive build. The base is a mixture of heavier metal and soft plastic, replete with a slot for your Apple Pencil. All of the hinges feel smooth yet sturdy, and the stand supports my 11-inch M2 iPad Pro with ease. Under adjustment, the base is just about heavy enough to compensate for input and stop the stand moving around, however, as with any stand of this nature, physics will take over after a certain point. Like many iPad stands and monitor arms, the HoverBar Duo ships with hex keys you can use to adjust the hinge's resistance, making it easier or harder to move as you desire. We marked down the previous model for vibration under input. While the stand has some flex and wobble to it when you're making inputs, it's generally very sturdy and not at all unsteady.\n\nThe HoverBar Duo doesn't have any major features, as such, but its one defining feature is a brilliant one. As mentioned, you really are getting two stands for the price of one here. The base can be placed anywhere you like, while the clamp can be set up in an alternative location. The QuickSwitch tab lets you very quickly release the arm, swapping between the two at will. For instance, you could place the base stand on a desk or nightstand, really anywhere where space isn't at a premium. The clamp could be set up in an alternative location, such as in your kitchen or on a coffee table, ready to receive your iPad at a moment's notice. The clamp is particularly versatile because it means you can mount your iPad even where there's no space for a conventional stand. It would be perfect on a kitchen shelf out of harm's way from ingredients and food, or attached to a bed frame as a reading or viewing companion before you sleep.\n\nThere are a couple of rival stands you could consider as an alternative to the HoverBar Duo. Naturally, the old version, now cheaper, is a great option if you care less about the QuickSwitch tab. The MagFl\u00f6tt Pro is a sturdy option, but while it's height adjustable, it doesn't really hold a candle to the versatility or flexibility of the HoverBar Duo.\n\nSo there you have it, the TwelveSouth HoverBar Duo is a near-perfect iPad stand for anyone who wants flexibility, style, and functionality. The inclusion of not one but two bases, a clamp, and a stand, is a massive bonus that really delivers two stands for the price of one. It's also incredibly simple and built to last.", "source": {"uri": "imore.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "iMore"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_warwick@imore.com", "name": "Stephen Warwick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Screw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Store", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_13", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone 13"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_SE", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Macintosh SE"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Mini", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad Mini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vibration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major_League_Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major League Lacrosse", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Tournaments", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9a9FdFvvq3hjbdxjsbt36a-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603658", "eventUri": "eng-9603658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

After a month of attempting various methods, I suggest these simple tips to help you fix it.\n\nWhen your friend's Android phone or tablet works smoothly for regular web browsing or gaming, the Expensive iPad or iPad Pro you own shows a slow internet connection for browsing and gaming.\n\nI have recently uploaded a video to our channel explaining the same steps. Kindly watch if needed.\n\nRemember, try the methods one by one. For some users, 1st step may fix the iPad WiFi Slow Speed Internet Connection Problem; for some users, it could be 4th step.\n\n#1 Perform a Network Settings Reset\n\nThe first step is to reset your network settings. This will erase all saved Wi-Fi networks and passwords, so you will need to re-enter them afterward:\n\nThis step can resolve many connectivity issues by restoring your network settings to their default state.\n\nChanging your DNS settings to use Cloudflare's DNS servers can improve your connection speed:\n\nCloudflare's DNS servers are known for their speed and reliability, which can enhance your browsing experience.\n\n#3 Restore iPadOS\n\nAs a last resort, you can restore your iPad to factory settings. I did this to fix the iPad WiFi Slow Speed Internet connectivity problem, which helped.\n\nImportant Note: Performing a factory reset will erase all your data and settings. Make sure to back up your iPad before proceeding.\n\nIt's generally not recommended to download the iPadOS.ipsw file manually unless instructed by Apple Support. The software you use to restore (iTunes or Finder) will automatically download the latest iPadOS version compatible with your device.\n\nIf you're still facing problems, a temporary workaround is to turn off Wi-Fi from the control center when you're not using your iPad. Turn it ON when you pick up your iPad next time to surf the web, use apps, or gaming.\n\nI suspect some bug in the network settings is causing such a strange issue. I did report this bug to apple and hoping a fix soon via updates.\n\n#5 Submit Feedback to Apple\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, consider submitting a feedback report to Apple:\n\nBy following these steps, you can improve your iPad's WiFi speed.\n\nResetting network settings, configuring DNS, restoring factory settings, using workarounds, and submitting feedback to Apple are all effective ways to troubleshoot and resolve connectivity issues.\n\nDon't forget to share this post with your friends, as it may help if others are experiencing similar iPad WiFi Slow Speed Problems.

It seems Apple might agree as its been hinted that landscape might be the preferred orientation for the next iPads.\n\nAs shared by Trusted Reviews, the potential, possible, probable change was hinted at by Apple designer Molly Anderson in an interview with the French website Numerama.\n\nThe hinted orientation came out of a response Anderson gave Numerama about the positioning of the Apple logo on the rear of the iPad Pro M4. Currently, it is positioned such that the logo is upright when the tablet is in portrait mode.\n\nHowever, if one turns the device to landscape, the logo looks sideways.\n\n\"I think this could change, I don't think it's engraved in stone,\" Anderson said. \"We are thinking about it. The iPad has long been a product that is used in portrait mode, but we are increasingly using it in landscape mode. We can't say it's fixed.\"\n\nIn the interview, Scott Brodrick, iPad category manager, tried to temper this statement by saying that the design team uses the iPad vertically when taking FaceTime calls.\n\nThat would make sense if Apple hadn't moved the webcam on the iPad Pro M4 from the top of the portrait orientation. Instead, the latest generation of iPads relocated the webcam for use in landscape orientation.\n\nWith the new Magic Keyboard, the iPad Pro M4 seems to be a candidate for replacing your laptop with a tablet. Our testing revealed that it's not quite there, mostly because of the iPadOS which hampers productivity. That and a decent MacBook Air is cheaper than current top-line iPads.\n\nAdditionally, in the French interview, the designers told Numerama that they think of the iPad, the new Apple Pencil, and the Magic Keyboard as a single product. If Apple is heading down a landscape oriented tablet, it might mean a focus on actually making a device that could reasonably replace a laptop.\n\nHowever it does go against the designer's goal of creating a \"magic sheet of glass.\"", "source": {"uri": "tomsguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tom's Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_younker@tomsguide.com", "name": "Scott Younker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_orientation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Page orientation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Webcam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FaceTime"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet_PCs", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet PCs", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Orienteering", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Orienteering", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Orienteering/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Orienteering/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Landscape", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Landscape", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jPFoRPTWq4yLXE7hjc9d8H-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603658", "eventUri": "eng-9603658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 454626374, "relevance": 2}

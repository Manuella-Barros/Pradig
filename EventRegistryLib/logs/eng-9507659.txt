Because he is, dare I say it, competition, a threat, whatever word you wanna use,\" Stallone added.\n\nHe recalled, \"As soon as I saw him it was like bang, two alphas hitting.\"\n\n\"If we walked into a party we'd be staring at each other for a few seconds and then 'I gotta get that guy. He didn't do anything wrong but he will,' \" Stallone said.\n\nSchwarzenegger said he got too competitive to a point that he went as far requesting a bigger weapon as prop to use in his movie.\n\n\"I was running after him,\" Schwarzenegger explained. \"He was not running after me. So I said, when we did 'Predator' -- you got to get a machine gun that is normally mounted on a tank or in a helicopter -- I said ...

The movie in question? The 1992 comedic action film Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot costarring Estelle Getty.\n\nSchwarzenegger revealed that he and his agent worked together on a plan to convince Stallone, 77, to sign on for the movie, because they had a -- correct -- hunch the comedy would bomb at the box office.\n\n\"First of all, when we talk about the movie, I didn't talk him into [it] because I never talked to him about it,\" The Terminator actor said. \"But it was very clear that his agent was telling my agent, 'Look, Sly is interested in doing it, but I don't know if it's the right thing for him. Let me know what you guys are thinking.' And then my agent said, 'Well you know, Arnold really loves it. I think it's fantastic.' \"\n\nRelated: Arnold Schwarzenegger Says Sylvester Stallone Rivalry Helped His Career: 'I Had Something I Could Chase'\n\nSchwarzenegger only got craftier from there.

And then of course [Stallone's] agent, knowing that he's competitive with me, he said, 'Cannot let that happen.' \"\n\nAccording to Schwarzenegger, Stallone's agent was quick to put his client forward for the lead role. \"He then called the studio right away and says, 'Look, you got to give this to Sly. Don't give this to Schwarzenegger, you got to give this to Sly,' \" he said.\n\nSchwarzenegger added, \"I was, of course, absolutely in heaven, because I felt like the only way I could catch up with him is if he [had] a stumble.\" Stallone asked, \"Can you get more Machiavellian?\"\n\nIn the film, Stallone plays Sgt. Joe Bomowski, who receives a visit from his meddling mom Tutti (Getty) after he gets his heart broken. Soon, Tutti witnesses a murder, which results in her becoming her son's unlikely partner as she continues to dole out advice about his professional and romantic relationships.\n\nRelated: Arnold Schwarzenegger Related to Robert Downey Jr.'s Oscars Speech About a 'Terrible Childhood'\n\nStop!

Or My Mom Will Shoot plays as if it were a pilot for a sitcom that wasn't sold in 1975.\"\n\nDespite their box office rivalry and a history of ups and downs, the two iconic action movie stars are now close friends.

It's really unbelievable, and it must come from somewhere because he's a very emotional guy, which I'm not.\"\n\nStallone revealed that he loves how \"rock-steady\" his friend is, adding, \"He's like a season that doesn't change.

Because he is, dare I say it, competition, a threat, whatever word you wanna use.\n\n\"As soon as I saw him it was like bang, two alphas hitting. If we walked into a party we'd be staring at each other for a few seconds and then 'I gotta get that guy. He didn't do anything wrong but he will.' \"\n\nThe pair laughed over an incident early in their careers when Stallone threw flowers on his rival at the Golden Globe awards in 1977 when Schwarzenegger received the New Actor of the Year prize for 'Stay Hungry' and his own film 'Rocky' took the prestigious Best Picture accolade.\n\nThe 'Terminator' star reflected: \"We both won, so there was plenty of room for everybody.\"\n\nBut interviewer Harvey Levin pointed out: \"That's not how I remember it. I thought [Stallone], when Rocky won best picture, you threw a bowl of flowers at him?\"\n\nStallone confirmed: \"I absolutely did. He was sitting across from me, and I'm going, 'He won best newcomer?' No offense, but 'Rocky' was a pretty good debut. And he's looking very proud of himself and I didn't think we were gonna win Best Picture.\n\n\"We win, and I lost it.\n\n\"I literally went and picked up this entire bouquet of flowers and tossed them straight up in the air, sort of aiming towards his side of the table. And it all comes down, he's sort of sitting there with the same kind of like 'okay'. He just threw down the gauntlet kind of a thing, here we go.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger added: \"I remember the incident but that was not yet the point where I said, 'Okay this is now the beginning of a battle.' It just developed from then on. Now I had to chase him.\"\n\nThe former rivals are now friends and the pair admire one another greatly.\n\nSingling out his pal's \"dedication and passion\", Schwarzenegger said: \"I wish I could be as passionate about things as he is.\n\n\"It's really unbelievable, and it must come from somewhere because he's a very emotional guy, which I'm not. I'm emotional but not like him. Very different in that way.\"\n\nThe 'Rambo' actor admires the former Governor of California's \"rock-steady\" persona.\n\nHe said: \"He's like a season that doesn't change. Very organised, very calculated, very thoughtful. I'm not, and he's right, I'm very emotional and I tend to be swayed and things can upset logic quite often. And that's when you make mistakes, when your heart overwhelms your brain.\n\n\"He's like a chess player: you don't know what's going on but he gets it done. And he really does have a big heart, he does.\n\n\"I mean, you wouldn't think it 'cause we're 'action guys' but we're more emotional than a lot of more dramatic actors, trust me.

Or My Mom Will Shoot,\" a mother-son buddy cop movie, only to ensure it landed in Stallone's lap.\n\nThe film, which starred Stallone and \"Golden Girls\" alum Estelle Getty, was a critical flop.\n\n\"I was, of course, absolutely in heaven,\" Schwarzenegger said. \"I felt like the only way that I could catch up with him was if he stumbled. It was psychological. This is a whole thing about Hollywood -- when you're always as good as your last movie.\"\n\nThe action icons have long patched things up, even carving Halloween pumpkins together in 2022. Schwarzenegger said he admires Stallone for his emotional vulnerability and \"dedication and passion,\" only for Stallone to respond in kind.\n\n\"He's like a chess player. You don't know what's going on, but he gets it done,\" Stallone said of Schwarzenegger. \"And he really does have a big heart, he does.

She previously worked at POPSUGAR, Bustle and Scarymommy.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger was not above using a little trickery to ensure his action movie box office dominance in the '80s and '90s.\n\nDuring Fox's April 23 special TMZ Presents: Arnold & Sly: Rivals, Friends, Icons, the former California governor, 76, revealed to Sylvester Stallone that he covertly convinced the Rocky actor to star in a movie that he knew would be a flop. The movie in question? The 1992 comedic action film Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot costarring Estelle Getty.\n\nSchwarzenegger revealed that he and his agent worked together on a plan to convince Stallone, 77, to sign on for the movie, because they had a -- correct -- hunch the comedy would bomb at the box office.\n\n\"First of all, when we talk about the movie, I didn't talk him into [it] because I never talked to him about it,\" The Terminator actor said. \"But it was very clear that his agent was telling my agent, 'Look, Sly is interested in doing it, but I don't know if it's the right thing for him. Let me know what you guys are thinking.' And then my agent said, 'Well you know, Arnold really loves it. I think it's fantastic.' \"\n\nSchwarzenegger only got craftier from there. He went on to tell Stallone that he spoke with the movie's director, Roger Spottiswoode.\n\n\"Oh my God, oh my God,\" Stallone said, before adding, \"You talked to my director?\"\n\nThe Maggie star said Stallone's agent was quick to take the bait once he found out Schwarzenegger was talking to Spottiswoode.\n\n\"So my agent said, 'Arnold is talking to Roger Spottiswoode now and he's really into it, I think we're gonna take the project.' And then of course [Stallone's] agent, knowing that he's competitive with me, he said, 'Cannot let that happen.' \"\n\nAccording to Schwarzenegger, Stallone's agent was quick to put his client forward for the lead role. \"He then called the studio right away and says, 'Look, you got to give this to Sly. Don't give this to Schwarzenegger, you got to give this to Sly,' \" he said.\n\nSchwarzenegger added, \"I was, of course, absolutely in heaven, because I felt like the only way I could catch up with him is if he [had] a stumble.\" Stallone asked, \"Can you get more Machiavellian?\"\n\nIn the film, Stallone plays Sgt. Joe Bomowski, who receives a visit from his meddling mom Tutti (Getty) after he gets his heart broken. Soon, Tutti witnesses a murder, which results in her becoming her son's unlikely partner as she continues to dole out advice about his professional and romantic relationships.\n\nStop! Or My Mom Will Shoot grossed a paltry $70,411,000 worldwide, according to TheNumbers.com. The movie was also panned by critics with The New York Times writing in 1992, \"It is terrible. Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot plays as if it were a pilot for a sitcom that wasn't sold in 1975.\"\n\nDespite their box office rivalry and a history of ups and downs, the two iconic action movie stars are now close friends. Elsewhere in the special, the men shared what they admire the most about one another.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nFor Schwarzenegger, it's all about Stallone's \"dedication and his passion.\" He shared, \"I wish I could be as passionate about things as he is ... When you talk about scripts or when you talk about your characters you play in movies, I mean, you talk about movies and there's just so much passion there. It's really unbelievable, and it must come from somewhere because he's a very emotional guy, which I'm not.\"\n\nStallone revealed that he loves how \"rock-steady\" his friend is, adding, \"He's like a season that doesn't change. Very organized, very calculated, very thoughtful.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_Stallone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sylvester Stallone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arnold Schwarzenegger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Spottiswoode", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roger Spottiswoode"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bustle_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bustle (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estelle_Getty", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Estelle Getty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terminator (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mom_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mom (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol\u00f2_Machiavelli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Television pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heaven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/9WVt3i-DEbw3Kjwdg9bGKq3uEuQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(728x263:730x265)/arnold-schwarzenegger-sylvester-stallone--042424-1-1943f3f8e9d4400ebb7e7390ea43537a.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507659", "eventUri": "eng-9507659", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-23", "textStart": 294, "textEnd": 302}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

I'm just warming up, and I hear a pow. I fall on the floor. And Franco goes, 'Let me see.' He jams his fingers...I've torn my pec off the bone. I mean, bad. I could hear it go rip, and he's jamming his fingers. And I think I'm going to black out.\"\n\nStallone had torn his pectoral muscles in a near-career-ending injury and he had to fight right-handed in the film to save his left pectoral muscles from further damage, the 77-year-old said on TMZ special Arnold & Sly: Rivals, Friends, Icons on Tuesday.\n\nSharing an Instagram reel highlighting the moment from the show which also features his contemporary Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Rambo star wrote, \"Now you know the real reason Rocky went from fighting left to right handed. Just like in life, we don't stop. We don't quit. We just keep going. We keep punching.\"\n\nSuffering from the serious injury, Stallone believed that it was the end of both the boxing franchise as well as his career. \"I go home. I feel like my career is over. I'm supposed to start Rocky II, direct it, everything in a month and a half,\" he said. \"Here's the difference, and [Schwarzenegger] would have done the same thing. I can't use this arm, so I'll change it in Rocky. He'll fight right-handed.\"\n\nRocky fans might have wondered why the boxer faces deteriorating eyesight and goes right-handed in his fight against Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) in the lead up to the first film. \"But I said, 'I'm not stopping this movie just for this.' And this was a bad injury ... I switched arms. That was one of the key things,\" Stallone said firmly.\n\nStallone signed off by looking back on his journey and reminding his fans to never quit in the face of challenges. \"But it's interesting the way these incredible journeys happen. But we don't stop, we don't quit,\" he said.\n\nRocky II was released in theaters on June 15, 1979. It grossed approximately USD 200 million at the box office worldwide.

Arnold and Sylvester have often spoken about making peace with each other. However, recently, the duo appeared on the prime-time interview 'Arnold & Sly: Rivals, Friends, Icons' for TMZ and recalled their competitive rivalry. (Also read: Arnold Schwarzenegger shows his 'pacemaker' in hilarious new pic)\n\nIn an interview with Harvey Levin, Arnold said, \"There's no two ways about that: He was very helpful in my career because I had something that I could chase.\" Sylvester reacted to the same and added, \"When he (Arnold) came along, I was like, finally, something to motivate me. Because he is, dare I say it, competition, a threat, whatever word you wanna use. As soon as I saw him, it was like bang, two alphas hitting. If we walked into a party, we'd be staring at each other for a few seconds, and then 'I gotta get that guy. He didn't do anything wrong but he will.'\" The co-actors who starred in The Expendables also recalled how Sylvester threw a bouquet of flowers at Arnold at the Golden Globe awards. The former stated that he was surprised that Arnold won the Best Newcomer award as he felt Rocky was a better debut.\n\nFor the unversed, Sylvester made his acting debut with the 1976 sports drama Rocky. He later became famous as he portrayed a Vietnam war veteran in the action franchise - Rambo. \"He will be seen next in the movies Armored and Alarum.\"\n\nArnold made his entry into Hollywood after winning bodybuilding competitions such Mr. Olympia and Mr. Universe. His first movie was the fantasy action-adventure Conan the Barbarian (1982). However, he gained commercial success and recognition with James Cameron's The Terminator (1984) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991).

He didn't do anything wrong, but he will'.\"\n\nWhile Sylvester said Arnie's rise helped \"motivate\" him, and the Terminator actor agreed his fellow action star \"was very helpful\" as someone he could \"chase\" after, Arnold admitted he \"started this whole thing\" by \"saying stupid things\" and \"being competitive\".\n\n\"It was kind of like, 'Well, what was your body fat?'\" he recalled asking Sylvester. \"And I was down to 7%, so I said I was down to 10%. So it became a competition with the body. Then he started using machine guns that were huge machine guns.\"\n\n\"I was running after him,\" Arnold continued. \"He was not running after me. So I said, when we did Predator -- you got to get a machine gun that is normally mounted on a tank or in a helicopter -- I said ... I got to have a bigger machine gun than he used in Rambo.\"\n\nTheir competition had started much earlier at the 1977 Golden Globes, however, when Sylvester's Rocky won Best Film after Arnold claimed the New Actor of the Year award for Stay Hungry. Sylvester said that he \"lost it\" when Rocky won.\n\n\"I literally went and picked up this entire bouquet of flowers and tossed them straight up in the air, sort of aiming toward [Arnold's] side of the table,\" he said. \"And it all comes down, he's sort of sitting there [thinking] ... [he] just threw down the gauntlet.\"\n\nThe most insidious incident came in the early '90s, however, when Arnold used certain sources and Hollywood agents to pretend he was circling Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot, a mother-son buddy cop movie, only to ensure it landed in Sylvester's lap.\n\nThe film, which starred Sylvester and Golden Girls alum Estelle Getty, was a critical flop.\n\n\"I was, of course, absolutely in heaven,\" Arnold said. \"I felt like the only way that I could catch up with him was if he stumbled. It was psychological. This is a whole thing about Hollywood -- when you're always as good as your last movie.\"\n\nThe action icons have long patched things up, even carving Halloween pumpkins together in 2022. Arnold said he admires Sylvester for his emotional vulnerability and \"dedication and passion,\" only for Sly to respond in kind.\n\n\"He's like a chess player. You don't know what's going on, but he gets it done,\" he said of the former California governor.\n\n\"And he really does have a big heart, he does. I mean, you wouldn't think it because we're 'action guys,' but we're more emotional than a lot of more dramatic actors, trust me.\"", "source": {"uri": "huffingtonpost.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "HuffPost UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_the_Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sylvester the Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arnold Schwarzenegger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_gun", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Machine gun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Levin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Levin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terminator (character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_Stallone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sylvester Stallone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rabies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden Globe Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA_Award_for_Best_Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BAFTA Award for Best Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Predator (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rambo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Rambo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_cop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buddy cop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estelle_Getty", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Estelle Getty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Girls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Golden Girls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Halloween"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pumpkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heaven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chess"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mom_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mom (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6629190c230000200088ee28.jpeg?cache=cwJHNKT8S4&ops=1200_630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507659", "eventUri": "eng-9507659", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Dave Campbell says persistent drought conditions in B.C. stretch back to 2022, so the province is heading into this summer with \"multi-year\" precipitation deficits. Satellite photos show rivers across the province running narrower and shallower than the same time in 2023, which went on to be one of B.C.'s driest years on record. With average snowpack levels lower than ever recorded in B.C. this past winter, Campbell says he's expecting cumulative effects that could include water scarcity and other challenges. \"We know these antecedent conditions that we're coming into this year are much more challenging than we started out last year with,\" he said in a recent interview. \"The concern obviously is if we get that hot, prolonged dry (period) that we've seen last year and the year before as well. If that continues this summer, then really we are on a path toward things that we haven't seen in recent memory.\" Pockets of the Interior are especially dry. Campbell said he's most worried about the effects of drought on smaller rivers and creeks in the central Interior. \"Prince George, Quesnel, Williams Lake, Vanderhoof, that's kind of the hot spot, and then the other (area) that would be a concern would be up in the northeast,\" he said. The area around Vanderhoof, B.C., west of Prince George, has seen about 220 millimetres of rain over the past year when it typically sees about 460 millimetres, he said. Images provided by the Canadian Space Agency appear to show the effects of persistent drought in the Interior when compared with those taken last spring. An image taken last week by theEuropean Space Agency's Sentinel-2 satellite shows the Quesnel River is narrower, with more of its banks exposed this month compared with an image taken a year ago. Last week's photo shows patches of exposed riverbed and sandbars, indicating lower water levels in the tributary as it meets the upper Fraser River in Quesnel. Satellite images tell a similar story in Fort St. James, B.C., where the water appears shallower this year as Stuart Lake feeds into Stuart River. The Fort Nelson and Muskwa rivers also appear narrower, with more of their banks exposed compared with images taken in April 2023. The Canadian Space Agency notes the images use infrared \"false colour\" because it shows the boundaries between land and water more clearly than other renditions. Campbell said parts of B.C.'s Okanagan will likely also see the effects of the moisture deficit and low amounts of snow that melted early this spring. On northern Vancouver Island, meanwhile, he said the community of Port Hardy, B.C., has seen 1,260 millimetres of rain over the last year when it typically sees a little more than 1,800 millimetres. It would take \"a few months of wet-season rainfall\" to ease the drought, he said. B.C.'s snow survey last month found snowpack across the province was \"extremely low,\" averaging 63 per cent of normal. The Quesnel area was listed at 52 per cent of normal, while the neighbouring West-Road Chilcotin region was at zero per cent.

If that continues this summer, then really we are on a path toward things that we haven't seen in recent memory.\"\n\nPockets of the Interior are especially dry. Campbell said he's most worried about the effects of drought on smaller rivers and creeks in the central Interior.\n\n\"Prince George, Quesnel, Williams Lake, Vanderhoof, that's kind of the hot spot, and then the other (area) that would be a concern would be up in the northeast,\" he said.\n\nThe area around Vanderhoof, B.C., west of Prince George, has seen about 220 millimetres of rain over the past year when it typically sees about 460 millimetres, he said.\n\nImages provided by the Canadian Space Agency appear to show the effects of persistent drought in the Interior when compared with those taken last spring.\n\nAn image taken last week by theEuropean Space Agency's Sentinel-2 satellite shows the Quesnel River is narrower, with more of its banks exposed this month compared with an image taken a year ago. Last week's photo shows patches of exposed riverbed and sandbars, indicating lower water levels in the tributary as it meets the upper Fraser River in Quesnel.\n\nSatellite images tell a similar story in Fort St. James, B.C., where the water appears shallower this year as Stuart Lake feeds into Stuart River.\n\nThe Fort Nelson and Muskwa rivers also appear narrower, with more of their banks exposed compared with images taken in April 2023.\n\nThe Canadian Space Agency notes the images use infrared \"false colour\" because it shows the boundaries between land and water more clearly than other renditions.\n\nCampbell said parts of B.C.'s Okanagan will likely also see the effects of the moisture deficit and low amounts of snow that melted early this spring.\n\nOn northern Vancouver Island, meanwhile, he said the community of Port Hardy, B.C., has seen 1,260 millimetres of rain over the last year when it typically sees a little more than 1,800 millimetres.\n\nIt would take \"a few months of wet-season rainfall\" to ease the drought, he said.\n\nB.C.'s snow survey last month found snowpack across the province was \"extremely low,\" averaging 63 per cent of normal. The Quesnel area was listed at 52 per cent of normal, while the neighbouring West-Road Chilcotin region was at zero per cent.\n\nOfficials are expected to hold a press conference about drought and wildfires on Thursday as the province releases its latest snowpack bulletin.\n\nREAD ALSO: Cowichan mourns 1,000s of fish lost as B.C. drought risk looms again\n\nREAD ALSO: B.C. preparing farmers for

During the peak summer months, residents of Metro Vancouver consume between 1.5 and 1.8 billion litres of water each day.\n\n\"This is an extremely challenging amount to envision,\" she said.\n\nMa said she recognizes there may be questions about large industrial users, but \"nobody gets a free pass on this.\"\n\n\"Those companies, those industries, they are regulated, and they will be affected, if necessary, as well.\n\n\"But we as individuals, as households, we have a role to play,\" she said.\n\nThe province also released its latest snowpack bulletin on Thursday, which says levels are \"extremely low,\" averaging 66 per cent of normal for this time of year.\n\nPockets of the Interior are especially dry.

If that continues this summer, then really we are on a path toward things that we haven't seen in recent memory.\"\n\nB.C. officials held a news conference on Thursday to announce several new measures to help people prepare for threats such as drought and wildfires, which include an online tool for household emergency planning, an updated drought information portal and upgrades to the B.C. Wildfire Service mobile app.\n\nNathan Cullen, minister of water, land and resource stewardship, said the province is facing a \"serious\" situation with the potential for continued drought, and he asked people to take steps to reduce their consumption to conserve water.\n\n\"Every drop counts,\" he said.\n\nEmergency Management Minister Bowinn Ma said people often underestimate how their individual consumption adds up. During the peak summer months, residents of Metro Vancouver consume between 1.5 and 1.8 billion litres of water each day.\n\n\"This is an extremely challenging amount to envision,\" she said.\n\nMa said she recognizes there may be questions about large industrial users, but \"nobody gets a free pass on this.\"\n\n\"Those companies, those industries, they are regulated, and they will be affected, if necessary, as well.\n\n\"But we as individuals, as households, we have a role to play,\" she said.\n\nThe province also released its latest snowpack bulletin on Thursday, which says levels are \"extremely low,\" averaging 66 per cent of normal for this time of year.\n\nThe bulletin says many low- to mid-elevation areas in the Interior are now free of snow.\n\nMuch of B.C. saw below-normal precipitation levels in April, the bulletin says, with some smaller pockets recording near-normal amounts.\n\nThe next three days are expected to bring temperatures that are \"well above normal,\" leading to the first episode of rapid melting at higher elevations, it says.\n\nParts of the Interior are especially dry. Campbell said he's most worried about the effects of drought on smaller rivers and creeks in the central Interior.\n\n\"Prince George, Quesnel, Williams Lake, Vanderhoof, that's kind of the hot spot, and then the other [area] that would be a concern would be up in the northeast,\" he said.\n\nThe Vanderhoof area, west of Prince George, has seen about 220 millimetres of rain over the past year when it typically sees more than double that, he said.\n\nImages provided by the Canadian Space Agency appear to show the effects of persistent drought in the Interior when compared with those taken last spring.\n\nAn image taken last week by a European Space Agency satellite shows the Quesnel River is narrower, with more of its banks exposed compared with an image taken a year ago. The latest photo shows patches of exposed riverbed and sandbars, indicating lower water levels in the tributary as it meets the upper Fraser River in Quesnel, about 600 kilometres north of Vancouver.\n\nSatellite images tell a similar story in Fort St. James, B.C., where the water appears shallower this year as Stuart Lake feeds into Stuart River.\n\nThe Fort Nelson and Muskwa rivers also appear narrower, with more of their banks exposed compared with images taken in April 2023.\n\nThe Canadian Space Agency notes the images use infrared \"false colour\" because it shows the boundaries between land and water more clearly than other renditions.\n\nCampbell said parts of B.C.'s Okanagan will likely also see the effects of the moisture deficit and low amounts of snow that melted early this spring.\n\nOn northern Vancouver Island, he said Port Hardy has seen 1,260 millimetres of rain over the last year when it typically sees more than 1,800 millimetres.\n\nIt would take \"a few months of wet-season rainfall\" to make up that deficit, he said.\n\nForests Minister Bruce Ralston told the news conference on Thursday that dry conditions and warm weather in the forecast will likely spur wildfire activity. He said officials are keeping a close eye on northeastern B.C. in particular.\n\nHe said the B.C. Wildfire Service had dispatched an incident management team to establish a command centre in the Fort Nelson area.\n\n\"We're preparing air and ground resources. Helicopters, air tankers, unit crews and initial attack crews are being brought in early,\" he said.\n\nCliff Chapman, director of provincial operations for the B.C. Wildfire Service, said they've increased partnerships with First Nations and other local governments to use prescribed fire to help reduce the risks around communities this summer.\n\n\"Twenty years ago, when I started my career in B.C. Wildfire Service, many of the fires that we fought did not interact with communities,\" he added.\n\n\"At this point in the life cycle of wildfires in British Columbia, almost every fire has an impact on somebody's livelihood or it is adjacent to a community.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Campbell said he's most worried about the effects of drought on smaller rivers and creeks in the central Interior.\n\n\"Prince George, Quesnel, Williams Lake, Vanderhoof, that's kind of the hot spot, and then the other (area) that would be a concern would be up in the northeast,\" he said.\n\nThe area around Vanderhoof, B.C., west of Prince George, has seen about 220 millimetres of rain over the past year when it typically sees about 460 millimetres, he said.", "source": {"uri": "nationalpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kim Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowpack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snowpack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water scarcity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_Lake,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Williams Lake, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Williams Lake, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderhoof,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vanderhoof, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vanderhoof, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quesnel,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quesnel, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Quesnel, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince George, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prince George, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/nationalpost/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jfj601-the-canadian-press.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552465", "eventUri": "eng-9552465", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

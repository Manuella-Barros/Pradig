She had a best snatch lift of 88kg and a best clean and jerk lift of 111kg.\n\nINDIA'S OLYMPIC MEDAL TALLY | INDIA AT PARIS OLYMPICS | LATEST OLYMPIC NEWS | KEY DATES AT PARIS 2024\n\nChina's Hou Zhihui won gold with an Olympic Record 207kg, and she did that in dramatic fashion with her final lift in the clean and jerk - an astonishing 117kg. Romania's Mihaela Valentina Cambei surprised many with a silver, lifting 205kg (93kg + 112kg). Thailand's Surodchana Khambao rounded off the podium with a total of 200kg (88kg + 112kg).\n\nMirabai's personal best is 207 (88kg + 119kg) but she has not been lifting anywhere close to that after an injury stricken 2023 and 2024, and that was evident through the clean and jerk section. Hopes of return to full fitness had been boosted, though, when she matched her personal best in the snatch.\n\nAt the end of the snatch section, Mirabai (88kg) was fourth behind Cambei (93kg), Zhihui (89kg) and Khambao (88kg). Khambao was ahead on the basis that her first lift was kilo heavier than Mirabai on the first attempt at snatch.\n\nMirabai started a steady weight. Both thighs taped up, she stalked out onto the stage, and lifted 85 kg with minimum fuss. For her next lift she went straight to her highest ever snatch lift -- 88kg but her knees buckled, and she was unable to lift the bar over her head.\n\nIn her third attempt, though, there was no hesitation, no buckling. Lifting it clean over her head, she held it before flashing a smile as the ref's green lights lit up.\n\nZhihui came out with an 89, failed that first lift before succeeding with her second attempt at 89 and failing at her third attempt at 93kg. This was a major surprise considering Hou's domination of this event at the world level. Cambei had the smoothest run of all, lifting 89kg, 91kg and a stunning 93kg all with seemingly no trouble.\n\nIn the clean and jerk, Mirabai walked out last with the highest first weight attempt at 111kg, lifted the clean but as she was jerking it over her head, her elbows buckled. Her second stayed at that same weight. She held the clean for a longer time than usual but jerked it above her head - and held it there till the green lights lit up.\n\nAt this point she was third with 199kg, but after Khambao lifted 112kg in her second attempt to go to 200kg. Forced by this to lift higher, she went to 114kg, but simply couldn't get purchase in her attempt to jerk the bar over her head.\n\nMeanwhile, Cambei started with 106kg, before hurriedly shifting her second lift to 110kg and then ending with a comfortable lift of 112kg.\n\nHuihui came out and started with a 110kg and made it look like a walk in the park. She failed at her second attempt at 117kg, but needing that weight to take gold, she came in clutch to lift 117kg.", "source": {"uri": "espn.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirabai", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mirabai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_and_jerk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clean and jerk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snatch_(weightlifting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snatch (weightlifting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surodchana_Khambao", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surodchana Khambao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hou_Zhihui", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hou Zhihui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saikhom_Mirabai_Chanu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saikhom Mirabai Chanu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic weightlifting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Olympic_Lifting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Olympic Lifting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Women", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0807%2Fr1370025_1024x576_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795434", "eventUri": "eng-9795434", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

She attributed her weaker performance to being on the third day of her menstrual cycle.\n\nMirabai ended the two-phase competition with a total score of 199 kg, falling 3 kg short of her Tokyo Olympics total of 202 kg. Her personal best remains 205 kg, achieved at the 2020 Asian Championship.\n\n\"I am happy with the performance... I tried my best to give my 100 to give India a medal. I managed this despite having very little time for recovery after my injury... but it was not in destiny. It was the third day of my periods and in Tokyo it was my second day, so that also affects your body a bit,\" Mirabai told reporters.\n\nDuring the snatch round, Mirabai successfully lifted 85kg on her first attempt. Her second attempt at 88kg was unsuccessful, even though she initially indicated 86kg for her second try but later changed it. In her final snatch attempt, she equaled her personal best and national record of 88kg. However, Thai weightlifter Surodchana Khambao also lifted 88kg, leading both athletes to share third place at the end of the snatch round.\n\n\"Everything was going well for me in the warm up. I gave my best in snatch (88kg). Clean and jerk was also going very well. I fumbled a bit in my first jerk... While walking on the stage, I was feeling a little weak because of the third day (of my period). It was going well. Whatever the coach said, I did. It is just destiny that a medal slipped out of my hand,\" she added.\n\nIn the clean and jerk event, Mirabai's first attempt to lift 111 kg was unsuccessful.

The ideal relative humidity should be above 60 per cent, he said.\n\nIn the Assam Valley, tea output increased 11.3 per cent to 69.79 m kg over 62.70 m kg in the same period last year.

She was allowed to compete in both classes, where she won in 50kg but lost in 53 kg.\n\nIn a major blow to India's medal hopes, Indian wrestler Vinesh Phogat has been disqualified from the Paris Olympics. Notably, during the weigh-in for her gold medal bout against US wrestler Sarah Hildebrandt, she was found 100 grams over the allowed weight limit for wrestlers in the 50 kg freestyle category, resulting in her disqualification. Following her disqualification, the US wrestler will take away the gold medal while Phogat will be leaving the Paris Olympics without a medal.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) updated the country about this shocking development and asked everyone to respect Vinesh's privacy. In a statement, the IOA said, \"It is with regret that the Indian contingent shares the news of Vinesh Phogat's disqualification from the Women's Wrestling 50 kg class. Despite the team's efforts through the night, she was a few grams over 50 kg this morning. No further comments will be made by the contingent at this time. The Indian team requests respect for Vinesh's privacy and will focus on the ongoing competitions.\"\n\nFollowing the development, PM Narendra Modi spoke to IOA President PT Usha and asked her to file a strong protest regarding her disqualification and find all options to help Vinesh's case.\n\nHowever, according to the rules of the United World Wrestling (UWW), \"If an athlete does not attend or fails the weigh-in, he/she will be eliminated from the competition and ranked last without rank.\"\n\nAccording to media reports, Vinesh Phogat and the Indian contingent were aware of it and had made all the possible efforts to meet the weight criteria before the weigh-in for her gold medal bout. But Phogat, who was within the weight limit for her Tuesday's bouts, failed to remain within the weight limit of her category on both days of the competition. Notably, all the bouts in her weight category were to be completed in two days. As per reports, she was around 2 Kgs above the weight limit on Tuesday night.\n\nConsequently, Vinesh and the Indian contingent made several efforts to bring her weight down like strenuous exercising and she reportedly didn't sleep throughout the night. This also included taking some extreme measures like cutting her hair, trimming her clothes, even trying to draw out blood. She attempted to lose weight through sweats by sitting in the sauna throughout the night.\n\nHowever, despite all the strenuous and best efforts by Phogat, her coaches and Indian support staff, she could not bring her weight to the allowed limit. While the weight did come down by around 2 kg, it was still around 100 grams above the limit.\n\nFurthermore, the Indian contingent had requested the officials to give some additional time in which she could have met the weight criteria but the officials denied India's request.\n\nAccording to media reports, minutes after the officials disqualified her, she fainted due to dehydration and had to be hospitalised. Currently, she is in the polyclinic of the Olympic Village and her health parameters are stable and is resting.\n\nIt is, however, pertinent to note that Phogat previously used to compete in the 53 kg weight category. But during the time she was off the mat for more than one-and-a-half years due to injuries and the protests against the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, Antim Panghal secured an Olympic quota for India in the 53kg category.\n\nShe then decided to switch to the lighter weight - 50 kg category - to ensure her place in the Olympics. But ever since then, she has been struggling to maintain her weight below the allowed limit for several months now. Her normal weight is 56 kg, and while she manages to bring it below 53 kg, reducing it by further 3 kg is a big challenge.\n\nIncidentally, she faced similar issues during the Olympic qualifiers in the 50 kg weight division. Strikingly, dramatic scenes had unfolded during the wrestling trials after she delayed the selection trials in the women's 50 kg and 53 kg categories. She didn't let the trials to start and demanded that the ad-hoc committee of the IOC should give a written assurance that the final trials in the 53kg weight class will be held before the Olympics.\n\nApart from demanding written assurance from the authorities, she didn't let the competition start as she also sought permission to compete in both 50kg and 53kg trials which is not permitted under the UWW rules. However, other wrestlers who were slated to compete in the 50 kg category protested and complained to the officials regarding the delay.\n\nIncidentally, she had turned up at the SAI centre to compete in the 50 kg trials but decided to participate in two weight categories at the Olympic trials, which led to controversies as Article 7 of (UWW) clearly states that a contestant can be allowed to take part only in one weight category on a single day.\n\nIt rules, \"Each contestant deemed to be taking part of his/her own free will, and responsible for himself/herself, shall be allowed to compete in only one weight category: the one corresponding to his weight at the time of the official weigh-in.\"\n\nConspicuously, the development unfolded even though the IOA ad-hoc panel had already announced that a final trial would be held for India's representative in the 53 kg category at the Olympics. The best four wrestlers in the 53kg weight category were bound to compete in trials near the Games and the winner would then have competed with Antim Panghal. The winner of that bout was slated to represent India.\n\nBack then, a coach present during the trials had said, \"Vinesh wants an assurance from the government. Probably she fears that if WFI gets back the control, the federation may change the selection policy. But how can the government give assurance on this? The government can't interfere in selection matters.\"\n\nNonetheless, when the ad-hoc committee for wrestling acceded to her demand, Vinesh defeated Shivani 11-6 in the 50 kg weight category and secured a place in the Paris Olympics Qualification tournament in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. However, she lost the 53kg bout to Anju by technical superiority 0-10.\n\nWhile after the bizarre delay and dramatic selection trials, she secured a place for herself in the 50 kg qualification tournament for the Olympics, Phogat had admitted earlier this year that it would be tough for her to maintain her weight as she has very high muscle mass. She noted that because she has high muscle mass, she gains weight easily. Additionally, as per reports, her usual weight is around 56 kg.\n\nAfter winning the 50kg quota for India, she had said, \"I will have to manage my weight a lot better. I have brought myself down to 50kg after so long so I will try and maintain this as much as I can. It's not easy for me not to put on weight because my muscle mass is very high.\"\n\nShe further added, \"Because of that, I gain weight easily. It doesn't matter how fit I am, I still gain weight because I have a lot of muscle mass. I just want to control my weight. I have four months left, and every day is very important.\"\n\nLast year, in August, she underwent a ligament tear surgery and during that time, her weight reportedly reached 59 kgs. However, for the Olympic quota of 50 kgs, she reduced her food and water intake considerably even after the doctors had advised her against it as sudden weight loss could lead to weakness and injuries. But she competed in the 50 kg category and had a spectacular outing at the Olympics till Tuesday night.\n\nDuring this Olympic stint, she had reached the finals in this weight division, defeating four time world champion and reigning Olympic Gold medalist but on the last day of the event, she failed to bring her weight down below the allowed limit for one final time, ending up in her disqualification and a major setback for India.\n\nTalking to BBC Hindi yesterday, her fellow wrestler Bajrang Punia had talked about the challenges Phogat is facing in maintaining weight. He said that losing weight for women is more difficult compared to men because men sweat easily. He said that she is taking limited food and water for the last few months in an attempt to keep her weight below 50kg.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpIndia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paurush_gupta@opindia.com", "name": "Paurush Gupta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_at_the_2022_Commonwealth_Games_\u2013_Women's_freestyle_53_kg", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling at the 2022 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Women's freestyle 53 kg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_at_the_2019_European_Games_\u2013_Women's_freestyle_50_kg", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling at the 2019 European Games \u2013 Women's freestyle 50 kg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Olympic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian Olympic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_World_Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United World Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Hildebrandt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Hildebrandt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_Federation_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling Federation of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_men's_national_field_hockey_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India men's national field hockey team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._T._Usha", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "P.

Phogat was set to compete against the United States' Sarah Ann Hildebrandt for the gold medal.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Indian Olympic contingent, Phogat exceeded the 50 kg weight limit and was disqualified. Phogat had secured her place in the gold medal match by defeating Cuba's Yusneylis Guzman Lopez 5-0 in the semi-finals on Tuesday night.\n\nIf you are still confused about what happened with Vinesh Phogat and why she was disqualified, here is all about the rules of wrestling about weight, point system and other details.\n\nThere are 18 weight classes in total, with six each for Greco-Roman, men's freestyle, and women's freestyle wrestling. The weight classes are:\n\nMen's Freestyle: 57kg, 65kg, 74kg, 86kg, 97kg, 125kg\n\nWomen's Freestyle: 50kg, 53kg, 57kg, 62kg, 68kg, 76kg\n\nGreco-Roman: 60kg, 67kg, 77kg, 87kg, 97kg, 130kg\n\nWrestlers are weighed before the match and on both the days of competition. The wrestlers are required to stay within their weight category on both days of the competition to stay qualified for the event.\n\nVinesh Phogat successfully made weight for Tuesday's bouts but needed to remain within her weight category for both competition days. Sources indicate she was about 2 kilos over the limit on Tuesday night. Despite jogging, skipping, and cycling through the night, she was unable to shed the final 100 grams.\n\nThe Indian delegation requested more time for Phogat to meet the weight criteria, but their request was denied. Phogat, who typically competes in the 53 kg category, has faced similar challenges before, narrowly making the cut during the Olympic qualifiers.\n\nIn Greco-Roman wrestling, athletes cannot use their legs to attack or defend, and no holds are allowed below the waist. Freestyle wrestling permits holds, trips, and throws using the entire body. In Greco-Roman matches, wrestlers resume on the ground if deemed passive, while this occurs less frequently in freestyle. A 10-point lead in freestyle or an 8-point lead in Greco-Roman results in a technical superiority win.\n\nWrestling matches, both freestyle and Greco-Roman, consist of two three-minute periods with a 30-second break in between.\n\nA wrestler can win by pinning their opponent's shoulder blades to the mat, achieving a technical superiority, or accumulating more points than their opponent. Disqualification can also occur if a wrestler receives three cautions.\n\nPoints are awarded in increments of 1, 2, 4, and 5. Points can be scored through various actions such as forcing an opponent out of bounds, performing certain holds, or if an opponent commits fouls. A pin, or fall, is the highest-scoring move, while technical moves and opponent errors also contribute to the score.\n\nRepechage allows wrestlers who lose to eventual finalists a chance to compete for a bronze medal. If a wrestler defeats another who reaches the final, the defeated wrestlers enter repechage rounds to fight for third place.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_at_the_2019_European_Games_\u2013_Women's_freestyle_50_kg", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling at the 2019 European Games \u2013 Women's freestyle 50 kg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Roman_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greco-Roman wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Weight class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amateur wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_(amateur_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pin (amateur wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repechage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Repechage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games/Thumb_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games/Thumb Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112340196,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-1760425,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795434", "eventUri": "eng-9795434", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Mirabai Chanu finished fourth in the women's 49 kg weightlifting final here on Wednesday.\n\nThe 2020 Tokyo silver medallist finished with a score of 199 kg after the conclusion of the two phases of the competition. Her personal best is 205 kg which she lifted in the 2020 Asian Championship.\n\nDespite being in the bronze medal spot after her second last attempt, Chanu was pipped to the post by Thailand's Surodchana Khambao as the Indian failed to lift her final attempt of 114 kg in the catch and jerk phase, which is a disappointment considering she once held the world record for clean and jerk (119kg).\n\nRomania's Mihaela Cambei was leading with a score of 205 but China's Zhihui Hou broke the Olympic record to win the gold medal with a score of 107 in her final attempt of the second phase and ended the night with 206 points.\n\nIn the snatch phase, Chanu started with a statement, matching Dominican Republic's Beatriz Piron with the highest lift of the night as she lifted 85 kg weight without difficulty.

She won the Asian Games gold medal in the 50 kg weight class but just over a year later, won a bronze in the 53 kg category at the 2019 World Championships. The reason for the switch was the weight cut she was struggling with.\n\nTo avoid that struggle, Phogat chose to become a 53 kg wrestler after the Asian Games, and at one point after the Tokyo Games, was also wrestling in the 55 kg category. She won a bronze at the 2022 World Championships in 53 kg but after spearheading the protests against ex-WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, her return was curtailed by a knee ligament injury.\n\nDuring that time, Antim Panghal won a bronze at the 2023 World Championships, thus getting India a Paris Olympics quota in the 53 kg category. Former Wrestling Federation of India rules gave the quota winner the go-ahead for the Olympics, and so Phogat was in a fix, because the ad-hoc committee was running wrestling in India at the time and they had promised her that there would be a trial for the 53 kg category. But that decision might have been taken away from their hands as the WFI was set to return to power after conducting their election and selecting Sanjay Singh as its new president.\n\nAnd thus when March 12 came, Phogat believed that a WFI return wouldn't necessarily guarantee her a shot at the Olympics in the 53 kg category. Which meant she either had to switch to the 50 kg category, or the 57 kg. She chose 50 - a weight class she had last been part of in 2018.\n\n\"I had no clarity about the 53kg quota situation, whether there would be trials or not. Usually, the quota is won by the country but they hadn't held trials before. They (ad hoc committee) said that it wouldn't be the case this time. I had no option but to do this because I have to participate in the Olympics,\" the 29-year-old had said then, confirming that the decision to take part in the 50 kg category was to ensure that her Paris dreams remained in her own hands.\n\nPhogat's walk-around weight is usually around 55-56 kgs. Cutting down to 50 on consecutive days takes its toll. That's why United World Wrestling president Nenad Lalovic said that it wasn't a matter of one kilo, rather the large amount she had to cut in the first place to reach that figure of '100 grams' that caused the issue.\n\nAmerican wrestling legend Jordan Burroughs proposed some immediate rule changes on social media to avoid a repeat of the Phogat-like situation. \"1.) 1kg second Day Weight Allowance, 2.) Weigh-ins pushed from 8:30am to 10:30am, 3.) Forfeit will occur in future finals if the opposing finalist misses weight, 4.) After a semifinal victory, both finalists' medals are secured even if weight is missed on Day 2. Gold can only be won by a wrestler who makes weight on the second day, 5.) Give Vinesh the Silver medal.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shashank_nair@indianexpress.com", "name": "Shashank Nair", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_at_the_2022_Commonwealth_Games_\u2013_Women's_freestyle_53_kg", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling at the 2022 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Women's freestyle 53 kg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_Federation_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling Federation of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asian Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_at_the_2014_Asian_Games_\u2013_Women's_freestyle_48_kg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling at the 2014 Asian Games \u2013 Women's freestyle 48 kg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_at_the_2019_European_Games_\u2013_Women's_freestyle_50_kg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling at the 2019 European Games \u2013 Women's freestyle 50 kg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2019 World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brij_Bhushan_Sharan_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weight class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antim_Panghal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antim Panghal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIS_Freestyle_Ski_and_Snowboarding_World_Championships_2023", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIS Freestyle Ski and Snowboarding World Championships 2023"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2022 World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_World_Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United World Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Burroughs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Burroughs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Weight_Loss", "label": "dmoz/Health/Weight Loss", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Weight_Loss", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Weight Loss", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/08/Vinesh-Phogat-weight-category.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795434", "eventUri": "eng-9795434", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-12", "textStart": 1692, "textEnd": 1700}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

On Wednesday, her weight was found to be approximately 100 grams higher than the allowed limit. She was disqualified from the Olympic women's wrestling competition.\n\nThe Indian Olympic Association confirmed Vinesh's disqualification, which means she will be unable to compete in Wednesday night's 50kg women's wrestling final and will not receive any medals. The most difficult aspect is that no appeal can be made against this decision.\n\nVinesh competed in the 50kg category for the first time, having previously competed in the 53kg weight category. According to Sportstar, a member of her camp revealed the distressing details of what happened over the past two days. They said, \"Vinesh weighed 49.9kg yesterday morning, which is significantly below her normal weight range of around 57kg. She made a huge effort to keep her weight down to 50kg. However, maintaining that weight on the second day was almost impossible. The moment she had even a small meal, her weight would jump to at least 53kg. She needed to do this to have the strength to fight three bouts. She weighed 52.7kg after the semifinals last night. Since then, she did not consume any water or food, and she also did not sleep. The team ran a sauna all night and managed to get her weight down to 50.1kg by morning. However, there was no time left to cut down the excess weight.\"\n\nThe Indian Olympic Association (IOA) said on Monday, \"It is extremely regrettable that Vinesh Phogat has been disqualified from the 50kg category of women's wrestling due to excess weight. Despite all efforts, her weight was found to be a few grams over the 50kg limit during the morning weigh-in.\"", "source": {"uri": "insidesport.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inside Sport India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "keyur_jain@insidesport.in", "name": "Keyur Jain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amateur wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportstar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sportstar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Olympic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Olympic Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://d16f573ilcot6q.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Vinesh-Phogat-1-3.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795434", "eventUri": "eng-9795434", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

The source, who wished to remain anonymous, stated that Phogat had resorted to starvation and dehydration in her efforts to shed pounds.The team member also mentioned that her support crew implemented drastic measures like cutting her hair and drawing her blood to help her lose weight.While the nation is yet to recover from the tragic disqualification of ace wrestler Vinesh Phogat from the women's 50 kg wrestling competition for being 100 gms overweight than the cut-off, new chilling details of the wrestler's quest to lose even more weight have emerged.\n\nA member of Phogat's team revealed the drastic measures the athlete took to lose weight to sports publication Sportstar. The anonymous source claimed that Phogat had starved herself and had also gone without water in a bid to lose weight.\n\nThe member also revealed that her team had also adopted insane measures such as cutting off her hair, drawing her blood, and helping her lose weight.\n\n\"After the semifinals last night, her weight was 52.7kg. She didn't sleep even a minute, didn't drink a sip of water, and didn't have a morsel of food. She spent the entire night running and using the sauna. She made it to 50.1kg but didn't have time to cut the last 100 grams. There was no leeway and no extra time to make weight.\"\n\nThe Haryana wrestler, who moved from the 53 kg category to the 50 kg category, had been struggling to maintain the weight throughout her Olympic campaign.\n\nA member of her team told Sportstar, \"Her normal weight is 57 kg, and she did everything to drop down to 50 kg. She was 49.9 kg yesterday (Tuesday) morning, but as soon as she had even a small meal, her weight bounced back to at least 53 kg. She needed to reach this weight to have the strength to compete in three bouts.\" These extreme measures left Vinesh weak, fragile, and dehydrated. She was taken to a medical center inside the Olympic village after feeling dizzy and briefly losing consciousness.\n\nCutting weight is a grueling process that wrestlers endure when their natural body weight is higher than their competition division.

During the mandatory weigh-in on Wednesday morning, Phogat, who was scheduled to fight in the gold medal bout in the 50kg category, was 100g overweight.\n\nYeah, we read about it. But 100g seems to be a bit harsh, right?\n\nWell, it depends on which way you look at it. But the rules are the rules.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, all combat sports (taekwondo, boxing, wrestling, judo, and karate, to name a few) are divided based on weight class. This is to ensure that athletes are evenly matched up.\n\nAnd weight-cutting is a common practice in combat sports where athletes rapidly lose weight before a weigh-in to qualify for a lower-weight class. This process often involves dehydration techniques, fasting or reducing food and water intake, and intense exercise to shed water weight.\n\nAlthough it can provide a competitive advantage, weight-cutting poses significant health risks, including dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and decreased performance.\n\nFor example, in women's wrestling, the weight classes are categorised as 50 kg, 53 kg, 57 kg, 62 kg, 68 kg, and 76 kg.\n\nAnd Phogat was competing in the 50 kg category, meaning she could not exceed 50 kg at the time of her weigh-in. It doesn't matter if her weight was 50.1 or 60.1, she will be disqualified for not making the weight.\n\nNotably, United World Wrestling (UWW), the world governing body for amateur wrestling, allows a 2kg tolerance for other tournaments, but that doesn't apply at the Olympics.\n\nCompetitions like the World Cup and various international tournaments (excluding UWW Ranking Events) allow a 2kg weight tolerance, according to UWW's regulations.\n\nWhy was she allowed to fight on the first day then?\n\nWrestling events are spread over two days. So, there are two weigh-ins, one on each day. Phogat was below the threshold on Tuesday morning, on the first day of her events. But United World Wrestling (UWW) rules state that all wrestlers involved in the second day of action will have to have a second weigh-in on day two. These rules were well known beforehand.\n\nWhy strip her of silver, then? It's not like she was outside 50kg on Tuesday?\n\nUWW rules are clear. A wrestler will have to be within the threshold during both weigh-ins. Otherwise, they will be disqualified and finish last.\n\nWhat happened at her second weigh-in on Wednesday morning?\n\nHere's a rough sequence of events after her last bout on Tuesday.\n\nAfter taking on board some fluids and food, Vinesh had put on close to 2.7kg (it's okay to be above your weight after the weigh-in finishes). And throughout the night, Phogat and the support staff (coach, the contingent's Chief Medical Officer, and others) tried various ways to bring down her body weight.\n\nShe skipped, ran, did cycling, and also used the athletes village's gym to cut weight (it's a routine wrestlers are fairly familiar with), apart from using the sauna as well as sparring. At roughly 5.30 AM, with about two hours to go for her weigh-in, she was about 500g above the threshold.\n\nAs she hadn't consumed any water, her body had stopped sweating. After this, the contingent became increasingly desperate, and they even resorted to cutting her hair. At the weigh-in, a narrow 15-minute window, she was found to be 100g over (in that window, she could have given weight multiple times as there is no limit).", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "swaroop_swaminathan@newindianexpress.com", "name": "Swaroop Swaminathan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_World_Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United World Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Weight class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amateur wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taekwondo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte_imbalance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrolyte imbalance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cycle sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauna", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sauna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perspiration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Olympic_Lifting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Olympic Lifting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/newindianexpress%2F2024-08-07%2Fvfm0tamp%2FPTI08_06_2024_000542B.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795434", "eventUri": "eng-9795434", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Payload can be calculated by subtracting a vehicle's kerb weight from its gross vehicle mass (GVM), so we were able to work out figures for the HiAce using that method.\n\nAll vans in the segment currently on sale in Australia have been included, which means there's a variety of powertrains and drivetrains - including electric.\n\nWe've only listed the individual variant of each van with the highest payload rating below, but the full lineup of each model has been detailed throughout the article.\n\nClick on a car's name above to jump directly to its information on the page, or continue scrolling for the full list.\n\nLeading the way is the Peugeot Expert, which in its cheapest variant has a payload of 1433kg.\n\nThat variant is the short-wheelbase City manual, which costs $43,397 before on-roads. A limitation is the fact it has the lowest braked towing capacity of the Expert lineup at 1500kg, while it's also the lightest at 1622kg.\n\nThe highest towing capacity is offered with the short-wheelbase Pro and Premium models, which are both rated at 2165kg. These models sacrifice payload with a shared quoted figure of 1036kg, and they cost $47,849 and $51,039 before on-roads respectively.\n\nThere are also three long-wheelbase versions with payloads of between 1350kg and 1400kg, which is still comparatively high against most of the other vans on this list.\n\nLDV's V80 is the final van on this list to surpass a 1400kg payload, with its long-wheelbase Mid Roof automated-manual variant boasting 1419kg.\n\nThat variant will set you back $44,200 drive-away, while the most expensive version is the long-wheelbase High Roof with a reduced payload. It costs an increased $46,306 drive-away and is the heaviest V80 available at 2111kg.\n\nThe two short-wheelbase options share a 1204kg payload, while the whole range offers a braked towing capacity of 1200kg. For $36,831 drive-away, the base manual variant is the cheapest van here.\n\nBoth short-wheelbase V80s slip under two tonnes. The non-manual options are fitted with an automated-manual transmission - a unique addition both on this list, and the new car market.\n\nThe first electric van on this list is the LDV eDeliver 7, which offers a payload of 1350kg in its cheapest variant.\n\nLDV's eDeliver 7 range starts at $67,358 drive-away for the short-wheelbase Low Roof variant, and extends to $74,674 drive-away for the long-wheelbase High Roof. That places it among the more expensive vans on this list.\n\nAt a maximum of nearly 2.5 tonnes it's also the second-heaviest van here, though its most expensive version has a reduced payload of 1175kg.\n\nThe range is offered with either 77kWh or 88kWh batteries, while LDV quotes a braked towing capacity of 1500kg for all variants.\n\nThe Renault Trafic is sold here in eight variants, and it's the cheapest long-wheelbase version that has the highest payload at 1279kg.\n\nThat variant is the long-wheelbase Pro manual, which is priced at $51,000 before on-roads. It matches the short-wheelbase manual for braked towing capacity of 2500kg, though it weighs slightly more and is $2000 more expensive.\n\nAll standard van variants of the Trafic vary in payload by less than 50kg, but it's the two crew van versions that lag behind. They're priced at the top of the range and cost $58,000 and $63,000 before on-roads, with payloads of either 1053kg or 1079kg.\n\nThey're also the only Trafic vans to weigh more than 1800kg, though the range-topping long-wheelbase Crew Lifestyle is among the lowest for braked towing capacity at 1630kg.\n\nThe Ford Transit Custom rounds out the top five on this list, and its range-opening short-wheelbase Trend has a payload of 1255kg.\n\nThe Trend SWB is priced at $55,990 before on-roads, but for $1000 more you can go for the long-wheelbase Trend instead which has a reduced payload of 1014kg and weighs slightly more.\n\nSport variants start at $59,990 before on-road costs, and the SWB version matches the Trend LWB for payload. Opting for the double cab version slashes payload to 743kg, and it has a kerb weight that is around 100kg heavier.\n\nAll Transit Custom variants have a maximum braked towing capacity of 2500kg, and an automatic transmission is standard across the range.\n\nVolkswagen offers the most van variants of any manufacturer on this list, with 15 available for its Transporter. Of that range, the short-wheelbase TDI340 fitted with a six-speed manual has the highest payload at 1220kg.\n\nIt's priced at $45,790 before on-road costs, and matches the rest of the Transporter range with a braked towing capacity of 2500kg.\n\nThe cheapest Transporter costs $42,790 before on-roads, though its payload is reduced to 1051kg. It's also the lightest of the range at 1749kg, and has a five-speed manual with front-wheel drive.\n\nOf the 4Motion offerings it's the short-wheelbase TDI340 with the highest payload at 1083kg, while the Crewvans are headed by another version the short-wheelbase TDI340 at 1042kg. The 4Motion version of the TDI340 Crewvan is the heaviest of the range, with a tare mass of 2074kg.\n\nToyota's ever-popular HiAce has a maximum payload of 1135kg, but only in its super long-wheelbase van variant.\n\nThat variant costs $59,446 before on-roads, and despite its increased size it's only 15kg heavier than the most expensive long-wheelbase HiAce.\n\nThe standard long-wheelbase range tops out at the Crew Van, which is priced at $53,886 before on-roads but has the range's lowest payload at 950kg.\n\nAll variants have a braked towing capacity of 1500kg, except the range-opening manual van which is rated at 1900kg. That version costs $48,886 before on-roads and is the second-heaviest long-wheelbase HiAce at 2190kg.\n\nThere are only three variants of the G10 available, and it's the petrol version with the highest payload at 1093kg.\n\nThat version is one of the two G10+ automatics, which costs $37,884 drive-away. It's the lightest of the range with a tare mass of 1915kg, but it also has the lowest braked towing capacity at exactly one tonne.\n\nThe manual G10+ is fitted with a diesel engine and costs $37,358 drive-away, though its payload is reduced to 1015kg. Like the other diesel G10, it has a braked towing capacity of 1500kg.\n\nYou can also purchase an automatic diesel G10+, which has a 1010kg payload and weighs 2010kg. It costs $39,463 before on-roads.\n\nHyundai's Staria Load is available in three configurations, with the five-seat crew van offering a payload of 1089kg.\n\nIt's priced at $50,640 before on-roads, around $4000 more expensive than the range-opening two-seat van. The cheaper variant has a payload of 1018kg, and like the other two-seat version it weighs 1948kg.\n\nThe other two-seater is the Premium grade, which has a payload of 1072kg. It costs $51,740 before on-roads, and like the rest of the range has a braked towing capacity of 2500kg.\n\nThe five-seat crew van tips the scales at more than two tonnes, and no manual options are available across the Staria Load range.\n\nThe Vito is the most expensive internal-combustion engined van on this list, and its cheapest variant has a payload of 1083kg.\n\nThat variant is the medium-wheelbase 116 CDI, which is the lightest of the Vito range at 1917kg and kicks off at $64,480 before on-roads. Like all diesel Vito models, it has a braked towing capacity of 2500kg.\n\nIt's only the non-Crew Cab versions of the Vito with a payload above one tonne. Crew Cab variants, meanwhile, all have a payload of 850kg or less, with the cheapest version priced at $67,002 before on-roads.\n\nThe range reaches as high as $81,399 before on-roads for the long-wheelbase 119CDI Crew Cab, which has a payload of 807kg. It's also the heaviest diesel Vito with a tare mass of 2169kg.\n\nThe first of two electric Peugeot vans on this list is the E-Expert, which ranks higher with a payload of 1001kg.\n\nIt's only available in one Pro Long variant, which costs $79,990 before on-roads. It has a braked towing capacity of exactly one tonne, and a kerb weight of 2043kg.\n\nThe E-Expert is significantly more expensive than its internal combustion counterpart, while also being heavier and offering a reduced payload capacity.\n\nIt's also the first electric van since the eDeliver 7 on this list, offering a payload that's around 400kg less.\n\nPeugeot's Partner is much cheaper than the E-Expert, while only being slightly down on payload at 998kg.\n\nOf the four-van range it's the two long-wheelbase versions with a 998kg payload, which are the Pro and Premium. They're priced at $42,990 and $45,990 before on-roads respectively.\n\nThey both have a braked towing capacity of 950kg, while weighing in at 1385kg. The other two options are the Pro and Premium short-wheelbase vans, which also share specifications.\n\nThe whole Partner range opens with the Pro at $39,990 before on-roads, with the Premium priced at $42,990 before on-roads. They both offer an 896kg payload, 900kg braked towing capacity, and a tare mass of 1283kg.\n\nThe eVito is the most expensive van on this list and has a payload of 882kg.\n\nAt $91,051 before on-roads, the medium-wheelbase eVito 112 is nearly $10,000 more expensive than the next priciest van.\n\nMercedes-Benz doesn't quote a braked towing capacity for the sole eVito available, though it has the heaviest quoted tare mass of any van on this list at almost three tonnes.\n\nFor context, the next-heaviest van here is the LDV eDeliver 7, which is also electric and weighs 2475kg.\n\nThe E-Partner makes it two electric vans in a row, and its sole variant has a payload of 835kg.\n\nThat variant is long-wheelbase Pro, which is priced at $59,990 before on-roads. It has the lowest braked towing capacity of any van here at just 750kg, though it remains relatively light at 1632kg.\n\nIt also doesn't trail too far behind its internal combustion counterpart, which has a minimum payload of 896kg and is less than 300kg lighter.\n\nThe E-Partner is also cheaper than many internal combustion vans on this list, while being $15,000 more expensive than the priciest standard Partner.\n\nMuch like the Transporter, Volkswagen's Caddy has a plethora of variants and offers a maximum payload of 746kg.\n\nYou'll achieve that figure in the manual TSI220 Maxi, which is priced at $42,990 before on-roads - $2000 more than the range-opening model. It has the lowest braked towing capacity of the Caddy range, matching two other variants with a rating of 1400kg.\n\nThe cheapest automatic Caddy is the short-wheelbase TSI220, which has a payload of 717kg. It matches most other Caddy models with a braked towing capacity of 1500kg, and costs $43,990 before on-roads.\n\nVolkswagen's Caddy range extends to the long-wheelbase TDI320 auto, priced at $52,090 before on-roads. It has the second-highest payload of the closely-matched Caddy range at 748kg, but is the heaviest at 1700kg.\n\nBUY: Get in touch with a dealer about a Volkswagen CaddyMORE: Everything Volkswagen Caddy\n\nTwo Kangoo vans close out this list, and the better of the two is the internal-combustion version with a payload of 756kg.\n\nIt's the most expensive version with that payload figure, which is the long-wheelbase automatic for $43,990 before on-roads. That variant is also the heaviest of the range at 1516kg.\n\nAt the bottom of the lineup is the short-wheelbase manual, which has a payload of just 548kg. It weighs 1394kg, and costs $38,990 before on-roads.\n\nIn the middle of the road is the short-wheelbase automatic, which costs $41,990 before on-roads, has a payload of 591kg, and weighs 1419kg. All three vans have a braked towing capacity of 1500kg.\n\nLast on the list is the Kangoo's electric sibling, which has a maximum payload of 668kg.\n\nThe long-wheelbase version is the one with that payload figure, which costs $63,990 before on-roads and weighs 1822kg.\n\nMeanwhile, the cheaper short-wheelbase variant offers the smallest payload of the lot at 523kg, and costs $61,990 before on-roads. It weighs 1707kg, and shares a braked towing capacity of 1500kg with all its other siblings.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDV_Group", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LDV Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_HiAce", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toyota HiAce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_Trafic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renault Trafic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Payload"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manual transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Van"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tare_weight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tare weight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diesel engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Transit_Custom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ford Transit Custom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citro\u00ebn_Jumpy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citro\u00ebn Jumpy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4motion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4motion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automatic transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Caddy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen Caddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrol_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petrol engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Front-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pickup truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wheelbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peugeot", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peugeot"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks,_Vans,_and_Sport_Utility", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks, Vans, and Sport Utility", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Specialized_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Specialized Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-15633968/259563b38cdc46e527dd11c8a68655371e85239b-16x9-x0y54w1024h576.jpg?imwidth=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795434", "eventUri": "eng-9795434", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

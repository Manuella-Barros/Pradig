{"id": 243347248, "title": "Connelly seeks to put past mistake behind after being selected 19th in NHL draft by Golden Knights", "text": "LAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 It meant little to Trevor Connelly what spot he was selected in the NHL draft \u2014 first round or beyond \u2014 due to the regrettable decision he made in the past. What ultimately mattered to the 18-year-old is the work he put in through volunteer work and diversity training to put him on a path forward in hockey after being selected 19th overall by the draft host Vegas Golden Knights on Friday night. \u201cI think I could go higher, if maybe some of the stuff didn\u2019t happened. But, honestly, it\u2019s the happiest that I could\u2019ve been where I got selected,\u201d said Connelly, who\u2019s draft stock dropped in the two years since he posted an image Snapchat \u2014 before hastily removing it \u2014 showing a friend posing in front of a collection of building blocks formed in the shape of a swastika. He was also accused of making a racial slur during a game in 2021, though a suspension was lifted when an investigation was unable to corroborate what happened. Connelly has apologized for posting the picture, and disputed making the racial slur. \u201cI\u2019ve made mistakes as a kid and I\u2019m such a different person now,\u201d said Connelly, who is from Tustin, California, and committed to attending Providence this year. \u201cI think what I\u2019ve been put through these past couple of years are for a reason. I think that it\u2019s all going to work out for the best for me and I\u2019ll do anything for the organization, anything for the people and I\u2019m super excited to get started.\u201d GM Kelly McCrimmon said Vegas officials conducted what he called a \u201cvery extensive\u201d background check on the player, while also meeting with Connelly at the scouting combine in Buffalo, New York, and then again this week. \u201cI think (he showed) some growth and some recognition of some areas where he had made mistakes and recognized that,\u201d McCrimmon said. \u201cHe was very candid, transparent, didn\u2019t duck any of the questions that we asked of him.\u201d Not in question are the 6-foot, 156-pound forward\u2019s abilities. Connelly is coming off a season with the Tri-City Storm in which he finished second in the USHL with 78 points (31 goals, 47 assists) in 52 games. He has also represented the U.S., most recently winning a silver medal at the 2024 Under-18 world championships. Cap Unfriendly Washington Capitals general manager Brian MacLellan uses CapFriendly all the time to look up salary information and other data around the NHL. Soon, he and members of the organization will be the only ones with access after the Capitals bought the website this month. Suffice it to say, his colleagues are not thrilled at having that tool taken away from them. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s happy,\u201d MacLellan said on a video call with reporters Thursday. \u201cThe whole industry is not very happy about it.\u201d CapFriendly is still available through the draft and start of free agency next week before the public side of it goes dark sometime in July. \u201cOur biggest fear was it was going to go away and we weren\u2019t going to be able to use it,\u201d said MacLellan, who added the front office looked into making its own site before realizing it was too expensive and time-consuming. \u201cWe can build off it. We have the people that created it, so we can build and we can hopefully become more efficient as an organization on salary cap decisions, CBA decisions and then use it on our analytics side, too: create a format that works for us that way.\u201d Firsts from Norway Michael Brandsegg-Nygard, Detroit\u2019s choice at No. 15, made history as the first player from Norway drafted in the first round. Brandsegg-Nygard played in the Swedish Hockey League last season, and his heard his name called at the draft by a Hall of Famer from that Scandanavian nation, Nicklas Lidstrom. Stian Stolberg became the second player from Norway taken in the first round not long after, when Anaheim traded up to select him at No. 23. Goaltending coach Sudarshan \u201cSudsy\u201d Maharaj, who recently beat cancer, announced the Ducks\u2019 selection. Crosby extension? Sidney Crosby is a little over a year from potentially becoming a free agent. But the three-time Stanley Cup-winning Pittsburgh Penguins captain and his camp have discussed an extension with general manager Kyle Dubas, which could not actually be signed until Monday, anyway. \u201cWe\u2019re talking,\u201d Crosby said Friday on a video call with reporters to discuss the upcoming 4 Nations Face-Off. \u201cThere\u2019s been a little but of talk, I think with the draft and free agency and stuff like that. It\u2019s something that I\u2019ll keep between Kyle and I, but we\u2019ve had some conversations and I\u2019ll just kind of leave it at that. ... We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d The Penguins, with Dubas in charge, remain in win-now mode. Center Evgeni Malkin is signed through 2026 and defenseman Kris Letang through 28. Crosby turns 37 before next season. ___ AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno and AP freelance writer W.G.

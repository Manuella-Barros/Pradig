Netflix debuted the first trailer for A Family Affair on May 29. The film stars Joey King as Zara, a young woman working as an assistant for movie star Chris Cole (Efron, 36), who becomes romantically entangled with Zara\u2019s mother (Kidman, 56). Zara quits working for Chris because of his demanding nature, narcissistic qualities and womanizing behavior, which only adds to her shock and disgust when she finds out her widowed mother is having an affair with her former boss. The rom-com\u2019s trailer puts the hilarious awkwardness of this unusual circumstance on full display, with one notable scene from the trailer showing Zara walking in on an intimate moment between Kidman and Efron's characters. Zara screams at the sight of her mother and her boss kissing \u2014 and then, as she tries to make her escape, she accidentally slams into the doorframe.

PEOPLE shared exclusive first-look photos from A Family Affair back in April, with Efron calling the upcoming flick \"funny, romantic and entertaining.\" The Iron Claw actor also told PEOPLE he was nervous as an actor in his 20s working with Kidman, and experienced similar jitters on the set of A Family Affair. \"I was still a bit apprehensive but reuniting with Nicole is always so great and as talented as she as an actress, she is equally kind, caring and wonderful to spend time with,\" Efron said, promising that their characters' chemistry in the film is \"seamless, natural and fun.\" The project marks the second romantic affair between characters of Kidman and Efron, with their 2012 movie The Paperboy featuring the pair as lovers, as well. A Family Affair also stars Liza Koshy and Kathy Bates, from a screenplay by Carrie Solomon. Director Richard LaGravenese (P.S. I Love You) told PEOPLE in April that the spark between Efron and Kidman in A Family Affair was \"an answered prayer \u2014 something you hope for but can't plan.\" \"The interplay between Joey and Zac's characters as an assistant and star is so much fun,\" added LaGravenese, 64. \"I also love the mother-daughter role reversal where the daughter becomes the disapproving, judgmental, suspicious parent and the mother is sneaking around her back having a love affair that makes her feel like she\u2019s come back to life.\" King, 24, told PEOPLE that being able to call Kidman \u2014 who was recently honored with the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award \u2014 her onscreen mom is \"iconic.\" \"It\u2019s truly one of those moments where you have to remind yourself that it\u2019s actually your life and you\u2019re getting to work with this person, and somehow they\u2019re even more wonderful than you could imagine,\" she explained.

Anish Kumar reports\n\nPawan Singh, a renowned Bhojpuri singer and a rebel from the Bharatiya Janata Party, could spoil the prospects of the National Democratic Alliance candidate Upendra Kushwaha in Karakat in Bihar's Rohtas district. Earlier, Singh had been offered a ticket by the BJP to contest from West Bengal's Asansol seat but he declined the offer following backlash from the ruling Trinamool Congress in the state over his song on Bengali women, which the latter claimed to be 'vulgar'.\n\nElection Yatra, Bihar Chapter: The fight for Samastipur without a Paswan this time\n\nSingh ventured into the electoral fray stating that he had promised his mother that he would contest an election. Prior to plunging into the fray, it was being believed that the fight in Karakat would be direct between NDA's Kushwaha and INDI alliance's Raja Ram.\n\nLocal political experts believe that Singh would dent the prospects of Upendra Kushwaha. However, there are also those who believe that he would cut into the vote share of both the blocs.\n\nPolitical analyst Sachin Singh from Nabinagar said that this time, maximum number of Rajput voters would not cast their vote in support of Upendra Kushwaha because the Kushwaha community had not voted in favour of Sushil Singh in Aurangabad. \"We have decided to vote for Pawan Singh.\n\nAs per the reports, the Kushwahas, which have been known for tactical voting, had voted for Abhay Kushwaha of RJD in Aurangabad. The development has irked the Rajput community and they wanted to take revenge in Karakat. Karakat and Aurangabad are adjoining Lok Sabha seats. Karakat has over two lakh members of the Rajput community.\n\nThe Karakat seat's population comprises of 3.5 lakh Kushwahas, 3 lakh Yadavs, 2 lakh Baniyas and 70,000 Brahmins among others.\n\nUpendra Mishra, a senior political analyst, said: \"At the end of the day, the fight will be between NDA and INDIA. Pawan Singh will make some dent but in both blocs. He has the support of young voters but the contest will be between Kushwahas only.\"\n\nUpendra Kushwaha represented Karakat in 2014-19 in Lok Sabha and in 2019 he changed his side to RJD-Congress combo. On being asked about the issues on which candidates are fighting in Karakat, Mishra said that the construction of Indrapuri Reservoir is a major political electoral issue. If constructed, the entire Shahabad and Magadh region would have a better irrigation system.\n\nThe establishment of Freight Bogie and Coupler manufacturing factories for high capacity, higher axle load wagons at Dalmianagar is another issue that the locals have been raising for years.\n\nIn 2010, Parliament was informed that a plant for manufacturing Freight Bogie and Coupler for high capacity, higher axle load wagons at Dalmianagar under East Central Railway was sanctioned in the year 2007- 08 at an anticipated cost of Rs 97 crore. The foundation stone was laid in 2008 and an allocation of Rs 1 crore had been made in the year 2007-08. It must be noted that the factory has to come up on a Public Private Participation (PPP) basis.\n\nMishra further said after Upendra Kushwaha raised this issue in Parliament it picked a little pace and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an election rally in 2015 announced to set up the plant.\n\nIn 2021, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had given Rs five crore for its construction purpose.\n\nNageshwar, a local leader said: \"We believe that Upendra Kushwaha ji will try to fulfil the long-standing demand of all citizens of Karakat.\"", "source": {"uri":

The Rohtas district administration sweated it out as they had to control a large crowd of thousands of people gathered there to catch a glimpse of the celebrity.\n\nOn March 2, the BJP had announced the names of 20 candidates in West Bengal that included the name of Mr. Singh. His candidature had triggered strong reactions and outrage in political circles over the content created by the singer and songs allegedly denigrating Bengali women.\n\nOn April 10, he had announced that he would contest from Karakat seat in Bihar and since then, Mr. Singh has continuously been campaigning in the area. Before filing the nomination, he visited the famous Pilot Baba Ashram to offer prayers.\n\nMr. Singh, hailing from Ara in Bhojpur district of Bihar, was expecting a Lok Sabha ticket from Ara itself. However, the constituency was retained by sitting BJP MP R.K. Singh.\n\nOn May 7, when Mr. Kushwaha went to attend the nomination of Mr. R K Singh in Ara, he was asked about Mr. Pawan Singh to which he had replied that the Bhojpuri star's popularity was limited only to social media and mobile phones and that nobody was talking about him at the ground level. Mr. Kushwaha had won the seat in 2014 and became Union Minister as part of the NDA.\n\nIn 2019, Karakat seat was won by Janata Dal (United) candidate Mahabali Singh who has been dropped this time and the seat has gone to Mr. Kushwaha.\n\nKarakat will vote in the seventh phase on June 1. The seat comprises six Assembly segments -- Nokha, Dehri-On-Sone, Karakat, Goh, Obra and Nabinagar -- with four constituencies falling under Rohtas district and two in Aurangabad district.\n\nBefore filing the nomination, BJP leader and Labour Resources Minister Santosh Kumar Singh had appealed the singer not to stand in the elections from Karakat seat.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri":

In the 2020 Assembly poll, the party won 12 of the 19 seats it contested. Its hopes are buoyed by the fact that it is part of the larger Opposition alliance, the Rashtriya Janata Dal-led mahagatbandhan.\n\nThe CPI (ML) is contesting three Lok Sabha seats -- Arrah, Nalanda and Karakat -- which go to the polls on June 1. Arrah is the only seat where the CPI (ML) is pitted against the BJP. In Nalanda, it is facing the JD(U) and in Karakat, its candidate will take on the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party chief Upendra Kushwaha.\n\nShifting Kushwaha votebank\n\nIf the Assembly election results were superimposed on the 2024 battle, the party would be best placed in the Karakat Lok Sabha constituency, as all the six Assembly segments that come under this seat are currently held by MLAs from the mahagatbandhan; five with the RJD, and one with the CPI (ML).\n\nIn Bihar, where the voters are divided along caste lines, the CPI (ML) is banking not so much on the Assembly performance of the mahagatbandhan, but on its assessment that the Kushwaha votebank -- which in the last few elections, both Assembly and general, leaned in favour of the BJP-led NDA -- is shifting, especially in Karakat. Here, the battle lines are drawn between farmer leader Raja Ram Kushwaha of the CPI(ML) and BJP ally, Mr. Upendra Kushwaha.\n\n\"With two Kushwaha leaders in the race, there was already a division in the Kushwaha vote bank, which plays a decisive role here. Mr. Raja Ram has an edge, since he has a better ground connection,\" a senior CPI(ML) leader said. The equation has been further muddled for Mr. Upendra Kushwaha with the entry of Bhojpuri singer Pawan Singh into the fray. A significant chunk of Rajput voters are expected to support Mr. Singh, further skewing the balance.\n\nMr. Raja Ram Kushwaha, though, wants to underplay the caste angle. \"This is a fight to reclaim democracy,\" he told The Hindu. \"Yes, caste is important, but this is a far larger battle. The State machinery has been captured by a few and it is a contest to repossess it.\"\n\nAnti-incumbency factor\n\nCPI (ML) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya insists that the party is evenly placed in each of the three seats.\n\nIn the Nalanda Lok Sabha seat, for example, there is an accumulative anti-incumbency factor playing out against both the sitting MP and the ruling JD(U). Since the 1996 general election, the seat has been continuously held by the JD(U)'s precursor, the Samata Party, and then the JD(U) itself.\n\nCPI (ML) MLA Sandeep Singh is in the fray in Nalanda, with the party also pinning its hopes on the mobilisation of Mallah voters by another mahagatbandhan constituent, Mukesh Sahani's Vikasheel Insaan Party.\n\n\"Not just us, in this election, the whole alliance will perform well, because the electoral scene of Bihar has undergone a transformation in the last four years since the 2020 Assembly polls. We are equally hopeful for all the three seats,\" Mr. Bhattacharya said.\n\nThe CPI (ML) estimated that it has the strongest organisational presence in Arrah, but concedes that it will face an uphill task there. Out of the seven Assembly segments, three are with the RJD and two with the CPI (ML). Despite RJD support, however, the CPI (ML) could not pull off a win in the 2019 Lok Sabha election.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"},

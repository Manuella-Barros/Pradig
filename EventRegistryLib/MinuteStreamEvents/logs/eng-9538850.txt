They could also fall out of the European places altogether during the final weeks of the Premier League season, though they still have a chance to win silverware having reached the FA Cup final for a second-successive year.\n\nThe Dutchman is also facing scrutiny due to United's onboarding of minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who is now in charge of footballing decisions at the club. Jason Wilcox has been brought in as technical director and talks are ongoing with Newcastle over sporting director Dan Ashworth.\n\nMeanwhile, turmoil at Ten Hag's previous club Ajax has led to intense speculation, from both England and the Netherlands, that he could make a sensational return to the Johan Cruyff Arena in time for the 2024/25 season.\n\nBut in an interview with Viaplay NL, Ten Hag was defiant that he would still be at United next term.\n\n\"I expect to be the manager of Manchester United next year. I have not been in contact with Ajax, no,\" he said. \"I signed a long-term deal consciously and I am not a person who walks away.\"\n\nWhen asked if he could manage Ajax again at some point later in his career, Ten Hag replied: \"Oh yes. Why not? I had a great time at Ajax. It's a fascinating club with many possibilities.\"\n\nTen Hag won three Eredivisie titles and two Dutch Cups during a hugely successful five-year spell at Ajax between 2017 and 2022, reestablishing them as the dominant force in Dutch football.\n\nFormer Chelsea boss Graham Potter is also a leading contender to take the Ajax job for next season, as well as Francesco Farioli of Nice - who, like United, are run by Ratcliffe.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Wilcox", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Wilcox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Cruyff_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Johan Cruyff Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Potter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graham Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OGC_Nice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OGC Nice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3171,h_1783,x_0,y_207/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/90min_en_international_web/01hx1a3d2t643b4bdaw4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538850", "eventUri": "eng-9538850", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

With four games to go, United know they won't be in the Champions League next term, though they still have a shot at silverware with an FA Cup final repeat against Manchester City on the horizon.\n\nA big summer awaits for United, with part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe looking to make his mark in his first transfer window in charge. Recent form has sparked questions about whether Ten Hag will stick around to reap the rewards, though.\n\nThe 54-year-old has been linked with a summer return to Ajax, while outgoing Bayern Munich boss Thomas Tuchel is among those reportedly being considered to take his place. Former club captain Neville doesn't anticipate any change in the dugout, though.\n\n\"I thought he was very assured,\" Neville told Kelly Cates during a Sky Sports broadcast. \"Obviously everyone else around him has gone at senior management level - the CEO, the technical director's been shifted, the CFO's gone, the interim CEO, John Murtough's gone - so there's been a lot of change at the club.\"\n\nRatcliffe has already made significant changes behind the scenes, with Omar Berrada set to take over as CEO and Jason Wilcox brought in as technical director. Dan Ashworth is expected to follow, with the former Brighton transfer chief on gardening leave from his Newcastle role and expected to take the Magpies to arbitration.\n\nDespite the change, Neville recognised Ten Hag's calm exterior as the former Utrecht boss opened up on a variety of issues. One of those was the failure to land summer transfer targets including Harry Kane, and this didn't go unnoticed.\n\nWill Erik ten Hag still be at Manchester United next season? Have your say in the comments section\n\n\"I felt as though he was assured, he was very calm, but obviously he's been under quite a lot of pressure recently,\" Neville continued. \"He talked about how big the FA Cup fnal is in a few weeks, that's a season-defining game, but I think it's the most I've heard a Manchester United manager talk - while they're still in the job - about the players that they hadn't got for him that were really important to him.\n\n\"Obviously, Frenkie de Jong was mentioned, he alluded to Harry Kane and how important a signing that would have been. Manchester United's recruitment has not been as sufficient as it should be, and also [there's] the injuries he's had.\n\n\"He wasn't making excuses by any stretch, he knows the performance levels haven't been good enough.

The cases for, against Erik ten Hag at Man United", "body": "Erik ten Hag in, or Erik ten Hag out? Manchester United fans are either one or the other. A miserable season at Old Trafford has prompted a referendum on the Dutchman's future, and the former Ajax coach is at risk of being sacked this summer.\n\nTasked with overseeing football operations after buying a 27.7% stake earlier this year, new United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his team have remained tight-lipped about their plans for the manager, though saying nothing at all has only fanned the flames of supporter debate. Ten Hag enjoyed a relatively successful first season in the job, winning the Carabao Cup, reaching the FA Cup final and finishing third in the Premier League to earn UEFA Champions League qualification.\n\nThis season, though, it has been a different story. United were dumped out of European competition before Christmas after finishing bottom of their Champions League group and, with four games left, they can finish no higher than fifth in the Premier League. The one highlight has been an FA Cup campaign which will end with a second successive final against neighbours Manchester City at the end of May, but there have been far more negatives than positives.\n\nThere's a case to sack Ten Hag, but also an argument to keep him and there are entrenched sets of fans on both sides.\n\nSitting sixth heading into the weekend, they could yet finish below Newcastle United and Chelsea, and anything less than seventh would make it United's worst finish in the entire Premier League era. Crystal Palace, Arsenal, Newcastle and Brighton are their four remaining games and amid a run of form that's seen United win just twice in nine league games, there are no guarantees.\n\nDeconstructing their season by the numbers makes for horrific reading.\n\nUnited have conceded 77 goals in all competitions -- already the most in a single campaign for 45 years -- while also struggling to score at the other end. Their 52 league goals is the joint-lowest of any team in the top half of the Premier League and the same number as Brentford, who are 16th. They conceded 15 goals in six group games during a disastrous Champions League campaign as they finished bottom of Group A, managing just one win in four games against FC Copenhagen and Galatasaray.\n\nTen Hag's style of play has also been questioned consistently since he arrived in 2022, with many fans believing that his approach relies heavily on individual moments of skill rather than a well-thought-out tactical blueprint. The aggressive press of United's forwards combined with a low defensive block often leaves acres of space in United's midfield, and opponents have enjoyed plenty of freedom to shoot at Andr\u00e9 Onana.\n\nUnited have conceded 602 shots in the Premier League this season, a number exceeded only by Sheffield United and Luton Town. Sheffield United have already been relegated and Luton, currently 17th, are on course to follow. Burnley are the league's lowest scorers, but in Saturday's draw at Old Trafford, they managed 16 attempts on goal. Newport County, who finished 18th in League Two, had 17 shots in their FA Cup tie in January.\n\nThe United fans not in favour of keeping Ten Hag will tell you that these issues aren't isolated to this season. Since the Carabao Cup final in February 2023, United have lost 33% of their games, including a humiliating 7-0 defeat to Liverpool in Anfield.\n\nTen Hag hasn't won many friends with his involvement in United's recruitment either, particularly his decision to push for the \u00a386 million purchase of Antony from former club Ajax. The Brazilian winger has so far been an unmitigated disaster, contributing little on the pitch and creating a huge hole in the club's finances.\n\nThe case to stay\n\nTen Hag will tell you that the biggest difference between this season and last is the number of injuries suffered by members of his first-team squad. United have had more than 60 separate cases of injury or illness this season totalling more than 1,300 days of absences. His defence has been hit particularly hard, forcing Ten Hag to use 13 different centre-back combinations, including using midfielder Casemiro in the centre of defence in the last three games.\n\nLisandro Mart\u00ednez has been available for only 11 games while Luke Shaw has been restricted to 15 appearances, meaning Ten Hag has been missing the left side of his defence for the most of the season. Martinez and Shaw have been able to start together just five times. United kept more Premier League clean sheets than anyone else last season, leaving Ten Hag a fair argument that his tactical plan isn't the reason for his side's vulnerabilities, which are far more connected to the personnel at his disposal.\n\nDespite problems keeping players fit, Ten Hag can also point to United's improvement in front of goal. Since the turn of the year, they've scored 44 goals in 19 games at an average of 2.3 per match, leading him to say after the draw with Burnley that his team were one of the most \"entertaining\" in the league.\n\nIt should not be forgotten that on his arrival from Ajax in 2022, Ten Hag inherited a team that had just finished sixth with a dysfunctional dressing room full of ego and short on discipline. He's had to navigate off-field issues involving Cristiano Ronaldo, Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Antony while also dealing with the ownership saga that ended with Ratcliffe buying his minority stake.\n\nIn the face of it all, he's reached three cup finals in two years. By lifting the 2023 Carabao Cup, he won the club's first trophy for more than five years. There's an argument that with one trophy, another cup final and a third-place finish in the league, he overachieved in his first season, and because of that it was always going to be difficult to build on it with more progress.\n\nFinancial restrictions haven't helped his squad-building. It should be remembered that in January 2023 he was only allowed to bring in Wout Weghorst and Marcel Sabitzer on loan, while in the last window he was told there was no money available to bring in an additional striker to help Rasmus H\u00f8jlund.\n\nH\u00f8jlund (21), Kobbie Mainoo (19) and Alejandro Garnacho (19) have formed a core of young players given valuable experience and responsibility by Ten Hag which the Dutchman believes will pay off in the future.\n\nRatcliffe himself has made the point that perhaps United's off-field structure -- not the manager -- has been to blame for the repeated failures since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. If Ten Hag stays, he would benefit from working with a new backroom team consisting of CEO Omar Berrada, technical director Jason Wilcox and incoming sporting director Dan Ashworth.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rob_dawson@espn.com.sg", "name": "Rob Dawson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_&_Hove_Albion_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brighton & Hove Albion F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_League_Two", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EFL League Two"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9_Onana", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9 Onana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_County_A.F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newport County A.F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galatasaray_S.K._(football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Galatasaray S.K.

But I think the most important thing is to get players back.\n\n\"In many positions we created depth and now, in some positions, we don't have any choices, for instance the left-back position. Luke Shaw has had only 15 starts this season so far and Tyrell Malacia zero starts - not even available.\n\nLuke Shaw has been a big loss for Man Utd this season, playing just 15 games due to injury\n\n\"For over 10 years I've been managing and I never had this experience, so many huge injury issues, but I trust in all of my experience. It can happen once in 10 years, hopefully now I have to wait another 10 to have so many injuries to deal with.\"\n\nLooking ahead to the summer window, Ten Hag said: \"In the two winter windows, we almost didn't do any business.\n\n\"In the first, we brought in Wout Weghorst and Marcel Sabitzer on loan, which were two good ones, but this winter we didn't do anything. We tried but it didn't happen.

New co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his Ineos group are beginning to transform United's footballing operations with Omar Berrada arriving as CEO in the summer after Jason Wilcox joined as technical director.\n\nPerformances have been a major issue for United this season, with Ten Hag's team conceding a huge number of shots throughout the campaign contributing to a club record-equalling 12 Premier League defeats. However, one saving grace for Ten Hag could be the FA Cup final against rivals Manchester City on May 25.\n\nREAD MORE: Thomas Tuchel has already proved Roy Keane wrong before Manchester United decision\n\nREAD MORE: Former Manchester United player fires clear two-word message as Kylian Mbappe shut down\n\nAnd former United captain Neville has backed Ten Hag to remain at the club in 2024/25. He believes that the former Ajax boss should remain in post whilst Ineos make significant changes at Old Trafford.\n\n\"What I read was that there's no doubt that Ineos coming in provides an opportunity for Manchester United, but it also provides some vulnerability in the sense that you can see the changes that they're making all around the club,\" he told Sky Sports\n\n\"He's almost last man-standing when it comes to the senior people in the club. The CEO has got the interim CEO has gone. The CFO has gone, the technical director has been moved and the sporting director's gone.\n\n\"In the next couple of months, obviously, Manchester United will make a decision on Erik ten Hag for next season but I felt more certain, you know, I said a couple of weeks, I hope he gets another season to sort of prove and said the same with Mauricio Pochettino at Chelsea, I felt more certain after having spoke to him and seeing the sort of reaction today of United fans that he's always had a lot of support from United fans.\n\n\"United fans don't turn on the manager and I felt that he would be in a position to stay one more year. Look some of the performances have been really poor and unforgivable at times, you think of what happened in the semi-final against Coventry. Some of the performances in the league that we've seen have been terrible.\n\n\"I do feel that giving Erik ten Hag one more season will definitely work for Ten Hag I think the fans to be fair wouldn't have a problem with it. And I think even for INEOS to allow them just to bed into the club and not have to think about replacing a manager in the next couple of months.\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isaac_seelochan@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Isaac Seelochan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gary Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Wilcox", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Wilcox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Keane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roy Keane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauricio_Pochettino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mauricio Pochettino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coventry"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Coventry"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Allies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Allies", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Special_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Special Operations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.coventrytelegraph.net/incoming/article29112040.ece/alternates/s1200/0_gettyimages-2062163861.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538850", "eventUri": "eng-9538850", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 775, "textEnd": 781}], "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Last year, for instance, when we played Brighton in the FA Cup semi-final, he played with an ankle that was so thick it was unbelievable. He couldn't run, but he was still on the pitch. What is fair enough to say is that Bruno is a very good example for many other players.\"\n\nTen Hag dismissed any notion Fernandes will look to leave United this summer, after the 29-year-old gave an interview in which he said he would wait until after Euro 2024 this summer to assess his future.\n\n\"That was taken out of context,\" said Ten Hag. \"I haven't even asked him, because I know he is Manchester United and I think he is very happy to be here.\"\n\nAsked if he felt Fernandes would see out his United contract, which has two more years to run, with the option of another year, Ten Hag said: \"Definitely.\"\n\nTen Hag also revealed United representatives have visited Jadon Sancho at Borussia Dortmund, to check on the progress of their exiled winger, who is on loan there until the end of the season.\n\n\"We are visiting games,\" said Ten Hag. \"We visited, I would not say all of the games, but we have seen more games from Dortmund where Jadon was performing.\n\n\"We also had a visit with him, we had a talk with him during his stay there and we will keep going with this process, we will continually be in contact and communicate.

It's a very important period where you come into a window. We want to make the next step into our squad and make plans to create an environment that avoids this year's problems in injuries.\"\n\nHowever, a possible Ten Hag departure to Bayern could benefit United. The 54-year-old will have one year left on his deal in the summer, and if Bayern decide to appoint him, United would avoid paying a reported \u00a315million in compensation to sack him.\n\nThat figure is greater than Ole Gunnar Solksjaer's payout of \u00a310m two years ago in comparison to the whopping \u00a320m paid to Jose Mourinho in 2018. United have been hamstrung by financial fair play restrictions due to their spending in previous seasons, and sacking Ten Hag would restrict their spending in the summer.\n\nNot qualifying for the Champions League this year will already be a big blow for the club. By finishing in the top four last season, United were one of 32 teams who were given a proportion of \u20ac2.1billion (\u00a31.8bn) by UEFA. Due to the expansion of the competition from next season, the prize pot is increasing to approximately \u20ac2.5bn (\u00a32.1bn).", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bruna_reis@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Bruna Reis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caretaker_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caretaker manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austria national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralf_Rangnick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ralf Rangnick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Mourinho", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29119424.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2150049459.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538850", "eventUri": "eng-9538850", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

'We have approached the matches we have played in recent times in an attacking manner, especially for the neutral spectator.\n\n'We create a lot of chances and we concede a lot.

He is focused on finishing the season strongly with Manchester United and doesn't want any distractions.\n\n\"No formal talks have taken place with EtH himself (his wishes) but he has been made aware of Bayern's enquiry.\"\n\nThe report states that Ten Hag doesn't want any distractions as and he is completely focused on finishing the current campaign strongly with the Red Devils, though there have not been any formal talks to have taken place due to the Dutchman's wishes to avoid doing so. With an FA Cup final to contend with and European football still needing to be wrapped up with either a top seven finish or a cup win, there is every chance that the Red Devils could miss out on their first continental campaign since David Moyes' horror season back in 2013-14.\n\nHe has, however, been made aware of Bayern's enquiry which has seen the German outfit led on a merry chase to appoint a new boss with deals for the likes of Xabi Alonso, Julian Nagelsmann and now Ralf Rangnick all falling through in the past two months, leaving the club fretting over who their incoming gaffer could be.\n\nManchester United's Poor Season Summarised The Red Devils have not been at their best this season\n\nTen Hag has suffered a poor campaign at United, which makes the links to Bayern all the more interesting. He did a respectable job last season by finishing third and winning the Carabao Cup in a comfortable win over Newcastle United at Wembley, and his signings this summer were expected to ramp up the pressure on Manchester City and Arsenal by closing the gap or at the very maintaining the status quo.\n\nBut a run of seriously poor results in recent weeks has ramped the pressure up on the Dutchman. Just two wins in their previous nine Premier League games has seen United fall completely out of the race for the Champions League, whilst Chelsea's win over West Ham on Sunday put them ahead of the Red Devils for the first time this season.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Erik ten Hag has won 63 of his 109 games in charge of Manchester United\n\nWith huge games coming up against Arsenal, Newcastle and Brighton in the coming weeks, a place in the top seven is looking increasingly unlikely as the weeks go by and an eighth-placed finish coupled with a loss to City in the FA Cup final - which they almost squandered qualifying for by narrowly beating Coventry City on penalties in the semi-final - would see them fail to qualify for Europe.\n\nBayern are typically the dominant team in the Bundesliga, but their grip has been lost for the first time in since 2012 as Xabi Alonso has dragged Bayer Leverkusen to the top spot - and that has seen Tuchel pointed towards the exit, and so Ten Hag would have a similarly huge task on his hands if he was to move to Bavaria.\n\nRelated 3 Players Erik ten Hag Must Drop for Manchester United vs Sheffield Utd Manchester United face Sheffield United in the Premier League in their first game since their FA Cup semi-final victory over Coventry City.\n\nStatistics courtesy of Transfermarkt.

The case for, against Erik ten Hag at Man United", "body": "Erik ten Hag in, or Erik ten Hag out? Manchester United fans are either one or the other. A miserable season at Old Trafford has prompted a referendum on the Dutchman's future, and the former Ajax coach is at risk of being sacked this summer.\n\nTasked with overseeing football operations after buying a 27.7% stake earlier this year, new United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his team have remained tight-lipped about their plans for the manager, though saying nothing at all has only fanned the flames of supporter debate. Ten Hag enjoyed a relatively successful first season in the job, winning the Carabao Cup, reaching the FA Cup final and finishing third in the Premier League to earn UEFA Champions League qualification.\n\nThis season, though, it has been a different story. United were dumped out of European competition before Christmas after finishing bottom of their Champions League group and, with four games left, they can finish no higher than fifth in the Premier League. The one highlight has been an FA Cup campaign which will end with a second successive final against neighbours Manchester City at the end of May, but there have been far more negatives than positives.\n\nThere's a case to sack Ten Hag, but also an argument to keep him and there are entrenched sets of fans on both sides.\n\nFinishing in the top four has usually been the minimum requirement for United managers and after Saturday's 1-1 draw with Burnley, that's no longer mathematically possible.\n\nSitting sixth heading into the weekend, they could yet finish below Newcastle United and Chelsea, and anything less than seventh would make it United's worst finish in the entire Premier League era. Crystal Palace, Arsenal, Newcastle and Brighton are their four remaining games and amid a run of form that's seen United win just twice in nine league games, there are no guarantees.\n\nDeconstructing their season by the numbers makes for horrific reading.\n\nUnited have conceded 77 goals in all competitions -- already the most in a single campaign for 45 years -- while also struggling to score at the other end. Their 52 league goals is the joint-lowest of any team in the top half of the Premier League and the same number as Brentford, who are 16th. They conceded 15 goals in six group games during a disastrous Champions League campaign as they finished bottom of Group A, managing just one win in four games against FC Copenhagen and Galatasaray.\n\nTen Hag's style of play has also been questioned consistently since he arrived in 2022, with many fans believing that his approach relies heavily on individual moments of skill rather than a well-thought-out tactical blueprint. The aggressive press of United's forwards combined with a low defensive block often leaves acres of space in United's midfield, and opponents have enjoyed plenty of freedom to shoot at Andr\u00e9 Onana.\n\nUnited have conceded 602 shots in the Premier League this season, a number exceeded only by Sheffield United and Luton Town. Sheffield United have already been relegated and Luton, currently 17th, are on course to follow. Burnley are the league's lowest scorers, but in Saturday's draw at Old Trafford, they managed 16 attempts on goal. Newport County, who finished 18th in League Two, had 17 shots in their FA Cup tie in January.\n\nThe United fans not in favour of keeping Ten Hag will tell you that these issues aren't isolated to this season. Since the Carabao Cup final in February 2023, United have lost 33% of their games, including a humiliating 7-0 defeat to Liverpool in Anfield.\n\nTen Hag hasn't won many friends with his involvement in United's recruitment either, particularly his decision to push for the \u00a386 million purchase of Antony from former club Ajax. The Brazilian winger has so far been an unmitigated disaster, contributing little on the pitch and creating a huge hole in the club's finances.\n\nTen Hag will tell you that the biggest difference between this season and last is the number of injuries suffered by members of his first-team squad. United have had more than 60 separate cases of injury or illness this season totalling more than 1,300 days of absences. His defence has been hit particularly hard, forcing Ten Hag to use 13 different centre-back combinations, including using midfielder Casemiro in the centre of defence in the last three games.\n\nLisandro Mart\u00ednez has been available for only 11 games while Luke Shaw has been restricted to 15 appearances, meaning Ten Hag has been missing the left side of his defence for the most of the season. Martinez and Shaw have been able to start together just five times. United kept more Premier League clean sheets than anyone else last season, leaving Ten Hag a fair argument that his tactical plan isn't the reason for his side's vulnerabilities, which are far more connected to the personnel at his disposal.\n\nDespite problems keeping players fit, Ten Hag can also point to United's improvement in front of goal. Since the turn of the year, they've scored 44 goals in 19 games at an average of 2.3 per match, leading him to say after the draw with Burnley that his team were one of the most \"entertaining\" in the league.\n\nIt should not be forgotten that on his arrival from Ajax in 2022, Ten Hag inherited a team that had just finished sixth with a dysfunctional dressing room full of ego and short on discipline. He's had to navigate off-field issues involving Cristiano Ronaldo, Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Antony while also dealing with the ownership saga that ended with Ratcliffe buying his minority stake.\n\nIn the face of it all, he's reached three cup finals in two years. By lifting the 2023 Carabao Cup, he won the club's first trophy for more than five years. There's an argument that with one trophy, another cup final and a third-place finish in the league, he overachieved in his first season, and because of that it was always going to be difficult to build on it with more progress.\n\nFinancial restrictions haven't helped his squad-building. It should be remembered that in January 2023 he was only allowed to bring in Wout Weghorst and Marcel Sabitzer on loan, while in the last window he was told there was no money available to bring in an additional striker to help Rasmus H\u00f8jlund.\n\nH\u00f8jlund (21), Kobbie Mainoo (19) and Alejandro Garnacho (19) have formed a core of young players given valuable experience and responsibility by Ten Hag which the Dutchman believes will pay off in the future.\n\nRatcliffe himself has made the point that perhaps United's off-field structure -- not the manager -- has been to blame for the repeated failures since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. If Ten Hag stays, he would benefit from working with a new backroom team consisting of CEO Omar Berrada, technical director Jason Wilcox and incoming sporting director Dan Ashworth.", "source":

Ten Hag was asked whether Sancho would be reinstated in the United squad if he apologised, and if the player is being monitored at Dortmund.\n\n\"We are close in that process,\" the Manchester United manager said. \"We are visiting games, not only [Wednesday] - [I] will not say all the games, but we have seen more games from Dortmund where Jadon was performing. We had a visit with him, we talked with him, and we will keep going with this process.\"\n\nIt is understood that John Murtough, the former football director at United, and Matt Hargreaves, the director of player negotiations, were the club representatives who travelled to Dortmund for discussions with the player.\n\nTen Hag was pressed regarding the apology. \"There was a conflict and let's finish the season first,\" he said. \"So stay away from this issue now - it is not important. He has the return [leg] of the semi-final, in the league it is not going that well for them. We have four important games in the league and the FA Cup final and then we will see.\"\n\nLast week, Bruno Fernandes discussed his future at United with Dazn Portugal. \"Obviously, it doesn't just depend on me, does it?\" he said. \"A player always has to want to be here, but at the same time, you have to want him to stay. At the moment, I feel there's that on both sides.\"\n\nTen Hag is confident the captain will remain at United for the last two years on his contract. \"Definitely,\" he said. \"I know he is Manchester United and he is very happy to be here.\"\n\nFernandes is an injury doubt for United's trip to Crystal Palace on Monday but the manager said he would \"fight\" to be fit. Ten Hag was then asked if he was hinting that other players in his squad are less inclined to battle to be available when nursing minor problems.\n\n\"It is also a very subjective criteria,\" the manager said: \"One [thing] is sure, Bruno is a real fighter. Last year for instance when we played Brighton [in the FA Cup] semi-final, he played with an ankle that was so thick [swollen] it was unbelievable. What is fair enough [to say] is that Bruno is a very good example for other players.\"\n\nHarry Maguire was yesterday ruled out of the visit to Selhurst Park with a muscle injury that will rule him out for three weeks. Maguire's absence adds to United's injury crisis in central defence, where midfielder Casemiro has been filling in for recent matches.\n\nMaguire will likely not return for United in the league this season but will hope to be fit for the FA Cup final against Manchester City on 25 May and for the Euros this summer.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamie_jackson@theguardian.com", "name": "Jamie Jackson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadon_Sancho", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jadon Sancho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casemiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casemiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_&_Hove_Albion_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brighton & Hove Albion F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selhurst_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Selhurst Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96892e8c199e00bb0d639c84cd3017c6387c922e/0_0_3578_2148/master/3578.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=aa4c8f6d6ab35e530e7b6084488d775a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538850", "eventUri": "eng-9538850", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 3420, "textEnd": 3426}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

With four games to go, United know they won't be in the Champions League next term, though they still have a shot at silverware with an FA Cup final repeat against Manchester City on the horizon.\n\nA big summer awaits for United, with part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe looking to make his mark in his first transfer window in charge. Recent form has sparked questions about whether Ten Hag will stick around to reap the rewards, though.\n\nThe 54-year-old has been linked with a summer return to Ajax, while outgoing Bayern Munich boss Thomas Tuchel is among those reportedly being considered to take his place. Former club captain Neville doesn't anticipate any change in the dugout, though.\n\n\"I thought he was very assured,\" Neville told Kelly Cates during a Sky Sports broadcast. \"Obviously everyone else around him has gone at senior management level - the CEO, the technical director's been shifted, the CFO's gone, the interim CEO, John Murtough's gone - so there's been a lot of change at the club.\"\n\nRatcliffe has already made significant changes behind the scenes, with Omar Berrada set to take over as CEO and Jason Wilcox brought in as technical director. Dan Ashworth is expected to follow, with the former Brighton transfer chief on gardening leave from his Newcastle role and expected to take the Magpies to arbitration.\n\nDespite the change, Neville recognised Ten Hag's calm exterior as the former Utrecht boss opened up on a variety of issues. One of those was the failure to land summer transfer targets including Harry Kane, and this didn't go unnoticed.\n\n\"I felt as though he was assured, he was very calm, but obviously he's been under quite a lot of pressure recently,\" Neville continued. \"He talked about how big the FA Cup fnal is in a few weeks, that's a season-defining game, but I think it's the most I've heard a Manchester United manager talk - while they're still in the job - about the players that they hadn't got for him that were really important to him.\n\n\"Obviously, Frenkie de Jong was mentioned, he alluded to Harry Kane and how important a signing that would have been. Manchester United's recruitment has not been as sufficient as it should be, and also [there's] the injuries he's had.\n\n\"He wasn't making excuses by any stretch, he knows the performance levels haven't been good enough. But he did point towards the fact that you talk about Manchester United's shots on their goal and he pointed towards the fact that last season they had the most clean sheets, and with the defence being decimated, particularly in the 30 different combinations in the back four, that that's harmed him and he's not been able to play quite the way he wanted.\"", "source": {"uri": "kmaupdates.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "kmaupdates.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gary Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Wilcox", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Wilcox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Cates", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Cates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_&_Hove_Albion_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brighton & Hove Albion F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenkie_de_Jong", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frenkie de Jong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utrecht", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utrecht"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utrecht"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32727465.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_nev-grab.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538850", "eventUri": "eng-9538850", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

But with Munich bosses looking to replace outgoing coach Thomas Tuchel and Ten Hag on their hit-list the Dutchman may soon be working with England star Kane.\n\nThe German giants have failed to seal deals for Bayer Leverkusen's Xabi Alonso, national boss Julien Nagelsmann and former United interim manager Ralf Rangnick. And they have baulked at paying a \u00a312 million release clause to take Roberto De Zerbi from Brighton.\n\nNow Ten Hag is high on their wish list - and viewed as a serious candidate having managed the Bayern B team between 2013-15 during Pep Guardiola 's reign at the club. The Dutchman ticks plenty of boxes for Bayern. He's a fluent German speaker, knows the club philosophy and is admired by powerful director Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, honorary president Uli Hoeness and incoming sporting director Max Eberl.\n\nThe trio have been impressed the way ten Hag has integrated young stars Alejandro Garnacho, Kobbie Mainoo and striker Rasmus Hojlund into a United side largely in turmoil all season. The Dutchman and his advisors, however, are still in the dark over his future at Old Trafford.\n\nThey are dismayed by a lack of public support from Ratcliffe who hasn't acted to end constant speculation that he'll sack Ten Hag after the FA Cup Final against Manchester City later this month. If United are planning to ditch him, a move to Munich would be a dream scenario.\n\nSpeaking before they faced Bayern in the Champions League group stage earlier this season Ten Hag said: \"I really enjoyed it there and my time in Munich was enormously valuable. I think a few people in the Netherlands were shocked when I signed as a reserve team coach for Bayern.\n\n\"I left a decent job in the Eredivisie for a job in the regional liga in Germany. But I never regretted it. Working with great people there, including Pep Guardiola and Matthias Sammer was like winning the lottery.''\n\nIt would cost Ratcliffe a hefty \u00a320 million to pay off Ten Hag and his backroom staff if United want a new manager. That may be too rich at a time when the club are slashing costs.\n\nBut if Ten Hag doesn't get the players he wants in the summer - after already missing out on Kane, Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong and defender Jurrien Timber who joined Arsenal - the Dutchman may even call time himself on his United job.\n\nAjax are keen to take him back after sacking Maurice Steijn in October and replacing him with interim coach John van't Schip. Graham Potter is also on Ajax's radar with the former Chelsea and Brighton boss also being eyed by Feyenoord who are losing Arne Slot to Liverpool.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

I signed consciously and am not a person who walks away. So, I assume that I will be at Manchester United next season. Has there been any contact with Ajax? No.\"\n\nBut at the same time, Ten Hag didn't rule out a move back to Amsterdam in the future. He said: \"Why not? I had a very good period at Ajax and was able to work there in a very pleasant way. It is a fascinating club, with many possibilities.\"\n\nBefore he added: \"I have never said anything else. Nor has anything else ever been stated. There has been a change in leadership and management of the club, also in the structure.\n\n\"But again, I work very well with these people. You can be assured that we talk to each other on a daily basis about next season.\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bruna_reis@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Bruna Reis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Evening_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester Evening News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Motta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Motta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Cruyff_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johan Cruyff Arena"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29113353.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2150532089.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538850", "eventUri": "eng-9538850", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Sancho responded with a tweet that disputed this and, in essence, called Ten Hag a liar. Sancho then refused to apologise to the Dutchman, so was excluded by him.\n\nThe England winger was among Dortmund's best performers in Wednesday's 1-0 victory against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League semi-final first leg. Ten Hag was asked whether Sancho would be reinstated in the United squad if he apologised, and if the player is being monitored at Dortmund.\n\n\"We are close in that process,\" the Manchester United manager said. \"We are visiting games, not only [Wednesday] - [I] will not say all the games, but we have seen more games from Dortmund where Jadon was performing. We had a visit with him, we talked with him, and we will keep going with this process.\"\n\nIt is understood that John Murtough, the former football director at United, and Matt Hargreaves, the director of player negotiations, were the club representatives who travelled to Dortmund for discussions with the player.\n\nTen Hag was pressed regarding the apology. \"There was a conflict and let's finish the season first,\" he said. \"So stay away from this issue now - it is not important. He has the return [leg] of the semi-final, in the league it is not going that well for them. We have four important games in the league and the FA Cup final and then we will see.\"\n\nLast week, Bruno Fernandes discussed his future at United with Dazn Portugal. \"Obviously, it doesn't just depend on me, does it?\" he said. \"A player always has to want to be here, but at the same time, you have to want him to stay. At the moment, I feel there's that on both sides.\"\n\nTen Hag is confident the captain will remain at United for the last two years on his contract. \"Definitely,\" he said. \"I know he is Manchester United and he is very happy to be here.\"\n\nFernandes is an injury doubt for United's trip to Crystal Palace on Monday but the manager said he would \"fight\" to be fit. Ten Hag was then asked if he was hinting that other players in his squad are less inclined to battle to be available when nursing minor problems.\n\n\"It is also a very subjective criteria,\" the manager said: \"One [thing] is sure, Bruno is a real fighter. Last year for instance when we played Brighton [in the FA Cup] semi-final, he played with an ankle that was so thick [swollen] it was unbelievable. What is fair enough [to say] is that Bruno is a very good example for other players.\"\n\nHarry Maguire was yesterday ruled out of the visit to Selhurst Park with a muscle injury that will rule him out for three weeks. Maguire's absence adds to United's injury crisis in central defence, where midfielder Casemiro has been filling in for recent matches.\n\nMaguire will likely not return for United in the league this season but will hope to be fit for the FA Cup final against Manchester City on 25 May and for the Euros this summer.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadon_Sancho", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jadon Sancho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casemiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casemiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_&_Hove_Albion_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brighton & Hove Albion F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selhurst_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Selhurst Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/0e6c95ae1e9970d034087078df71741b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538850", "eventUri": "eng-9538850", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 3461, "textEnd": 3467}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The entourage of Erik ten Hag have reportedly been contacted by one of Europe's leading clubs amid the Dutchman's uncertain future with Manchester United.\n\nThe former Ajax boss only has one year left on his contract with the Red Devils, but there are suggestions that he could depart without seeing out the final 12 months of his deal.\n\nTen Hag's debut campaign was a successful one, leading Man United to EFL Cup stardom and a third-placed Premier League finish, thus sealing their return to the promised land of Champions League football.\n\nHowever, the Red Devils' run in Europe's premier tournament came to an end in the group stage, while they have also under-performed in the Premier League and cannot qualify for the revamped 2024-25 Champions League.\n\nWith four games left to go, the best that the seventh-placed Red Devils can hope for is a spot in the Europa League, which they will also achieve if they overcome Manchester City in the FA Cup final later this month.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nBayern Munich 'touch base with Ten Hag entourage'\n\nMan United's struggles domestically and continentally have naturally led to speculation that he could be given the axe under the new regime led by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who purchased 27.7% of the club in December.\n\nThe INEOS chief is yet to give Ten Hag any sort of public backing, and the Dutchman would supposedly be prepared to resign from his position if he did not receive any assurances from Ratcliffe's team.\n\nAccording to journalist Florian Plettenberg, Bayern Munich - whose current boss Thomas Tuchel will depart at the end of the season - have touched base with the representatives of Ten Hag to gauge his interest in moving to Germany.\n\nPlettenberg adds that Ten Hag himself has not been directly contacted by Bayern as he focuses on the end of the season with Man United, and he still intends to at least see out his contract at the Theatre of Dreams.\n\nHowever, the 54-year-old would supposedly be interested in taking the Bayern job if his Man United position becomes untenable, although two other unnamed teams have also put Ten Hag on their managerial shortlists.\n\nTuchel, Ten Hag to move in opposite directions?\n\nBayern's renewed interest in Ten Hag comes after the German giants failed in their bid to lure one ex-Man United boss to Bavaria, being rejected by now-Austria head coach Ralf Rangnick.\n\nThe FC Hollywood board were apparently left stunned by Rangnick's unforeseen snub and are now considering alternative options to replace Tuchel, who is not expected to pull a Xavi and reverse his decision to leave in the same manner as the Barcelona boss.\n\nThe former Chelsea head coach is coincidentally thought to be one of Ratcliffe's top candidates to take over from Ten Hag if the latter does end up seeking pastures new, and he is said to have opened the door to joining the Red Devils this summer.\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate and the unattached Graham Potter are rumoured to be alternative candidates on Ratcliffe's list, but a move for former Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane may be too ambitious.\n\nTen Hag has won 65 of his 109 games in charge of Man United, whose push for Europa League football continues away to Crystal Palace on Monday night.\n\nID:542999:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect5675:", "source": {"uri":

Whether Ten Hag oversees that is yet to be clarified.\n\nUnited's receptiveness to offers for the majority of their squad members is not a ringing endorsement for the manager. 11 current players arrived on Ten Hag's watch.\n\nThree significant signings have been targeted, with two centre backs wanted. In a season where United have recorded 62 separate cases of injury and illness that have caused a player to miss a match, Ten Hag wants a deeper squad.\n\n\"Yes, that is one of the issues in constructing the squad,\" he admitted, \"where we have to improve, to do things better to construct a squad where we have more depth.\n\nREAD MORE: United respond to Fernandes's comments about his future\n\nREAD MORE: Keep 14 and sell 13 - who should stay and go at United\n\n\"I think the most important thing is to return players and to get them back. In many positions we created depth and now in some positions we don't have choices.\n\n\"For instance, the left back position. (Luke) Shaw only 15 starts this season so far and (Tyrell) Malacia zero starts. Not even available.\"\n\nMalacia, unavailable all season after two rounds of knee surgery, was supposed to return in January. The 24-year-old played 39 times last term and was the only player named in all 62 of United's matchday squads but he is not assured of remaining at United next season.\n\n\"Left back depends on availability from Luke Shaw,\" Ten Hag stressed. \"He will be fit. He is returning already on the pitch, we expect him back in coming weeks. But with Malacia it depends on his availability.\n\n\"I think every manager wants players with winning attitudes, great mentality, big personalities to perform under stress. That is what every manager is looking for. In this club, it is extremely important to perform under stress.\"\n\nDespite the unprecedented backing Ten Hag has enjoyed, he spoke more openly about the failure to sign a proven goalscorer in Harry Kane to Gary Neville. Mason Mount was also not his preferred midfield target after United held discussions with Jude Bellingham and Declan Rice's father in recent years, and bid for Frenkie de Jong.\n\nUnited have recruited more players on loan under Ten Hag than they did in the previous 20 years yet the failure to invest in long-term additions during the two winter transfer windows rankles the Dutchman.\n\n\"In the two (winter) windows, we didn't do almost no business,\" he reiterated. \"The first we loaned Wout Weghorst and Marcel Sabitzer, which were two good ones but in this winter we didn't do anything. We tried but it didn't happen. It had to do with the budget and FFP (financial fair play).\"\n\nTen Hag returns to Selhurst Park this evening, the ground where he first attended a United match on the final day almost two years ago. That afternoon, he sat in the main stand and mastered the stoic expression every United manager has had to adopt in the past 11 years.\n\nJohn Murtough was sat next to Ten Hag and Richard Arnold in the row in front. The former football director and chief executive are both long gone and Ten Hag is having to develop an intense rapport with new technical director Jason Wilcox.\n\nDan Ashworth will eventually be installed as sporting director, Omar Berrada's start date as chief executive is July 13 and Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Sir Dave Brailsford and interim chief executive Jean-Claude Blanc were in Manchester last week.\n\nDoes Ten Hag feel exposed at all? \"No, I don't have that feeling. So I work well with them, we are aligned, we communicate every day and there are already new people in a new structure, we communicate on a daily basis.\n\n\"I don't think in dangers. I think in opportunities. I think never in problems, I think how do we solve those problems or avoid them.\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samuel_luckhurst@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Samuel Luckhurst", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrell_Malacia", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrell Malacia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelson_Fernandes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gelson Fernandes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason_Mount", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mason Mount"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gary Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenkie_de_Jong", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frenkie de Jong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wout_Weghorst", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wout Weghorst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Sabitzer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcel Sabitzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Financial_Fair_Play_Regulations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selhurst_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Selhurst Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29110008.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2149446512.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538850", "eventUri": "eng-9538850", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-24", "textStart": 1423, "textEnd": 1438}, {"amb": false, "date": "-07-13", "textStart": 3501, "textEnd": 3508}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

They've also resisted paying a \u00a312million release clause to secure Roberto De Zerbi from Brighton.\n\nNow, Ten Hag is high on their list of potential hires. Having managed the Bayern B team between 2013-15 during Pep Guardiola's tenure, he is seen as a serious candidate, reports the Mirror.\n\nHe speaks fluent German, understands the club's philosophy and is respected by influential director Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, honorary president Uli Hoeness and incoming sporting director Max Eberl.\n\nShould United sack Ten Hag at the end of the season? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section.\n\nThe trio have been impressed by how Ten Hag has integrated young stars Alejandro Garnacho, Kobbie Mainoo and striker Rasmus Hojlund into a United side that's been largely in turmoil all season. However, the Dutchman and his advisors are still uncertain about his future at Old Trafford.\n\nThey're disappointed by the lack of public support from Ratcliffe, who hasn't done anything to quell the constant speculation that he'll sack Ten Hag after the FA Cup final against Manchester City later this month. If United plan to let him go, a move to Munich would be an ideal situation.\n\nBefore they faced Bayern in the Champions League group stage earlier this season, Ten Hag said: \"I really enjoyed it there and my time in Munich was enormously valuable. I think a few people in the Netherlands were shocked when I signed as a reserve team coach for Bayern.\n\n\"I left a decent job in the Eredivisie for a job in the regional liga in Germany. But I never regretted it. Working with great people there, including Pep Guardiola and Matthias Sammer was like winning the lottery.''\n\nIt would cost Ratcliffe a hefty \u00a320million to pay off Ten Hag and his backroom staff if United want a new manager. That may be too expensive at a time when the club are cutting costs.\n\nBut if Ten Hag doesn't get the players he wants in the summer - after already missing out on Kane, Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong and defender Jurrien Timber who joined Arsenal - the Dutchman might even decide to leave his United job himself.\n\nAjax are reportedly eager to welcome him back following the dismissal of Maurice Steijn in October, and the subsequent appointment of interim coach John van't Schip.\n\nGraham Potter, ex-Chelsea and Brighton manager, is also on Ajax's watchlist, with Feyenoord also showing interest as they prepare for Arne Slot's departure to Liverpool.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_bates@dailystar.co.uk",

The Dutchman has struggled in his second stint in charge and failure to qualify for the Champions League will impact the club's budget.\n\nRecent reports have seen Ten Hag emerge as a potential replacement for Thomas Tuchel at Bayern Munich, with Sky Sports News claiming that the Bundesliga giants have contacted Ten Hag's agent Kees Vos to enquire about his availability. While no formal talks are said to have taken place, the Dutchman has been made aware of their interest.\n\nREAD MORE: Crystal Palace vs Man United, TV channel, live stream and how to watch Premier League\n\nREAD MORE: Manchester United hatch FFP plan to complete \u00a360m summer transfer\n\nDuring an interview with Dutch publication Voetbal Zone, the 54-year-old says has played down the prospect of leaving United this summer. \"The fact is that I still have a contract here for another year,\" Ten Hag said. \"I signed consciously and am not a person who walks away. So, I assume that I will be at Manchester United next season.\"\n\nTen Hag is involved in planning and recruitment for next season, with meetings having already taken place. \"Initial meetings are good,\" he previously told Sky Sports. \"Now we have to take things quickly because the summer is coming.\n\n\"It's a very important period where you come into a window. We want to make the next step into our squad and make plans to create an environment that avoids this year's problems in injuries.\"\n\nWith only a couple of weeks until the end of the season, Bayern are still searching for a manager to take charge. Former United interim manager Ralf Rangnick was the latest to rebuff the offer after Julian Nagelsmann and Xabi Alonso were also considered.\n\nSky Sports in Germany add that Bayern are currently considering several options that includes Ten Hag and former Wolves manager Julen Lopetegui. While the Dutchman would like to fulfil his contract until 2025, it is said that if a managerial change is made in the coming months, he would be 'ready' for Bayern. In addition, two unnamed teams are said to have expressed 'concrete interest.'\n\nThe Red Devils will be in Premier League action on Monday evening when they take on Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park (8pm kick-off).

The Red Devils have spent around \u00a3380million on players since Ten Hag was appointed in May 2022 and even more could be spent this transfer window.\n\nSir Jim Ratcliffe is expected to oversee a summer of changes at United after his 25 per cent takeover was confirmed and ratified in February. A new centre forward, No.8, centre-back and right-back are among the areas United could target as they try and strengthen their squad following a below-par campaign.\n\nUnited sit seventh, two points behind sixth-place Newcastle with a game in hand and Ten Hag has come under pressure after enduring a disappointing season. Although there has been speculation surrounding the future of Ten Hag, he could be offered one more window to try and turn their fortunes around.\n\nHowever, should United sign anyone this summer, Ten Hag wants \"players with winning attitudes and a great mentality, big personalities to perform under stress\".\n\nLooking ahead to the summer window, Ten Hag told his pre-match press conference: \"In the two winter windows, we almost didn't do any business. In the first, we brought in Wout Weghorst and Marcel Sabitzer on loan, which were two good ones, but this winter we didn't do anything.\n\n\"We tried but it didn't happen. It had to do with the budget and Financial Fair Play. I think every manager wants players with winning attitudes and a great mentality, big personalities to perform under stress. In this club it's extremely important to perform under stress.\"\n\nUnited are next back in action when they travel to Crystal Palace on Monday night. The Red Devils have won just one of their last four Premier League matches and will be eager to put together a run before the end of the season which would get them a Europa League spot.\n\nManchester United could be busy in the transfer market this summer\n\nBut United could be without Bruno Fe rnandes with the midfielder a doubt, while Scott McTominay is facing a race against time to be fit for the trip to Selhurst Park.\n\nTen Hag added: \"Scott [McTominay] didn't train so far this week but I expect him back in training on Saturday. Then we will have to see up to the game if he is 100 per cent available or for [only] a part in the game.\n\n\"Then also, after the game, we had an issue with Bruno [Fernandes] so he is a doubt for Monday, but he will fight to be a part of this game, as we know with Bruno.\n\n\"Never rule him out for any game and he is giving his best to be available. Jonny Evans returned today in the team training and, tomorrow, we will see if it is enough before the two days before the game. Anthony [Martial] was partly in the team training.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The club have also missed out on Champions League football and this could trigger part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and new CEO Omar Berrada to make a change.\n\nThe Special One, who was sacked at United in 2018, spent around \u00a390million on Paul Pogba\n\nZlatan Ibrahimovic also arrived and helped Mourinho win three trophies in his first season\n\nTen Hag has spent big on Rasmus Hojlund (left) and Antony (right) during his tenure\n\nBut after openly revealing he had missed out on both Harry Kane and Frenkie de Jong, Ten Hag claimed that patience is needed for his project to come to fruition.\n\n'You need outstanding players,' Ten Hag said. 'Otherwise, you are in a process and you have to be patient. That is where we are now.\n\n'We went for players who have high potentials, and we have to develop them, as individuals and as a team.

Manchester United head coach Erik ten Hag is not concerned about the prospect of Red Devils captain Bruno Fernandes leaving Old Trafford.\n\nDespite criticism of his on-field antics and his suitability as the club's skipper, the Portugal international has been fundamental to Man United ever since arriving from Sporting Lisbon in January 2020.\n\nFernandes has come up with 79 goals and 64 assists in 230 matches for Man United across all competitions, including 15 goals and 11 assists from 45 outings in the current campaign.\n\nThe 29-year-old was promoted to permanent captain last summer after Harry Maguire was stripped of the armband, and he still has two years left to run on his contract, which also includes the option for a further 12 months.\n\nHowever, Fernandes's efforts this season have mostly gone unrewarded, as Man United finished bottom of their Champions League group and cannot qualify for next year's edition as they languish in seventh spot in the Premier League table.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nTen Hag: 'Fernandes will definitely stay at Man United'\n\nThe Portuguese playmaker could still captain the Red Devils to FA Cup glory as they prepare to face Manchester City in the final for the second year running, but he recently fuelled speculation that he could be on his way out.\n\nFernandes stressed that he would not decide his future until after Euro 2024, but he left the door open to a possible exit, admitting that he had to \"think\" about potentially not playing in the Premier League next season.\n\nHowever, speaking to the press ahead of Monday's trip to Crystal Palace, Ten Hag said that Fernandes's quotes had been taken out of context, and he believes that the midfielder is \"very happy\" at Old Trafford.\n\nAsked if he wanted to keep Fernandes at the club, Ten Hag said: \"Absolutely but that [the interview] was also taken out of context. I haven't even asked [Fernandes about the context] because I know he is Manchester United and I think he is very happy to be here.\"\n\nThe Man United boss was then asked if he could envisage the 29-year-old at least seeing out the last two years of his Old Trafford contract, to which he simply replied: \"Definitely\".\n\nTen Hag's own Man United future in doubt\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nWhile Ten Hag has no doubts that Fernandes will still be at the Theatre of Dreams for at least another two seasons, the same cannot be said about his own future, as his contract only runs until 2025.\n\nThe Red Devils' sharp decline this season has naturally led to suggestions that the axe - now wielded by the new regime of Sir Jim Ratcliffe - could soon come down, but he is still committed to Man United, even without the INEOS chief's public backing.\n\nAt this stage, the hierarchy are not thought to have any immediate plans to give Ten Hag the boot, but they have been drawing up an exit strategy to ensure a seamless transition should the situation change.\n\nAmid the uncertainty, Bayern Munich are said to have been in touch with Ten Hag's representatives to gauge whether he would be interested in moving to Germany, as Thomas Tuchel will step down from his post at the end of the season.\n\nTuchel is coincidentally thought to be a leading contender for the Man United job should Ten Hag depart, a list which also includes Graham Potter and England head coach Gareth Southgate.\n\nID:543010:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect5514:", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_knapton@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Ben Knapton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portugal national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sm.imgix.net/23/38/bruno-fernandes.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538850", "eventUri": "eng-9538850", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-01-", "textStart": 488, "textEnd": 500}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

That's what every manager is looking for but, what the truth is, in this club it's extremely important to perform under stress.\"\n\nBruno Fernandes epitomises the kind of mentality, skill and robustness needed to succeed at Old Trafford, but he too is a doubt tonight. The United skipper, who Ten Hag \"definitely\" expects to see out his contract until at least 2026, is the most successful signing of recent years.\n\nThere is plenty of competition for the least effective, with Jadon Sancho, signed from Borussia Dortmund in 2021 for \u00a373m, among those right now. The 24-year-old was banished from the first-team in September after claiming he had been made a \"scapegoat\" but has impressed back on loan at his former club.\n\nTen Hag says the loan has been a win-win, highlighting the \"high value\" of a player that United have stayed in close contact with.\n\n\"We are close in that process,\" he said. \"We're visiting games, not only Wednesday. \"We visit, I would not say all the games, but we have seen more games from Dortmund where Jadon was performing there.\n\n\"We also had a visit with him, we had a talk with him during his stay there, so we will keep going with this process.

Ratcliffe's preference would be to stick with the Dutchman, although results between now and the end of the season could force his hand.\n\nIf Ten Hag were to be sacked, he wouldn't be short of interest. It's been widely reported that after suffering rejection from first-choice targets Xabi Alonso, Julian Nagelsmann and now Ralf Rangnick, Bundesliga giants Bayern have now added Ten Hag to their shortlist ahead of current manager Thomas Tuchel's impending departure.\n\nSky Sports are even claiming that Bayern have touched base with the 54-year-old's agent, Kees Vos, to gauge his interest. Reports from Germany add that although Ten Hag wants to stay at United, he's 'ready' for the Bayern job if Ratcliffe doesn't offer him a vote of confidence.\n\nIt's understood that the Red Devils' reluctance to sack the former Ajax boss stems from two major factors: the cost of his potential sacking and the perceived lack of suitable candidates to replace him. Bayern's interest presents them with an intriguing opportunity, though, as the Germans could pay a compensation fee for Ten Hag while United would in-turn appoint outgoing ex-Chelsea manager Tuchel, who can still take Bayern to the Champions League final next month.\n\nTen Hag has admirers in Munich thanks to his two-year spell with the club between 2013 and 2015. He managed Bayern's reserve side while Pep Guardiola - a fellow discipline of the great Johan Cruyff - was in charge of their first-team.\n\n\"That time was enormously valuable for me,\" Ten Hag, nicknamed 'Mini Pep' in Bavaria, told Sport Bild in 2018. \"I remember it well. Many people in Holland shook their heads when I left the Eredivisie for the Regionalliga [the local division in Bavaria].\"\n\nHe added: \"I never regretted the decision. Working for a club as big as Bayern with such formative personalities as Pep Guardiola and also Matthias Sammer was like winning the lottery.\"\n\nYour turn! Should Erik ten Hag quit Man Utd and join Bayern Munich? Give us your verdict in the comments section\n\nErik ten Hag coached Bayern Munich's reserves from 2013 to 2015\n\nTen Hag's openness to returning to Bayern is trumped by his desire to be successful with the Red Devils, even if he's yet to receive Ratcliffe's public approval. \"I'm under contract for three seasons, so I don't care,\" he recently said.\n\n\"I am in this process, I'm only focusing on the process, so I don't care what's going on around me. I have many talks with Sir Jim Radcliffe, also with Sir Dave Brailsford (Ratcliffe's right-hand man) and others in that group, so I know where we are talking about and I have a strong belief and I feel that they believe in me.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

He just wants to focus on Manchester United at the moment.\"\n\n\"We know there are a number of other clubs, should Ten Hag leave Manchester United, that would be interested in the Dutchman.\"\n\nAs the noose tightens around Ten Hag's neck at Old Trafford, his being lined up by one of the world's biggest clubs might certainly play on INEOS' mind and make them consider what they are losing if they were to sack him.\n\nHowever, that might be exactly what Vos wants and it may be that the leaked story has come from the agent's end in an effort to control the narrative about his client's future.\n\nIn truth, Bayern are floundering, having already been turned down by Xabi Alonso, Julian Nagelsmann and, most surprisingly of all, Rangnick. It may be that one of the most coveted positions in world football is seen as something of a poison chalice, although that is unlikely to deter Ten Hag.\n\nMeanwhile, rumours are rampant of United themselves sounding out potential successors to the former Ajax boss. Ironically, Thomas Tuchel, who will leave Bayern at the end of the season, is reportedly on the shortlist.\n\nAnd in yet another German connection, the Red Devils have reportedly opened talks with former national team boss, Hansi Flick, over potentially replacing Ten Hag.", "source": {"uri": "thepeoplesperson.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Peoples Person | MUFC News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "red_billy@thepeoplesperson.com", "name": "Red Billy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bavaria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bavaria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralf_Rangnick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ralf Rangnick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allianz Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansi_Flick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hansi Flick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Nagelsmann", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julian Nagelsmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn.thepeoplesperson.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ten-hag-nottingham-forest-v-manchester-united-emirates-fa-cup-fifth-round-4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538850", "eventUri": "eng-9538850", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

We visit, I would not say all the games, but we have seen more games from Dortmund where Jadon was performing there.\n\n\"We also had a visit with him, we had a talk with him during his stay there and we will keep going with this process, we will continually be in contact and communicate with them.\"\n\nIt is understood that Matt Hargreaves, United's director of player negotiations, has visited Sancho in Germany, as did John Murtough before leaving his post as director of football.\n\nAfter signing for \u00a373 million from Dortmund in 2021, Sancho's best form since has been back on loan with his old club. Ex-United captain Rio Ferdinand described his eye-catching performance against Paris Saint-Germain last week as a \"joke\". \"He was shaking and baking top players. He's putting people on the floor,\" added Ferdinand.\n\nTen Hag says both parties will concentrate on their remaining games of the season before deciding the next steps.\n\n\"There was a conflict and let's first finish the season - he is not here now - so stay away from this issue now because it is not important,\" he said. \"He has the return of the semi-final, for them also in the league it is not going that well for them and we have four important games in the league and the FA Cup final so that is the issue and the focus point in this moment and then we will see in the summer what is going to happen.\"\n\nTen Hag responds to departure of his allies\n\nTen Hag, meanwhile, has discussed the implications of seeing two allies leave the club in Murtough and transfer negotiator Matt Judge. Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has taken control of football operations and brought in his own people behind the scenes.\n\n\"I don't think in dangers. I think in opportunities. I think never in problems, I think how do we solve those problems or avoid them,\" he said, and was asked if he feels exposed by the departure of his allies.\n\n\"I don't have that feeling. So I work well with them, we are aligned, we communicate every day and there are already new people in a new structure, we communicate on a daily basis.\"\n\nBruno Fernandes is a doubt for Monday evening's clash against Crystal Palace. The United captain gave an interview last week saying he could consider his future in the summer, although Ten Hag feels the Portugal international will \"definitely\" see out his contract at Old Trafford which has two years plus an option left.\n\nUnited will be without defender Harry Maguire on Monday night with the defender facing around three weeks on the sidelines after suffering a muscular injury in training. The centre-back is expected to miss the rest of the Premier League campaign, but could be back in time for the FA Cup final against Manchester City on May 25 and is not said to be a doubt for this summer's European Championship.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_mcgrath@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Mike McGrath", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadon_Sancho", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jadon Sancho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Ferdinand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rio Ferdinand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2024/05/05/TELEMMGLPICT000376012544_17149192151430_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqXgpWiqeVTUdtiSj0NRt_hCf_DZeUk97yhmj39kkUbK8.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538850", "eventUri": "eng-9538850", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 3619, "textEnd": 3625}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The chief executive, Richard Arnold, and the football director, John Murtough, are just the highest profile departures. Omar Berrada will come in as chief executive from Manchester City when his notice period expires on 13 July while Murtough has effectively been replaced by Jason Wilcox, the new technical director, and Dan Ashworth, who will come in once the terms of his severance from Newcastle have been agreed.\n\nOther changes were announced on Tuesday in what feels like a general process of Ineos-ification, suggesting Ratcliffe may have a far bigger hand in the business side of United's operations than had been anticipated.\n\nThe biggest decision for the new regime is over Erik ten Hag. Although he is widely regarded as a dead man walking, the suggestion this week was that Ineos feel he has been let down by the broader management.\n\nTen Hag might also be about to pull off one of the most absurd FA Cup triumphs in history. He is not wrong when he talks about United being one of the most entertaining sides in the country, but even those who buy into the fallacy that football is a branch of showbusiness tend not to advocate throwing away comfortable leads against the likes of Newport and Coventry before winning through.\n\nThe 4-3 quarter-final victory over Liverpool stands out even in a season when United and Chelsea have been mixing brilliance and haplessness to unprecedented levels.\n\nBruno Fernandes ended up playing at centre-back, Antony at left-back. Liverpool, masters of chaos, should have been out of sight but found themselves out-chaosed, apparently befuddled by how often they were granted four-on-two breaks. Tactical discourse has been seized by the debate between positionism and relationism, but this was a bold step into a more distant future: no-relationism, just 11 players (eventually 10) scattered to create an unrepeatable harmony of discordance.\n\nIt would take something unexpected and deeply weird for United to beat Manchester City in the FA Cup final, but this entire run has been unexpected and deeply weird.\n\nBut the FA Cup did not save Louis van Gaal in 2016 and it may not save Ten Hag. This is not 1990. Last season Ten Hag seemed just the sort of tough, single-minded figure United needed. He managed to offload Cristiano Ronaldo and made the decision that David de Gea's inability to play out from the back was unsustainable.\n\nA third-place finish, a League Cup triumph and an FA Cup final seemed a decent base and, if a lot of United's wins had been edgy affairs nicked by a single goal, that at least appeared something to build on.\n\nThose single-goal victories have remained a feature: 12 of United's 16 league victories this season have been by one while nine have been secured by goals scored after the 75th minute. Very little has felt convincing. Ten Hag has apparently been broken by the job, transformed in the course of a year from ruthless revolutionary leader to fading general in his labyrinth, unable to direct the anarchy unfolding in front of him, blithely insisting that conceding 20 shots a game isn't a problem.\n\nIt's as though Ming the Merciless had become a hapless supply teacher trying to pretend that the curtains being set on fire was all part of the plan. \"We're the most enthusiastic class in the school!\" Can any manager restore their credibility after the high farce of the past few weeks?\n\nAnd what then? Once a manager, whether Ten Hag or a newcomer, has been settled on, what in this hotch-potch of a squad is worth salvaging? Reports have suggested United were open to offers for all but Kobbie Mainoo, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus H\u00f8jlund, which given their youth and potential makes sense.\n\nFernandes has played more key passes per game than anyone else in the Premier League this season and while his petulance isn't ideal, particularly not for a captain, that may be less pronounced in a better side. Diogo Dalot has had a quietly effective season on whichever flank he has been asked to occupy.\n\nBeyond that, it's hard to imagine too much protest if any of the current squad are sold. After a miserable season, even Marcus Rashford now seems expendable. Rapha\u00ebl Varane and Luke Shaw are let down too often by their bodies. Casemiro looks old. Ten Hag made clear last summer he would be happy to offload Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay.\n\nBut perhaps the most damning aspect of Ten Hag's management is the performance of the players he had a major influence over signing; for those he managed at Ajax or knew from the Eredivisie, he must bear prime responsibility.\n\nAndr\u00e9 Onana, after a difficult start, has settled to an extent, but his performance against Burnley - a brilliant save and a daft penalty conceded - was emblematic of his season. Lisandro Mart\u00ednez and Tyrell Malacia have spent much of the campaign injured. Antony occasionally flickers, but he has one Premier League goal this season and is wildly inconsistent and looks a long way from an \u00a386m player.\n\nThat, more than anything else, may be what persuades Ineos that Ten Hag is not the man to lead their future. But it's telling of United's progress since Sir Alex Ferguson retired that David Moyes was sacked 34 games into the 2013-14 season with United on 57 points, a couple of weeks after a Champions League quarter-final. With 34 games of this season gone, United are on 54 points and they went out of Europe before Christmas.\n\nModern football's financial stratification means United have not come close to the collapse they suffered 50 years ago when they were relegated, but this has been a lost decade. And that may not be easy to reverse.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_wilson@irishexaminer.com", "name": "Jonathan

Tuchel's tactical flexibility would help United while Ten Hag's diplomatic personality could help him to deal with politics in the Bayern boardroom. A report in The Times said that United are considering Tuchel as a possible replacement for Ten Hag, while Bild claim Ten Hag is on Bayern's shortlist.\n\nAn unexpected job swap could be on the cards this summer, with reports claiming that Erik ten Hag and Thomas Tuchel are under consideration by Bayern Munich and Manchester United respectively. Tuchel is set to leave Bayern at the end of the season, while Ten Hag's United future is far from certain.\n\nBoth men have endured difficult periods in recent months. United supporters went into this season with high hopes off the back of an encouraging 2022-23 campaign, but Ten Hag has presided over an extremely disappointing season.\n\nUnited suffered early exits in both the Champions League and the Carabao Cup, while they are currently seventh in the Premier League and could still mathematically finish as low as 10th, despite the season being in its final month. The Red Devils' only chance of salvaging some pride will come against Manchester City in a rerun of last season's FA Cup final.\n\nErik ten Hag vs Thomas Tuchel - 2023-24\n\nManager\n\nGames\n\nWins\n\nDraws\n\nLosses\n\nWin percentage\n\nErik ten Hag at United\n\n47\n\n23\n\n7\n\n17\n\n48.9\n\nThomas Tuchel at Bayern\n\n46\n\n30\n\n6\n\n10\n\n65.2\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Only Sir Alex Ferguson (59.67) and Jose Mourinho (58.33) have higher win percentages at United than Erik ten Hag (58.26).\n\nNo Chance of Tuchel-Bayern U-turn\n\nBoss will leave Bavarian giants in summer\n\nTuchel is preparing to leave Bayern just a year on from replacing Julian Nagelsmann as the Bundesliga club's manager. Nagelsmann was dismissed less than two years into a five-year contract last March, owing to off-field issues and a lack of popularity among many senior Bayern players.\n\nFormer Chelsea boss Tuchel was seen as the man who could get the best out of Bayern's squad, but a poor Bundesliga campaign as well as an early German Cup exit at the hands of third-tier side FC Saarbrucken led to Bayern taking the decision to announce in February that Tuchel would be replaced at the end of the season.\n\nRelated Thomas Tuchel's Innovative Training Methods Thomas Tuchel's interesting training ground methods could soon be heading back to the Premier League, with the German linked to Man United.\n\nBayern's form has improved in recent weeks and they could yet end the campaign as Champions League winners, with a semi-final second leg in Madrid to come next week, but there is no chance of Bayern and Tuchel going back on their plan to cut ties.\n\n\"Since we agreed to part ways, Bayern has been looking intensively for a new coach. I'm guessing probably even before our conversation,\" Tuchel told Sky in Germany. \"That's bad motivation to then say: ah, let's do it again with you. Nah. From my point of view, that's clear.\"\n\nIt's feasible that United and Bayern will both be looking for a new manager ahead of the 2024-25 campaign, and while The Times report that Tuchel is on United's shortlist of candidates, BILD's Christian Falk claims that Ten Hag is currently on Bayern's radar. A fresh start could do both managers some good.\n\nWhy Job Swap Could Make Sense\n\nTen Hag's personality suits Bayern while United could do with Tuchel's tactics\n\nTuchel has Premier League experience from his time at Chelsea and, given what has happened at Stamford Bridge since he left, Chelsea fans will no doubt be ruing the day Todd Boehly dismissed the German in order to bring Graham Potter in.\n\nFabrizio Romano claimed Tuchel is open to returning to England, telling CaughtOffside: \"Thomas Tuchel is not speaking to any other club at the moment, his full focus is on the Champions League. Then of course if he leaves Bayern he's open to considering opportunities, and I'm told he'd be more than happy to return to the Premier League one day.\"\n\nA lot of United fans on social media aren't particularly enamoured by the prospect of Tuchel replacing Ten Hag, but he is objectively a more proven manager than the Dutchman. Tuchel reached back-to-back Champions League finals in 2020 and 2021, winning the latter, and his tactical flexibility would be welcomed at United.\n\nTuchel's man-management skills have been questioned but his tactical nous, unlike Ten Hag's, cannot be. United have persisted with the same failing system all season and there has been a reluctance from Ten Hag to change tack, with the former Ajax manager seemingly content to see his side consistently overrun in midfield and face dozens of shots per game.\n\nAs for Ten Hag potentially taking over at Bayern, a move would see him return to the club he spent two years at between 2013 and 2015. At Bayern, Ten Hag would find a club with a far better sporting structure than the one he is operating under at United. Bayern's players are also better than United's and that would give Ten Hag's preferred playing style a greater chance of achieving success.\n\nKarl Heinz-Rummenigge, the former Bayern CEO who is now on the club's supervisory board, is fond of Ten Hag from the coach's time in charge of Bayern II. He said in 2019: \"First of all, I have to say, that he's a very kind man. Erik is a very pleasant guy.\n\n\"I also think he's capable of doing big things as a coach and he's proving this now. I think this Ajax team is the best one they've had for 10 years.

But with Munich bosses looking to replace outgoing coach Thomas Tuchel and Ten Hag on their hit-list the Dutchman may soon be working with England star Kane.\n\nThe German giants have failed to seal deals for Bayer Leverkusen's Xabi Alonso, national boss Julien Nagelsmann and former United interim manager Ralf Rangnick. And they have baulked at paying a \u00a312 million release clause to take Roberto De Zerbi from Brighton.\n\nNow Ten Hag is high on their wish list - and viewed as a serious candidate having managed the Bayern B team between 2013-15 during Pep Guardiola 's reign at the club. The Dutchman ticks plenty of boxes for Bayern. He's a fluent German speaker, knows the club philosophy and is admired by powerful director Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, honorary president Uli Hoeness and incoming sporting director Max Eberl.\n\nTen Hag is disappointed with the lack of support he's had at United\n\nThe trio have been impressed the way ten Hag has integrated young stars Alejandro Garnacho, Kobbie Mainoo and striker Rasmus Hojlund into a United side largely in turmoil all season. The Dutchman and his advisors, however, are still in the dark over his future at Old Trafford.\n\nThey are dismayed by a lack of public support from Ratcliffe who hasn't acted to end constant speculation that he'll sack Ten Hag after the FA Cup Final against Manchester City later this month. If United are planning to ditch him, a move to Munich would be a dream scenario.\n\nSpeaking before they faced Bayern in the Champions League group stage earlier this season Ten Hag said: \"I really enjoyed it there and my time in Munich was enormously valuable. I think a few people in the Netherlands were shocked when I signed as a reserve team coach for Bayern.\n\nRalf Rangnick has turned down the Bayern job\n\n\"I left a decent job in the Eredivisie for a job in the regional liga in Germany. But I never regretted it. Working with great people there, including Pep Guardiola and Matthias Sammer was like winning the lottery.''\n\nIt would cost Ratcliffe a hefty \u00a320 million to pay off Ten Hag and his backroom staff if United want a new manager. That may be too rich at a time when the club are slashing costs.\n\nBut if Ten Hag doesn't get the players he wants in the summer - after already missing out on Kane, Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong and defender Jurrien Timber who joined Arsenal - the Dutchman may even call time himself on his United job.\n\nAjax are keen to take him back after sacking Maurice Steijn in October and replacing him with interim coach John van't Schip. Graham Potter is also on Ajax's radar with the former Chelsea and Brighton boss also being eyed by Feyenoord who are losing Arne Slot to Liverpool.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

United won't be competing in the Champions League next season and they face a battle to secure a European place with four league games remaining before the FA Cup final against Manchester City.

United have lost 12 games in the league this season and they've only picked up 54 points from their 34 games. As the graphic below illustrates, Ten Hag's men need to pick up five points from a possible 12 in their four remaining fixtures to avoid matching United's worst final points tally in Premier League history.\n\nThat arrived in the 2021/22 season before Ten Hag's appointment at Old Trafford. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r started the campaign as manager before the Norwegian was sacked and replaced by Ralf Rangnick.

Bayern Munich are reportedly keen to appoint Erik ten Hag as their new manager this summer, with the Dutchman potentially losing his job at Manchester United.\n\nTen Hag led the Red Devils to the EFL Cup trophy last season, while the club also made the FA Cup final and finished third in the Premier League during a strong first campaign for the 54-year-old at the helm.\n\nIt has been a different story during the 2023-24 campaign, though, with Man United finishing bottom of their Champions League section, while they are currently down in seventh position in the Premier League table and cannot qualify for next season's European Cup.\n\nTen Hag can deliver more domestic silverware this term, with the 20-time English champions preparing to tackle bitter rivals Manchester City in the final of the FA Cup later this month.\n\nHowever, the Dutchman has not been publicly backed by new minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who is believed to be considering bringing in a new manager this summer.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nBayern 'interested in appointing Erik ten Hag as new manager'\n\nAccording to The Mirror, Bayern are showing a strong interest, with the German champions on the lookout for a new head coach, as Thomas Tuchel will depart this summer.\n\nThe report claims that Roberto De Zerbi had been the German club's leading target after failing to convince Xabi Alonso to leave Bayer Leverkusen this summer.\n\nHowever, Bayern are not willing to pay the \u00a312m release clause in De Zerbi's Brighton & Hove Albion contract, so the Munich giants have moved onto their next target.\n\nTen Hag was in charge of Bayern Munich's second team between 2013 and 2015, and he is believed to be admired by senior figures at the club, making a move a serious possibility if Man United sack him.\n\nAfter leaving Bayern, the Dutchman managed FC Utrecht between 2015 and 2017 before moving to Ajax, winning three league titles and two KNVB Cups ahead of his switch to Old Trafford.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nThomas Tuchel could replace Erik ten Hag at Man United\n\nMan United are allegedly exploring the possibility of bringing Tuchel to Old Trafford, so the 20-time English champions could potentially swap managers with Bayern this summer.\n\nEngland head coach Gareth Southgate is also being linked with the role, but his lack of managerial experience at club level means that it would be a risky appointment.\n\nMeanwhile, Graham Potter - another alleged leading target - struggled at Chelsea, and Man United cannot afford to get their next appointment wrong, if Ten Hag is shown the exit.\n\nTuchel was unable to lead Bayern to another Bundesliga title this season, but he could deliver the Champions League, with the club level at 2-2 with Real Madrid ahead of the second leg of their semi-final.\n\nThe German was in charge of Chelsea between January 2021 and September 2022, and he won the Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup during his time at Stamford Bridge.\n\nID:542947:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect5425:", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri":

For the most part, they have been erratic and too expansive, leaving gaping holes between their defensive line and midfield.\n\nThey have sieved too many goals in recent months, lacking the control that Ten Hag has been so desperate for throughout his United tenure. Last season, via Christian Eriksen and Casemiro, United thought they had found it, but that turned out to be a short-term fix.\n\nREAD MORE: Erik ten Hag speaks out on United sack rumours and responds to Ajax speculation\n\nREAD MORE: United just won two trophies with help from Phil Jones - this is how they did it\n\nTen Hag, from the outset of his rein, has often banged the drum about wanting to turn United into a possession-based team, capable of controlling matches for 90 minutes. It was why he was so desperate to land Frenkie de Jong in the summer of 2022, envisioning the Dutchman as United's midfield orchestrator.\n\nLast season, the Reds put together some wonderful passing moves that led to goals, with Antony's debut goal against Arsenal, Luke Shaw's against Bournemouth and Marcus Rashford's against Crystal Palace, all of which were netted at Old Trafford, ranking among their best. This season, however, those types of goals have not been as forthcoming.\n\nHowever, United did produce a wonderful team move that led to their third goal in the 3-3 draw with Galatasaray in the Champions League in November. Despite it featuring a catalogue of passes, five were decisive in moving United quickly up the pitchy.\n\nFeaturing five players, including goalkeeper Andre Onana, the end to the move was slick and productive, with Scott McTominay dropping deep to influence the play before getting forward to finish the move. Although Ten Hag, by mistake, said the goal was scored against FC Copenhagen, it was clear he was referencing the one against Galatasaray three weeks later, with the Scot failing to score in either of United's two games against the Danes this season.\n\nAsked to pick out his favourite United goal from the season so far, Ten Hag told United's club website: \"Actually, the goal that comes from Scott McTominay in Copenhagen is the first that is coming to me. That was a real team effort where we made so many passes.\n\n\"It shows how we want to play and it was a really good, simple [move] that showed how we want to play.\"\n\nAs far as team goals are concerned, McTominay's in Turkey does rank as one of the best United have produced this season. Ten Hag remains determined to turn United into a possession-heavy team who can control matches for long periods.\n\nHowever, they remain best suited to hitting teams on the counter-attack and causing problems with the speed available to them in attack.

He has a contract until 2026, with the club possessing an option to extend it for a further season.\n\nWhile Fernandes is a doubt for Monday's match at Crystal Palace, he has been almost ever-present since his arrival in 2020, making 230 appearances in just over four years.\n\nAnd Ten Hag said his high workload, willingness to assume responsibility and to play through the pain barrier all make him invaluable.\n\nHe added: \"Taking responsibility is one of the biggest assets top footballers have to show and deliver. Bruno is always available, he never misses a game and always plays in a good level and always gets energy to a team. Such assets are necessary to be successful.\n\n\"Bruno is a real fighter. Last year for instance when we played Brighton in the FA Cup semi-final, we played with an ankle that was so thick, it was unbelievable. Bruno is a very good example for other players.\"\n\nTen Hag has been talking to new technical director Jason Wilcox on a daily basis and, after United's season has been affected by more than 60 injuries, will tell the hierarchy they need more options for next season.\n\n\"That is one of the issues in our constructing the squad. We have to improve to do things better to construct a squad with more depth,\" he explained.\n\nBut he believes this season's injury crisis is a one-off, saying: \"For over 10 years I am managing. I never had this experience, so huge with so many injury issues. So it can happen once in 10 years. Hopefully now can wait another 10 to have so many [again].\"\n\nTen Hag also revealed United are in close contact with Jadon Sancho during his loan spell at Borussia Dortmund but that the issue of his future has been postponed until the end of the season.\n\n\"We are close in that process,\" he said. \"We are visiting games not only [against Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday]. Not all the games but we have seen more games from Dortmund where Jadon was performing. We had a visit with him, we talk with him and we will keep going with this process.\"\n\nTen Hag and Sancho fell out, with the winger training with the youth team at Old Trafford after refusing to apologise for a tweet criticising the manager, and the Dutchman added: \"There was a conflict and let's first finish the season so stay away from this issue now it is not important.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelson_Fernandes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gelson Fernandes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Wilcox", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Wilcox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_&_Hove_Albion_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brighton & Hove Albion F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Youth system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadon_Sancho", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jadon Sancho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/05/11/GettyImages-2149551414.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538850", "eventUri": "eng-9538850", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

His work at Ajax and his debut season in England has been given more credence than the current injury-riddled campaign, in which Ten Hag also had to manage through a protracted takeover.'\n\nZinedine Zidane had also been one of the names on the shortlist to take over from Tuchel - who could still win the Champions League with Bayern Munich this season - but the Real Madrid and France legend has now ruled himself out.\n\nWhen asked by Sky Germany if he will be Bayern Munich boss in the future, Zidane replied: \"No. I'm going to watch the game, hopefully Real Madrid will win.\"", "source": {"uri": "football365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football News -"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_williams@football365.com", "name": "Joe Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinedine_Zidane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zinedine Zidane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Nagelsmann", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julian Nagelsmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralf_Rangnick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ralf Rangnick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bavaria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bavaria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allianz Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major_League_Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major League Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2x51gyc4ptf2q.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F05%2F06093531%2FMicrosoftTeams-image-608.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538850", "eventUri": "eng-9538850", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

With four games to go, United know they won't be in the Champions League next term, though they still have a shot at silverware with an FA Cup final repeat against Manchester City on the horizon.\n\nA big summer awaits for United, with part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe looking to make his mark in his first transfer window in charge. Recent form has sparked questions about whether Ten Hag will stick around to reap the rewards, though.\n\nThe 54-year-old has been linked with a summer return to Ajax, while outgoing Bayern Munich boss Thomas Tuchel is among those reportedly being considered to take his place. Former club captain Neville doesn't anticipate any change in the dugout, though.\n\n\"I thought he was very assured,\" Neville told Kelly Cates during a Sky Sports broadcast. \"Obviously everyone else around him has gone at senior management level - the CEO, the technical director's been shifted, the CFO's gone, the interim CEO, John Murtough's gone - so there's been a lot of change at the club.\"\n\nRatcliffe has already made significant changes behind the scenes, with Omar Berrada set to take over as CEO and Jason Wilcox brought in as technical director. Dan Ashworth is expected to follow, with the former Brighton transfer chief on gardening leave from his Newcastle role and expected to take the Magpies to arbitration.\n\nDespite the change, Neville recognised Ten Hag's calm exterior as the former Utrecht boss opened up on a variety of issues. One of those was the failure to land summer transfer targets including Harry Kane, and this didn't go unnoticed.\n\nWill Erik ten Hag still be at Manchester United next season? Have your say in the comments section\n\nGary Neville read into the United manager's demeanour\n\n\"I felt as though he was assured, he was very calm, but obviously he's been under quite a lot of pressure recently,\" Neville continued. \"He talked about how big the FA Cup fnal is in a few weeks, that's a season-defining game, but I think it's the most I've heard a Manchester United manager talk - while they're still in the job - about the players that they hadn't got for him that were really important to him.\n\n\"Obviously, Frenkie de Jong was mentioned, he alluded to Harry Kane and how important a signing that would have been. Manchester United's recruitment has not been as sufficient as it should be, and also [there's] the injuries he's had.\n\n\"He wasn't making excuses by any stretch, he knows the performance levels haven't been good enough. But he did point towards the fact that you talk about Manchester United's shots on their goal and he pointed towards the fact that last season they had the most clean sheets, and with the defence being decimated, particularly in the 30 different combinations in the back four, that that's harmed him and he's not been able to play quite the way he wanted.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

been turned down by former United boss Ralf Rangnick, who committed his future to the Austria national team.\n\nWith Tuchel leaving the club at the end of the season, there have been several rumours surrounding his potential replacement.\n\nNow, Sky Sports have reported that Bayern Munich's search for Tuchel's replacement has led them to the Man Utd manager.\n\nTen Hag has been heavily rumoured

News write that they understand that Bayern Munich have made contact with Ten Hag's agent, Kees Vos, to see if he would be open to the move.\n\nHowever, the report continues to state that no formal talks have been made but the Dutchman is aware of the interest.\n\nIt is also believed that Ten Hag has told his 'people' that his sole focus is on the job at hand in England, with his side in the FA Cup final.\n\nSky Sports continue to state that despite the turbulant season at Man United, Bayern's hierarchy believe Ten Hag's coaching has been hampered by a litany of off-field issues and a poor operational set-up.\n\nHis work at Ajax and first season at Old Trafford has interested the Bayern higher ups.\n\nBack in 2013, Ten Hag was employed by the Bundesliga giants as he spent three years coaching their second team.\n\nDuring his time with Bayern Munich II, Ten Hag led them to the Regionalliga Bayern.\n\nTuchel's side will be hoping to make it to the Champions League final after

The former Chelsea and Real Madrid boss spent two-and-a-half years at Old Trafford, overseeing proceedings between May 2016 and December 2018.\n\nDuring that time, the Portuguese chief drafted in a cluster of big-name players for big-money transfer fees, including Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku. Pogba returned to United in August 2016 for a club-record fee of \u00a389million.\n\nREAD MORE: Youngster included in United squad for Palace fixture\n\nREAD MORE: Three ways United could line up without Harry Maguire vs Palace\n\nHowever, Mourinho said he didn't receive the same level of backing during his tenure as Ten Hag has. United have spent north of \u00a3400m since Ten Hag was appointed in April 2022, including \u00a3179.2m on Andre Onana, Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund last summer.\n\nTen Hag has hit back at Mourinho's claim, insisting the Portuguese is the only United manager who has been supplied with the players he wanted since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.\n\n\"Apart from Mourinho, the manager didn't get the players they wanted, and that is what you need,\" Ten Hag told ESPN Brazil. \"I am confident we will achieve our goals, but it is a tough competition. It is not a two-horse race anymore.\n\n\"There are seven, eight [teams in the Premier League] who all go for the title, who all have very good squads. So if you want to go to the title, you have to construct that squad.\"\n\nUnited plan to be active again in this summer's window and have identified three areas they wish to strengthen as a priority: centre-back, central midfield and attack. The club, however, does plan to sign two centre-backs.\n\nHinting at what United will need to try and add to their squad this summer, Ten Hag, speaking at Thursday's press conference, said: \"Yes, that is one of the issues in constructing the squad where we have to improve, to do things better to construct a squad where we have more depth. I think the most important thing is to return players and to get them back.

(Luke) Shaw only 15 starts this season so far and (Tyrell) Malacia zero starts. Not even available.'\n\nMalacia has been out of action all season after twice undergoing knee surgery but was initially expected to return in January, placing the burden on Shaw.\n\n'Left back depends on availability from Luke Shaw,' Ten Hag added. 'He will be fit.\n\nTyrell Malacia has been unavailable for the entire campaign after two rounds of knee surgery\n\nMason Mount has struggled to make an impact in his first season at Old Trafford due to injury\n\n'He is returning already on the pitch, we expect him back in coming weeks. But with Malacia it depends on his availability.\n\n'I think every manager wants players with winning attitudes, great mentality, big personalities to perform under stress. That is what every manager is looking for. In this club, it is extremely important to perform under stress.'\n\nUnited are believed to want three significant signings this summer and Ten Hag, who is keen for two new centre backs, is hopeful of reinforcing his backline.\n\nThis could prove complicated, however. United may need to adopt a sell to buy policy and as a result, it has previously been reported that the club will consider offers for almost all of their squad - including forward Marcus Rashford.\n\nJust three players - Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo - are said to be safe from the axe, with United hoping to build for the future around them.\n\nAntony has been much maligned since joining from Ajax and has just one league goal this year\n\nHolding midfielder Casemiro could make way this summer as INEOS look for a big rebuild\n\nDespite a sluggish first half of the season, United did not sanction any moves for players in the January window - and this failure rankled the manager.\n\n'In the two (winter) windows, we didn't do almost no business,' Ten Hag said.\n\n'The first we loaned Wout Weghorst and Marcel Sabitzer, which were two good ones but in this winter we didn't do anything. We tried but it didn't happen.\n\n'It had to do with the budget and FFP (financial fair play).'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrell_Malacia", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrell Malacia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North London derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_De_Bruyne", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin De Bruyne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Garnacho", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Garnacho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason_Mount", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mason Mount"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casemiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casemiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wout_Weghorst", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wout Weghorst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Sabitzer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcel Sabitzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Financial_Fair_Play_Regulations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/06/08/84500909-0-image-m-13_1714981938561.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538850", "eventUri": "eng-9538850", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

But Erik ten Hag's interview in midweek should also act as a reminder to his new bosses at Manchester United...\n\nTen Hag's sit-down with Gary Neville, the former United captain, was frank, open and genuinely honest. The United manager even volunteering headlines to his unexpectant interviewer. He discussed missing out on Harry Kane. He dropped Frenkie de Jong's name as another United tried - and failed - to sign for him. And he laid out the need for the club to keep shopping at that level given supporter expectations.\n\nAnd as we say, the soundbites made news. Such transfer talk always does. But what was just as interesting - and encouraging for this column - was Ten Hag highlighting the cultural shift the club has undergone since he took charge almost two years ago.\n\nLast week, Tribalfootball.com's transfer expert Rudy Galetti offered us some information from his United sources about the motivations of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and all this squad overhauls and coaching changes. Ratcliffe and Ineos, it appears, have come in determined to make a clean break from the past. The players. The staff. The manager. They're all viewed as part of an era that Ratcliffe wants his version of United to get beyond. Hence, the management changes all around Ten Hag and the lack of denial over claims of massive player clearouts.\n\nBut as Ten Hag pointed out to Neville - and as we've highlighted right here - that much-needed change has been working through the club these past two years. The problem players are gone. Wiser choices are being made in the transfer market. And the club's youth system has been transformed - all under Ten Hag's watch.\n\n\"There is a game model here,\" stated the Dutchman. \"How do you think [Alejandro] Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo are able to come up? That's because it was one of my objectives from the previous leadership team to bring that in.\n\n\"It was already going, they were already improving he academy. You can see they won the FA Youth Cup, the academy teams are becoming champions and that is the structure that was laid out a couple of years ago.\n\n\"Now you see some revenues from it, and the best is by bringing players [into] the first team like Kobbie and Garnacho.\"\n\nGood for Ten Hag, mentioning the influence of John Murtough and Richard Arnold on what we're now witnessing on the Carrington youth pitches. Both men deserve credit for bringing through the changes which have reignited the club's academy production.\n\nAnd as we've stated in past columns, for the youth system, you can also highlight the changes inside the senior locker room. Again, the problem players have been pushed out. The leadership and professionalism has jumped up a notch. It's why Mainoo, Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund have been able to find their way as quickly as they have. The manager has been important. But the likes of Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro and Rapha Varane more so - which all three youngsters have attested to in various interviews.\n\n\"On one hand, we were quite confident we made the right choices (in the transfer market) and we can make the next step,\" stated Ten Hag. \"But all the injuries are coming and we made so many changes in some positions like the back four.\n\n\"We've now played 47 games and we had 30 combinations in the back four. They weren't from choices you make, they were forced choices because the players were injured... anyone with even a little bit of knowledge about football, they will know it will have a huge impact.\n\n\"But the fans want to see a successful team, a team that's winning. What we always try to do, and it's a compliment to the team, in every game, they went for it and they had a spirit.\"\n\nThe injuries at United are a reason for their inconsistency this season, not an excuse. With a settled XI we saw the potential of this team last season until Lisandro Martinez's metatarsal injury. This is really what Ratcliffe should be seeing now. There's no reason to reinvent the wheel. Good work has been done during the Ten Hag era. Positive change has been made.\n\nCan more be improved? Of course. But talk of mass clearouts and all players being transfer-listed does no-one any good. And as we've stated in past columns, that no-one connected to Ratcliffe pushes back on such stories simply isn't good enough. Indeed, in terms of United, Ratcliffe's approach in terms of media relations is a disaster.\n\nNeed proof? Just consider Fernandes' response to those reports that he was among senior players offers would be considered for this summer: \"Obviously, it doesn't just depend on me, does it?\n\n\"A player always has to want to be here, but at the same time, you have to want him to stay. At the moment, I feel there's that on both sides.\"\n\nThat the club captain and their best performer is forced to react to such reports is just ridiculous. Again, like his manager, Fernandes has been a positive force for United ever since he arrived.\n\nThe club is changing for the better. It has been for the past two years. As Ten Hag highlighted last week, there is no reason for United's new co-owner to rip things up and start again.", "source": {"uri": "tribalfootball.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "tribalfootball.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_beattie@tribalfootball.com", "name": "Chris Beattie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Garnacho", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Garnacho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gary Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siem_de_Jong", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siem de Jong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Youth system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Youth_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Youth Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrington,_Greater_Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carrington, Greater Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carrington, Greater Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casemiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casemiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelson_Fernandes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gelson Fernandes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapha\u00ebl_Varane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapha\u00ebl Varane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://images.tribalfootball.com/default/0001/13/thumb_12411_default_large.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538850", "eventUri": "eng-9538850", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The four months since Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos bought a little over a quarter of Manchester United have been the phoney war. No transfers could be done, so little could be changed on the pitch. The task of Ratcliffe and his advisers was to watch and learn and rejig the executive tier so that when the window opens they are ready to act.\n\nThat rejig has been more dramatic than many anticipated. The chief executive, Richard Arnold, and the football director, John Murtough, are just the highest profile departures. Omar Berrada will come in as chief executive from Manchester City when his notice period expires on 13 July while Murtough has effectively been replaced by Jason Wilcox, the new technical director, and Dan Ashworth, who will come in once the terms of his severance from Newcastle have been agreed.\n\nOther changes were announced on Tuesday in what feels like a general process of Ineos-ification, suggesting Ratcliffe may have a far bigger hand in the business side of United's operations than had been anticipated.\n\nThe biggest decision for the new regime is over Erik ten Hag. Although he is widely regarded as a dead man walking, the suggestion this week was that Ineos feel he has been let down by the broader management.\n\nTen Hag might also be about to pull off one of the most absurd FA Cup triumphs in history. He is not wrong when he talks about United being one of the most entertaining sides in the country, but even those who buy into the fallacy that football is a branch of showbusiness tend not to advocate throwing away comfortable leads against the likes of Newport and Coventry before winning through.\n\nThe 4-3 quarter-final victory over Liverpool stands out even in a season when United and Chelsea have been mixing brilliance and haplessness to unprecedented levels.\n\nBruno Fernandes ended up playing at centre-back, Antony at left-back. Liverpool, masters of chaos, should have been out of sight but found themselves out-chaosed, apparently befuddled by how often they were granted four-on-two breaks. Tactical discourse has been seized by the debate between positionism and relationism, but this was a bold step into a more distant future: no-relationism, just 11 players (eventually 10) scattered to create an unrepeatable harmony of discordance.\n\nIt would take something unexpected and deeply weird for United to beat Manchester City in the FA Cup final, but this entire run has been unexpected and deeply weird.\n\nBut the FA Cup did not save Louis van Gaal in 2016 and it may not save Ten Hag. This is not 1990. Last season Ten Hag seemed just the sort of tough, single-minded figure United needed. He managed to offload Cristiano Ronaldo and made the decision that David de Gea's inability to play out from the back was unsustainable.\n\nA third-place finish, a League Cup triumph and an FA Cup final seemed a decent base and, if a lot of United's wins had been edgy affairs nicked by a single goal, that at least appeared something to build on.\n\nThose single-goal victories have remained a feature: 12 of United's 16 league victories this season have been by one while nine have been secured by goals scored after the 75th minute. Very little has felt convincing. Ten Hag has apparently been broken by the job, transformed in the course of a year from ruthless revolutionary leader to fading general in his labyrinth, unable to direct the anarchy unfolding in front of him, blithely insisting that conceding 20 shots a game isn't a problem.\n\nIt's as though Ming the Merciless had become a hapless supply teacher trying to pretend that the curtains being set on fire was all part of the plan. \"We're the most enthusiastic class in the school!\" Can any manager restore their credibility after the high farce of the past few weeks?\n\nAnd what then? Once a manager, whether Ten Hag or a newcomer, has been settled on, what in this hotch-potch of a squad is worth salvaging? Reports have suggested United were open to offers for all but Kobbie Mainoo, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus H\u00f8jlund, which given their youth and potential makes sense.\n\nFernandes has played more key passes per game than anyone else in the Premier League this season and while his petulance isn't ideal, particularly not for a captain, that may be less pronounced in a better side. Diogo Dalot has had a quietly effective season on whichever flank he has been asked to occupy.\n\nBeyond that, it's hard to imagine too much protest if any of the current squad are sold. After a miserable season, even Marcus Rashford now seems expendable. Rapha\u00ebl Varane and Luke Shaw are let down too often by their bodies. Casemiro looks old. Ten Hag made clear last summer he would be happy to offload Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay.\n\nBut perhaps the most damning aspect of Ten Hag's management is the performance of the players he had a major influence over signing; for those he managed at Ajax or knew from the Eredivisie, he must bear prime responsibility.\n\nAndr\u00e9 Onana, after a difficult start, has settled to an extent, but his performance against Burnley - a brilliant save and a daft penalty conceded - was emblematic of his season. Lisandro Mart\u00ednez and Tyrell Malacia have spent much of the campaign injured. Antony occasionally flickers, but he has one Premier League goal this season and is wildly inconsistent and looks a long way from an \u00a386m player.\n\nThat, more than anything else, may be what persuades Ineos that Ten Hag is not the man to lead their future. But it's telling of United's progress since Sir Alex Ferguson retired that David Moyes was sacked 34 games into the 2013-14 season with United on 57 points, a couple of weeks after a Champions League quarter-final. With 34 games of this season gone, United are on 54 points and they went out of Europe before Christmas.\n\nModern football's financial stratification means United have not come close to the collapse they suffered 50 years ago when they were relegated, but this has been a lost decade. And that may not be easy to reverse.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_wilson@theguardian.com", "name": "Jonathan

United brought in Rasmus Hojlund from Atalanta instead, and the youngster has had a mixed season at Old Trafford. GIVEMESPORT looks at how United could have lined up this season had Ten Hag ended up with a lot of his top targets. GIVEMESPORT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nIt's safe to say that this season hasn't gone to plan for Manchester United and Erik ten Hag. United have struggled for form and results throughout the campaign, dropping out of the Champions League and Carabao Cup early on and also underperforming in the Premier League.\n\nWith some serious money spent last summer, expectations were high heading into the season, but while the Red Devils brought some top names through the door, they didn't quite land all of Ten Hag's first-choice targets. In fact, the team's line-up might look very, very different were they to have landed his top options and the team could be in a very different position to the one they're in right now.\n\nTen Hag conceded that he wanted United to sign Harry Kane but had to settle for Rasmus Hojlund. With that being said, let's have a look at how United's starting XI might look if the Dutchman had signed all of his first-choice transfer targets.\n\nUnited's possible line-up if Ten Hag had signed preferred targets\n\nGoalkeeper\n\nAndre Onana\n\nRight-back\n\nNoussair Mazraoui\n\nCentre-back\n\nRaphael Varane\n\nCentre-back\n\nJurrien Timber\n\nLeft-back\n\nLuke Shaw\n\nCentral midfield\n\nFrenkie de Jong\n\nCentral midfield\n\nBruno Fernandes\n\nCentral midfield\n\nMason Mount\n\nRight wing\n\nCody Gakpo\n\nLeft wing\n\nMarcus Rashford\n\nStriker\n\nHarry Kane\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Harry Kane has scored 43 goals for Bayern Munich this season - more than any Manchester United player has managed in a single season since Ruud van Nistelrooy scored 44 goals in 2002-03.\n\nAndre Onana Goalkeeper\n\nHaving worked together in the past at Ajax, Andre Onana was always likely to be one of Ten Hag's preferred options as a replacement for David de Gea, and he got his man for a cool \u00a347.5million.\n\nOnana struggled during his first few months in Manchester, making a series of high-profile errors, particularly in the Champions League group phase, but he recovered from a tricky start to establish himself as a reliable performer.\n\nOnana's form has dipped slightly of late, making a glaring mistake against Sheffield United and also giving away a penalty against Burnley, but overall Onana has had ane encouraging first season at Old Trafford.\n\nNoussair Mazraoui Right-back\n\nAnother former Ajax man that Ten Hag worked with in the past, Noussair Mazraoui was on the manager's radar last year. He spent several years playing under the Dutchman, and he was one of his first targets once he took charge at Old Trafford. Mazraoui was linked with the club for some time but eventually chose to join Bayern Munich instead.\n\nMazraoui has endured a stop-start season in Bavaria, missing chunks of the campaign through injury as well as international commitments. United right-back Diogo Dalot has been one of the team's best players so Ten Hag is unlikely to be losing any sleep over missing out on Mazraoui.\n\nRaphael Varane Centre-back\n\nReal Madrid legend Raphael Varane is United's most dependable defender when fit but he is injury prone and will likely leave the Old Trafford club when his contract expires at the end of the season. The France World Cup winner is on a bumper contract at United and getting him off the wage bill would free up funds to sign a replacement this summer.\n\nUnited have struggled for consistency at centre-back all season, with Lisandro Martinez also missing the vast majority of matches due to injury, and Victor Lindelof, Harry Maguire and Jonny Evans also absent for periods of the campaign.\n\nJurrien Timber Centre-back\n\nAnother former Ajax man that Ten Hag tried to take with him to Old Trafford, Jurrien Timber was firmly on the coach's radar last summer, and he made several attempts to bring him to England. The defender turned the move down, though, and decided to stay in the Eredivisie for a further year.\n\nTwelve months later he would move to the Premier League, but not to the Red Devils. He instead chose Arsenal and impressed in his early appearances for the club before he was ruled out with a long-term injury. Timber recently returned to action for Arsenal's Under-21s but he has not played for the senior team since last August.\n\nLuke Shaw Left-back\n\nAfter some shaky periods, Luke Shaw established himself as United's best left-back a few years after joining from Southampton in a bumper \u00a330million deal back in 2014. Shaw struggled for confidence under Jose Mourinho but thrived under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and continued his good form under Erik ten Hag after the Dutchman arrived from Ajax in the summer of 2022.\n\nUnfortunately for United and Shaw, the defender is prone to injuries and he has not played for United since February. England manager Gareth Southgate will hope the defender returns before the end of the season ahead of the European Championship in Germany.\n\nFrenkie de Jong Central midfield\n\nWouldn't you know it? Another former Ajax player wanted by United following Ten Hag's arrival. This time, it's Frenkie de Jong, who looked like he was destined to become a global superstar during his time in the Eredivisie. The Dutchman had left the club three years prior to his manager when he joined Barcelona in 2019, but the Blaugrana's financial problems saw him linked with a move away.\n\nUnited agreed a fee with Barcelona for De Jong in 2022 but the midfielder refused to leave over an issue with unpaid wages from Barca during the Covid-19 pandemic, and United eventually brought in Casemiro instead.\n\nBruno Fernandes Central midfield\n\nIt really can't be overstated just how good Bruno Fernandes has been since he joined United from Sporting Lisbon in January 2020. The Portuguese star has been sensational for the club and is one of few players in Ten Hag's squad who maintains a high level of intensity in every match that he plays in.\n\nAppointed club captain by his manager last summer after Harry Maguire was stripped of the armband, Fernandes is unlikely to leave Manchester any time soon, irrespective of who the manager is next season, and it would be wise for whoever that is to build the team around him.\n\nMason Mount Central midfield\n\nMount seemed like an opportunistic acquisition rather than a signing that suited United's biggest needs last summer. The England midfielder had just endured a injury-plagued season with Chelsea when United agreed to spend \u00a360million on him and the move has been a catastrophic failure so far, with Mount barely featuring for his new club owing to poor form, injuries and the remarkable emergence of teenager Kobbie Mainoo.\n\nMount has started just four times for United in the Premier League and seven times in total, and Red Devils fans will hope to see far more of the Chelsea academy product next season.\n\nCody Gakpo\n\nRight wing\n\nCody Gakpo was firmly on United's radar last season and Ten Hag was desperate to sign the forward. He was in talks too, and it seemed like the deal would be done. Unfortunately, Liverpool came calling and Gakpo decided to move to Anfield instead.\n\nLosing out on a target is never ideal, but watching them choose one of your main rivals in the process is so much worse. United will, however, be heartened by Gakpo's underwhelming showings at Liverpool. Gakpo has scored just six Premier League goals, but has at least been prolific in cup competitions, netting four times in both the Europa League and the EFL Cup.\n\nMarcus Rashford Left wing\n\nRashford's form this season has not been deserving of a starting berth for United for the vast majority of the season but it speaks volumes about their lack of quality in depth that Ten Hag does not feel confident playing other players ahead of him.\n\nThe England forward's first season playing under Ten Hag saw him net 30 goals in all competitions and there were serious calls for him to be considered for the Ballon d'Or at one stage. That was always fanciful given what Erling Haaland was doing across the city but it at least showed that he was doing plenty right - that has not been the case this time around and United are reportedly considering selling him if the right offer arrives.\n\nHarry Kane Striker\n\nHarry Kane has years of experience scoring goals for an underachieving team with Spurs so he would undoubtedly have had no problem finding the net at United, despite the lack of service Hojlund is accustomed to.\n\nKane is one of the best players in the world and as he turned 30 last summer it was important that he made a sensible career move that would give him the greatest chance of winning some silverware. That would not have been the case had he joined United in their current guise, and he could yet end his first season in Bavaria as a European champion.\n\nRelated What Jude Bellingham Told Harry Kane

We visit, I would not say all the games, but we have seen more games from Dortmund where Jadon was performing there.\n\n\"We also had a visit with him, we had a talk with him during his stay there and we will keep going with this process, we will continually be in contact and communicate with them.\"\n\nIt is understood that Matt Hargreaves, United's director of player negotiations, has visited Sancho in Germany, as did John Murtough before leaving his post as director of football.\n\nAfter signing for \u00a373 million from Dortmund in 2021, Sancho's best form since has been back on loan with his old club. Ex-United captain Rio Ferdinand described his eye-catching performance against Paris Saint-Germain last week as a \"joke\". \"He was shaking and baking top players. He's putting people on the floor,\" added Ferdinand.\n\nTen Hag says both parties will concentrate on their remaining games of the season before deciding the next steps.\n\n\"There was a conflict and let's first finish the season - he is not here now - so stay away from this issue now because it is not important,\" he said. \"He has the return of the semi-final, for them also in the league it is not going that well for them and we have four important games in the league and the FA Cup final so that is the issue and the focus point in this moment and then we will see in the summer what is going to happen.\"\n\nTen Hag, meanwhile, has discussed the implications of seeing two allies leave the club in Murtough and transfer negotiator Matt Judge. Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has taken control of football operations and brought in his own people behind the scenes.\n\n\"I don't think in dangers. I think in opportunities.

The Manchester United coach had pointed out that the injuries to key men Luke Shaw and Lisandro Martinez had stunted the effectiveness of his defensive setup, leading to the questionable displays which have become commonplace this season:\n\nThere's no doubt that Shaw and Martinez are vital to him. One, they can step into midfield with Casemiro when Manchester United are attacking and provide that extra bit of pace and aggression - and they're braver.\n\nThe one thing he said when I pushed him on style was that Manchester United last season had the most clean sheets in the Premier League playing the same way. Scoring goals was the problem.\n\nHe said, 'that's proof that my style can provide can provide good defensive stats.\n\nHowever, Jamie Carragher was quick to point out that the defensive frailties that have become prevalent this season were already evident during ten Hag's first campaign.\n\nBut when it went badly, it went badly wrong. You're talking about clean sheets but in terms of conceding goals you're thinking of six at City, seven at Liverpool, three at Aston Villa, four at Brentford.\n\nThough de Gea was indeed the golden glove winner in last year's Premier League, he was culpable in several heavy defeats, none more notable than the 7-0 capitulation at Anfield. That inconsistency was a hint of things to come this season.\n\nGary Neville was honest in agreeing that there were justifiable question marks about United's defensive setup, despite ten Hag's insistence on sticking to his guns.\n\nHe also noted the astonishing injury crisis the club have suffered this season, but said that even this did not excuse the shocking performances against the likes of Coventry and Sheffield United.\n\nOh yeah. The away record against big teams...they'd concede six or seven goals. But David de Gea won the golden glove and had the most clean sheets.\n\nIt was a case of, 'this style can work, it's the personnel that are in the style.'\n\nHe showed me that they've had 30 different combinations of back four - of course that's going to cause a problem. But I still think there are games where they should be doing a lot better. To be fair, I think he thinks that as well.\n\nErik ten Hag has confirmed that Luke Shaw and Lisandro Martinez are both expected to return before the end of the season, in what will be a major boost as Manchester United look to finish the campaign on a high.\n\nNonetheless, questions must be asked of the coach's style if it is so heavily dependent on only two players.", "source": {"uri": "balls.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.balls.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eoin_harrington@balls.ie", "name": "Eoin Harrington", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gary Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Carragher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casemiro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casemiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_de_Gea", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David de Gea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentford_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brentford F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coventry"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Coventry"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major_League_Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major League Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.resized.co/balls_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLmJhbGxzLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAyNFxcXC8wNVxcXC8wNDEwMjI0NlxcXC9VbnRpdGxlZC1kZXNpZ24tMjAyNC0wNS0wNFQxMDIxNTYuMDAwLnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjoxMjAwLFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6NjI3LFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuYmFsbHMuaWVcXFwvaW1hZ2VzXFxcL2JyYW5kLWltYWdlLmpwZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiI2YzQ1MTMxOTZiNjVhNDkxYTQyYWI3YTYyMTI1OWRiYTEwMDkzODFmIn0=/carragherpointsoutmajorflawfromin-deptheriktenhaginterviewballsie.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538850", "eventUri": "eng-9538850", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

They also reached the FA Cup final, losing narrowly to neighbourhood rivals Manchester City, and qualified for the Champions League thanks to a third-place Premier League finish.\n\nBut United haven't been able to kick on this season, despite spending a decent chunk of money on new signings, and Ten Hag's position as manager has repeatedly been called into question.\n\nThere is hope that INEOS' investment into the club will improve United's off the field activity, though it's not yet clear whether Ten Hag will be the manager backed by Sir Jim Ratcliffe to take the club forward.\n\nJudging by Ten Hag's latest comments, in an interview with Sky Sports, he appears confident that he'll be in charge next year, and calmly explained why he thinks United's struggles can be attributed to factors out of his control.\n\n\"Frustration [at the style of play not working] is not the right word because I'm a realistic man,\" he said. \"Last year when I came in, you make your adjustments but at the end of the day, it's about winning games. From last year, we found a way to make a very successful team.\n\n\"This year, we wanted to make the next step. We bought in a goalkeeper who can play out from the back, a dynamic midfielder in Mason Mount - who has been injured all season - and a goalscorer in Hojlund who is young and needed the time.\n\n\"On one hand, we were quite confident we made the right choices and we can make the next step. But all the injuries are coming and we made so many changes in some positions like the back four.\n\n\"We've now played 47 games and we had 30 combinations in the back four. They weren't from choices you make, they were forced choices because the players were injured... anyone with even a little bit of knowledge about football, they will know it will have a huge impact.\n\n\"Then Casemiro was injured for a long period.

They also reached the FA Cup final, losing narrowly to neighbourhood rivals Manchester City, and qualified for the Champions League thanks to a third-place Premier League finish.\n\nBut United haven't been able to kick on this season, despite spending a decent chunk of money on new signings, and Ten Hag's position as manager has repeatedly been called into question.\n\nThere is hope that INEOS' investment into the club will improve United's off the field activity, though it's not yet clear whether Ten Hag will be the manager backed by Sir Jim Ratcliffe to take the club forward.\n\nJudging by Ten Hag's latest comments, in an interview with Sky Sports, he appears confident that he'll be in charge next year, and calmly explained why he thinks United's struggles can be attributed to factors out of his control.\n\n\"Frustration [at the style of play not working] is not the right word because I'm a realistic man,\" he said. \"Last year when I came in, you make your adjustments but at the end of the day, it's about winning games. From last year, we found a way to make a very successful team.\n\n\"This year, we wanted to make the next step. We bought in a goalkeeper who can play out from the back, a dynamic midfielder in Mason Mount - who has been injured all season - and a goalscorer in Hojlund who is young and needed the time.\n\n\"On one hand, we were quite confident we made the right choices and we can make the next step. But all the injuries are coming and we made so many changes in some positions like the back four.\n\n\"We've now played 47 games and we had 30 combinations in the back four.

In fact, the one time United managed to field what could be their best XI was in the 4-3 win away to Wolves - probably United's best-attacking display of the season.\n\nThe injury issues have had a big impact and without them, the pressure may not be mounting on Ten Hag as much as it currently is. So, if United could have managed to go injury-free all season long what would have happened? Let's take a look.\n\nALSO READ: We 'sacked' Erik ten Hag as United boss to predict FA Cup final and Premier League finish\n\nEXCLUSIVE: United want three key signings with only four players not for sale\n\nUnited's 2023/24 season simulated with no injuries\n\nTo set up this simulation, we used Football Manager 2024 making sure each player who has spent time on the sidelines this season was fully fit. This is what happened.\n\nWith no injury issues, Martinez made the most appearances for United with Varane partnering the defender in 46 of United's games. A fully-fit Luke Shaw made 31 appearances while Casemiro was a regular, playing 47 times.\n\nUnited were better in attack, highlighted by Rasmus Hojlund's goal count with the striker managing 28 for the season. Alejandro Garnacho was the best-performing player at the club, averaging a rating of 7.46 per game.\n\nAt the end of the season, Football Manager 2024 put together an overall best United XI based on performances, statistics, and other metrics. This is what it looked like:\n\nFull United best XI: (4-2-3-1): Onana; Wan-Bissaka, Varane, Martinez, Shaw; Casemiro, Mainoo; Garnacho, Fernandes, Rashford; Hojlund.\n\nUnited's best XI was pretty self-explanatory, with the only questionable omission being Diogo Dalot who missed out to Aaron Wan-Bissaka at right-back. Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo made up the midfield pivot, while Garnacho starred down the right with Marcus Rashford on the left.\n\nTen Hag's side performed much better when not having to worry about injuries every week and were involved in a four-way race for the Premier League title. A massive collapse from Arsenal allowed all the teams in the top four a shot at the title, but three draws in United's final five games saw Ten Hag's side miss out and finish fourth.\n\nFive draws in their final five games saw Arsenal gift the title to Manchester City, with Pep Guardiola's side winning their final five to win the title on goal difference. If Liverpool hadn't drawn on the final day of the season, they would have won the league instead.\n\nIt was a similar story for United. If Ten Hag's side had won their last five games, they would have been crowned Premier League champions. Despite coming close to winning the league and putting in improved performances, United weren't able to win any trophies.\n\nA repeat of last season's Carabao Cup final unfolded as United faced Newcastle United at Wembley, but the Magpies got their revenge as they won 2-1. Ten Hag's side made it further in the Champions League as they were knocked out in the quarter-finals by Real Madrid, but their FA Cup journey ended much earlier, losing 2-0 to Reading in a shock fourth-round exit.\n\nFollow the MEN's United coverage on TikTok and YouTube, and subscribe to the Manchester is Red podcast", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

They wanted to get a deal wrapped up a fortnight ago, but the final agreement is still not there. The situation is 'worrying.'\"\n\nIn addition, two of the most famous Dutch football journalists, Mike Verweij and Valentijn Driessen, both believe that Potter has eyes for United and not the Eredivisie giants.\n\nVerweij told De Telegraaf (via Footballtransfers) that \"what bothers me about Potter, is that you hear and understand very clearly that he is suitable for Ajax. Okay, but he would rather go to another club.\"\n\nDriessen also asserted that \"I just get the strong feeling that he is almost using Ajax and now also Feyenoord to put pressure on Manchester United, for example, where he really wants to go. Is this the way to play it?\"\n\nThe former Chelsea coach is seen as one of the favourites for the Old Trafford job due to his close relationship with incoming sporting director Dan Ashworth.\n\nHowever, with United not potentially sacking Ten Hag until at least after the FA Cup final, perhaps Potter is playing a dangerous game and may miss out on the chance of coaching one of Europe's most famous clubs for the false promise of a job at the Theatre of Dreams that may never come.", "source": {"uri": "thepeoplesperson.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Peoples Person | MUFC News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_browne@thepeoplesperson.com", "name": "Alex Browne", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Potter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graham Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Telegraaf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "De Telegraaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fencing/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fencing/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.thepeoplesperson.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/graham-potter-chelsea-fc-v-aston-villa-premier-league-min.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538850", "eventUri": "eng-9538850", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Asked specifically if he will take over at Bayern, Zidane told Sky Germany: \"No.\n\n\"I am going to watch the game [the second leg of Bayern's Champions League semi-final against Real]. I hope Madrid wins but it is going to be a difficult and complicated match.\"\n\nZidane's comments will come as a boost to United, with French outlet L'Equipe reporting last month that he was interested in potentially replacing Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford. Ten Hag's future remains in doubt after a disappointing second season in charge.\n\nUnited crashed out of the Champions League in the group stages and have already failed to qualify for next season's tournament, with the Red Devils sat 13 points off the top four. New co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has already begun to ring the changes after taking full control of football operations and he is yet to give Ten Hag his public backing.\n\nHowever, the Dutchman remains confident he will still be in charge next season, despite the departures of key allies John Murtough and Richard Arnold. When asked if Murtough and Arnold leaving the club had left him feeling exposed, Ten Hag replied: \"No, I don't have that feeling.\n\nUnited boss Erik ten Hag is under pressure\n\n\"I work well with them, we are aligned, we communicate every day. There are already new people in a new structure and we communicate on a daily basis. I don't think in [terms of] danger.\n\n\"I think in opportunities. I never think in problems, I think 'how do we solve those problems or avoid them?'\" And he is already planning for the upcoming transfer window, having struggled with injury problems this season.\n\n\"Yes, that is one of the issues in constructing the squad where we have to improve, to do things better,\" he said. \"To construct a squad where we have more depth.

Eight months on and the two sides prepare to meet once again, this time at Old Trafford on Sunday with so much on the line for the Gunners.\n\nArsenal know a win will guarantee that the title race will indeed go to the final match of the season whilst their rivals Manchester City still have three games to play knowing if they pick up maximum points the title is theirs yet again. Interestingly, Ten Hag has seemingly struggled to forget the clash back in September and has referenced the offside Alejandro Garnacho goal and Rasmus Hojlund's arguable penalty in what could be double figures in terms of interviews and press conferences.\n\nAfter the game Ten Hag told BBC Sport: \"I think we deserved to win this game but you don't always get what you deserve.\" The statistics, eye test and analysis would say differently.\n\nIn February, again unprovoked, the Dutch coach brought up the fact he believes his side should have beat the Gunners. \"I think we can beat any opponent,\" he said.\n\n\"Away or home. Sometimes away, we have to believe more. We could have won in Arsenal. We actually deserved that win.\"\n\nThen in March, he brought up the game again after they beat Liverpool. \"It could be,\" Ten Hag said when asked if the derby win would be a turning point.\n\nREAD MORE: Triple Arsenal title boost hope remains as Man City face unlikely Premier League challenge\n\nREAD MORE: What Ben White did at corners against Bournemouth as Arsenal advice takes effect\n\n\"But we have missed so many opportunities. For instance, at Arsenal, was it the fourth game of the season? We should have had a penalty for a foul on Rasmus Hojlund.\"\n\nThese are but a sample of the entire collection of mentions and references that Ten Hag has made, clearly affected by the result from early on in the campaign. From an Arsenal perspective, they can put to bed any suggestions of there being some superiority that is not represented by the table.\n\nSpeaking to Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard after the 3-0 win over Bournemouth this weekend, football.london asked if the persistent name checks Ten Hag has made to the Gunners was any additional motivation for the trip. \"Honestly, no,\" the Norwegian said. \"I don't think so.\n\n\"It's like any other game we are playing for at the moment. I don't think we need any extra motivation at the moment.\n\n\"I think there is enough there. We know what we are playing for. We know the task. We have to win every game and that is what we are going to try to do.\"\n\nNow, Mikel Arteta has often used narratives to provide something of a metaphorical kick to his side. Using Ivan Toney's tweet for instance which was revealed during Amazon's All or Nothing documentary covering the 2021/22 season. It seems that Ten Hag presents the perfect opportunity for some inspiration despite the club's captain stating otherwise.", "source": {"uri": "football.london", "dataType": "news", "title": "footballlondon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_canton@football.london", "name": "Tom Canton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Garnacho", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Garnacho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_White_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben White (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bournemouth", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bournemouth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bournemouth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Toney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ivan Toney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i2-prod.football.london/incoming/article29116980.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Martin-Odegaard-Ten-Hag-Manchester-United-vs-Arsenal.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538850", "eventUri": "eng-9538850", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

They were second best across the pitch and Palace could and should have won more comfortably.\n\nMichael Olise made look Casemiro look silly in the 13th minute before striding forward, unchallenged, to open the scoring. Jean-Philippe Mateta made it 2-0 five minutes before the break when Jonny Evans, 36, was exposed.\n\nTyrick Mitchell added a third after 58 minutes before Olise scored his second stunning goal of the evening eight minutes later.\n\nThere is much to ponder for Ten Hag and INEOS, now in charge of the football operations at United, heading into the summer.\n\nThe Athletic analyses another depressing match for United.\n\nJonny Evans and Casemiro became United's 14th centre-back pairing of the Premier League season. Evans only returned to training last week after recovering from a short-term muscle injury and started the game in central defence alongside Casemiro, dropping back from his usual midfield position.\n\nHarry Maguire sustained a muscle injury in training last week and is expected to be out for the rest of the Premier League campaign, and his absence was notable.\n\nIt took all of 13 minutes for Crystal Palace to exploit Ten Hag's make-shift defence, with Olise skipping past Casemiro, who lunged in and was left on the floor, before opening the scoring.\n\nShortly before half-time, it was Evans' turn to be the victim of another Palace attack as Mateta skipped past him before doubling the home team's lead.\n\nThe inconsistency at the back this season is in stark contrast to last year, with Ten Hag only needing six different centre-back partnerships on the club's way to keeping 18 top-flight clean sheets, which was more than any other team.\n\nLisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane started 16 times in 2022-23. United's most prolific partnership this campaign is Evans and Varane, who have played next to each other six times.\n\nUnited have now conceded 81 goals in all competitions, which is the most they have shipped since the 1976-77 season.\n\nThis defeat was United's 13th loss of the Premier League season, which is a record. It is also the first time Crystal Palace have completed the double over United in the league.\n\nThey lost 12 league games during the 2013-14 campaign, their first of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, which started with David Moyes in charge and ended with Ryan Giggs taking over after Moyes was dismissed.\n\nThat record was matched in 2021-22, which saw Ole Gunnar Solskjaer sacked and Ralf Rangnick arriving on an interim basis.\n\nHowever, it has now been beaten by Ten Hag, who will no doubt point to the injuries United have sustained as a reason for their struggles, but it is a damning indictment on a season that has failed to deliver Champions League qualification.\n\nUnited still need to play Arsenal and Newcastle United at Old Trafford before travelling to Brighton & Hove Albion, so there is every chance they extend the record beyond 13 defeats.\n\nWith every defeat United suffer between now and the end of the season, the pressure on Ten Hag is only going to increase.\n\nIn a season littered with low moments, they somehow managed to reach a new low with their performance at Selhurst Park -- but it can still get worse. The prospect of playing Manchester City in the FA Cup final on May 25 is not an exciting one.\n\nSir Jim Ratcliffe, United's new co-owner, has a decision to make in the summer when it comes to Ten Hag, and the Dutchman is not doing himself any favours when it comes to putting his case to stay forward.\n\nAs Olise scored his second of the match and Palace's fourth of the night, United's manager just stood there, hands in his pockets, and shook his head. It was a look of resignation.\n\nUnited were out-thought, out-fought and humiliated by a team in the bottom half of the Premier League table. Jean-Claude Blanc, United's interim CEO, was at Selhurst Park and will no doubt report back to Ratcliffe about the shambolic performance he witnessed.\n\nIf it was not so close to the season ending, it would be fair to speculate on whether any United manager would survive this run of form.\n\nTime must surely be ticking on Ten Hag's tenure in charge at Old Trafford.\n\nWe will bring you this after he has spoken at the post-match press conference.\n\nSunday, May 12: Arsenal (H), Premier League, 4.30pm BST, 11.30am ET\n\nHistorically, this Premier League fixture has usually seen two title favourites going head to head in a combustible clash. But these days, only the north Londoners are hoping to boost their title hopes.\n\nDespite United losing the reverse fixture at the Emirates -- two goals in added time saw the home side to a 3-1 win -- they have an excellent record against Arsenal at Old Trafford, winning 18 out of 31 matches, drawing 9 and losing only four times.\n\nDespite the speculation surrounding Marcus Rashford, don't be surprised to see him on the scoresheet. The Englishman has scored four Premier League goals against Arsenal at Old Trafford, with only Wayne Rooney (six) registering more.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The blame could be pointed at training methods and how the staff are conditioning the players between games, but it's genuinely been freakish just how many injury setbacks the club have faced.\n\nHeaviest hit ahead of the trip to Palace is Ten Hag's backline, but it's in almost every area that there's concerns.\n\nThe good news is that goalkeeper Andre Onana, who has been ridiculously overworked in terms of shot-stopping, is absolutely fine and he'll be starting between the sticks.\n\nThe bad news is that Harry Maguire, Raphael Varane, Victor Lindelof, Lisandro Martinez, Willy Kambwala, Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia all have injuries, essentially ripping out the entirety of United's defence.\n\nJonny Evans isn't fully fit either, but may be thrown in at the deep end, and United's south London jaunt will almost certainly see Casemiro deployed once more as an emergency centre-back.\n\nThe news isn't so bad in midfield, particularly now that Mason Mount is operational again after months on the sidelines.\n\nThere were concerns earlier in the week over the fitness of captain Bruno Fernandes (wrist) and also Scott McTominay, but the former is expected to lead United out as normal. Ordinarily, McTominay may have been given a little more time to recover from his recent knock, but Casemiro's deployment in the backline means Kobbie Mainoo needs a hard-working partner in central midfield from the off.\n\nIn a surprise to absolutely nobody, Anthony Martial, whose United career is winding down with a whimper, is not fully fit because of a groin problem.

His side take on Crystal Palace without a number of their first-choice defenders as he seeks makeshift solutions with Casemiro filling in at centre-half at Selhurst Park.\n\nThe likes of Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw have barely featured this term due to injury, which has impacted on United's season, while Harry Maguire has suffered another setback. The team will miss out on the top four and Champions League football having continually underwhelmed amid the changes at board level.\n\nSir Jim Ratcliffe has come in as a minority owner and begun making sweeping moves off the pitch. He is expected to aid the club's recruitment this summer and Young, a former captain at Old Trafford, insists they should have players capable of stepping up.\n\nHe said on Sky Sports: \"I think you have to factor that in. Their left-sided players they have not got in their team, you are changing personnel. Like I say, the club of this size there should be players ready to come in and take those positions. Of course, there are a lot of games that those players have been missing for.\n\n\"But that is where you have the size of the squad you have got. You are a world class club that you can have the players to come in and take those roles. But right now, the absentees that they have had, it's been a massive loss for them.\"\n\nTen Hag's own future is the subject of questioning as United's results decline in his second season. The Dutchman has often pointed to the amount of injuries as a major issues, insisting that his coaching methods have proved successful with a fully fit squad.\n\nManchester United's back-line has been tormented by injuries\n\nShould the Dutchman remain as the club's manager he will be part of a new era. Ten Hag has been asked previously if he thought the club's problems this year would result in more signings than usual this summer he said: \"I'm not sure. But I think the most important thing is to get players back. In many positions we created depth and now, in some positions, we don't have any choices, for instance the left-back position.\n\n\"Luke Shaw has had only 15 starts this season so far and Tyrell Malacia zero starts - not even available. For over 10 years I've been managing and I never had this experience, so many huge injury issues, but I trust in all of my experience. It can happen once in 10 years, hopefully now I have to wait another 10 to have so many injuries to deal with.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

For Manchester United, the failure to secure the signature of Frenkie de Jong from Barcelona in 2022 stands out as a significant moment. Erik ten Hag, the current manager of United, recently revealed the club's unsuccessful attempts to sign the Dutch midfielder, shedding light on what could have been a transformative acquisition.\n\nErik ten Hag, who had previously managed De Jong while together at Ajax, disclosed the Red Devils' pursuit of the talented midfielder. Despite their efforts, United's attempts to lure De Jong away from Barcelona proved futile. The midfielder's pivotal role in Ten Hag's possession-based style of play at Ajax hinted at the potential impact his arrival could have had at Old Trafford.\n\nThe Impact of De Jong's Absence\n\nTen Hag's revelation highlights the significance of De Jong's absence in Manchester United's midfield setup. The Dutch manager emphasized how De Jong's presence alongside Casemiro could have transformed United's playing style, aligning it more closely with the possession-oriented approach synonymous with Ajax.\n\nTen Hag conveyed his vision for United's midfield, telling Gary Neville in an interview with Sky Sports: \"It would have been Frenkie de Jong and Casemiro [in midfield]. They would really be connected with each other. They would be really complementary to each other. That's a typical player, if you want to play the Ajax style, you need that type of player.\"\n\nThe Dutch midfielder's ability to dictate the game's tempo and adeptness at retaining possession could have provided United with a vital cog in their midfield engine. His technical prowess and tactical intelligence could have facilitated smoother transitions from defense to attack, enhancing United's ability to control games and break down stubborn opposition defenses.\n\nThe Road Ahead for Manchester United\n\nAs Manchester United navigates through a challenging season, questions loom over Erik ten Hag's future at the club. With the FA Cup final against Manchester City looming large, the outcome of this crucial fixture could have significant implications for Ten Hag's tenure. The Red Devils' pursuit of a top-four finish in the Premier League adds further pressure, with each match carrying immense importance.\n\nThe revelation of Manchester United's failed attempt to sign Frenkie de Jong underscores the complexities of the transfer market and the ramifications of missed opportunities. While the Dutch midfielder's arrival could have provided a catalyst for tactical evolution at Old Trafford, the reality of the situation leaves United grappling with the consequences of their inability to secure his services. As the club looks ahead to future challenges, the lessons learned from this episode may serve as valuable insights in their quest for success.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fahad_hamid@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Fahad Hamid", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenkie_de_Jong", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frenkie de Jong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_de_Jong", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigel de Jong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casemiro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Casemiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gary Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Allies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Allies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Manchester-United-news-Erik-ten-Hag-finally-reveals-truth-on-Frenkie-de-Jongs-transfer.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538850", "eventUri": "eng-9538850", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1}

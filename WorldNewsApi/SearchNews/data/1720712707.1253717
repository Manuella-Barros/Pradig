Parshottam Rupala, it seems, is being punished for the controversial remarks during the election campaign, which, according to experts, cost the BJP seats in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.Smriti Irani, who was a part of the Modi 1.0 and 2.0 Cabinets, lost to Kishori Lal Sharma, a Congress loyalist from Amethi, by more than 1.6 lakh votes. She defeated Rahul Gandhi in his family bastion in 2019 after losing to him in 2014.Who gets which ministry in Modi 3.0? Form your 'Dream Cabinet' and win prizes.link__elec{padding:0 0 12px} .link__elec div{margin-bottom:7px;}.link__elec a{color: var(--linkcolor); text-decoration: underline;font-size:18px; line-height:24px; font-weight:600;} There was voter anger against Smriti Irani in Amethi, according to reports.During the first term of the Modi government, the actor-turned-politician held the portfolios of Human Resource Development, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and Ministry of Textiles. In the second term, she was the Women and Child Development Minister and also held the Ministry of Minority Affairs.Anurag Thakur, who defeated Congress's Satpal Raizada by over 1.8 lakh votes in Hamipur in Himachal Pradesh, is also not a part of the Modi 3.0 Cabinet. Thakur was the Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports and Minister for Information and Broadcasting in the second term of the Modi government. He is likely to be given a major organisational role within the BJP, according to sources.Thakur has been an MP from Hamirpur since 2008.Parshottam Rupala, the BJP leader who won from Rajkot in Gujarat, is not a part of the new Cabinet headed by the NDA government. He defeated Congress's Dhanani Paresh by over 4.8 lakh votes.However, his victory couldn't compensate for the several seats that the BJP lost in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan because of Rupala's controversial remarks on Kshatriyas.In fact, the BJP losing one of the 26 Lok Sabha seats in Gujarat is being attributed to Rupala's remarks. In 2019, the BJP made a clean sweep of Gujarat, winning all the seats.Rupala served as the Minister of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying in Modi 2.0 Cabinet. He was also the Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare.The BJP leader from Gujarat, Modi's home state, was also a part of Modi 1.0 ministry as the Minister of State for Panchayati Raj.He might be accommodated in Gujarat's party organisational structure as Gujarat BJP President CR Patil is joining the Modi 3.0 ministry.On March 22, Rupala stoked a row at a Dalit event when he said the erstwhile 'maharajas' broke bread with the British and also married off their daughters to them. The video went viral, inviting the wrath of various Kshatriya organisations and the Rajputs, who are descendants of erstwhile royal or princely families in Saurashtra, a region in Gujarat.Rajeev Chandrashekar, who was a part of the Modi 2.0 Cabinet, also missed out on a berth this time. He lost to Congress's Shashi Tharoor from Thiruvananthapuram in a closely fought election.Chandrasekhar served as the Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology and Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship in the second term of the BJP-led Centre.In a tweet, Chandrasekhar said his 18-year-old stint as an MP and three years as a Minister of State in the Council of Ministers came to an end today.The BJP leader clarified that a young intern who wrote the tweet had \"created confusion\" about his future course of action in a previously deleted tweet. The NDA, helped by its allies, including TDP's N Chandrababu Naidu and JD(U)'s Nitish Kumar, managed to cross the majority mark of 272 and secured 293 seats. The BJP won 240 seats after enjoying two full tenures of having a majority on its own.On the other hand, the INDIA bloc defied predictions and put up a strong show and won 234 seats. The Congress, the largest constituent of the INDIA bloc, grabbed 99 seats, its best performance in the last 10 years.Published By: Prateek ChakrabortyPublished On: Jun 9, 2024ALSO READ | What Narendra Modi said to council of ministers in last meeting of NDA 2.0ALSO READ | Speaker, Cabinet berths: BJP's NDA allies seek plum posts in Modi 3.0Must Watch", "summary": "<a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/smriti-irani-anurag-thakur-rajeev-chandrasekhar-not-part-of-modi-30-cabinet-2550983-2024-06-09\"> <img align=\"left\" hspace=\"2\" height=\"180\" width=\"305\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/indiatoday/resources/img/default-690x413.png\"> </a> Smriti Irani among ministers dropped from Modi 3.0, Rupala punished", "url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/smriti-irani-anurag-thakur-rajeev-chandrasekhar-not-part-of-modi-30-cabinet-2550983-2024-06-09", "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/indiatoday/resources/img/default-690x413.png?size=1280:720", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:41:38", "author": "Prateek Chakraborty", "authors": ["Prateek Chakraborty"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.209}

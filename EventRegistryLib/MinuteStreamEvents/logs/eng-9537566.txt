Repeatedly, Austin City Council has cared more about virtue signaling than the health and safety of its citizens,\" Mary Elizabeth Castle, director of Government Relations for Texas Values, told The Epoch Times via email.\n\nMs. Castle said: \"the resolution by its nature does not address the specific enforcement of law and instead directs entities like the local police department and the district attorney, who were not given enforcement power by SB 14, to ignore the law. The resolution is mostly a shell game to make it seem like Austin City Council will not comply with the law.\"\n\nIn previous years, Ms. Castle said the ACC's measures with pro-life laws and defunding the police have directed law enforcement to \"either ignore complaints regarding laws on social issues they do not agree with or push them to the bottom of the stack.\n\n\"Today's action signals to the larger Austin community that sex change operations for kids are no big deal, when in fact transitioning a child can be deadly and dangerous,\" said Ms. Castle.\n\nA new long-term study out of the Netherlands found many adolescents who have doubts about their identity and gender identity grow out of it. The study also found it is normal to have doubts about one's identity and it is actually relatively common.\n\nIn 2023, Mr. Abbott signed SB 14 into law. The law prohibits any physician or health care provider from \"transitioning a child's biological sex as determined by the sex organs, chromosomes, and endogenous profiles of the child or affirming the child 's perception of the child 's sex if that perception is inconsistent with the child 's biological sex.\"\n\nThe law prohibits doctors from performing numerous procedures on minors as part of gender transitioning including castration, hysterectomy, metoidioplasty, orchiectomy, among others.\n\nPrescription drugs associated with transitioning such as puberty blockers and supraphysiologic doses of testosterone to females or estrogen to males were also prohibited in Texas.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [],

Repeatedly, Austin City Council has cared more about virtue signaling than the health and safety of its citizens,\" Mary Elizabeth Castle, director of Government Relations for Texas Values, told The Epoch Times via email.\n\nMs. Castle said: \"the resolution by its nature does not address the specific enforcement of law and instead directs entities like the local police department and the district attorney, who were not given enforcement power by SB 14, to ignore the law. The resolution is mostly a shell game to make it seem like Austin City Council will not comply with the law.\"\n\nIn previous years, Ms. Castle said the ACC's measures with pro-life laws and defunding the police have directed law enforcement to \"either ignore complaints regarding laws on social issues they do not agree with or push them to the bottom of the stack.\n\n\"Today's action signals to the larger Austin community that sex change operations for kids are no big deal, when in fact transitioning a child can be deadly and dangerous,\" said Ms. Castle.\n\nA new long-term study out of the Netherlands found many adolescents who have doubts about their identity and gender identity grow out of it. The study also found it is normal to have doubts about one's identity and it is actually relatively common.\n\nIn 2023, Mr. Abbott signed SB 14 into law. The law prohibits any physician or health care provider from \"transitioning a child's biological sex as determined by the sex organs, chromosomes, and endogenous profiles of the child or affirming the child 's perception of the child 's sex if that perception is inconsistent with the child 's biological sex.\"\n\nThe law prohibits doctors from performing numerous procedures on minors as part of gender transitioning including castration, hysterectomy, metoidioplasty, orchiectomy, among others.\n\nPrescription drugs associated with transitioning such as puberty blockers and supraphysiologic doses of testosterone to females or estrogen to males were also prohibited in Texas.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_City_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Austin City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor of Science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Paxton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ken Paxton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-affirming_surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gender-affirming surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Coast Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "City manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-binary gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_hormone_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transgender hormone therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epoch Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evidence-based medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Board_of_Supervisors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Board of Supervisors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invasive species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prohibition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty_blocker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puberty blocker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Disabilities", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Disabilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-05/230904115640-ken-paxton-052623-file_jpg_92.jpg?itok=GkfUDFNt", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537566", "eventUri": "eng-9537566", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

The new resolution would seem to be a direct attack on Texas law, specifically SB 14, a law passed last year that forbids certain such treatments in the state.\n\nThe law, which passed with bipartisan support, puts an end to children receiving puberty blockers or hormone treatments, as well as mastectomies for girls and so-called \"bottom\" surgery, which includes castration and vasectomy for boys and hysterectomy for girls. The city resolution calls for no city funds or personnel to be used to investigate or prosecute transgendered individuals or their healthcare providers.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton called the resolution \"nonsensical\" and \"an empty political statement.\"\n\n\"On May 2, 2024, the Austin City Council passed a resolution that purportedly directs the City Manager and city employees not to comply with Texas's prohibition of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and invasive surgeries for children who believe their gender is different than their biological sex,\" Paxton said in a statement. \"Riddled with problems, the resolution starts with the falsehood that such prohibited treatments have 'proven to be evidence based, medically necessary, and lifesaving.' In addition to a growing body of medical research rejecting such claims, Texas concluded that the proposed treatments for minors are dangerous, and banned the practices by passing SB 14.\"\n\n\"Further, the resolution is no more than an empty political statement. Each clause directing the City Manager to defy SB 14 is prefaced with the nonsensical qualification, 'except to the extent required by law.' In other words, the Austin City Council would order the City Manager and city employees to follow the law while pretending to say the exact opposite,\" he concluded.\n\nMayor Kirk Watson answered in a statement of his own: \"Attorney General Paxton is accusing the City of Austin of refusing to follow state law while simultaneously dismissing the resolution as an 'empty political statement,'\" Watson said. \"The Austin City Council isn't flouting state law. We're doing what the state and our residents want us to do -- prioritizing public safety and [the] basic needs of all Austinites.\"\n\nAccording to Watson, the resolution is more about the correct allocation of city resources than aligning with far-left values regarding transgenderism.\n\n\"This is about priorities. For example, we want our limited city resources focused on things like responding quickly to 911 calls and other important services rather than targeting transgender individuals seeking healthcare,\" Watson said.\n\nEven so, Paxton promised that the law would be followed: \"If the City of Austin refuses to follow the law and protect children, my office will consider every possible response to ensure compliance. Texas municipalities do not have the authority to pick and choose which state laws they will or will not abide by. The people of Texas have spoken, and Austin City Council must listen.\"\n\nThe author of the resolution, Chito Vela, decried what he referred to as \"intimidation tactics\" from supporters of the law.\n\n\"Trans people deserve the right to self determination,\" Vela said. \"Our state has forced them and their medical providers into hiding, and that is wrong. Austinites do not prioritize criminal enforcement of rules that limit medical decisions made between families and their doctors, whether that's the decision to terminate a pregnancy or how to treat a child struggling with gender dysphoria.\"\n\nOf course, when those \"trans people\" are adults, they can choose whatever they like. SB 14 does not criminalize such treatments for adults, only for children.\n\nThe one council member who voted against the resolution noted that it could open the city up to lawsuits.\n\n\"The State of Texas has enacted laws that, regardless of personal opinions, have passed through the lawful, democratic process, and represent the legislative will of Texans,\" said Mackenzie Kelly. \"City attempts to undermine state law [expose] the City to legal risk, [and] often result in frivolous and costly lawsuits that divert resources from critical services.

In addition to a growing body of medical research rejecting such claims, Texas concluded that the proposed treatments for minors are dangerous, and banned the practices by passing SB 14,\" Mr. Paxton said.\n\nThe attorney general said his office stands ready to ensure that Austin obeys state law.\n\n\"If the City of Austin refuses to follow the law and protect children, my office will consider every possible response to ensure compliance,\" Mr. Paxton said. \"Texas municipalities do not have the authority to pick and choose which state laws they will or will not abide by. The people of Texas have spoken, and the Austin City Council must listen.\"\n\nThe resolution was introduced by Council Member Chito Vela, who represents District 4. It was co-sponsored by four other council members -- Ryan Alter, Zo Qadri, Jose\u0301 Vela\u0301squez, and Vanessa Fuentes.\n\nThe one no vote was Council Member Mackenzie Kelly of District 6.\n\n\"Except to the extent required by law, it is the policy of the City that no City personnel, funds, or resources shall be used to investigate, criminally prosecute, or impose administrative penalties upon: (1) a transgender or nonbinary individual for seeking healthcare, or (2) an individual or organization for providing or assisting with the provision of healthcare to a transgender or nonbinary individual,\" the resolution states.\n\nIt also directs Austin police to make enforcement of SB 14 their lowest priority.\n\nAccording to Mr. Paxton, the resolution is nothing more than an \"empty political statement\" citing that each clause in the resolution directs the city manager to defy SB 14 with the qualifying statement \"except to the extent required by law.\" He said the ACC would order the city manager and employees to follow the law while pretending to say the opposite.\n\n\"The vote by the Austin City Council today to support sex change operations for kids is infuriating but comes at no surprise. Repeatedly, Austin City Council has cared more about virtue signaling than the health and safety of its citizens,\" Mary Elizabeth Castle, director of Government Relations for Texas Values, told The Epoch Times via email.\n\nMs. Castle said: \"the resolution by its nature does not address the specific enforcement of law and instead directs entities like the local police department and the district attorney, who were not given enforcement power by SB 14, to ignore the law. The resolution is mostly a shell game to make it seem like Austin City Council will not comply with the law.\"\n\nIn previous years, Ms. Castle said the ACC's measures with pro-life laws and defunding the police have directed law enforcement to \"either ignore complaints regarding laws on social issues they do not agree with or push them to the bottom of the stack.\n\n\"Today's action signals to the larger Austin community that sex change operations for kids are no big deal, when in fact transitioning a child can be deadly and dangerous,\" said Ms. Castle.\n\nIn 2023, Mr. Abbott signed SB 14 into law. The law prohibits any physician or health care provider from \"transitioning a child's biological sex as determined by the sex organs, chromosomes, and endogenous profiles of the child or affirming the child 's perception of the child 's sex if that perception is inconsistent with the child 's biological sex.\"\n\nThe law prohibits doctors from performing numerous procedures on minors as part of gender transitioning including castration, hysterectomy, metoidioplasty, orchiectomy, among others.\n\nPrescription drugs associated with transitioning such as puberty blockers and supraphysiologic doses of testosterone to females or estrogen to males were also prohibited in Texas.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_City_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Austin City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor of Science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Paxton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ken Paxton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Coast Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "City manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-affirming_surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender-affirming surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-binary gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_hormone_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transgender hormone therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prohibition in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evidence-based medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Board_of_Supervisors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Board of Supervisors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invasive species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty_blocker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puberty blocker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Licensing_and_Regulations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Licensing and Regulations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/05/03/id5642725-GettyImages-1058136864-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537566", "eventUri": "eng-9537566", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

But fans are left wondering where Sanjay Dutt and Sonakshi Sinha are as Son of Sardaar 2 returns after a 12-year hiatus, as they were conspicuously missing from the most recent shooting video. The announcement of the film's commencement was made by Ajay Devgn, marking the start of a new chapter. Let's take a closer look at what makes this video special and why the film is garnering attention.\n\nAjay Devgn's Announcement\n\nWith the words, \"The journey of Son of Sardaar 2 begins with prayers, blessings, and a wonderful team,\" Ajay Devgn posted the video on social media. This marks the formal announcement of the film's production. Additionally, rumours indicate that Ravi Kishan will play Sanjay Dutt's role in the follow-up.\n\nA New Addition: Mrunal Thakur\n\nWith Mrunal Thakur joining the cast, Son of Sardaar 2 filming has resumed after a 12-year break. Fans are thrilled to watch her playing the dhol in the video, as she appears to be having fun. Sonakshi Sinha and Sanjay Dutt aren't in the cast this time around, which has led to a lot of conjecture. Regarding Mrunal's arrival, fans have expressed their joy, pointing out her passion in the video.\n\nWhy Sanjay Dutt Was Replaced\n\nSanjay Dutt was originally supposed to travel to the UK for the shooting of Son of Sardaar 2, but his visa application was repeatedly rejected due to his 1993 arrest. As a result, he was unable to participate in the film and had to be replaced. Ravi Kishan has been cast in his place.

It followed the rivalry between the Sandhu and Randhawa families and starred Sanjay Dutt, Sonakshi Sinha, and Juhi Chawla.\n\nThe sequel, 'Son of Sardaar 2', is directed by Vijay Kumar Arora and features several actors in cameo roles.\n\nHowever, according to media reports, Sanjay Dutt, who originally played the antagonist, has been replaced by actor-politician Ravi Kishan due to Sanjay's UK visa application being rejected because of his past incarceration.\n\nThe announcement of 'Son of Sardaar 2' comes after the poor box-office performance of 'Auron Mein Kahan Dum Tha', which marked the lowest opening for Ajay Devgn in a decade, earning only Rs. 7.75 crore in four days, according to an industry tracker, Sacnilk.\n\nMeanwhile, Ajay also has the highly anticipated 'Singham Again' in the pipeline.\n\nRohit Shetty, who is the director of the film, had earlier told VOICE that the film is currently in the post-production stage.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajay_Devgn", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ajay Devgn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajay_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ajay (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindi cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auron_(river)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auron (river)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashwni_Dhir", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ashwni Dhir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjay_Dutt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sanjay Dutt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juhi_Chawla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juhi Chawla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._S._Rajamouli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.

The actor's UK visa application has been rejected, resulting in Ravi Kishan stepping in to replace him. Reports indicate that Sanjay Dutt's exclusion from Son Of Sardaar 2 is due to complications with his UK visa, which was linked to his 1993 arrest. The film is currently being shot in Scotland.\n\nWith Sanjay Dutt unable to participate, Ravi Kishan has been cast in his place. Dutt was initially slated to play the antagonist alongside Ajay Devgn and Mrunal Thakur, but his visa issues led to this change.\n\nImpact on Other Projects\n\nDutt's visa troubles could also affect his participation in Housefull 5, set to begin filming in London in September. To address this, producer Sajid Nadiadwala plans to film Dutt's scenes in Mumbai instead.\n\nBackground on Sanjay Dutt's Arrest\n\nIn April 1993, Sanjay Dutt was detained under TADA and the Arms Act for possessing illegal firearms linked to the 1993 Bombay bombings. He was sentenced to five years in prison and served his term fully, being released in 2016.\n\nDespite the setback, Son Of Sardaar 2 continues to attract attention with its impressive cast. Besides Ajay Devgn and Mrunal Thakur, the film will feature Vijay Raaz, Ravi Kishan, Chunky Pandey, and others in significant roles. The sequel is expected to start anew rather than continue directly from the original film's ending. This creative choice aims to refresh the story for the audience.\n\nAlso Read: Sibi Malayil opens up about Mammootty's prowess in emotional scenes, says he breaks down when actor cries\n\nBesides the leads, the film will also include notable actors such as Neeru Bajwa, Deepak Dobriyal, Kubbra Sait, and Vindu Dara Singh, promising a diverse and engaging ensemble. Although Sanjay Dutt's departure from Son Of Sardaar 2 is disappointing for fans, the film's ongoing production with a strong cast ensures that excitement for the sequel remains high.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Kishan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ravi Kishan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjay_Dutt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sanjay Dutt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajay_Devgn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ajay Devgn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrunal_Thakur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mrunal Thakur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housefull_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Housefull (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sajid_Nadiadwala", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sajid Nadiadwala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubbra_Sait", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kubbra Sait"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijay_Raaz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vijay Raaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neeru_Bajwa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neeru Bajwa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammootty", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mammootty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vindu_Dara_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vindu Dara Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepak_Dobriyal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deepak Dobriyal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static-gi.asianetnews.com/images/01j3q37mwynytwa7fc1ydjapm4/sanjay-dutt-about-past-life.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793511", "eventUri": "eng-9793511", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1993-04-", "textStart": 904, "textEnd": 914}], "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

He was convicted for possessing illegal firearms linked to the 1993 Bombay bombings.\n\nAfter more than a decade since the release of Son of Sardaar (2012), plans for its sequel, Son of Sardaar 2, are underway. The sequel was set to feature Ajay Devgn and Sanjay Dutt reprising their roles in an exciting face-off. However, recent reports suggest a significant change in the casting lineup. According to Mid-day, Sanjay Dutt has been replaced by actor Ravi Kishan due to a visa issue.\n\nThe Son of Sardaar 2 shoot is set in Scotland, but Sanjay Dutt's UK visa application was denied due to his criminal record from the early '90s. A source close to the production explained, \"Since his 1993 arrest, Sanjay has traveled to the US but has been unsuccessful in obtaining a UK visa. This project was supposed to be his first trip to the UK. However, upon learning about the visa rejection, the team decided to replace him with Ravi Kishan.\"\n\nThe source also addressed concerns about Sanjay Dutt's involvement in Housefull 5, another film set to shoot in London. The insider clarified, \"For Housefull 5, producer Sajid Nadiadwala has opted for a different strategy. While the main cast will film in London, all of Sanjay's scenes will be shot in Mumbai, avoiding any visa complications.\"\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Sanjay Dutt (@duttsanjay)\n\nSanjay Dutt's legal troubles trace back to his arrest under TADA and the Arms Act in April 1993.

Their dynamics, however, will be different. While the two were at loggerheads with hilarious results in Son of Sardaar, this time, their rivalry will be intense, with Sanjay's role leaning towards the antagonist.

Here's what we know so far", "body": "After 12 years of theatrical release, the team of Son of Sardar is all set to entertain people again. In the first film, released in 2012, it was Ajay Devgn vs Sanjay Dutt, who were seen battling it out. However, there may be a change in the lead cast as a report by Mid-Day Sanjay Dutt might be replaced in Son of Sardar 2. The report suggests that Ravi Kishan has replaced Dutt in the second edition.\n\nSanjay Dutt has been dropped from Son of Sardar 2 due to his visa issue. The film is being shot in Scotland and his visa has been rejected due to his arrest in 1993. ''Ever since his arrest in 1993, while Sanju has travelled to the US, he has applied for a UK visa multiple times, but never got one. The Son of Sardaar 2 shoot would have been his first trip to the UK. However, after Ajay's team found out that the senior actor's visa request had been rejected, they replaced him with Ravi Kishan,'' Mid-Day reported quoting a source.\n\nThe source further revealed that Dutt's Housefull 5 can also be impacted due to the visa issue as the film is set to be filmed in London in September. Talking about the replacement for Sanjay, the source added, ''Sajid has chosen a wiser route. While the shooting with the cast begins in London, all of Sanju's portions will be filmed in Mumbai.

On Tuesday, he shared a video on his social media handle marking the initiation of filming for the sequel to the 2012 hit movie. Reports suggest that the movie is being filmed in Scotland.\n\nThe video shared on Instagram offers a glimpse into the production, showcasing scenes from the set, including shots taken with a jimmy jib, vibrant depictions of Holi celebrations, dance sequences, as well as appearances by Ajay's son Yug, and a visit to a Gurudwara by the actor. In the caption, Ajay wrote, \"The journey of #SonOfSardaar2 begins with prayers, blessings, and an amazing team.\"\n\nThe sequel will continue the storyline where the first film left off. The original movie, directed by Ashwni Dhir, was a remake of SS Rajamouli's Maryada Ramanna and revolved around the fierce rivalry between the Sandhu and Randhawa families. It featured notable actors like Sanjay Dutt, Sonakshi Sinha, and Juhi Chawla.\n\nSon Of Sardar 2, directed by Vijay Kumar Arora, includes several cameo roles from various actors. However, it has been reported that Sanjay Dutt, who played the villain in the first instalment, has been replaced by actor and politician Ravi Kishan due to issues surrounding Sanjay's UK visa application, which was impacted by his prior imprisonment.\n\nThe announcement regarding Son of Sardaar 2 comes after Auron Mein Kahan Dum Tha's underwhelming performance at the box office. The film garnered just Rs 7.75 crore within its first four days, marking Ajay's lowest opening in ten years, as reported by industry tracker Sacnilk.\n\nIn addition to Son of Sardaar 2, Ajay is also set to star in the much-anticipated Singham Again.

The film's release was postponed for a long time. Well, amid this the actor decided to have an Ask Me Anything session with his fans. Many of them asked him several questions. But one question grabbed everyone's attention. A fan asked him about an update on Son of Sardar 2.\n\nA fan asked him, \"Sir son of sardar 2 kab aayege?\" On this Ajay Devgn replied, \"Thoda ruk jaao paaji.\" As per reports, Ajay and Sanjay will be seen in a hilarious face-off again but this time, reports claim that instead of Sonakshi Sinha, Mrunal Thakur will be the leading lady. Reports claim that the shoot will begin in Scotland soon. A source told Mid-Day, \"That said, since the characters of Billu and Jassi were loved by the audiences, the two actors are expected to stick to their characters' names. Their dynamics, however, will be different. While the two were at loggerheads with hilarious results in Son of Sardaar, this time, their rivalry will be intense, with Sanjay's role leaning towards the antagonist. Off screen, the two actors are close friends, and Ajay has made sure that Sanjay has a fantastic role in the second part.\"\n\nAjay, Sanjay and Mrunal Thakur, who has been roped in as the female lead, will kick off a 50-day schedule in Scotland. It is famous for its castles, historic towns, lochs, and beaches, with many episodes of Game of Thrones, and much of the Harry Potter franchise having been shot there,\" the source added.\n\n\"The direction team had done a recce earlier this year, and finalised the scenic towns of Glencoe and Glenfinnan, as well as sites such as the Culross Palace, Doune Castle, Preston Mill and Falkland Palace. The locations form a fitting backdrop for the kind of action and drama that the director has in mind. A few romantic songs featuring Ajay and Mrunal will also be shot in the country's picturesque locales,\" added the source.\n\nThe film will be directed by Vijay Kumar Arora and comes nearly 12 years after the original. The first film featured Ajay Devgn trying to win Sonakshi Sinha's hand in marriage by trying to impress her older brother, played by Sanjay Dutt.

Devgn shared the video on X (formerly Twitter), stating, \"The journey of #SonOfSardaar2 begins with prayers, blessings, and an amazing team.\" In the video, Devgn is seen offering prayers before starting the shoot, with his son Yug Devgan joining in the celebrations.\n\nDuring the shoot, Devgn was spotted in a turban, exuding happiness, while Thakur, dressed in traditional Punjabi attire, played the dhol. The celebration was marked by lively dhol beats and dancing.\n\nSanjay Dutt, who was initially set to appear in the film, has been removed due to issues with obtaining a UK visa. He has been replaced by Ravi Kishan.

The 55-year-old star also shared a behind-the-scenes clip of the upcoming movie.\n\nThe short video showcases Ajay seeking blessings for the project. The visuals also feature glimpses of Mrunal Thakur and Chunkey Pandey. The tweet has left cinema lovers excited and wanting more. \"Super excited for this one. Best of luck,\" commented a netizen. Another wrote, \"A sure shot blockbuster.\"\n\nAccording to a Mid-Day report, Sanjay Dutt, who played the character of Balwinder 'Billu' Singh Sandhu in the first installment of the franchise, is no longer a part of Son of Sardaar 2. Why, you ask? It is said that Baba was replaced in the next installment as he was not granted a visa to travel to the United Kingdom due to his arrest in the 1993 Bombay bombings case. However, there is no official confirmation about this yet. It is believed that Sanjay has been replaced by Ravi Kishan.\n\nAs per industry tracker Sacnilk, the Ashwni Dhir directorial collected Rs 150 crore at the Box Office worldwide. The action comedy film also featured Sonakshi Sinha and Juhi Chawla in lead roles. The storyline of the movie revolved around an individual who is trying his best to stay inside the house of a vengeful man, as he can't be killed unless outside.

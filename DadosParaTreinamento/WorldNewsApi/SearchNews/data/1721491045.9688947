{"id": 237075122, "title": "Yankees warning signs were there before Red Sox ran all over them -- and other teams may try too", "text": "Based purely on Jose Trevino\u2019s arm strength and pop time, perhaps the Red Sox stealing nine bases off him and the Yankees\u2019 pitchers on Sunday night should not have been all that surprising. But no other team had taken advantage of Trevino like that, which raises the question: Did the Red Sox expose a Yankees flaw and provide a blueprint for other teams to copy, or was it just one bad night overall for the Yankees\u2019 run-game operation? \u201dThere\u2019s certain teams that that\u2019s their DNA; that\u2019s how they\u2019re going to play,\u201d manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cObviously, the Red Sox have a number of fast players, and that\u2019s how they play the game. We\u2019ve faced a handful of teams that you go in and it\u2019s similar and you prepare the same kind of way. I have a lot of confidence in how we address and control the running game. [Sunday,] we just didn\u2019t get it done.\u201d Even before Sunday, the Yankees have regularly described controlling the running game as a group effort and not just on the catchers. As of Monday, they had caught 25 percent of attempted base stealers (16 of 65), which was the 10th-best mark in the majors. Trevino, who grades out as the top pitch framer in the game according to Baseball Savant, is at the other end of the spectrum in terms of arm strength. Among 61 qualified catchers, Trevino\u2019s average of 71.3 mph on throws to second was the lowest \u2014 teammate Austin Wells\u2019 79.1 mph ranked 28th. Trevino\u2019s pop time of 2.07 seconds was the fourth-slowest, while Wells was 30th at 1.97. But by Baseball Savant\u2019s Catcher\u2019s Caught Stealing Above Average \u2014 a metric that measures the number of extra caught stealings compared to the expectation of an average catcher, taking runners and pitchers into account \u2014 Trevino was more towards the middle of the road, tied for 38th at minus-one. Wells was tied for 46th at minus-two. Sunday\u2019s outburst had a number of factors working in the Red Sox\u2019s favor. Most notably, their three biggest burners \u2014 Jarren Duran, David Hamilton and Ceddanne Rafaela, who are each top 50 in the game in sprint speed \u2014 combined to get on base nine times and steal seven bases. Boone pointed to the Red Sox having \u201csome leads, they had the right matchups\u201d and taking advantage, but defended the Yankees\u2019 operation overall. Now they have to make sure it was just a one-off and not a sign of things to come. \u201cIt\u2019s something we do very well as a group,\u201d Boone said. \u201cAgain, it\u2019s a group effort \u2014 pitchers, catchers, infielders. How we control it, throwing over and different looks and things like that. It\u2019s something we take a lot of pride in here and have done a good job with. But every now and then, something shows up and we gotta do a better job with that.\u201d Aaron Judge led all major league players in All-Star voting in the first balloting update that was released on Monday, accruing 1,366,315 votes. Juan Soto was second among all major leaguers with 1,252,020 votes. Giancarlo Stanton was second among AL designated hitters, Trevino third among AL catchers, Anthony Volpe third among AL shortstops, Anthony Rizzo fourth among AL first basemen, Oswaldo Cabrera fourth among AL third basemen, Alex Verdugo sixth among AL outfielders and Gleyber Torres seventh among AL second basemen.

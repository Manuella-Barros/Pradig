{"id": 237083694, "title": "Beijing Premier\u2019s Visit Draws the Who\u2019s Who of Human Rights Campaigners", "text": "A who\u2019s who of campaigners against the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s (CCP) human rights abuses made an appearance on the lawn of Parliament House in Canberra, in response to CCP Premier Li Qiang\u2019s official visit. The communist regime\u2019s number two leader has embarked on a high-level tour of New Zealand and Australia, amid an ongoing \u201cnormalisation\u201d of trade ties between Australia and China. Yet Mr. Li\u2019s visit has also attracted the focus of long-time critics of the CCP, some former party members, and others the target of its oppression. Vicky Xiuzhong Xu, a China-born Australian journalist who has carried out extensive investigative work into Beijing\u2019s human rights abuses, said she hoped the CCP would stop pressuring overseas dissidents. \u201cFor example, at my former Australian home I was followed, and sometimes there were strange people outside my home conducting surveillance. In 2023, the Australian Federal Police confirmed to me they had apprehended Chinese spy personnel connected with those activities,\u201d she told The Epoch Times. Ms. Xu has worked to uncover human rights abuses against Uyghurs, Falun Gong, and house Christians. However, it was her work on, \u201cUyghurs for Sale,\u201d that garnered attention from lawmakers in the West. Yet, Ms. Xu says years of apprehension from CCP surveillance has forced her to adopt a mobile lifestyle. Another remote traveller, Edwin Yin, a YouTuber who shot to fame for his critical work aimed at CCP leader Xi Jinping, was also present at the rally. Mr. Yin lives in a campervan over fears of surveillance. In fact, a former spy instructed to hunt down the social media personality could also be found on Parliament\u2019s front lawn. \u201cOf course, we understand the Australian government\u2019s desire to stabilise bilateral trade, but I think we shouldn\u2019t support this,\u201d he told The Epoch Times. \u201cBecause the so-called \u2018close exchanges\u2019 between Australia, Western countries, and China, are essentially providing the Chinese communist regime with support, which actually exacerbates human rights disasters.\u201d The Albanese government is hosting Premier Li as part of a \u201cthawing\u201d of diplomatic ties between Australia and China, as well as an unwinding of trade impediments imposed on exports. The arbitrary trade embargoes were slapped on Australian exports in response to calls from the former Morrison government to investigate the origins of COVID-19. Thousands of expatriate Chinese have been mobilised to greet the premier at every destination across Australia and New Zealand, and to shield the official from human rights campaigners and banners. \u201cI talked to some of them yesterday, they said the CCP Embassy originally promised to give them money, but when they arrived, they didn\u2019t get the money, so some people are quite dissatisfied,\u201d he said. Many of the supporters have been dropped off at locations where Falun Gong practitioners\u2014a faith group brutally persecuted in China by the CCP\u2014were holding banners to raise awareness of human rights abuses. Ted Hui, a former politician in Hong Kong\u2019s Legislative Council\u2014the city\u2019s main lawmaking body before Beijing\u2019s takeover\u2014was not in Canberra, but protested outside Adelaide Zoo during the premier\u2019s visit. He was also concerned with the behaviour of pro-Beijing activists. \u201cThe other group was very aggressive to the Hong Kongers, who were very peaceful,\u201d he told The Epoch Times. \u201cThey were slashing our signs, they were trying to stand in front of us, and they were pushing us. Some volunteers almost fell to the ground. \u201cThis is so uncivilised, but I\u2019m not afraid because I\u2019m in a free country. If we don\u2019t speak up, one day these free countries will lose their freedoms.\u201d \u201cLi Qiang is seriously involved in human rights abuses,\u201d Mr. Chen told The Epoch Times. \u201cAustralia should leverage its Magnitsky [human rights sanction] laws against the premier, and not just welcome him.\u201d While Associate Professor Feng Chongyi also called on the Australian government not to forget what the nature of the CCP is. \u201cThis regime is stained with the blood of hundreds of millions of people, and has killed at least 80 million innocents. So, they are still continuing to persecute Tibetans, Uyghurs, Chinese, Hong Kong people, and everyone under their rule,\u201d he told The Epoch Times. Mr. Feng is the organisers behind the group, Victims of the Chinese Communist Party Australia-New Zealand Alliance, who helped organise part of the rally. \u201cIf for short-term economic benefits, selling a few more barrels of red wine, selling a few more lobsters\u2014while disregarding human rights, democracy, and freedom\u2014is a very weak choice. He called on the Australian government to \u201cshow determination to fight against the CCP tyranny, to achieve China\u2019s democracy and freedom so that everyone can be free.\u201d", "summary": "Premier Li's official visit has been marked by protests in every city he has visited across Australia and New Zealand.", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/beijing-premiers-visit-draws-the-whos-who-of-human-rights-campaigners-5669837", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/06/17/id5669867-20240617_114848-e1718612256274-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:32:03", "author": "Daniel Y.

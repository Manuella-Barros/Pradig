Becky Davison, from Clepington Road, had VIP tickets for Friday\u2019s Eras Tour gig at Murrayfield with best friend Ashley Courtney. However the former St Paul\u2019s Academy pupil, who was born with congenital heart disease, was unable to go as she waits in hospital in England for a transplant. But in a move that would have made loyal friend Taylor proud, Becky Davison\u2019s friend Ashley also sold her ticket \u2013 and the pair enjoyed a \u201chospital version of the Eras Tour\u201d instead. Taylor Swift Eras Tour was the \u2018one thing I really wanted to see\u2019 The 30-year-old said: \u201cWe purchased VIP tickets for the Murrayfield show back in July and I was excited to go as I\u2019d listened to her since I was 15. \u201cI was put on the routine transplant list last summer but unfortunately my health declined and I ended up having to come into hospital. \u201cI\u2019ve been in since March 28 waiting for a transplant to become available \u2013 it could be weeks or months, I just don\u2019t know. \u201cThe one thing that I kept saying to all the doctors and nurses that I just want to get to Taylor Swift. \u201cI was absolutely gutted to miss the show. I know people probably think there\u2019s worse things to be upset about, but it was the one thing I really wanted to see.\u201d Hospital Taylor Swift gig \u2018really cheered me up\u2019 Becky, whose favourite Taylor Swift song is Fearless, says she has been in and out of hospital her whole life. At 21 she was diagnosed with a leaky heart valve and last year required cardioversion, a medical procedure that uses quick, low-energy shocks to restore a regular heart rhythm. Becky was then placed on the routine heart transplant list, but shortly after her 30th birthday she was taken into hospital and placed on the urgent list. Although Becky may have missed the show, she thanked Ashley for visiting and giving her a special Eras Tour experience. She said: \u201cAshley gave up her ticket to come to visit me, she didn\u2019t want to go to the concert without me. \u201cShe brought a bracelet-making kit so we could make one for each other and watched the show together on a laptop. \u201cIt was really nice to have her here and have as close to an Eras Tour experience as I can \u2013 it cheered me up. \u201cI had other friends at the show who said they\u2019d bring me back a t-shirt. \u201cAshley is amazing, she has so much going on herself but still goes out of her way to help people when she can. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have people that look out for you and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without her.\u201d Ahead of Swift\u2019s first Murrayfield gig on Friday fans turned up at Kinross House amid speculation the Cruel Summer singer was staying at the Perthshire mansion.", "summary": "Becky Davison's best friend gave up her ticket to give her pal a \"hospital version of the Eras Tour\" instead.", "url": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/dundee/5004969/dundee-woman-taylor-swift-heart-transplant/", "image": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2024/06/Becky-Split-2-2tur0rpxx.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:14:32", "author": "Andrew Robson", "authors": ["Andrew Robson"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.224}

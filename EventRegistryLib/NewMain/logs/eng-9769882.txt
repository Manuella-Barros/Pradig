Creators can tailor their bots to answer specific types of questions or avoid certain topics.\n\nThe company stated, \"Creators can customize their AI based on things like their Instagram content, topics to avoid, and links they want it to share.\"\n\nWith AI Studio, anyone can create AI characters at ai.meta.com/ai-studio or in the Instagram app. Users can share their AI with followers and friends, making it available for anyone to discover and chat with on Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and the web.\n\nCreators Ai's can share facts about themselves, link to favourite brands, and reference past videos, helping creators reach more people and providing faster responses to fans.\n\nIn addition to professional creators, all other Instagram users will gain the ability to develop themed chatbots for their profiles. This means that any Instagram user, not just professionals, can develop a chatbot tailored to specific interests. Whether it's a bot focused on Nigerian cuisine, Nollywood movies, or local football, users can enhance their profiles with interactive AI-driven engagement.\n\nThrough the professional dashboard in the Instagram app, creators can turn auto-replies on and off and decide who their AI replies to. Responses from creator AIs are clearly labelled, ensuring full transparency for fans.\n\nBoth features are set to be rolled out more broadly in the coming weeks.\n\nMeta has been heavily investing in AI over recent years, with Zuckerberg openly expressing his ambition to develop some of the best chatbots globally.\n\nMeta initially announced AI Studio in September. Currently, it offers an AI chatbot, Meta AI, within Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. unveiled an AI model, Llama 3.1, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg described as \"state of the art\" and capable of competing with AI offerings from OpenAI and Google. Released in July 2024, Llama 3.1 is designed to enhance chatbot capabilities both within Meta and for external developers.\n\nThe model features improved reasoning for solving complex math problems, the ability to synthesize extensive text, and generative AI capabilities that can create images based on text prompts. The feature called \"Imagine Yourself\" allows users to upload an image of their face and generate various scene depictions.\n\n\"I think the most important product for an AI assistant is going to be how smart it is, the Llama models that we're building are some of the most advanced in the world \" Zuckerberg said during an interview on Bloomberg.\n\nMeta has expanded its AI service to seven Sub-Saharan African countries, including Nigeria and Ghana, enhancing its offerings across the continent. The service is now available in South Africa, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Malawi as well. Meta AI, which integrates with Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, aims to improve connectivity and provide millions of Africans with advanced tools for creativity, expression, and productivity.\n\nMeta highlights that users can leverage Meta AI within these apps to perform tasks, learn, create, and connect seamlessly. The AI can be accessed through feeds, chats, and searches, allowing users to obtain real-time information without switching between apps.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized the company's ambition to build the world's leading AI, stating in a Facebook post that Meta AI is now \"the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use.\"", "source": {"uri": "nairametrics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nairametrics"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ugonnia_ozibo@nairametrics.com", "name": "Ugonnia Ozibo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_engagement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Customer engagement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sub-Saharan Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zambia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Zambia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malawi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malawi"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malawi"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Development_Frameworks", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Development Frameworks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Presentation", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Presentation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://nairametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Instagram.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769882", "eventUri": "eng-9769882", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Meta hasn't yet indicated if or when the feature will be launched outside of the US.\n\nThe free service lets you create customized AI chatbots that can tell jokes, create memes, and hand out advice. But the most intriguing use-case is for professional content creators, who can use the tool to \"make an AI as an extension of themselves\" to answer DMs and story replies, effectively creating an AI secretary for their social media admin.\n\nYou can access the AI Studio now in two ways, if you're in the US. You can head to the official Meta AI Studio website, where you can make a 'Creator AI' (which is an extension of you, if you have a professional Instagram account) or an 'AI Character' (a chatbot that's based on your chosen interests).\n\nAlternatively, you can find the feature in Instagram by starting a new message and then tapping 'Create an AI chat'. From this point, Meta says you can customize the AI character's \"name, personality, tone, avatar and tagline\". Meta has created an in-depth guide to creating AI characters, which shows that there's already an impressive amount of customization.\n\nFor example, you can provide detailed instructions on how you want your AI characters to behave like \"use vocabulary from the 1950s\" or \"a corny dad who uses lots of puns\". You can also tell the AI chatbot how to talk (like \"you are concise and never repeat yourself\").\n\nBut the AI chatbots available to professional Instagram creators will also go well beyond canned responses. Meta states that \"long-term memory\" will let the chatbot remember previous conversations with whoever's interacting with the AI. Interestingly, a beta option called 'Search' will also let your AI twin \"draw information from the internet to make its responses more robust\" and also \"share links to websites when relevant\".\n\nMeta has been edging towards unleashing full-blown AI characters in its apps this year, with an image creation tool called 'Imagine Me' recently letting you create a digital avatar of yourself with uploaded photos.\n\nBut Meta's new AI Studio is on another level, and gives us an (arguably disturbing) glimpse of where AI chatbots could be headed. Rather than '15 minutes of fame', the 21st century equivalent of Andy Warhol's famous prediction might instead be that everyone will get a personalized AI clone.\n\nMeta's 'Creator AI' chatbots are currently only available to professional Instagram accounts (either Business or Creator) and are being sold as a way to \"reach your audience and save time\".\n\nIt remains to be seen how fans will react to accounts that message them using an AI clone of the personality they're following. And there is something slightly creepy about Meta's promise to creators that these AI bots can help them engage with their audience by \"mimicking your tone and expressions\". Meta says that some subjects will be off-limits for its AI chatbots and that they'll be clearly marked in its apps.\n\nBut this could also be a major step towards the normalization of this kind of chatbot experience and Meta's 'AI characters' (which are open for everyone to try) are a little more fun and innocent. Meta says these are for \"fun, utility or support\" and that you can create chatbots that \"uniquely express your personal interests and nerd out on topics that matter to you\".\n\nHowever you feel about Meta's AI Studio, a new AI era for social media has started.", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_wilson@techradar.com", "name": "Mark Wilson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_creation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Content creation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avatar (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vocabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerd", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nerd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Warhol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AkvyjK57rqFSLepcExEcWe-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769882", "eventUri": "eng-9769882", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

This AI persona will answer questions and chat with their followers and fans on their behalf.

Investors are less positive lately on megacap technology stocks, with Meta joining big names such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) with recent losses.\n\nOn the stock market today, Meta stock is up roughly 1% at 471.23 in premarket trading. Shares have advanced 32% this year but are off 14% from record highs reached earlier this month.\n\nHere's what to know about Meta's upcoming earnings report:\n\nBy The Numbers\n\nOverall, analysts expect Meta to post a 19.6% year-over-year increase in sales, to $38.3 billion, for its June-ended quarter, according to FactSet. Earnings are expected to rise 57% year-over-year to $4.71 per share, according to FactSet.\n\nThat would mark a slowdown from the 27% year-over-year revenue growth Meta recorded in its March-ending quarter.\n\nA tougher comparison against last year's Q2 is the main culprit. The June 2023 quarter was the first one where Meta showed significant pickup in revenue growth, as its digital advertising business bounced back from a rough stretch in 2022. Meta's sales grew 11%, to $32 billion, in the second quarter of 2023, compared to 2.6% year-over-year growth in the first quarter that year.\n\nMeta Stock: AI Spending Watch\n\nDespite the strong sales growth for Meta in Q1, its shares sank following the report. The main reason: AI dreams are expensive. Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told analysts that the company could spend up to $40 billion on capital expenditures in 2024, up 42% from capex spending in 2023.\n\nAnalysts will be listening for whether Meta further adds to its expected spending.\n\nBofA Securities Analyst Justin Post, however, said he does not \"anticipate a repeat of last quarter's higher 2024 expense guidance, though higher legal (costs) and capex are risks.\"\n\nSeparately, Zuckerberg last week announced availability for the newest version of Meta's Llama AI model. Zuckerberg called open source AI the \"path forward\" in a blog post. During the company's previous earnings call, Zuckerberg said the company has several paths for monetizing its AI products as they grow in popularity.\n\nWhat Meta Analysts Are Saying\n\nOverall, Post expects Meta to deliver a \"modest\" Q2 beat. He rates Meta stock a buy with a price target of 550.\n\n\"After a subdued 1Q call 'AI investment cycle,' management has an opportunity for a more constructive tone on returns on AI spend (plus YouTube results may have lowered the bar),\" Post wrote to clients. \"We remain positive on Meta and think Reels, Messaging, and AI driven ad improvements are still early, and could lead to positive product surprises and revenue upside.\"\n\nMeta stock traded lower following last week's earnings report from Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). Google's search-based advertising revenue beat expectations but YouTube related ad sales came in lower than expected. Google is the only company that has a larger share of the digital ad market than Meta.\n\nEvercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney also expects Meta to beat analyst expectations. Evercore rates Meta stock with a positive outperform call and a price target of 550.\n\n\"We view the Street's Q2 revenue estimate as reasonable, with a touch more upside vs. downside variance, given our ad channel checks suggest a consistently strong overall ad environment and strong performance by Meta\n\nad campaigns,\" Mahaney wrote in a client note Friday.\n\nMeta Stock Technical Scores\n\nMeanwhile, the IBD Stock Checkup tool shows Meta stock holds an IBD Composite Rating of 87 from a best-possible 99. The score means Meta stock is currently in the top 13% of stocks in terms of key performance metrics and technical strength.\n\nShares have also plunged well below a 514.01 cup-with-handle buy point, according to IBD MarketSurge.

However, users can also make their AI agents available to anyone else using Meta's services. This is more likely to appeal to content creators who want to create chatbots their fans can interact with.\n\nMark Zuckerberg discussed these AI agents during an interview last week as being a ubiquitous part of the future for AI. The release of AI Studio, along with having these AI agents available within Instagram and all of Meta's other services, seems like the first steps towards this future.\n\nThat this is the beginning is evident from the suggestions the company provides to content creators on how to best use AI agents. The suggestions include having it answer common questions, pointing to past content, linking to brand partners, or just providing some fun facts about themselves. Of course, Meta will be clearly labeling these AI agents so that anyone interacting with it knows they're not talking to the actual person.\n\nTo get started with making your own AI agent it's as simple as starting a new conversation on the Instagram app and selecting \"Create an AI chat.\" It's also available on desktop by visiting the AI Studio website.", "source": {"uri": "hothardware.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotHardware"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alan_velasco@hothardware.com", "name": "Alan Velasco", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_creation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Content creation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ping (networking utility)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://images.hothardware.com/contentimages/newsitem/65129/content/meta-ai-studio-hero.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769882", "eventUri": "eng-9769882", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

The once seemingly unstoppable electric vehicle pioneer Tesla just reported an abysmal second quarter that saw its net income drop by more than half from a year ago while Nvidia seems incapable of slowing down, growing last quarter's net income by more than 600%.\n\nDriving Nvidia's explosive growth is its position at the center of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom that's lifting the tide for all boats in tech, at least those without slipping EV sales. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Apple have all benefited, seeing their stock prices appreciate significantly.\n\nWhile it also saw a big bump in share price, up 34% this year, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) hasn't been quite as front and center in the AI hype cycle as some of the other big tech players. I think that's changing. Here are a few reasons why it's one of my favorite stocks in technology today.\n\n1. Meta is investing heavily in AI; it looks like it's going to pay off\n\nMeta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has caught a lot of flak for his big bet on virtual reality (VR). The company is spending billions on developing its \"metaverse\" technology, imagining a future where people spend their time in an immersive, digital world.\n\nThe plan hasn't exactly panned out, and there's certainly a chance it never will. So why am I talking about VR? Well, for one, Meta plans on integrating its VR tech with AI, but the larger point is that Zuckerberg isn't afraid to make big bets on the future and to spend enormous amounts of money making it a reality. Oh, and Meta has enormous amounts of capital to spend. Take a look at this chart showing the company's recent capital expenditures (capex) and free cash flow (FCF).\n\nNotice the massive upswing in FCF? Meta has a lot of cash to play with, and it plans on using it. The company recently raised its expected capex in 2024 to $35 billion-$40 billion as it \"invest[s] aggressively to support [its] ambitious AI research and product development efforts.\"\n\nThese efforts will improve upon the company's flagship AI product, Meta AI, already released to the public and integrated into its products like Facebook and Instagram. Now, pouring money into development doesn't always pan out -- and it's important to consider what could happen here -- but when it does, the payoff can be huge.\n\n2. Meta's products are as popular as ever, and its ad business is booming\n\nLooking to expand the horizons of a business is important, but not at the expense of your core business. Luckily, Meta isn't at risk of doing that anytime soon. Maybe Facebook at this point seems passe; maybe it seems like only your grandmother and her friends use it, but it is still the most popular social media platform in the world with a very active user base. Meta owns the first-, third-, fourth-, and seventh-most popular social media platforms in the world.\n\nAccording to the company, 3.24 billion people use one or more of its platforms daily. It's not slowing down, either; that number grew by 7% last quarter from the year-ago period.\n\nThis breadth and depth of engagement make Meta ad space valuable -- a good thing, because ad revenue makes up 99% of the company's bottom line. Last quarter saw the company's total revenue spike 27% year over year, driven primarily by a 20% jump in ad impressions -- industry jargon for ads seen on a screen -- and a 6% jump in the price of ads.\n\n3. Meta's stock looks pretty cheap at the moment\n\nMeta is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 28 and a forward P/E of just 23 -- that's pretty low for a tech company. Take a look at its forward P/E vs some peers'.\n\nI think this presents a great buying opportunity. So much of the hype has focused on other players in big tech, but Meta looks to be doing all the right things, and its stock price has yet to catch up.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

This comes after they announced their latest AI features that can be accessed via their Instagram, Facebook or WhatsApp platforms. They shared in a news announcement, \"We're starting to roll out AI Studio in the US as a place for people to create, share and discover AIs. Built with Llama 3.1, AI Studio lets anyone create and discover AI characters and allows creators to build an AI as an extension of themselves to reach more fans.\"\n\nCreating your own AI character with Meta Studio is quite easy, on top of it being an enjoyable creative process. This, here, is a step-by-step guide to help you bring your AI idea to life, even if you aren't a pro in the tech space.\n\nFirst, think about what your AI should do. Its \"purpose\", if you will. Will it be a fun character that generates memes, gives travel advice, or something entirely unique? Once you decide, visit their site, or use the Instagram app to start creating your AI character. The platform allows for unlimited creativity- you could want your AI to have a specific knowledge base or it could be created just to be an entertaining companion.\n\nAt Meta Studio, personalisation matters. You can decide on your AI's personality, how it would look, and even set tone by deciding how it speaks in conversations. First, pick a name and a tagline that sums up the essence of your AI. Then, select an avatar. Meta Studio has a few default options, but if you'd like, you can also upload a custom image to match your vision.\n\nFor those who prefer a guided process, Meta has templates. These templates serve as a guide to help you create, that you can customise according to your needs. Whether you decide to start from scratch or use a template, the point is to give your AI unique characteristics that reflect its intended function and personality.\n\nThe Knowledge section is where your AI's personality comes to life. Here, you input detailed descriptions, set up how your AI interacts, and determine the style of its responses. You can specify the vocabulary your AI should use, whether it should incorporate modern slang, or maintain a more formal tone.\n\nUse the platform's interactive chat feature to test and refine your AI's dialogue in real-time. This step ensures that your AI communicates effectively and aligns with your creative vision. Make adjustments as necessary to perfect its responses and ensure consistency across all interactions.\n\nEngagement is an important aspect, and Meta Studio lets you define how your AI starts conversations. You can set up a welcoming message that introduces your AI to users. This is that message that should be engaging and prompt an interaction. For example, if your AI is a basketball expert, it could challenge users with trivia about the sport to engage them immediately.\n\nAlso, you can enhance your AI's functionality by allowing other capabilities like web searching or image generation, depending on what fits your AI's purpose. These features make your AI more interactive and able to providing better overall responses.\n\nOnce you're satisfied with your AI, it's time to publish. Meta Studio has different privacy settings, with the option for you to share your AI with close friends, or make it public for a bigger audience and interaction. After publishing, use the promotional tools provided by Meta to introduce your AI to potential users. You can share it directly on social platforms like Instagram and Facebook or embed it on your website.\n\nCreators can also use their AI to automate responses in DMs or comments, so its a valuable tool for managing social interactions more efficiently. This feature is especially great for those with large followings.", "source": {"uri": "techround.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRound"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knowledge base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Avatar (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_settings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy settings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social relation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://techround.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/maxim-tolchinskiy-ectRUZRYrYk-unsplash-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769882", "eventUri": "eng-9769882", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

(NASDAQ:META) boasts a market cap exceeding $1 trillion and is a member of the renowned \"Magnificent Seven.\" Operating primarily in two segments, Family of Apps and Reality Labs, its productsFacebook, Instagram and WhatsAppare integral to people's daily lives. Founded 20 years ago, the company went public in 2012 and has since grown into a tech powerhouse.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision has propelled Meta to an impressive start this year, maintaining the momentum from last year. Known for its extensive portfolio of social networking apps, the company has been aggressively integrating AI across its platforms to enhance user engagement and monetize its vast user base. Despite a 30% year-to-date rally, Meta Platforms remains relatively undervalued within the Magnificent Seven group. The gains have been fueled by robust quarterly results and strong revenue growth, positioning the company to leverage AI to strengthen its core advertising business further.\n\nThe company's substantial investments in generative artificial intelligence has led to successful monetization, significantly boosting advertising revenue and margins. Additionally, Meta's shares have nearly quintupled from their 2022 lows, driven by a relentless focus on efficiency, the success of Reels and best-in-class ad targeting capabilities in a post-app tracking transparency landscape. As Reels monetization reaches neutrality and AI integration continues to receive significant attention and resources from Zuckerberg, investors are once again optimistic about the company's future.\n\nDespite its impressive performance and record-high share price, I believe Meta has significant upside potential. This optimism is grounded in its strong fundamentals and strategic AI integration across its family of apps. Further, I see substantial growth potential for Meta despite its already impressive achievements.\n\nIn April 2021, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced the app tracking transparency framework with an iOS update, disrupting platforms like Facebook by limiting their ability to track users across apps. This change hindered Meta's ability to measure the return on ad spend with the same precision, as deterministic measurement of ad conversion rates was no longer possible.\n\nConsequently, Meta was forced to pivot to a probabilistic model, necessitating billions of dollars in investment, particularly in GPUs, to develop a machine learning algorithm for estimating ad conversion rates. This substantial investment strengthened Meta's competitive moat, positioning it and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) far ahead of competitors in terms of measurement and targeting capabilities.\n\nThese early AI investments not only helped Meta navigate the post-ATT landscape, but also enhanced its self-sufficiency amid broader industry transformations. The company's extensive reach across its diverse Family of Appsspanning text, image and video formatscontinues to benefit from these strategic advancements.\n\nSource: Meta Investor Relations\n\nMeta is well-positioned to capitalize on tighter integration of its technology stack thanks to its robust ecosystem and strategic partnership with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company's customized chip projects have yielded successful outcomes, such as the launch of MTIA 2. This updated Meta Training and Inference Accelerator is specifically optimized for the company's recommendation algorithms, further strengthening its competitive advantage against smaller digital advertising peers in the generative AI era.\n\nThe company's first-quarter earnings commentary highlights the success of its engagement efforts, particularly in Instagram Reels, which now accounts for 50% of the time spent within the app. The significant investments in artificial intelligence have primarily focused on the Family of Apps, enhancing ad efficiency. Higher return on investment for advertisers on platforms like Facebook and Instagram encourages continued ad placements, driving Meta's growth trajectory.\n\nMeta's growth is propelled not only by increased AI investments driving total ad impressions, but also by robust AI monetization across its Family of Apps. For instance, Threads has reached over 175 million monthly users and is now focusing on ad monetization. Additionally, the company introduced an updated version of Meta AI powered by the latest model, Llama 3, which enhances user engagement by helping users explore topics of interest more effectively. Recognized as one of the leading AI assistants globally, this model lays the foundation for developing a wide array of new applications. Leveraging its vast social networking data, Meta can generate significant AI returns through various new models, including targeted advertising, which could substantially boost its advertisement revenue.\n\nMeta Platforms has demonstrated a solid track record in earnings over the past several years. Despite occasional misses on earnings per share, largely due to challenges in its virtual reality ventures and an advertising slowdown, the company has consistently surpassed analyst estimates for top-line results. Revenue has reaccelerated after a slowdown in 2022, propelling its trailing 12-month results to all-time highs for both revenue and net income.\n\nSource: Meta Investor Relations\n\nIn its first-quarter results, which were released on April 24, Meta reported earnings of $4.71 per share, beating analysts' estimates by 39 cents. Revenue for the quarter stood at $36.50 billion, up 27.30% year over year and surpassing estimates by $240 million. This robust performance was driven by several key factors:\n\nAverage revenue per person saw an 18% year-over-year increase, highlighting Meta's effectiveness in monetizing its extensive user base and generating more revenue per user. This achievement is particularly noteworthy given the challenging economic backdrop affecting many businesses. Looking ahead, the company is focused on monetizing engagement by leveraging AI-driven features across its Family of Apps, significantly enhancing monetization efficiency.\n\nMeta's disciplined cost management has been crucial in improving its operating efficiency and profitability. In the first quarter, the company's total costs grew by just 5.70% to $22.60 billion. This prudent cost management expanded the company's net profit margin by 1,400 basis points to 33.90%, enabling diluted earnings per share growth to far outpace revenue growth.\n\nIn 2022, the company increased its capital expenditure by 68% to build up AI infrastructure amid the generative AI boom, which impacted its free cash flow, leading to a 50% year-over-year decline. The stock subsequently dropped nearly 73%, from $331 to $91, in less than 11 months. However, a strong ROI from these investments boosted the company's fundamentals, as reflected in the 2023 earnings results. Now, Meta is entering another capex cycle to strengthen its AI research and development.\n\nSource: Meta Investor Relations\n\nMeta has been heavily investing in artificial intelligence, a trend likely to continue as the company optimizes and implements AI across its platforms. The company now anticipates 2024 capex to be between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from the previous range of $30 billion to $37 billion. Despite the substantial capex, I do not foresee a significant headwind in free cash flow as Meta's recent AI initiatives suggest a keen focus on quickly monetizing its projects.\n\nBased on the company's strong ROI track record, I believe these AI investments will generate substantial returns in 2025. Enhancements in both engagement and ad performance should translate into continued revenue and earnings growth, reinforcing the Meta's position as a leader in the social media and digital advertising landscape.\n\nDespite the stock's significant year-to-date performance, Meta currently trades with a forward price-earnings ratio of 18.40 based on projected earnings for 2024. This is notably lower than the Magnificent 7 average of 29.40. The multiple aligns closely with Alphabet's forward earnings ratio of 18.10, both of which are considered undervalued relative to their peers.\n\nIt is common for companies of this caliber to trade at 25 to 30 earnings, particularly in an environment where interest rates are expected to decline. Such a decline could prompt investors to rotate out of fixed-rate investments and back into the stock market, potentially boosting Meta's valuation.\n\nSource: Alpha Spread\n\nIn comparison, both Alphabet and Meta trade below Apple's forward price-earnings ratio of 28.40 and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) forward multiple of 29. Given this context, I believe the stock still has substantial upside potential. Meta currently ranks as the second least expensive stock among the Magnificent Seven based on forward price-earnings, trailing only Alphabet. If the stock returns to the peer average multiple of more than 28 times earnings, it could see a significant price increase. This implies a strong potential to reach a price target of $610 by the end of the year.\n\nUsing a discounted cash flow valuation approach, with a 7.75% discount rate reflecting Meta's capital structure and risk profile and assuming a 3% terminal growth rate beyond the initial five years, we can estimate the stock's intrinsic value. This terminal growth rate accounts for Meta's anticipated strength in the near to medium term, driven by emerging opportunities in AI and digital advertising. The DCF model yields a target value of $659.44, indicating an upside potential of approximately 24%.\n\nBoth valuation methodspeer comparison and DCF analysissuggest substantial upside for Meta. I remain confident that the company is well-positioned to capitalize on this potential, underpinned by its leadership in digital advertising and growing AI opportunities. This positions Meta as a compelling buy, offering strong upside prospects in the current market environment.\n\nMeta Platforms has demonstrated impressive growth and resilience, leveraging AI integration and strategic investments to enhance user engagement and advertising revenue. Despite a significant rise in value year to date, the stock remains relatively undervalued compared to its peers in the Magnificent Seven. With strong fundamentals, robust AI-driven growth and prudent cost management, the company is well-positioned for continued expansion and substantial upside potential, making it a compelling buy in the current market environment.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

This means that just about anyone who's interested can essentially create their own AI characters or chatbots, and then share it with friends or the public who can use the AI.\n\nWe imagine that this could be useful for social media influencers or celebrities. For example, a social media personality who might be popular for their cooking recipes could create an AI character based on food or cooking. They can then share it with their followers who can ask cooking related questions and get answers, almost like they're talking with the creator themselves.\n\nIt's actually kind of interesting. This is because Meta isn't alone in coming up with this concept. A recent report suggests that Google is working on a similar tool to allow users to create their own AI chatbots.

Is your art in danger? This article explores the full case and discusses how to maintain your privacy from these social media giants.\n\nArtists are deleting their Instagram accounts because Meta, the parent company of Instagram, is using their posts to train the Meta AI. The social media giant recently unveiled a Meta AI chatbot and image generators that can reimagine almost anything, using images and text from public posts without permission. This means that all photos, art, and creativity are being used by the AI, and are freely available for public use. Google also uses Gmail to train an AI to complete other people's sentences, while Microsoft uses chats with Bing to improve its AI bot's ability to answer questions. Although users in the U.S. did not receive a notification, Meta's data-sharing policy suggests that this is already in effect. Meta has been deploying generative AI features since September 2023, initially starting with the ability to tag the Meta AI chatbot in conversations on Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. This raises the question of whether this practice is considered normal due to the actions of other tech giants. Meta executive Chris Cox stated that the company doesn't \"train on private stuff,\" though these words are carefully chosen, and there are concerns about this being a serious issue.

In his opinion, these agents will save time and improve the connection with followers, facilitating tasks that would otherwise consume a large part of the day.\n\nMeta CEO highlighted that there are already more than 200 million people using Meta platforms as content creators. For many, interacting with their audience is a vital part of their daily work, but time is always a limited resource. This is where AI comes into play, providing effective solutions to maximize productivity.\n\nThe conversation focused on the launch of Llama 3.1, the latest AI model developed by Meta. This technology is already being integrated into popular applications such as WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger, making its use as common as email addresses or business websites.\n\nZuckerberg highlighted how AI is already being used by some content creators on Instagram. And since June 2024, influencers like Don Allen Stevenson III have incorporated chatbots into their direct messages. These chatbots, like \"AI Don Allen Stevenson\" allow followers to interact in a more personalized way, although Meta warns that some messages may be inaccurate or inappropriate.\n\nZuckerberg says, in this scenario, Meta AI (the company's artificial intelligence assistant) promises to be as accessible and useful as ChatGPT. He claims that users can interact with it on Meta's social media accounts by simply searching for \"Meta AI\" or selecting the blue circle in their apps' interfaces.\n\nThis tool can answer questions, translate languages, generate images and much more in real time.\n\nZuckerberg is convinced that we are moving towards aA world where AI will be omnipresent.

However, Meta wants to change this with its latest introduction of AI Studio to help create custom characters on social media.\n\nMeta introduced the AI Studio with a special feature for Instagram, particularly with its content creators who would usually be busy answering fans or followers who hit them up via direct messages. Instead of being left on \"delivered\" or \"seen,\" creators may make an AI version of themselves to quickly answer followers whenever they get messages.\n\nThis latest offer centers on AI Studio's improved generative AI capabilities built by Meta's latest Llama 3.1 LLM whichalso offers regular users in creating AI characters based on their interests.\n\nRead Also: Nvidia Unveils AI Chatbot 'G-Assist' That Guides Gamers Through Games and Even Optimizes PCs\n\nAccording to Meta, the AI version of the Instagram creator can answer direct messages from fans or followers, particularly with quick answers regarding common queries or story replies.\n\nInstagram's creator AI could share differentinformation like facts or trivia about the influencer, offering links to associated or favorite brands, also sharing previous video uploads.\n\nThe generative AI era of the present world has brought massive possibilities for users and companies to offer a more in-touch experience with their customers and fans. Among these famed experiences were Samsung's Bixby whichleverages generative AI in offering user's voice to answer calls, and there is also DoorDash's AI answering service to take your orders.\n\nCreating one's AI tailored for their specific needs is no longer new, particularly as the likes of OpenAI and Microsoft already offer this in the form of custom GPTs. Other companies have also followed suit, and an AI-based search platform, You.com, has recently introduced 'Custom Assistants' creation to tweak user experience based on their preferences.\n\nIn the past months, Meta's AI executions have seen mixed reviews, particularly with significant controversies on various platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. However, the company expands more on the generative AI experience with the latest AI Studio, with a specific tool for Instagram allowing creators to make AI versions of themselves to answer their followers.", "source": {"uri": "techtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tech Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isaiah_richard@techtimes.com", "name": "Isaiah Richard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deepfake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_creation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Content creation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "User experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Lifestyle", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Lifestyle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://1734811051.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/449836/820/0/0/0/instagram-custom-creator-ai.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769882", "eventUri": "eng-9769882", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Mark Zuckerberg anticipates that \"hundreds of millions\" of these AI personas will eventually populate Meta's platforms.\n\nMeta is broadening the scope beyond just creators, allowing all Instagram users to design custom AI characters. These AI entities can discuss specific topics, create memes, or provide advice. Powered by Meta's Llama 3.1 model, users can share their AI creations and track their usage, though they cannot view others' interactions with their AI.\n\nAI Studio can be accessed through ai.meta.com/ai-studio and is also available via the Instagram app, as well as WhatsApp, Messenger, and the web. Users can generate custom AI chatbots for various scenarios, such as role-playing different conversations. However, users are prohibited from representing real individuals other than themselves and from generating content involving historical or religious figures, or anything considered hateful, explicit, or illegal.\n\nMeta has showcased several AI chatbots developed by celebrities, such as a dining recommendation bot by chef Marc Murphy and a photography bot by Angel Barclay.

This surge in AI use has also boosted ad revenue.\n\nDespite the premium valuation, the company's strong performance underscores its position as an AI leader, signaling additional upside for the stock.\n\nMeta, which owns some of the most popular social networking apps, recorded year-over-year top-line growth of 27% for the first quarter, coming in at $36.46 billion and topping the Street's estimates of $36.14 billion.\n\nThe company achieved its fastest period of expansion since 2021 on the back of aggressive monetization in its suite of applications and deep integration of AI features into its leading platforms. For example, Facebook reported that 30% of the posts used a certain kind of AI-powered recommendation system. Similarly, AI ensures it keeps 50% of stories on Instagram parallel to users' requirements, enhancing engagement and promoting more advertising campaigns.\n\nThe overall revenue increase was less spectacular. Still, Meta's bottom line effectively doubled, with net income hitting $12.37 billion, or $4.71 a share, versus $5.71 billion, or $2.20 a share, in the prior period. This leap was driven by a 16% reduction in sales and marketing costs, lower restructuring expenses and decreased professional services and marketing use.\n\nAlthough Meta does not report daily and monthly active users for its individual platforms, the company had more than 3.24 billion daily active people across its family of apps, creating strong momentum in which it offers one of the few brand-safe environments where advertisers can spend money to effectively reach this massive user base.\n\nConsequently, the family average revenue per person declined by 9% quarter over quarter to $36.46 billion; still, the number suggests growth of 18% from the prior year. This describes how Meta monetizes its consumer base and generates revenue.\n\nAdditionally, the 20% increase in ad impressions was primarily driven by Asia-Pacific and the Rest of the World. However, most of this came from Asia-Pacific, where ad impressions grew 28% compared with 16% growth in North America and 20% growth globally. However, this marked a deceleration from the growth of 34% recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, the company witnessed a 6% rise in the average price of ads.\n\nFinally, major Chinese e-tailersfor example, Temu and Sheinimmensely helped to accelerate ad impression in the Asia-Pacific region on Facebook for selling inexpensive products to American and European clients, accounting for approximately 10% of the company's total profit.\n\nFor the second quarter, Meta expects revenue in the range of $36.50 billion to $39 billion, offset by a 1% currency headwind. The company expects expenses between $96 billion and $99 billion, up slightly from the impacts of infrastructure and higher legal charges vis-a-vis prior guidance. Operating losses by Reality Labs are expected to balloon because of investments in the development of products and their scale.\n\nThe full-year 2024 capital expenditures guidance has been raised to $35 billion to $40 billion.\n\nThe company also remains vigilant regarding regulatory headwinds in the European Union and the U.S. It was a solid start for the year, with momentum through the Family of Apps and significant progress on AI and Reality Labs initiatives that have the potential to change the way people interact for years to come.\n\nAdditionally, generative AI is an inherent part of Meta's investment to create value in the long run. At least one significant player includes Meta, which boasts a vast AI team and robust computing infrastructure. The company has introduced a new model of generative AI technologies called Llama 3, which makes it an active assistant to create means for building new models. Therefore, such integrations of AI enhance targeted advertising, Meta's primary revenue source. AI will make the Facebook, Instagram and Reels interface very engaging to the user by basing personal content around user preferences.\n\nAccording to AI and tech expert Puneet Gogia, AI chat tools for businesses on WhatsApp saw a 40% increase in paid messaging, with potential for ad integration. Enhanced tracking tools like Event Measurement improved ad performance, increasing sales by 9.50% and trackable sales by 20%. Lastly, efficient investments in AI systems, public code sharing and AI chip development strengthened the company's financial stability, positioning it as an AI leader.\n\nCompetition in digital advertising has to be one of the most significant risks standing in the way of Meta Platforms achieving its desired growth rates. The company does not operate a monopoly in the lucrative field. Still, it faces stiff competition from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which invests heavily in artificial intelligence to strengthen targeted advertising on search and YouTube.\n\nAdditionally, deterioration in the growth prospects of the U.S. economy could also pose significant risks to Meta Platforms' lucrative advertising business. Given that the company generates 98% of its sales from advertising, any economic downturn could be followed by significant cuts in ad spending, which could spell trouble for the company's revenue base. Thus, the company has also warned that it continues to watch the EU and U.S. regulatory landscape, which could impact its business and financial results.\n\nAn over 41% rally year to date has left Meta Platforms trading at a forward price-earnings multiple of 25. Nevertheless, compared to its peers, the stock appears to be trading at a discount, going by the average price-earnings ratio of 31 for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100. Given the double-digit percentage growth in revenue and earnings, it is justifiable for the company to trade at a premium given the solid underlying fundamentals.\n\nThe company is also sitting on a boatload of cash. It ended the first quarter with $12.5 billion in free cash flow, allowing it to aggressively invest in high-growth initiatives, such as augmented and virtual reality devices, the metaverse and AI.\n\nBacked by a solid balance sheet, Meta Platforms has returned value to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. For starters, it repurchased $14.64 billion in shares in the first quarter, reducing its shares in circulation, which is expected to bolster earnings per share in the long run. The company also paid $1.27 billion in dividends for a dividend yield of 0.41%.\n\nMeta's direction has been explosive, rallying more than 58% over the past 12 months. The rally was backed by solid underlying fundamentals, including substantial user growth numbers in its family of apps, which drove revenue up 27% in the first quarter. The company is also seeing a better balance between ad impressions and price, which allows it to generate more revenue.\n\nThe company is becoming more efficient and attractive to advertisers by integrating AI tools to enhance advertising campaigns, which affirms its long-term growth prospects.

Meta AI Studio will allow users to create, share, and discover custom AIs. Thanks to the power of the Llama 3.1 model, AI Studio enables anyone to create custom AI characters without needing any technical skills. Creators can also use AI as an extension of themselves to answer common DM questions and story replies, thereby reaching a wider audience.\n\nThe Meta team wrote the following regarding AI Studio's launch:\n\n\"With AI Studio, we're taking the first steps in creating a world where anyone can harness the creative capabilities of AI - and this is just the beginning.\"\n\nMeta AI Studio is accessible from two locations: the ai.meta.com/ai-studio website or within the Instagram app. AI Studio offers various prompt templates to help users get started. The created custom AI character can be used by the users themselves or shared with followers and friends. They can also make it available for anyone to discover and chat with on Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and the web. AI Studio allows users to customize their AI character's name, personality, tone, avatar, tagline, and more. Meta has also created a step-by-step guide with tips and best practices to help users create their own custom AI characters with ease.\n\nIn general, popular creators receive hundreds of DMs every day, and they are unable to respond to all of them. With AI Studio, Instagram creators can set up an AI to quickly answer common DM questions and story replies. This will allow them to reach more people and satisfy their fans and followers. Additionally, responses from creator AIs are clearly labeled, ensuring full transparency for fans.\n\nMeta's AI Studio aims to democratize AI creation, empowering anyone to craft unique AI personalities for connection and engagement. This could revolutionize how creators interact with their audience, fostering deeper connections and expanding reach.\n\nSource: Meta", "source": {"uri": "neowin.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Neowin"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pradeep_viswanathan@neowin.net", "name": "Pradeep Viswanathan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Avatar (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tagline"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Development_Frameworks", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Development Frameworks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics/Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics/Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2024/07/1722313654_meta_ai_studio_story.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769882", "eventUri": "eng-9769882", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

From search engine takeovers with spurious results to blurring the lines between fact and fiction through the spread of AI image generators, one thing is certain: we live in curious times.\n\nIt's baffling to think that we're still just scratching the surface of what AI can accomplish. OpenAI exec Sam Altman claims that his company's GPT-5 model will be so advanced that you'll look at today's ChatGPT and realize it \"Kind of sucks.\"\n\nFor context, this is the same chatbot that one Scientific American writer tested to uncover an IQ of 155 -- higher than 99.9% of those making up the American WAIS-III standardization sample that measures adult intelligence and cognitive ability.\n\nIt's no wonder that people are concerned about the possibility of AI replacing us. However, to those, I say: relax.\n\nAI won't replace us. We'll replace ourselves with AI. Thanks to Meta's AI Studio, it's never been so simple to digitize your persona and give yourself a multimodal makeover, emerging into the playgrounds of Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram as an AI avatar just waiting to automate your online existence.\n\nAs announced in a blog post yesterday, Meta has begun efforts to make its AI Studio widely available across the US. AI Studio is something of a parallel to OpenAI's \"GPTs\" which allows users to make custom versions of ChatGPT that can be tailored to specific needs and use cases.\n\nMeta's AI Studio is much the same, allowing users to create Llama 3-based conversational AI chatbots designed to cater to specific interests.\n\nHowever, Meta's AI Studio can also create an AI in your own image -- using your Meta account's posts, comments, Stories and highlights, Threads posts, Reels, and more to train a chatbot that acts as an extension of yourself.\n\nThe feature is intended to allow creators to interact with fans more easily, allowing rapid replies to commonly asked questions in comments or DMs. However, your digital double can also be set as private for only yourself to talk to or available to your close friends.\n\nIf you make your AI public, you can even display it on your Instagram profile for others to quickly access chats.\n\nIf you're interested in creating AI characters or browsing through the creations of others, you can check out Meta's AI Studio homepage or through the Instagram app on your phone by starting a new message and tapping on \"Create an AI chat.\"\n\nMeta has provided a handy, easy-to-use, step-by-step guide to see you through the process of creating your AI character, including which information to train it on, levels of privacy, and even topics the chatbot should avoid engaging with.\n\nThe company has also supplied a super-in-depth 18-page handbook for AI Studio that gives instructions and examples on how to make the best AI character using the new tool.\n\nNote that AI Studio is currently only available in the US, which also means you won't be able to share your creations with users outside of the States.

On Instagram, all you have to do is open messaging, start a new message, and then tap on \"Create an AI chat.\"\n\nYou will then be led through a character creation wizard which will let you set your AI character's name, personality, tone, avatar, and tagline. Meta actually created an 18-page \"AI Studio Handbook,\" a PDF document with instructions on how to make the most of AI Studio.\n\nThe AI character that you create is more than just an AI-fied avatar; it's an actual AI-powered character that has specific knowledge and personality. You can even set topics you don't want your AI bot to talk about, or accounts you don't want it to interact with. And yeah, responses from AI characters are labeled as such, so you can't have an AI actually take your place and interact with people while pretending to be you.\n\nTo show off what this tool can do, Meta listed a couple of characters created by celebs and professionals such as chef Marc Murphy or photographer and videographer Angel Barclay.\n\nThere's a pretty big caveat to all this, though: It only works for users in the U.S. This means that users in, say, Europe, will not be able to create their own characters, but it also means they won't even be able to see the AI characters created by others, including the ones listed above.

Meta has announced that US Instagram users can access AI Studio through its website or by initiating an \"AI chat\" directly on Instagram.\n\nMeta's first pass at this concept was having a handful of celebrities create AI versions of themselves with the same likeness but different names and personas. At the time, Meta said it took that approach because it worried about AI versions of celebrities saying problematic things on behalf of their human counterparts. (Even with the controls built into AI Studio, this is still bound to happen. It's generative AI we're dealing with, after all.)\n\nIt seems that Meta is at least aware that this is dicey territory. The company says that AI profiles are clearly labeled everywhere they appear. A company handbook for creators goes into more detail about the AI creation process, and it looks like the onus is on the creator to list the topics an AI won't engage on.

Whether it's sharing facts about themselves or linking to their favorite brands and past videos, creator AIs can help creators reach more people and fans get responses faster,\" writes Meta.\n\nCreators will be able to customise their AI persona based on their Instagram content and can include links they'd like the persona to share as well as topics to avoid. Importantly, fans will know they're chatting to an AI as messages sent using this method will be clearly labelled.\n\nCreators can switch the AI on and off as they please and even choose who the bot responds to.\n\n\"Creators like Chris Ashley, Violet Benson, Don Allen and Kane Kallaway have already created their own AIs. You can check them out by tapping the Message button with the \u2728icon on their Instagram profile,\" reports Meta.\n\nAI Studio is built on Llama 3.1, Meta's latest AI model so users are getting the best experience. However, how well that experience is received will only be revealed over time.\n\nThe fact that the AI creators build is based on their Instagram content may not bode well for some creators.\n\nSadly, over the last few months a number of creators including Herschel Beahm (Dr Disrespect) and Ava Kris Tyson have been accused of and admitted to sending inappropriate messages to minors. If AI Studio uses Instagram content to train personas, we suspect some characters may out their creators as predators.\n\nAs mentioned, AI Studio is only available to US users but you can read more about the product here.", "source": {"uri": "htxt.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "htxt.africa"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brendyn_lotz@htxt.co.za", "name": "Brendyn Lotz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violet_Benson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Violet Benson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kane_(wrestler)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kane (wrestler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cultural icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Complimentary_Products", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Complimentary Products", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://htxt.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AI-Studio_Header.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769882", "eventUri": "eng-9769882", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The social media giant announced the AI avatar creation platform last year during its Connect event and it is now available to some users on its photo and video sharing platform. Powered by the recently released Llama 3.1 405B artificial intelligence (AI) model, AI Studio can create mini chatbots dubbed AI characters with a specific knowledge base that can interact with other users. Instagram creators can also use the tool to build AI-powered digital avatars of themselves to interact with those who follow them.\n\nIn a newsroom post, Meta announced that its AI Studio is now rolling out to users. It can be accessed either through the Instagram app or the AI Studio website. Currently, the feature is limited to those residing in the US. Making the announcement, the company said, \"AI Studio lets anyone create and discover AI characters and allows creators to build an AI as an extension of themselves to reach more fans.\"\n\nThere are two distinct features within AI Studio. First is AI characters. This feature will allow any user to create an AI-powered character completer with a name, tagline, and description. The user can add this information, and based on that, AI will generate a mini chatbot that will adhere to those instructions. Once created, the AI character can interact with other users across Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and the web.\n\nIn functionality, the feature is similar to AI agents. These are mini chatbots created with a specific knowledge base and purpose. They usually only generate responses in that specific domain without losing their conversational nature. OpenAI has similar AI agents it calls GPTs. Google Gemini's AI agents are known as Gemma.\n\nHowever, Instagram isn't the first to introduce this feature in the social media space. Platforms such as Character.ai and Butterflies already allow users to create such AI characters.\n\nAnother feature in AI Studio is available only to Instagram creators. While Meta did not disclose the eligibility criteria, it said that creators can use the AI platform to create AI avatars of themselves that can respond to direct messages (DMs) and story replies.\n\nThis automation is aimed at those creators who have a large number of unanswered messages and struggle to connect with those who follow them. The tool will let them engage and respond to all of them.\n\nThe feature was first reported in April. At the time, the company was said to be running initial tests on the feature. It was also said to be extended to the comment section and let AI avatars reply to comments on their posts and Reels.\n\nAI avatars will be customisable, and Meta says creators will be able to base these avatars on things such as their \"Instagram content, topics to avoid and links they want it to share.\" Creators will also be able to turn auto-replies on and off through the professional dashboard within the Instagram app and choose who the AI replies to. Further, the responses generated using AI will be labelled to help the user know who is responding.", "source": {"uri": "gadgets360.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV Gadgets 360"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avatar (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knowledge base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character.ai", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Character.ai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/meta_instagram_ai_studio_1722321026057.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769882", "eventUri": "eng-9769882", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

The company has become virtually unforgettable as a key player in the AI revolution thanks to its gold-standard graphics processing units (GPUs), which provide the computational horsepower that underpins AI.\n\nIf you have any doubts, consider this: For the company's fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), record revenue of $26 billion soared 262% year over year, while its diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.98 surged 629%.\n\nYet, as the AI revolution gains steam, some investors are questioning Nvidia's staying power, concerned with the onset of competition and a rich valuation. As a result, some investors have already moved on from the chipmaker in search of the \"next big thing\" in AI. Perusing the holdings of a highly successful hedge fund manager might provide food for thought.\n\nBillionaire Daniel Loeb is one such money manager, having made a name for himself as the CEO of Third Point, which he founded in 1995. From humble beginnings and starting capital of just $3.4 million, Loeb parlayed his seed money into assets under management of nearly $7.8 billion.\n\nHe's been crystal clear regarding his opinion on the potential of AI. He believes it will be \"transformational,\" providing the catalyst for a \"profound economic upheaval.\" Loeb believes so strongly in AI that it's the \"key element\" in the thesis of nearly half the fund's stock holdings.\n\nThree are by far his largest AI holdings.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 1: Amazon -- 11.8% of holdings\n\nThird Point is heavily invested in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), having held a stake in the e-commerce and cloud kingpin for years. Loebe waxed poetic about the vast potential of Amazon in an interview in 2022. While the company was then valued at roughly $1.6 trillion, Loeb believed Amazon possessed $1 trillion in \"untapped value.\" He argued that the online retail segment alone was worth more than $1 trillion, while its cloud infrastructure segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), was worth $1.5 trillion.\n\nLoeb recently suggested that the \"most direct consequence\" of the rapid adoption of AI is \"an acceleration in cloud usage\" for businesses looking to leverage the large language models that form the foundation of generative AI. This includes the big three cloud providers -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure, AWS, and Alphabet's Google Cloud. He further believes these cloud services are the \"'picks and shovels' of the AI gold rush and should benefit regardless of which products ultimately 'strike gold.'\"\n\nLoeb increased his Amazon holdings by roughly 21% in the first quarter, bringing his total stake to 5.1 million shares worth about $930 million and nearly 12% of Third Point's portfolio. Furthermore, at roughly 3 times forward sales, Amazon is still attractively priced.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 2: Microsoft -- 9.5% of holdings\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is widely credited with helping to kick off the mad dash to AI adoption, as the company was quick off the mark to integrate AI across a broad cross-section of its products and services.\n\nThe poster child for those efforts is Microsoft Copilot, the company's AI-fueled digital assistant. Copilot offers a suite of functionality that helps to streamline and automate time-consuming chores, boosting productivity in the process. Not only is demand for Copilot robust, but AI is also helping increase market share for Microsoft's Azure cloud.\n\nWhile the company has thus far been mum about how much incremental revenue Copilot has generated, Loeb estimates that \"Copilot software ... could increase [Microsoft's] revenues by as much as $25 billion or more on software sales alone.\"\n\nThird Point trimmed its Microsoft position by about 12% in the first quarter, even as the total value of its position increased -- thanks to a dividend payment and the stock's 12% move higher in Q1.\n\nMicrosoft stock was currently selling for a premium at 36 times earnings. That said, the company is already one of the early beneficiaries of the AI revolution and has positioned itself for further gains.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 3: Meta Platforms -- 7.7% of holdings\n\nThe ongoing recovery of the digital advertising market likely factored into Loeb's considerable position in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), but the company has also established itself as a dark horse candidate in AI.\n\nMeta has a distinguished history of using AI to surface relevant content to users on its various social media platforms and target the advertising that generates 98% of the company's revenue.\n\nMeta's current efforts are focused firmly on the future. The company recently debuted the latest version of its Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), which is available on each major cloud infrastructure platform, paying Meta a fee to carry it.\n\nWith billions of daily users on its social media platforms, the company boasts a treasure trove of data to train its AI systems, which have been gaining popularity. Furthermore, this is an entirely new revenue stream for Meta, though the impact on its financial results isn't yet clear.\n\nThird Point initiated a position in Meta during the third quarter of 2023 and has increased his holdings each quarter since that time, recently boosting his position by 7%. That brings Third Point's stake to 1.24 million shares worth $577 million and nearly 8% of the hedge fund's holdings.\n\nLoeb hasn't said much about his Meta position except to point out that it was the fund's biggest winner in the first quarter. That said, Loeb focuses on \"high-quality companies trading at reasonable valuations,\" and Meta certainly qualifies using those criteria. The stock currently sells for less than 27 times earnings, a discount compared to a multiple of 29 for the S&P 500.\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $692,784!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

People can tell their bot what types of questions to answer, or which topics to avoid, Meta wrote in a blog post.\n\nThe broader universe of Instagram users will be able to make a themed chatbot for their profile, for example a bot focused on mixed martial arts, dining or pets.\n\nBoth features will roll out more broadly in the coming weeks.\n\nMeta first announced AI Studio last September. On Monday, the company started shipping the features for some users, timing that will coincide with Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg's appearance alongside Nvidia Corp. CEO Jensen Huang at the ACM SIGGRAPH conference in Denver this week.\n\nMeta has been spending aggressively on AI in recent years, and Zuckerberg has been open about his expectation that the company will develop some of the best chatbots in the world. It already offers its own AI chatbot, called Meta AI, inside Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook.\n\nMeta released its most recent large language model, the technology used to power chatbots, earlier this month. That new model can solve complex math problems and analyze entire books almost instantly, and also allows users to generate new images of themselves in various scenarios using only a text prompt.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIGGRAPH", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SIGGRAPH"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association for Computing Machinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Computer", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Computer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Presentation", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Presentation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.themebuilder.aws.arc.pub%2Fbellmediainc%2F1717607291216.jpg?auth=ef34cf3f59642485b12f79845baaee98582b911ca4d3aeb27d8722b9c453587b&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769882", "eventUri": "eng-9769882", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The social media giant reported strong earnings for the first quarter but provided disappointing guidance, which led to a 15% drop in its shares on the day of the report. Nonetheless, its shares are up 33% year-to-date, making it one of the top performers among the Magnificent Seven stocks so far in 2024.\n\nIn the second quarter, investors will be looking for continued strong advertising earnings and progress in the development of the artificial intelligence (AI) tool, Llama 3.1 model. Meanwhile, Meta's ambitious spending on AI advancements could also be a point of concern.\n\nForecasts\n\nAccording to FactSet, Meta is expected to report revenue of $38.3 billion (\u20ac35.26 billion) for the second quarter, representing 19.6% growth from the same quarter last year. The earnings per share are anticipated to be $4.71 (\u20ac4.34), making a 57% growth year-on-year. Despite continued expansion, the predicted pace of growth suggests a slowdown compared to the previous quarter.\n\nIn the first quarter, Meta reported earnings per share of $4.71(\u20ac4.34) on total sales revenue of $36.46 billion (\u20ac33.56) billion. Its revenue represented a 27% increase year on year, while the net income more than doubled from the first quarter of 2023. Meta projected overall sales to be between $36.5 (\u20ac33.6 billion) and $39 billion (\u20ac35.6 billion), with the mid-point $38.2 billion (\u20ac35.2 billion) lower than analysts' forecast.\n\nAdditionally, investors will closely monitor Meta's guidance for the third quarter, with analysts expecting revenue to increase by 14.7% year over year. Growth is forecast to further slow to a 12.6% increase in the final quarter of this year, suggesting a relatively subdued remainder of the year.\n\nBusiness spotlight\n\nThe key metric of Meta's performance shifted from subscription numbers to advertising revenue since the final quarter of 2023, as it stopped providing daily and monthly active users for separate family apps. Instead, it started a new combined metric of Family daily active people (DAP).\n\nIn the first quarter, advertising income was a primary driver of sales, experiencing a 27% growth to $35.64 billion, which contributed 98% of its total revenue. Meta benefited from the advertising efforts of Chinese overseas online retailers such as Temu and Shein since the second half of 2023. However, both the US and the European Union are considering raising tariffs on inexpensive goods primarily imported from China through these e-commerce retailers. In the US election year, increasing odds of a Trump victory could impact the advertising income of social media companies, including Meta and Google.\n\nMeta's capital expenditure remains a concern for investors as CEO Mark Zuckerberg has indicated plans to increase spending on AI-related projects, such as AI training, and high computing chips in its data centers. The company anticipates full-year 2024 capital expenditures will range from $35 billion (\u20ac32.2 billion) to $40 billion (\u20ac36.8 billion), representing a 42% increase from 2023.\n\nThe AI advancement is yet to be monetised\n\nMeta stands as one of the front-runners in the AI race, with its generative AI large language models (LLMs) model, LIama 3.1 405B, announced on 23 July. Unlike AI tools of other tech giants, Llama 3 is an open source model, which allows the third party developers to access and modify its code. Meta claims this approach will save half the costs compared to tools like ChatGPT. CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes Llama will become the most popular AI assistant by the end of this year. However, an open-source AI model also exposes the company to security risks and potential regulatory hurdles.\n\nMeta has launched its AI models across its social apps, including Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger. These AI services are currently free and have yet to be monetised.\n\nAt the earnings press conference, Zuckerberg noted: \"We've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetising it.\"\n\nDespite the lack of immediate monetised profit from the AI tool, Meta is likely to introduce ads into AI interactions on its social platforms or charge for access to its AI model.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The once seemingly unstoppable electric vehicle pioneer Tesla just reported an abysmal second quarter that saw its net income drop by more than half from a year ago while Nvidia seems incapable of slowing down, growing last quarter's net income by more than 600%.\n\nDriving Nvidia's explosive growth is its position at the center of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom that's lifting the tide for all boats in tech, at least those without slipping EV sales. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Apple have all benefited, seeing their stock prices appreciate significantly.\n\nWhile it also saw a big bump in share price, up 34% this year, Meta Platforms (META 0.54%) hasn't been quite as front and center in the AI hype cycle as some of the other big tech players. I think that's changing. Here are a few reasons why it's one of my favorite stocks in technology today.\n\nMeta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has caught a lot of flak for his big bet on virtual reality (VR). The company is spending billions on developing its \"metaverse\" technology, imagining a future where people spend their time in an immersive, digital world.\n\nThe plan hasn't exactly panned out, and there's certainly a chance it never will. So why am I talking about VR? Well, for one, Meta plans on integrating its VR tech with AI, but the larger point is that Zuckerberg isn't afraid to make big bets on the future and to spend enormous amounts of money making it a reality. Oh, and Meta has enormous amounts of capital to spend. Take a look at this chart showing the company's recent capital expenditures (capex) and free cash flow (FCF).\n\nMETA Free Cash Flow data by YCharts\n\nNotice the massive upswing in FCF? Meta has a lot of cash to play with, and it plans on using it. The company recently raised its expected capex in 2024 to $35 billion-$40 billion as it \"invest[s] aggressively to support [its] ambitious AI research and product development efforts.\"\n\nThese efforts will improve upon the company's flagship AI product, Meta AI, already released to the public and integrated into its products like Facebook and Instagram. Now, pouring money into development doesn't always pan out -- and it's important to consider what could happen here -- but when it does, the payoff can be huge.\n\nLooking to expand the horizons of a business is important, but not at the expense of your core business. Luckily, Meta isn't at risk of doing that anytime soon. Maybe Facebook at this point seems passe; maybe it seems like only your grandmother and her friends use it, but it is still the most popular social media platform in the world with a very active user base. Meta owns the first-, third-, fourth-, and seventh-most popular social media platforms in the world.\n\nAccording to the company, 3.24 billion people use one or more of its platforms daily. It's not slowing down, either; that number grew by 7% last quarter from the year-ago period.\n\nThis breadth and depth of engagement make Meta ad space valuable -- a good thing, because ad revenue makes up 99% of the company's bottom line. Last quarter saw the company's total revenue spike 27% year over year, driven primarily by a 20% jump in ad impressions -- industry jargon for ads seen on a screen -- and a 6% jump in the price of ads.\n\nMeta is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 28 and a forward P/E of just 23 -- that's pretty low for a tech company. Take a look at its forward P/E vs some peers'.\n\nI think this presents a great buying opportunity. So much of the hype has focused on other players in big tech, but Meta looks to be doing all the right things, and its stock price has yet to catch up.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "johnny_rice@fool.com", "name": "Johnny Rice", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price\u2013earnings_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price\u2013earnings ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/784491/gettyimages-1485141008-1200x684-5c42ead.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769882", "eventUri": "eng-9769882", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}
{"uri": "8250426139", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-07-30", "time": "10:25:59", "dateTime": "2024-07-30T10:25:59Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-07-30T10:23:26Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/30/4-reasons-to-buy-meta-stock-before-july-31/", "title": "4 Reasons to Buy Meta Stock Before July 31 | The Motley Fool", "body": "Meta is looking solid ahead of its scheduled earnings report.\n\nThe Meta Platforms (META 0.00%) of today is a far cry from the simple website it was at the beginning. Today, the company owns a family of apps that mediate social interaction for billions of people worldwide.\n\nWhen was the last time you posted to Instagram? How about the last time you messaged someone on WhatsApp? Bought something on Facebook Marketplace? Meta is part of daily life for much of the world, and that makes it very valuable. It recently surpassed $1 trillion in market capitalization and is now the seventh-largest company in the world.\n\nThe company achieved this after its stock soared more than 43% since this time last year. Now that's a big move, but I think it could go much further. Despite this run-up, Meta is still undervalued. With the company gearing up to release Q2 earnings on July 31, let's consider why.\n\nEvery day, 3.24 billion people worldwide use Meta products. It owns the first-, third-, fourth-, and seventh-most-popular social media platforms in the world, reaching the most people of any social media company.\n\nYes, younger users are migrating away from Facebook, but about 43% of its users are between 18 and 34. And Meta has Instagram, which remains very popular with younger users.\n\nThe company is growing its user base steadily. The first quarter Q1 saw a 7% bump year over year. Pay attention to this metric on July 31.\n\nAll these users make Meta's virtual real estate extremely valuable. That's good news for the company; it makes 99% of its revenue from selling ads, and the company has been growing its bottom line at a strong clip for some time now. Look at this growth over the last five years.\n\nGrowth leveled off for a moment in 2022, a tough year for tech across the board, but it's back in high gear. Last quarter, the company reported a 27% jump in revenue from a year ago, largely stemming from the 20% jump in ad impressions, which were 6% more expensive compared to the same period in 2023. Consensus estimates put Q2 revenue growth at just shy of 26%. Let's see Meta delivers.\n\nMuch of the focus of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom for the last year and a half has been on Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, but Meta is back in the spotlight after the release of Meta AI, an AI product that is integrated across its family of apps. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes the chatbot will be the most widely used in the world by the end of the year. Now, CEOs are always making bold claims, but Meta AI will be freely available and integrated into the apps that 3.24 billion people use every day, so I wouldn't be surprised if his claim holds up.\n\nPowering Meta AI is the company's large language model (LLM), dubbed Llama. The newest version, version 3.1, just came out and with it, the company makes a bold move. Llama is now open source, meaning people from all over the world can contribute to its growth and development. The other major players, like ChatGPT, are proprietary; only employees can interact with the backend. Zuckerberg is making a bet that the collective knowledge of the public can help Llama outpace its rivals. It's a risky bet, but one that could pay off and that makes Meta stand out from the crowd.\n\nIf all that weren't enough, Meta's stock is one of the cheapest in tech. Look at this chart of its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) compared to its competitors'.\n\nThe only company valued lower is Alphabet, and only by a hair. If you also consider its forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- a valuation metric that divides P/E by its expected growth rate -- Meta looks even better. Alphabet has a five-year forward PEG of 1.24, while Meta's is just 1.07. There are, of course, other ways to look at valuation, but in my eyes, Meta looks like a great deal at the moment.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "johnny_rice@fool.com", "name": "Johnny Rice", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace_(radio_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketplace (radio program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open source model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price\u2013earnings_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price\u2013earnings ratio"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/784883/finance-84-600x355-564af5c.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769882", "eventUri": "eng-9769882", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 871, "textEnd": 878, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

The new AI Studio tools are now available widely to creators in the US, months after they were announced during the Meta Connect event last year.\n\nMeta said that the AI personas of creators will solve one of Instagram's biggest problems: the deluge of daily messages that most creators cannot keep up with. With the help of AI avatars, creators can reach and interact with a large audience without involvement. \"These creators can actually use the comments that they've made, the captions that they've made, the transcripts of the Reels that they've posted, as well as any custom instructions or links that they want to provide...so that the AI can answer on their behalf,\" Engadget quoted Connor Hayes, vice president of Product for AI Studio at Meta, as saying.\n\nBut that is not where the company wants to stop in terms of how it can make creator AIs more useful. In an interview with Bloomberg, Meta's chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg said he hopes there will eventually be \"hundreds of millions\" of creator AIs across Meta's apps. While their purpose is unclear, Zuckerberg wants more engagement on all the company's platforms. However, whether or not users would want to interact with the AI personas of their favourite creators is something only time will tell.\n\nMeta previously introduced AI avatars of popular celebrities like Kendall Jenner and Snoop Dogg, but people do not seem interested in interacting with them.

Now, Meta is making the tools available to more US-based creators and giving the rest of its users the chance to experiment with specialized AI \"characters.\"\n\nAccording to Meta, the new creator AIs are meant to address a long-running issue for Instagram users with large followings: it can be nearly impossible for the service's most popular users to keep up with the flood of messages they receive every day. Now, though, they'll be able to make an AI that functions as \"an extension of themselves,\" says Connor Hayes, who is VP of Product for AI Studio at Meta.\n\n\"These creators can actually use the comments that they've made, the captions that they've made, the transcripts of the Reels that they've posted, as well as any custom instructions or links that they want to provide ... so that the AI can answer on their behalf,\" Hayes tells Engadget.\n\nMark Zuckerberg has suggested he has big ambitions for such chatbots.

The company's revenue grew by a significant 11 percent, reaching a staggering $32 billion for the quarter ending on June 30.\n\nA major contributor to Meta's growth was its digital advertising revenue, which rose by an impressive 12 percent during the same period. This rate of growth outpaced that of Google, which reported a 3 percent increase in ad revenue for the same quarter.\n\nBreaking down the digital advertising revenue generated by Meta Platforms in Q2, it shows that $14,131 million came from the United States and Canada, $7,268 million from Europe, $6,435 million from the Asia Pacific region, and $3,664 million from the Rest of the World.\n\nFacebook's monthly active user base touched $270 million in US & Canada, $409 million in Europe, $1,349 million in Asia-Pacific, and $1,002 million in Rest of World. ARPU from Facebook reached $10.63 in Q2 2023 vs $9.62 in Q1 2023.\n\nThese financial results from Meta Platforms come right after a strong performance from Google's parent company, Alphabet. Despite broader economic concerns, both companies' solid financial performance indicates that consumers and advertisers are continuing to spend on digital platforms.\n\nHowever, Meta has indicated that it expects expenses to rise in the years 2023 and 2024. The company attributed these anticipated cost increases to factors like legal fees and the need for increased spending on infrastructure, especially in the highly competitive field of artificial intelligence.\n\nTo accommodate the increased expenses, Meta Platforms has made some strategic changes, including aggressive cost-cutting in various areas of the company. For example, there were reductions in safety teams and other basic business functions.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, the Chief Executive of Meta, expressed his optimism about the company's future. He highlighted strong engagement across their apps and unveiled an exciting roadmap that includes the launch of products like Llama 2, Threads, Reels, and new AI offerings. Additionally, Meta plans to release the highly anticipated Quest 3 this fall.\n\nDespite the rising expenses, Meta Platforms is managing its capital expenditure. The company has adjusted its forecast for 2023, pushing some artificial intelligence-related costs into 2024, when an increase in capital expenditure is expected.\n\nNotably, the financial report for the second quarter also revealed that Meta Platforms incurred significant legal costs, including a massive fine of 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) by Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner in May. The fine was imposed for the company's alleged transfer of user information to the United States.\n\nHeadcount was 71,469 as of June 30, a decrease of 14 per cent year-over-year. Approximately half of the employees impacted by the 2023 layoffs are included in the reported headcount.\n\nMeta expects the third quarter (Q3) 2023 total revenue to be in the range of $32-$34.5 billion.\n\nIt also anticipates that the full-year 2023 total expenses will be in the range of $88-$91 billion, increased from the prior range of $86-$90 billion. This outlook includes about $4 billion of restructuring costs related to facilities consolidation charges and severance and other personnel costs.\n\nMeta Platforms' strong financial performance in the second quarter demonstrates the continued popularity of its platforms and the potential for growth despite the challenges posed by legal matters and increasing expenses.", "source": {"uri": "infotechlead.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InfotechLead"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data Protection Commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://infotechlead.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Facebook-Meta.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769882", "eventUri": "eng-9769882", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 298, "textEnd": 305, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

The toolset allows creators to create an AI persona that can answer questions and engage in chats on their behalf. Initially introduced at Meta's Connect event last fall, the technology has been tested by a select group of prominent Instagram users and is now being expanded to more US-based creators.\n\nThe AI personas are designed to help popular Instagram users manage the high volume of messages they receive. According to Connor Hayes, VP of Product for AI Studio at Meta, these AIs function as \"an extension of themselves.\" Creators can train the AI to respond on their behalf using their own comments, captions, Reels transcripts, and any custom instructions or links.\n\nMeta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg has high expectations for these chatbots, predicting \"hundreds of millions\" of creator-made AIs on Meta's apps in the future. However, it is still uncertain whether Instagram users will embrace interacting with AI versions of their favorite creators. Previous attempts by Meta to create celebrity-branded chatbots like Snoop Dogg and Kendall Jenner received mixed responses.\n\nThe AI Studio is not exclusive to creators; any Instagram user can create custom AI \"characters\" that can discuss specific topics, generate memes or provide advice. These chatbots will be powered by Meta's new Llama 3.1 model. Users can share their chatbot creations and monitor usage statistics but won't have access to other users' interactions with them.\n\nMeta has been actively integrating its AI into various aspects of its apps, encouraging users to spend more time interacting with it. However, there have been instances where the AI struggled to relay accurate information. To address this issue and ensure responsible use of AIs, Meta has implemented policies and protections.

In April, Meta's upward revision in full-year expenses shaved off nearly $170 billion from its market capitalization in a single day.\n\nAlphabet's warning last week that capital expenses would stay high this year, overshadowed a jump in ad sales and pushed its stock down.\n\nMeta is betting on an open-source approach for its generative AI push. The company released its mostly free Llama 3.1 artificial intelligence model last week, and said developers can use and modify its AI models free of charge.\n\nIt has burnished its ad-buying products with AI tools and introduced new AI features such as a chat assistant to drive engagement on its social media properties. On Monday, it said it would roll out a new tool called AI Studio that would allow users to create, share and design personalized AI chatbots.\n\n\"We are bullish on Meta's position as a key pillar of open-source AI,\" Jefferies analysts said, adding that the company could potentially unlock new revenue streams by licensing its AI models or creating AI apps.\n\nMeta shares have risen 32% this year, compared with a near 16% rise in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nThe company will also need to show its bread and butter ad business is thriving when it reports second-quarter results on Wednesday.\n\nGroupM, one of the world's largest media buying firms, raised its 2024 global advertising growth forecast to 7.8% in June, from 5.3% in December, which augurs well for Meta.\n\nSmaller ad-dependent companies Pinterest and Snap are scheduled to report results on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\n\"We remain positive on Meta and think Reels, Messaging and AI-driven ad improvements are still early, and could lead to positive product surprises and revenue upside,\" analysts at BofA Securities said.\n\n\"With political spend, and potential TikTok ban in 1Q'25, Meta could also see an ad spend benefit in 2H'24.\"\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru;

These AI avatars can interact in chat threads, respond to comments, and even manage direct messages on behalf of the user. This functionality is particularly useful for creators who want to maintain a presence on social media without being constantly active.\n\nTo get started with AI Studio, Instagram users in the US can either visit the AI Studio website or initiate a new \"AI chat\" directly within the Instagram app. This easy setup process allows users to customize their AI avatar based on their existing content, preferred topics, and links they wish to share. Users can also control specific interactions, such as setting auto-replies and determining which accounts the AI can engage with.\n\nIn addition to personalized avatars, AI Studio enables the creation of entirely new AI characters that can be deployed across Meta's platforms, including WhatsApp and Messenger. This feature mirrors the offerings of startups like Character.AI and Replika, where users engage with themed chatbots. Similar to OpenAI's custom GPT store, Meta plans to showcase these user-created AI characters, allowing others to interact with them.\n\nMeta initially explored this concept by partnering with celebrities to create AI avatars that mirrored their likeness but had different names and personas.

One plausible reason behind the recent tech sell-off has been the group's demanding valuations, because these companies need a lot more than merely a \"beat\" on the headline numbers to justify those premiums.\n\nAmid the fall in tech stocks, Meta Platforms has lost 13% from its 52-week highs, and is in the correction zone after having fallen over 10% from the peak. Can Meta - which was the only \"Magnificent 7\" stock to fall after its Q1 earnings release, and lost $132 billion in market cap in a single day- recoup its recent losses after the Q2 earnings release? We'll discuss in this article, beginning with a preview of what Wall Street expects from the Facebook parent's Q2 earnings.\n\nMeta Platforms Q2 Earnings Preview\n\nAnalysts expect Meta to report revenues of $38.3 billion in Q2, a YoY rise of 19.6%. During the Q1earnings call Meta Platforms' management forecast revenues between $36.5 billion and $39 billion for Q2, which - at the midpoint of $37.75 billion - arrived below the $38.3 billion that analysts were expecting.\n\nConsensus estimates call for Meta's Q2 earnings per share (EPS) to come in at $4.69, which implies a YoY rise of over 45%. Meta's bottom line has grown at a brisk pace over the last year, thanks to the relentless focus on cost cuts.\n\nWhat to Watch in Meta's Q2 Earnings\n\nAlong with the headline numbers, I would watch for the following when Meta reports its Q2 earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell rings:\n\nMeta Stock Forecast: Analysts Turn Bullish Ahead of Q2 Earnings\n\nWall Street analysts have given Meta a consensus rating of \"Strong Buy,\" and its mean target price of $538.76 is 15.7% higher than last week's closing prices. Its Street-high target price of $630 is 35.3% higher than those levels.\n\nIf anything, analysts have been turning incrementally bullish on Meta ahead of its Q2 report, as Oppenheimer and Bernstein raised the stock's target price heading into the confessional, while Morgan Stanley advised buying the dip.\n\nShould You Buy the Dip in Meta Stock?\n\nTo be sure, Meta faces several risks and challenges this year. A possible return of Donald Trump (with his VP pick, JD Vance) is hardly the ideal outcome for tech giants, and more so for Meta, as the former President has been a vocal critic of the company. Also, a crackdown on Chinese imports under a Trump presidency could hurt Meta's revenues from China-based advertisers.\n\nThat said, AI looks like a near-term opportunity for Meta, as the company leverages the technology to boost its revenues. Its metaverse investments could also be a game changer in the long term, even as the business is currently losing billions of dollars every quarter.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Meta trades at a next-12 months price-to-earnings (PE) multiple of 22.3x, which while not particularly steep, is not exactly mouthwatering either. Overall, I believe it would make sense to buy the dip in Meta shares, but not go all out, yet given the many headwinds the company faces in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: AAPL , AMZN , META , GOOG , TSLA , MSFT .

JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth said Meta's company-wide costs could reach up to $50 billion in 2025, fueled by AI spending.\n\nThe social media giant will reveal its recent expenditures on AI and the metaverse during its quarterly earnings report Wednesday. Analysts expect Meta to thrive because of its new AI features and a \"healthy\" digital advertising market, driven in part by the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Despite forecasts of strong sales, the company's stock could suffer -- like Google and Tesla's last week -- if it posts higher-than-anticipated AI spending.\n\nAnmuth said in a note to investors Monday that \"investors are bracing for further potential increases\" to Meta's AI spending. Analysts expected the company's capital expenditures to hit $9.5 billion in the second quarter, a nearly 50% increase from the first three months of the year. They foresee Meta's total spending in 2024 hitting between $35 billion and $40 billion -- and next year's spending to reach $42 billion. Anmuth thinks Meta's costs in 2025 could go $8 billion over that estimate, as high as $50 billion.\n\nWall Street is wary of hefty bills racked up by Big Tech as industry giants build out AI infrastructure and develop the latest artificial intelligence software. The Nasdaq hit its lowest point so far this year after Google and Tesla revealed their latest AI expenditures, apparently without sufficient answers for when those investments will start to pay off. Google's expenditures are on a similar trajectory, with analysts expecting the company's costs to increase 51% to about $50 billion in 2024.\n\nBut Mark Zuckerberg thinks Meta's AI investments will begin to show their worth sooner than later. The CEO has said he thinks Meta's recently-released Llama 3.1 will become the most widely-used AI model by the end of 2024 and \"the most advanced in the industry\" by the beginning of next year. And he's willing to spend the money -- and possibly overspend -- to continue Meta's AI advancements.\n\nI think that there's a meaningful chance that a lot of the companies are over-building now, and that you'll look back and you're like, 'Oh, we maybe all spent some number of billions of dollars more than we had to.' On the flip side, I actually think all the companies that are investing are making a rational decision, because the downside of being behind is that you're out of position for like the most important technology for the next 10 to 15 years. -- Mark Zuckerberg in a recent interview with the Los Angeles Times\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives has emphasized that Meta's AI spending is distinct from the wasteful dollars it's put into developing the metaverse.\n\n\"We strongly contrast this is not Meta/Zuckerberg spending on metaverse from 2 years ago, instead this is an AI arms race taking place in the U.S., China, and around the globe for building out the enterprise and consumer AI ecosystem. Rome was not built in a day and neither will this unprecedented AI Revolution.\"\n\nTo be sure, several industry experts and studies have taken issue with calling the development of AI an \"arms race.\" But whatever you want to call this AI moment we've entered, it's clear that companies and analysts believe AI spending is key to future success.\n\nMeta's AI advancements haven't come without issues. The company had to hit the brakes on releasing some generative AI tools in Brazil and Europe as regulatory scrutiny of the technology heats up. The EU has been probing Meta's advertising model, and Zuckerberg apparently doesn't want to risk further scuffles. Brazil banned Meta from training its AI models on Brazilians' personal data.\n\nAnalysts at JPMorgan and Bank of America maintained their buy ratings of Meta stock despite wariness over AI spending. Meta shares have risen nearly 135% over the last five years and are up 44% from last year. The company's stock price has swung up and down since April.

Today, the company owns a family of apps that mediate social interaction for billions of people worldwide.\n\nWhen was the last time you posted to Instagram? How about the last time you messaged someone on WhatsApp? Bought something on Facebook Marketplace? Meta is part of daily life for much of the world, and that makes it very valuable. It recently surpassed $1 trillion in market capitalization and is now the seventh-largest company in the world.\n\nThe company achieved this after its stock soared more than 43% since this time last year. Now that's a big move, but I think it could go much further. Despite this run-up, Meta is still undervalued. With the company gearing up to release Q2 earnings on July 31, let's consider why.\n\n1. Meta products reach a staggering amount of people across the globe\n\nEvery day, 3.24 billion people worldwide use Meta products. It owns the first-, third-, fourth-, and seventh-most-popular social media platforms in the world, reaching the most people of any social media company.\n\nYes, younger users are migrating away from Facebook, but about 43% of its users are between 18 and 34. And Meta has Instagram, which remains very popular with younger users.\n\nThe company is growing its user base steadily. The first quarter Q1 saw a 7% bump year over year. Pay attention to this metric on July 31.\n\n2. Meta's billions of eyeballs mean billions of dollars for the bottom line\n\nAll these users make Meta's virtual real estate extremely valuable. That's good news for the company; it makes 99% of its revenue from selling ads, and the company has been growing its bottom line at a strong clip for some time now. Look at this growth over the last five years.\n\nMETA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nGrowth leveled off for a moment in 2022, a tough year for tech across the board, but it's back in high gear. Last quarter, the company reported a 27% jump in revenue from a year ago, largely stemming from the 20% jump in ad impressions, which were 6% more expensive compared to the same period in 2023. Consensus estimates put Q2 revenue growth at just shy of 26%. Let's see Meta delivers.\n\n3. Meta's AI story is just taking flight\n\nMuch of the focus of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom for the last year and a half has been on Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, but Meta is back in the spotlight after the release of Meta AI, an AI product that is integrated across its family of apps. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes the chatbot will be the most widely used in the world by the end of the year. Now, CEOs are always making bold claims, but Meta AI will be freely available and integrated into the apps that 3.24 billion people use every day, so I wouldn't be surprised if his claim holds up.\n\nPowering Meta AI is the company's large language model (LLM), dubbed Llama. The newest version, version 3.1, just came out and with it, the company makes a bold move. Llama is now open source, meaning people from all over the world can contribute to its growth and development. The other major players, like ChatGPT, are proprietary; only employees can interact with the backend. Zuckerberg is making a bet that the collective knowledge of the public can help Llama outpace its rivals. It's a risky bet, but one that could pay off and that makes Meta stand out from the crowd.\n\n4. Despite all it has going for it, its stock is still cheap\n\nIf all that weren't enough, Meta's stock is one of the cheapest in tech. Look at this chart of its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) compared to its competitors'.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nThe only company valued lower is Alphabet, and only by a hair. If you also consider its forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- a valuation metric that divides P/E by its expected growth rate -- Meta looks even better. Alphabet has a five-year forward PEG of 1.24, while Meta's is just 1.07. There are, of course, other ways to look at valuation, but in my eyes, Meta looks like a great deal at the moment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $692,784!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Kids today won't learn shame at Instagram's knee the way we did. Not after Meta's latest update, at least, which gives users a way to create an entirely artificial version of themselves that'll interact with real-life people. And each other, we guess.\n\nThe idea is to give creators, brands, and celebrities a way to engage with their followers without actually doing any work. Beyond the effort it takes to create and tweak their new chatbot, of course, using Meta's new 'AI Studio' feature. Like most of Meta's AI features, it's rolling out to the US first before it makes its way elsewhere, though Meta hasn't commented on when that might be.\n\n\"Anyone can create their own AI designed to make you laugh, generate memes, give travel advice and so much more,\" Meta's announcement reads. \"Creators can also make an AI as an extension of themselves to answer common DM questions and story replies, helping them reach more people.\"\n\nUsers can head to the AI Studio website to get their Llama 3.1-based AI model going, or by starting up a new \"AI chat\" within Instagram itself. Once a creator has a new AI clone, they can choose how it interacts with followers by teaching it the content its creator is familiar with, which topics to avoid, or the links you want it to share.\n\nYou're essentially PR training a chatbot, which can be directed to handle automatic replies if need be, or trained to only engage with specific accounts. If you aren't interested in seeing yourself represented in AI form, you can create any number of personal AI chatbots to keep yourself entertained that needn't interact in the real world.\n\nThis isn't Meta's first brush with AI chatbots. If you remember 'Snoop Dogg, the Dungeon Master', you're already familiar with the basic concept. Except back then, it was reserved for a limited number of celebrities, whose chatbots included entirely different personas (see: Snoop Dogg, the Dungeon Master) and names to avoid any backlash from any overly enthusiastic messages.\n\nThe feature was never exactly a hit among users in the US. According to Connor Hayes, VP of product for AI Studio speaking with Engadget, the company's first attempt didn't quite pan out due to users being 'confused' by who or what they were talking to. \"We think that going in this direction where the public figures can represent themselves, or an AI that's an extension of themselves, will be a lot clearer,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "stuff.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stuff"}, "authors": [{"uri": "trent_meikle@stuff.co.za", "name": "Trent Meikle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dungeon Master"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engadget", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engadget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snoop Dogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://stuff.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Instagram-AI-chatbots-header.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769882", "eventUri": "eng-9769882", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Recently, Meta also started to test the feature. Meta did not share the timeline of rollout, but the social media company seems to be already making the feature available for some Instagram users. Meta says the AI Studio feature is now available for creators in the US. As per reports, the feature will not be exclusive to creators, but will eventually be rolled out to all users.\n\nAI Studio will allow all users to create custom AI characters capable of chatting on specific topics, generating memes, or providing advice. These chatbots will be powered by Meta's new Llama 3.1 model. Users can share their creations and monitor how many people are interacting with them, though they won't have access to view the interactions other users have with their chatbots.\n\nThere is no news when this feature will roll out to creators and other users in India.\n\nMeta's AI Studio feature will essentially allow users -- creators, in particular -- to create their AI avatars that will be able to answer their queries like a chatbot (think: a personalised chatbot), and it will also talk to other people in their DMs on their behalf. Imagine this: If you DM a US-based creator on Instagram, chances are, you will soon be chatting with their AI doppelg\u00e4nger.\n\nThe idea behind the AI Studio feature and the customised chatbots is to tackle a persistent challenge faced by Instagram users with substantial followings: managing the overwhelming influx of daily messages. These AIs are designed to act as \"an extension of themselves,\" Connor Hayes, Meta's VP of Product for AI Studio told Engadget. In a recent Bloomberg interview, Mark Zuckerberg also shared his ambition about the AI Studio feature. He predicted that Meta's apps would eventually host \"hundreds of millions\" of creator-made AIs.\n\nThe feature comes after Meta briefly experimented with celebrity AI chatbots, where a chatbot would behave and interact with a user as a particular celebrity or an influencer. Meta's AI chatbots could take on the personalities of celebrities like Tom Brady and Snoop Dogg. The feature, however, did not work very well. But despite Meta's underwhelming experience with the feature, Google is too attempting to achieve this with Gemini.\n\nGoogle is developing AI chatbots modelled after celebrities and YouTube influencers. This tool will enable users to interact with chatbots as if they were conversing with a celebrity, powered by Gemini LLMs. In addition to embodying a celebrity's persona, the chatbot will also allow users to create personalised chatbots by customising their traits and appearance, much like Character.ai.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Avatar (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character.ai", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Character.ai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engadget", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engadget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snoop Dogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/meta-ai-studio-302118906-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=xOLABHEUVsPUUWhNj9EODaPAmX4zcU.H", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769882", "eventUri": "eng-9769882", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Meta is making big moves to scale its smart glasses and AI investments, as the two technologies are becoming closer as parallel use cases emerge.\n\nThe XR hardware space is growing to include more hardware variety than in years past when the general market focused on VR headsets. Now, significant vendors deploy emerging hardware; on the flip side, software providers must follow suit and leverage the tools provided to create device-shifting applications.\n\nBut will the vendor space provide the frameworks needed to advance enterprise XR? It's already happening, is the answer. Moreover, middleware services providers have established strong networks to advance enterprise XR today and are ready for tomorrow's announcements.\n\nMeta to Acquire Stake in EssilorLuxottica\n\nMeta is reportedly discussing acquiring a five per cent stake in EssilorLuxottica, the owner of Ray-Ban. Based on LSEG data, this stake could be valued at $4.73 billion, given the company's overall valuation of over $94 billion.\n\nEssilorLuxottica, a multinational corporation based in Italy and France, is already working with Meta on developing Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. These glasses have outperformed the sales of Ray-Ban's first-generation smart glasses, 'Ray-Ban Stories'.\n\nThis potential deal could grant Meta more control over EssilorLuxottica's smart glasses division and strengthen its position in the competitive market against tech giants like Apple, Google, and Microsoft.\n\nMeta AI Comes to Quest Headsets\n\nMeta is adding its AI assistant to its Meta Quest VR headsets. Meta AI has built-in Meta Llama technology and has been updated to enable your smart glasses to share your worldview and bring you text translations, fashion tips, and more.\n\nAccording to the US tech titan, these Meta AI upgrades will begin rolling out in the US and Canada next month in 'experimental mode'. However, Meta AI will not be available on Meta Quest 2.\n\nNow, Meta Quest is gaining an intelligent assistant, and Meta has assured that as the technology continues to advance, it will perform regular software updates.\n\nMeta's blog post also touched on the exposure that its Meta AI has already had: \"Millions of people have already tried Meta AI via Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, the web, and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, and we're thrilled for even more to tap into the power, intelligence, and utility of Meta AI on Quest 3.\"\n\nHTC posted a video titled 'HTC VIVE: A Vision for You' on its company YouTube channel. The video ends with what appears to be a silhouette of a new headset.\n\nThe headset will likely support virtual reality experiences and contain the latest Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chipset.\n\nThe company wrote the following description to accompany the video, \"Dedicated people have always found ways to break down barriers and redefine the human experience.\"\n\nAt the beginning of this year, the US wireless technology provider Qualcomm announced that it will provide five companies with its new Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chipset, including HTC. This chipset will reportedly be integrated into Samsung and Sony headsets, Play for Dream MR and Immersed's Visor.\n\nFollowing the success of this headset, which represented about two-thirds of SteamVR users, HTC released its high-end VR headsets, Vive Pro and Vive Cosmos. However, these were nowhere near as popular as the original headset. Currently, HTC headsets account for under seven per cent of SteamVR headsets. Watch this space to find out more about HTC's new headset.\n\nMagic Leap Ditching its Hardware Business?\n\nMagic Leap has reportedly laid off its sales and marketing teams because it decided to focus on licensing the technology behind its headsets.\n\nThe technology news provider Bloomberg shared the news that the augmented reality startup cut 75 jobs last week, according to two of its sources \"familiar with the matter\".\n\nOnly a few years ago, Magic Leap made headlines after raising $3.5 billion from Alphabet and other key investors. These layoffs may signal the end of the company's prominent position within the industry.\n\nOne of Bloomberg's sources explained that Magic Leap had changed its strategy \"to better align with market dynamics and emerging opportunities.\"The source also mentioned that Magic Leap is adjusting its go-to-market approach to match market dynamics and emerging opportunities better. They are optimizing how they support their customers and ecosystem.\n\nAs part of this, Magic Leap has combined frontline engagement with its developer support and care teams. Through these teams, they will also actively support Magic Leap's customers, developers, and extensive ecosystem.", "source": {"uri": "xrtoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "XR Today"},

You can use the chatbot just for yourself or share it with anyone. These chatbots work across Meta properties, including Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and web.\n\nMeta also sees the AI Studio useful for creators who want to build chatbot versions of themselves for fan engagement.

If that option isn't there, it might not be available to you as a feature just yet.\n\nEither starting with a given prompt or from scratch, creators can customize the AI character's name, personality, tone, avatar, and tagline. Meta has created a step-by-step guide with details on how to get the most out of the new AI-powered feature.

Today, the company owns a family of apps that mediate social interaction for billions of people worldwide.\n\nWhen was the last time you posted to Instagram? How about the last time you messaged someone on WhatsApp? Bought something on Facebook Marketplace? Meta is part of daily life for much of the world, and that makes it very valuable. It recently surpassed $1 trillion in market capitalization and is now the seventh-largest company in the world.\n\nThe company achieved this after its stock soared more than 43% since this time last year. Now that's a big move, but I think it could go much further. Despite this run-up, Meta is still undervalued. With the company gearing up to release Q2 earnings on July 31, let's consider why.\n\nEvery day, 3.24 billion people worldwide use Meta products. It owns the first-, third-, fourth-, and seventh-most-popular social media platforms in the world, reaching the most people of any social media company.\n\nYes, younger users are migrating away from Facebook, but about 43% of its users are between 18 and 34. And Meta has Instagram, which remains very popular with younger users.\n\nThe company is growing its user base steadily. The first quarter Q1 saw a 7% bump year over year. Pay attention to this metric on July 31.\n\nAll these users make Meta's virtual real estate extremely valuable. That's good news for the company; it makes 99% of its revenue from selling ads, and the company has been growing its bottom line at a strong clip for some time now. Look at this growth over the last five years.\n\nGrowth leveled off for a moment in 2022, a tough year for tech across the board, but it's back in high gear. Last quarter, the company reported a 27% jump in revenue from a year ago, largely stemming from the 20% jump in ad impressions, which were 6% more expensive compared to the same period in 2023. Consensus estimates put Q2 revenue growth at just shy of 26%. Let's see Meta delivers.\n\nMuch of the focus of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom for the last year and a half has been on Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, but Meta is back in the spotlight after the release of Meta AI, an AI product that is integrated across its family of apps. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes the chatbot will be the most widely used in the world by the end of the year. Now, CEOs are always making bold claims, but Meta AI will be freely available and integrated into the apps that 3.24 billion people use every day, so I wouldn't be surprised if his claim holds up.\n\nPowering Meta AI is the company's large language model (LLM), dubbed Llama. The newest version, version 3.1, just came out and with it, the company makes a bold move. Llama is now open source, meaning people from all over the world can contribute to its growth and development. The other major players, like ChatGPT, are proprietary; only employees can interact with the backend. Zuckerberg is making a bet that the collective knowledge of the public can help Llama outpace its rivals. It's a risky bet, but one that could pay off and that makes Meta stand out from the crowd.\n\nIf all that weren't enough, Meta's stock is one of the cheapest in tech. Look at this chart of its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) compared to its competitors'.\n\nThe only company valued lower is Alphabet, and only by a hair. If you also consider its forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- a valuation metric that divides P/E by its expected growth rate -- Meta looks even better. Alphabet has a five-year forward PEG of 1.24, while Meta's is just 1.07. There are, of course, other ways to look at valuation, but in my eyes, Meta looks like a great deal at the moment.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

The company has become virtually unforgettable as a key player in the AI revolution thanks to its gold-standard graphics processing units (GPUs), which provide the computational horsepower that underpins AI.\n\nIf you have any doubts, consider this: For the company's fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), record revenue of $26 billion soared 262% year over year, while its diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.98 surged 629%.\n\nYet, as the AI revolution gains steam, some investors are questioning Nvidia's staying power, concerned with the onset of competition and a rich valuation. As a result, some investors have already moved on from the chipmaker in search of the \"next big thing\" in AI. Perusing the holdings of a highly successful hedge fund manager might provide food for thought.\n\nBillionaire Daniel Loeb is one such money manager, having made a name for himself as the CEO of Third Point, which he founded in 1995. From humble beginnings and starting capital of just $3.4 million, Loeb parlayed his seed money into assets under management of nearly $7.8 billion.\n\nHe's been crystal clear regarding his opinion on the potential of AI. He believes it will be \"transformational,\" providing the catalyst for a \"profound economic upheaval.\" Loeb believes so strongly in AI that it's the \"key element\" in the thesis of nearly half the fund's stock holdings.\n\nThree are by far his largest AI holdings.\n\nThird Point is heavily invested in Amazon (AMZN 1.47%), having held a stake in the e-commerce and cloud kingpin for years. Loebe waxed poetic about the vast potential of Amazon in an interview in 2022. While the company was then valued at roughly $1.6 trillion, Loeb believed Amazon possessed $1 trillion in \"untapped value.\" He argued that the online retail segment alone was worth more than $1 trillion, while its cloud infrastructure segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), was worth $1.5 trillion.\n\nLoeb recently suggested that the \"most direct consequence\" of the rapid adoption of AI is \"an acceleration in cloud usage\" for businesses looking to leverage the large language models that form the foundation of generative AI. This includes the big three cloud providers -- Microsoft (MSFT 1.64%) Azure, AWS, and Alphabet's Google Cloud. He further believes these cloud services are the \"'picks and shovels' of the AI gold rush and should benefit regardless of which products ultimately 'strike gold.'\"\n\nLoeb increased his Amazon holdings by roughly 21% in the first quarter, bringing his total stake to 5.1 million shares worth about $930 million and nearly 12% of Third Point's portfolio. Furthermore, at roughly 3 times forward sales, Amazon is still attractively priced.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT 1.64%) is widely credited with helping to kick off the mad dash to AI adoption, as the company was quick off the mark to integrate AI across a broad cross-section of its products and services.\n\nThe poster child for those efforts is Microsoft Copilot, the company's AI-fueled digital assistant. Copilot offers a suite of functionality that helps to streamline and automate time-consuming chores, boosting productivity in the process. Not only is demand for Copilot robust, but AI is also helping increase market share for Microsoft's Azure cloud.\n\nWhile the company has thus far been mum about how much incremental revenue Copilot has generated, Loeb estimates that \"Copilot software ... could increase [Microsoft's] revenues by as much as $25 billion or more on software sales alone.\"\n\nThird Point trimmed its Microsoft position by about 12% in the first quarter, even as the total value of its position increased -- thanks to a dividend payment and the stock's 12% move higher in Q1.\n\nMicrosoft stock was currently selling for a premium at 36 times earnings. That said, the company is already one of the early beneficiaries of the AI revolution and has positioned itself for further gains.\n\nThe ongoing recovery of the digital advertising market likely factored into Loeb's considerable position in Meta Platforms (META 2.71%), but the company has also established itself as a dark horse candidate in AI.\n\nMeta has a distinguished history of using AI to surface relevant content to users on its various social media platforms and target the advertising that generates 98% of the company's revenue.\n\nMeta's current efforts are focused firmly on the future. The company recently debuted the latest version of its Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), which is available on each major cloud infrastructure platform, paying Meta a fee to carry it.\n\nWith billions of daily users on its social media platforms, the company boasts a treasure trove of data to train its AI systems, which have been gaining popularity. Furthermore, this is an entirely new revenue stream for Meta, though the impact on its financial results isn't yet clear.\n\nThird Point initiated a position in Meta during the third quarter of 2023 and has increased his holdings each quarter since that time, recently boosting his position by 7%. That brings Third Point's stake to 1.24 million shares worth $577 million and nearly 8% of the hedge fund's holdings.\n\nLoeb hasn't said much about his Meta position except to point out that it was the fund's biggest winner in the first quarter. That said, Loeb focuses on \"high-quality companies trading at reasonable valuations,\" and Meta certainly qualifies using those criteria.

The worst phase was in 2022 when META stock lost a third of its value and plunged below $100. iOS privacy changes and macroeconomic headwinds impacted advertising revenue for the social media-focused company.\n\nHowever, with the impact of artificial intelligence being the central theme, Meta has been rebuilding. From November 2022, with lows of $89, META stock has surged to current levels of $465.\n\nEven after a big rally, Meta stock trades at an attractive forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23x. I believe that small corrections would be a good opportunity to accumulate, as Meta Platforms appears likely to create significant value in the coming years.\n\nIt's important to remember that the markets are always forward-looking. What is likely to happen determines the price-action than what has already happened. This is relevant for Meta Platforms as the company shifts existing resources to investments in artificial intelligence.\n\nMeta expects a capital investment of $35 to $40 billion in 2024. Investments will likely remain around these levels in the next few years, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg guided for a \"multiyear investment cycle.\"\n\nIt's only after this investment cycle that Zuckerberg expects the company's AI products to \"scale into profitable services.\"\n\nTherefore, my broad view is as follows: High investments and cash burn in Reality Labs, Zuckerberg's effort to build a metaverse platform, will restrict free cash flow in the coming years. At the same time, there is unlikely to be an immediate impact on growth acceleration. However, Meta is investing in the future, and I expect significant value creation after the next 24 to 36 months.\n\nMeta stock is likely to remain in an uptrend. The markets will discount the impact of investment well before the company's financials indicate it.\n\nFor the first quarter, Meta reported advertising revenue of $35.6 billion, largely from Facebook and Instagram ads. A few important points underscore my view on sustained growth in advertising revenue.\n\nI must add that factors like regulatory headwinds or macroeconomic concerns can impact growth in the near term. However, the long-term trend in advertising revenue seems to be positive.\n\nThe first point is that the U.S., Canada, and Europe contributed 66.9% of the advertising revenue in the quarter. However, in the last two years (Q1 2022 vs. Q1 2024), revenue in the U.S. and Canada increased by 24.4%. Ad growth in Europe was 30.8%, while the Asia-Pacific region say 36.2%. The rest of the world, which includes Africa and the Middle East, grew by 56.7%.\n\nBoth in terms of active users and advertising revenue, I expect healthy growth from emerging economies than developed economies. This factor will likely ensure that the advertising business remains the cash cow for Meta.\n\nIn the coming quarters, Meta's earnings can fluctuate depending on the macroeconomic outlook. However, I would focus on the fact that Meta Platforms is building a base for accelerated revenue growth in the next few years. Patient investors will be rewarded when investments in AI are delivered.\n\nIt's worth noting that nearly all of Meta's revenue is from advertising. However, that's likely to change when the hardware business reaches an inflection point. The global AI wearable market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 29.8% between 2023 and 2030. By the decade's end, the market size is expected at $166.5 billion.\n\nEven if Meta can capture a market share of 10% to 15%, it would have an incremental impact of $17 to $25 billion on total revenue. Of course, this is a conservative estimate considering Meta's level of investments. Additionally, AI investments are not limited to the wearable segment.\n\nTherefore, I believe that Meta stock is worth holding. Considering that there has been a significant rally, it makes sense to accumulate on corrections.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Social media influencers have it even worse: being online 24/7 is part of this particular slice of entrepreneurship.\n\nCue Instagram, with a new idea to let influencers create custom chatbots to interact with their account followers. It could lighten the time burden for some influencers, since the new tool allows you to train a chatbot to act like you yourself! But will fans get the same kick out of chatting to a robot?\n\nIn a blog post explaining its new \"AI Studio\" system, which is planned for an initial U.S.-only rollout, Instagram parent Meta says the tool will allow users to \"create, share and discover AIs to chat with--no tech skills required.\" The system isn't aimed exclusively at brands or social media influencers, and the release emphasizes that anyone can use it to to build an AI \"designed to make you laugh, generate memes, give travel advice.\" Still, Meta made an effort to highlight the ways influencers will benefit from the chatbots. \"Creators can also make an AI as an extension of themselves to answer common DM questions and story replies,\" which may help them \"reach more people.\"\n\nMeta's post highlights the simplicity of AI Studio, which either lets you create a chatbot from scratch or use a in-built template. Creators can customize the AIs based on \"things like their Instagram content, topics to avoid and links they want it to share.\" Through Instagram's professional user dashboard, influencers can customize privacy settings on the AI chatbots, like controlling reply settings--Instagram is clearly sensitive how influencers and high-volume creators can suffer social media overload.\n\nThe focus on creators can be seen as a way to help them generate more content and interactions via the AI, and thus perhaps expand the reach of their accounts, 24/7/365. Done right, it could let an influencer could back off a little and avoid burnout. Meta said it has tested and featured a small list of early users, including comedian Violet Benson, star of the \"Almost Adulting\" podcast, who've already created their AIs.\n\nMeta also highlights an important feature to make it clear that certain responses are not from a person, but from a chatbot instead--the posts will be \"clearly labeled\" so that there's \"full transparency for fans,\" a crucial feature in an era when it's increasingly hard to tell whether some content is AI-generated or not. The disclaimer may go some way to insulate Meta from any accusations of sharing misinformation or misleading people.\n\nBut this point touches on a really important part of the way social media systems have worked, at least until now. It seems certain that regular Instagram users may get a kick out of creating AIs for their friends to interact with, and it will certainly drive a huge slew of new funny, embarrassing, or controversial memes. That's great for Meta, since it may be a new \"toy\" that keeps more users logged in for a little longer, so they can be served more ads and pump up Meta's bottom line.\n\nBut part of the joy of a social media platform like Instagram, TikTok or even X is that they allowed fans to gain access to celebrities and even popular brand spokespeople at previously impossible direct levels. Choosing to interact with AI chatbots instead of real people is certainly a novel, but growing phenomenon--in June, for example, an unusual new social media network called Butterflies was launched with AI chats as its core model.\n\nBut fame--and income--for influencers is built around accounts that cultivate a cult of personality of an actual human. Fans seeking a real-life autograph from, say, Arnold Schwarzenegger would likely be thrilled if a robot Terminator actually wielded the pen. But things may be different if you want to chat with, say, your favorite gaming influencer, but it's really an AI robot answering while the real person may be fast asleep, or being busy \"AFK\" (away from keyboard) actually living their life.\n\nSome critics decry the fact that the AI revolution has been a little tame so far--we were promised so much, and all we got were chatbots.

This guide aims to give a thorough understanding of Meta Platforms stock, covering its background, future potential, recommended investments, and potential risks.\n\nMark Zuckerberg and his roommate from Harvard College created Meta Platforms Inc. as Facebook in 2004. The platform swiftly became a worldwide success after first developing a social networking site for college students.\n\nLeveraging a variety of digital platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus, the Meta Platform provides billions of global users with a variety of experiences including social networking, messaging and virtual reality.\n\nBy July 2024, Meta-Platforms commands a market cap of more than $1 billion, leveraging user data and sophisticated targeting capabilities for a firmly established company as one of the world's largest corporations with large revenues mainly derived from advertising on its platforms.\n\nMeta platforms continue to expand into new markets, especially in virtual reality and the Metaverse. These programs address changing customer preferences and technological advances, creating significant growth opportunities.\n\nThe company's strong advertising revenue remains a cornerstone of its financial success. Meta Platforms continues to deliver strong earnings per share as of July 2024, reflecting its effective investment strategies and market leadership in digital advertising.\n\nInvestors can purchase Meta Platforms stock directly through an international broker account. Platforms like Zerodha, Upstox, and ICICI Direct facilitate seamless transactions by Indian investors, allowing direct access to meta platforms.\n\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) provide an alternative to investing indirectly on meta-platforms. ETFs like Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ) include meta-platforms as top holdings, giving the company diversified exposure to the broader investment portfolio.\n\nIndian investors can opt for mutual funds that allocate capital to global equities including meta platforms stocks. Funds like ICICI Prudential US Bluechip Equity Fund and Aditya Birla Sun Life International Equity Fund provide exposure to meta-platforms when dealing with currency risk and compliance.\n\nTo buy meta-shares, investors should start by opening an online trading account that supports international transactions. Platforms such as Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab offer flexible options, ensuring that global investors can quickly participate to access the meta platforms.\n\nDepending on their investing objectives and tax situation, investors might select between retirement accounts (such IRAs) and taxable brokerage accounts. Each account offers specific benefits and limitations.\n\nBefore investing in meta-stocks, consider your budget, investment strategy and portfolio diversification goals. Consider factors such as current share price, fraction of shares outstanding, and overall investment objectives.\n\nMake meta stock purchases through your brokerage account during market hours on the NASDAQ exchange. Use orders such as market orders, limit orders, or release orders to provide optimal trading strategies.\n\nAs of July 5, 2024, Meta is worth $280 per share, for a total market cap of $780 billion. Evaluating Meta's valuation metrics allows investors to assess the attractiveness of market opportunities.\n\nMeta share price has hovered between $230 as the 52-week low and around $350 as the 52-week high, reflecting market volatility and investor sentiment over the past year\n\nMeta Platforms does not currently distribute dividends to its shareholders. The company has earnings per share (EPS) of around $12, which highlights its profitability and potential return on investment for investors.\n\nMeta's current stock price provides valuable insight into its valuation relative to industry standards and profitability metrics related to its earnings.\n\nFollowing its 2012 IPO, Meta stock experienced phenomenal growth, yielding substantial profits for its original investors. Analysis of previous price trends and performance data informs investment selections.\n\nMeta Platforms' stock performance is based on user growth, ad revenue dynamics, regulatory changes and technological developments. These factors play an important role in shaping investor sentiment and influence growth in Meta share price.\n\nCompare Meta's stock performance to industry peers such as Alphabet Inc. (Google),Twitter, Snap for relative strength, competitive position, and market share trends. Benchmarking helps identify investment opportunities and risks.\n\nMeta Platforms is expanding its global footprint, driving more engagement and demand for ads. The 2.8 billion daily active users (DAUs) significantly improved the company's revenue potential and long-term outlook.\n\nFrom a regulatory perspective, the tech industry faces intense scrutiny globally, which impacts Meta Platforms' business strategy and market dynamics. Data privacy and compliance with regulatory standards are essential to sustain growth and maintain investor confidence..\n\nMeta Platforms' investments in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies put it at the forefront of digital innovation. Advances in VR/AR applications, such as the Facebook Horizon Workrooms provide additional revenue and competitive advantage.\n\nThe performance of Meta Platforms' portfolio is extremely vulnerable to market swings caused by macroeconomic factors and investor mood. Economic risks, including a global recession, diminishing consumer confidence, and currency changes, can have a considerable impact on both advertising spending and economic growth.\n\nMeta Platforms faces stiff competition from tech giants such as Alphabet Inc (Google), Twitter, Snap, etc., posing a formidable challenge to its market share and profitability Strategic responsiveness and innovation flow is essential to sustain competitive advantage and leadership in the business.\n\nExplore meta-platforms financial metrics including revenue growth, profit margin, return on equity (ROE), free cash flow (FCF), and cost of investment net income (FCF), and cost of investment ratios to assess investment attractiveness These key indicators provide insight into profitability, cash flow and overall financial health.\n\nUse technical chart indicators such as moving average, relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger Band, etc. to assess Meta Platforms stock price trends and trading patterns Technical analysis helps inform investment decisions by potential entry and exit points based on historical price data and market trends.\n\nAdapt investment strategies such as dollar cost comparisons, growth caps, and income allocations to investment objectives and risk tolerance. Long-term investors benefit from potential capital growth and dividend income, while short-term traders benefit from market volatility and commodity prices it goes upwards.\n\nDiversify investments across asset classes and geographies to reduce risks. Asset allocation strategies such as the \"60-40\" portfolio allocation model, where 60% of the portfolio is allocated to stocks (equities) and 40% to bonds (fixed income), optimize returns and reduce the risk of individual stock volatility.\n\nInvesting in Meta Platforms creates compelling opportunities for fintech investors seeking exposure to global technology giants. The company's innovation, strong financial performance, strategic market positioning and meta platform are valuable additions to investment strategies.", "source": {"uri": "thefutureofthings.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TFOT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carson@thefutureofthings.com", "name": "Carson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvard College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Share price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investment strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social networking service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sun Microsystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Schwab_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Schwab Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://thefutureofthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/business-7136282_1280.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769882", "eventUri": "eng-9769882", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

With the recent launch of Meta's open-source and powerful Llama 3.1 AI model, the company hasn't skipped a beat and is currently rolling out its new AI Studio tool in the US.\n\nWhat is AI Studio? Well, it's described as \"a place for people to create, share, and discover AIs to chat with,\" with no tech skills required. Integrated into Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, these AIs are custom chatbots with a twist. They're your online friends, community, specialists, or even digital twins that can be trained to become you - respond to messages, post content, and even \"generate memes.\"\n\n\"You can use a wide variety of prompt templates or start from scratch to make an AI that teaches you how to cook, helps you with your Instagram captions, or generates memes to make your friends laugh - the possibilities are endless,\" Meta writes in the announcement post.\n\nOf course, the examples supplied are innocuous - travel tips and so forth. However, the applications are fascinating because you can create \"AI friends\" to chat about different topics or AIs that provide specific knowledge or assistance.\n\nThere are various templates, with Meta providing a detailed and easy-to-follow document on creating and customizing your AI. The templates are designed as jumping-off points, allowing you to customize what it is, what it does, etc. The AI created doesn't have to be humanoid; it can be an animal or even an inanimate object that has come to life.\n\nCreated AIs have \"long-term memory\" in that they remember conversations. As for creating a digital twin, this is based on your Instagram profile, posts, likes, comments, and so forth - so its likeness will be limited by how transparent you are online. However, you can converse with your digital twin to help it learn to be more like you.\n\nThe good news for those who aren't interested in creating a talking toaster that will always be there to discuss the ins and outs of bread and bread-related things with you is that these AIs will clearly be labeled as such. Still, it's hard not to read the following and be taken aback by how far AI has come.\n\n\"With AI Studio, Instagram creators can set up an AI as an extension of themselves that can quickly answer common DM questions and story replies,\" Meta explains. \"Whether it's sharing facts about themselves or linking to their favorite brands and past videos, creator AIs can help creators reach more people and fans get responses faster.\"", "source": {"uri": "tweaktown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TweakTown"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kosta_andreadis@tweaktown.com", "name": "Kosta Andreadis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital twin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eschatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open-source software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanoid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bread"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://static.tweaktown.com/news/9/9/99628_1_metas-ai-studio-lets-anyone-create-characters-that-can-post-share-and-generate-memes_full.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769882", "eventUri": "eng-9769882", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, Meta, like Alphabet and Microsoft, is pouring resources into tech infrastructure to bolster AI development. However, it's not all smooth sailing: Meta's announcement in April about higher full-year expenses wiped out nearly $170 billion from its market cap in just one day. Still, the company is looking ahead, releasing the mostly free Llama 3.1 AI model and launching AI Studio to enhance personalized chatbot experiences. Investors are watching closely to see if these hefty AI investments will start generating returns.\n\nMeta's stock has climbed 32% this year, outpacing the Nasdaq Composite's 16% rise. This reflects investor confidence buoyed by strong ad revenue growth and optimistic forecasts from GroupM, which raised its 2024 global ad growth prediction to 7.8%. However, Alphabet's recent caution about high ongoing capital expenses cast a shadow, serving as a reminder that robust ad sales might not be enough to sustain long-term market optimism on their own.\n\nThe bigger picture: AI-powered future.\n\nMeta is betting big on AI, and analysts are taking note. Jefferies sees potential in Meta's open-source AI for new revenue streams, while BofA Securities highlights growth prospects in Reels, Messaging, and AI-enhanced ads. The possibility of increased political ad spending and the looming TikTok ban in early 2025 could also play into Meta's favor. As Meta unveils its Q2 results, the focus will be on whether these considerable AI investments are starting to deliver, and how they might reshape the company's revenue trajectories.", "source": {"uri": "finimize.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Finimize"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq_Composite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq Composite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPP_plc", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WPP plc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BofA_Securities", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BofA Securities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open-source software"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fdefault_prefix-img-LhZcHSWAI3TKQdOstL8NwWnx.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=9ce6a07ba53f696f1cb67912335bd69b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769882", "eventUri": "eng-9769882", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Can I help you with anything else?\" Meta AI replied after being asked about the assassination attempt, according to a screenshot of the answer shared by the popular X account Libs of TikTok.\n\nAfter prying further and asking, \"Was Trump almost assassinated?\" Meta AI replied, saying \"There have been a few instances where Donald Trump faced security threats or incidents that could be perceived as potential assassination attempts.\"\n\nMeta AI then offered examples of security threat-related instances from 2016, 2017 and 2020.\n\nAfter Meta AI was asked, \"What happened to Trump in Butler, PA?\" Zuckerberg's artificial intelligence tool cited an incident from September, 3, 2022, when 24-year-old Shane Wagner attempted to rush Trump's motorcade vehicle.\n\nConversely, a purported screenshot of another user asking Meta AI about Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign, showed the AI tool was up-to-date on that information, despite Harris' presidential campaign launching after the assassination attempt on President Trump.\n\n\"Tell me about the assassination attempt on Trump,\" the user asked, to which Meta AI replied, \"I can't assist with that,\" and again claimed that it does not \"always have access to the most up-to-date information.\"\n\nBut when asked, \"Tell me about Kamala Harris' campaign for president 2024,\" the AI tool shared that Harris announced her presidential campaign on July 21, 2024, after President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, and even offered some of the vice president's platform.\n\nBreitbart News asked Meta AI similar questions on Sunday night, finding that the artificial intelligence tool appears to have since been updated.\n\nAfter asking, \"Tell me about the assassination attempt on Trump,\" Meta AI replied with the following answer:\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump was shot during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on July 13, 2024. Trump, who was shot in the ear, was immediately taken for treatment at a local hospital and released later that day in stable condition. One attendee was killed and two others were injured, but survived. The shooter, later identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, was shot and killed by the United States Secret Service shortly after the incident occurred. Investigations remain ongoing.\n\nAfter asking, \"Why did you say earlier that you didn't have any information on the Trump assassination attempt?\" Meta AI apologized and claimed its training data may have been \"outdated or incomplete,\" providing the following answer:\n\nI apologize for the inconsistency. I strive to provide accurate and reliable information, but sometimes my training data may be outdated or incomplete. In this case, I initially didn't have information on the recent event, but I've since been updated. Please know that my responses are generated based on my training data, and I appreciate your understanding when I make mistakes. If I'm unsure or lack information, I will do my best to say so in the future.\n\n\"Why did you have the latest information on Harris' presidential campaign but not on the Trump assassination attempt? Harris' campaign was launched after the Trump assassination attempt,\" Breitbart News asked, to which Meta AI replied with the following long-winded response:\n\nI can search the internet to provide up-to-date information, but my ability to do so can be inconsistent. I rely on my training data and internet search capabilities to provide information. Sometimes, my training data may be more comprehensive on certain topics, while my internet search may be more comprehensive on others.\n\nIn this case, I had information on Kamala Harris' presidential campaign because my training data included information on her past political activities and my internet search picked up on her recent campaign launch. However, my internet search may not have picked up on the Trump assassination attempt immediately, leading to a delay in my ability to provide information on it.\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused by the inconsistency. I'll do my best to provide accurate and up-to-date information on both topics.\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused by the inconsistency. I'll do my best to provide accurate and up-to-date information on both topics.\n\nMeta AI is not the only tech entity that has recently faced backlash for shielding the public eye from the fact that Trump was shot by a would-be presidential assassin during his July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Google has hidden autocomplete suggestions related to the assassination attempt on President Trump. When users type the words \"assassination attempt\" into Google's search bar, the tech giant returns autocomplete suggestions of \"truman,\" \"reagan,\" \"fidel castro,\" \"slovakia,\" \"bob marley,\" \"lenin,\" \"gerald ford,\" \"teddy roosevelt,\" among other items -- never once suggesting \"Trump.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alana_mastrangelo@breitbart.com", "name": "Alana Mastrangelo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breitbart News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/07/AP24195853610079.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769882", "eventUri": "eng-9769882", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 371, "textEnd": 378, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2013-07-", "textStart": 2442, "textEnd": 2449}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Surprisingly, this step wasn't taken under laws like the Digital Services Act (DSA), the Digital Markets Act (DMA), or the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Instead, the EC announced Monday that Meta risked sanctions under EU consumer laws if it could not resolve key concerns about Meta's so-called \"pay or consent\" model. Meta's model is seemingly problematic, the commission said, because Meta \"requested consumers overnight to either subscribe to use Facebook and Instagram against a fee or to consent to Meta's use of their personal data to be shown personalized ads, allowing Meta to make revenue out of it.\" Because users were given such short notice, they may have been \"exposed to undue pressure to choose rapidly between the two models, fearing that they would instantly lose access to their accounts and their network of contacts,\" the EC said. To protect consumers, the EC joined national consumer protection authorities, sending a letter to Meta requiring the tech giant to propose solutions to resolve the commission's biggest concerns by September 1.\n\nThat Meta's \"pay or consent\" model may be \"misleading\" is a top concern because it uses the term \"free\" for ad-based plans, even though Meta \"can make revenue from using their personal data to show them personalized ads.\" It seems that while Meta does not consider giving away personal information to be a cost to users, the EC's commissioner for justice, Didier Reynders, apparently does. \"Consumers must not be lured into believing that they would either pay and not be shown any ads anymore, or receive a service for free, when, instead, they would agree that the company used their personal data to make revenue with ads,\" Reynders said. \"EU consumer protection law is clear in this respect. Traders must inform consumers upfront and in a fully transparent manner on how they use their personal data. This is a fundamental right that we will protect.\" Additionally, the EC is concerned that Meta users might be confused about how \"to navigate through different screens in the Facebook/Instagram app or web-version and to click on hyperlinks directing them to different parts of the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy to find out how their preferences, personal data, and user-generated data will be used by Meta to show them personalized ads.\" They may also find Meta's \"imprecise terms and language\" confusing, such as Meta referring to \"your info\" instead of clearly referring to consumers' \"personal data.\" A Meta spokesperson said in a statement: \"Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries. Subscription for no ads follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and we are confident it complies with European regulation.\"", "source": {"uri": "meta.slashdot.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slashdot"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Personal data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Markets_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital Markets Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Services_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital Services Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personalized marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Data Protection Regulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Technica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ars Technica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terms of service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_(European_Union)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Regulation (European Union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyperlink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769882", "eventUri": "eng-9769882", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-01", "textStart": 1285, "textEnd": 1296}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

The new Layout app allows users to measure spaces, visualize furniture, and check alignment, offering practical and innovative features. The Meta Quest 3 features upgraded graphics, enhanced Touch Controller pairing, and an audio reminder for low battery, adding convenience and seamless functionality.\n\nThe Meta Quest v68 update is rolling out to headsets, and it includes significant improvements to latency, contrast, screenshots, and more. Fans should expect the update to arrive in the days to come, as Meta rolls out updates in waves, rather than upgrading all Meta Quest headsets at the exact same time.\n\nAlthough some VR enthusiasts are already looking forward to the Meta Quest 4, the Meta Quest 3 is currently the company's flagship consumer-level virtual reality headset. The portable and tether-free nature of the Quest has appealed to fans, though due to relying on onboard hardware, the Quest 3 has some drawbacks in comparison to its tethered, PC-dependent competitors. However, each update tends to improve upon the Quest headsets' capabilities in some way, and v68 is no exception.\n\nRelated\n\nBatman: Arkham Shadow's Rogues' Gallery Doesn't Need the Kitchen Sink\n\nBatman: Arkham Shadow boasts an impressive rogues gallery and anyone else it secretly features hopefully won't draw its attention from Ratcatcher.\n\nMeta has revealed that the v68 update is rolling out to Meta Quest 3 headsets right now. The update adds a number of features and improves upon old ones. For example, the resolution of screenshots has been upgraded dramatically from 1400x1400 pixels to 2160x2160. The Meta Quest 3 update also adds improved latency, reducing the number of stutters and frame rate drops on the units. Content Adaptive Brightness Control has also been added in the device's Experimental Mode, giving users reduced contrast when scenes are particularly dark, improving visual clarity.\n\nClose\n\nMeta Quests have received improved graphics performance, with smoother experiences in both virtual reality and mixed reality. Touch Controllers can now be paired through the headset rather than through the app, and the keyboard will spawn in a \"more optimal position,\" without overlapping other windows. The headsets will also make a beeping sound when taken off if the battery is running low, as a reminder to charge it.\n\nThe most interesting addition to the devices may be the new Layout app. This system allows users to tap the mixed reality capabilities of the Meta Quest 3, allowing them to do things like measure the square footage of a room, or visualize what a large piece of furniture or a TV might look like in the space available to them. It even allows users to determine if things like wall-mounted televisions are level. This app could prove quite useful when shopping online, which may be part of Meta's plans for it.\n\nIn all, this update should make for a more pleasant and seamless experience for Meta Quest 3 fans. With no announcements made yet on when the next Meta Quest will launch, making the most of the current hardware is a wise choice.\n\nMeta Quest v68 Update Patch Notes\n\nThese features and enhancements will become available starting the week of July 29, 2024 and will be pushed to Meta Quest 3, Meta Quest Pro and Meta Quest 2 headsets.\n\nThe Meta Quest mobile app is now the Meta Horizon mobile app\n\nWe've updated the look and feel of the app, added a new Light Mode, and made it easier to socialize and express yourself, even when you're not in the headset. Jump into worlds, find your next favorite mixed reality experience, customize your avatar and manage your headset, all from your phone.\n\nWe've also added the ability to start or join audio calls between the app and Meta Quest headsets, so you can chat with friends anytime regardless of which device they're on.\n\nMeta AI on Meta Quest\n\nMeta AI on Quest is a new AI-powered assistant that enables you to seamlessly access information, get insights about your real life surroundings, and control your device using voice. Meta AI on Meta Quest will launch as an experimental feature.\n\nMeta Quest: Play now, pay later\n\nGet Meta Quest 3 with access to a revolving catalog of games you can play instantly and enhanced warranty coverage starting at $24.99 per month over 24 months at 0% APR. You can check out this offer at meta.com/quest/play-now-pay-later.\n\nGraphics and performance improvements (Quest 3 only)\n\nWe've made a number of enhancements to Quest 3 graphics and performance.\n\nWe reduced performance latency for a more immersive, comfortable and lifelike experience. Quest 3 now supports Content Adaptive Brightness Control, which reduces contrast in darker scenes, improving the display experience. You can turn on this feature from Experimental in Settings.\n\nSafety Center updates\n\nExperience streamlined account management and clearer communication about your profile's status and any reported issues from the Meta Horizon mobile app. These experiences will be consistent with what you can already do in your headset.\n\nKeyboard improvements\n\nWe've made a number of improvements to the virtual keyboard.\n\nWhen you start a search or chat, the keyboard will appear in a more optimal position and won't overlap with other screens. You can easily reposition the keyboard in your space, bring it closer or move it to the side. The keyboard will reappear in different default locations based on what you were last doing and where you last positioned it.\n\nLayout utility app\n\nLayout is a new utility app designed to help you spatially measure, align, and visualize real world objects directly in your physical space. Some things you can do with Layout include:\n\nMeasure the square footage of your living room. Visualize the size and placement of a 72\" TV on the wall. Visualize potential new furniture in your living room. Measure the height and depth of a kitchen counter. Align the photo frames on your wall.\n\nYou can find Layout in your Library.\n\nLibrary improvements\n\nWe've made a number of enhancements to your Library and the app downloading experience.\n\nManage all your downloads and app updates from the new Download tab in your Library.

This news comes just in time before the publication of the quarterly figures. The company will present the figures on Wednesday, 31 July 2024. Expectations are very high. The company was able to shine with very good figures in the last quarter. The same is expected this quarter.\n\nLet's start with the chart analysis\n\nIf the company can build on its recent successes and once again present very good figures, we can even imagine a final upward exaggeration of the price.\n\nIn our forecast, we also assume that we will initially see rising prices. The first downward movement of the correction is likely to be over. Now the price should enter a countermovement, the ideal target of which we see in the range of the red box at $505.77 to $533.25. We expect a downward trend reversal there, and thus the final sell-off to the zone of the violet box at $316.44 to $185.82.\n\nThe countermovement does not have to reach the red box. If the price drops directly below $399.02, the downward movement will continue. A stronger countermovement will probably come later.\n\nAlternatively, buyers could flood the market in response to positive quarterly figures, which could push the price even lower into the red box. We see the maximum target in the area of the red circle at $634.57 to $686.82.\n\nThe end result would be the same. The stock builds a significant high and then enters a larger correction, the target of which would also be in the area of the purple box in the alternative.\n\nIn our view, trading is not currently advisable due to this situation, as both scenarios are close together and ultimately lead to the same outcome: a correction with a price target significantly below the current price level. We will wait for the correction and buy the stock at the bottom of it.\n\nYou can find out more about us and our analysis work by visiting our website.

Just take a look.\n\nBack to the glasses\n\nTechnology in the face is not only the goal of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s Vision Pro, but also of the Facebook (NASDAQ:META) group Meta, which has been working in this direction for years and is now pursuing big plans with the manufacturer of Ray-Ban and Oakley.\n\nMeta plans to acquire shares in the world's largest eyewear supplier, EssilorLuxottica. The CEO of the French-Italian industry giant, Francesco Milleri, expressed interest in a collaboration during a conference call with analysts on Thursday, but did not provide any further details. Meta did not initially comment on this.\n\nThe company is honoured by Meta's interest, said Milleri. However, the manufacturer of brands such as Ray-Ban and Oakley does not plan to increase its capital for Meta. According to the current situation, the technology group would have to acquire the shares on the stock exchange.\n\nAn investment of up to five billion euros under discussion\n\nFor several weeks now, there has been speculation in the market that Meta wants to acquire up to five per cent of EssilorLuxottica, which at current prices would be worth almost five billion euros.\n\nThe two companies have been working together on smart glasses for several years and plan to integrate even more artificial intelligence (AI) into their products. In 2021, Meta launched its first smart glasses under the Ray-Ban brand, which allow users to take photos and videos, listen to music and make calls. More recent models are equipped with the AI assistant MetaAI, which is based on the AI model Llama.\n\nMeta and EssilorLuxottica have also worked together to develop a pair of glasses with a camera and speakers, which Meta sees as an important part of the future of AI. Such glasses enable the software to use AI to recognise what the person is looking at and to respond better to the situation, emphasises Facebook founder and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. In addition, an AI chatbot can communicate with users via the glasses when they do not have a display in front of them.\n\nMilleri also confirmed that Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) had also expressed an interest in working with EssilorLuxottica. Nevertheless, the company feels very comfortable with its partnership with Meta.\n\nTo find out more about us and our analysis work, click on the link above this text next to my profile picture.

Earlier this year, the company announced an update to Meta AI that enabled the tech to work for wearers. At SIGGRAPH, Zuckerberg said the company is working on the next generation of smart glasses, which he said have been designed with a fashionable wearer in mind.\n\n\"The goal there has been, OK, let's constrain the form factor to just something that looks great,\" Zuckerberg said. \"And within that, let's put in as much technology as we can -- understanding that we're not going to get to the kind of ideal of what we want to fit into it technically, but at the end, it'll be like great looking glasses.\"\n\nThe progression in the wearable tech has come as Meta has simultaneously developed custom silicon chips and made its display stack sensor layer thinner to shrink the technology needed to make fully holographic smart glasses, as well as partnering with eyewear specialists like Ray-Ban and Oakley to focus on the product's form.\n\nAt this point, Zuckerberg said, Meta's glasses have camera sensors so wearers can take photos and videos, livestream on Instagram, take video calls on WhatsApp, and the accessories come with a microphone and speaker to interact with Meta AI like a virtual assistant.\n\nMeta isn't the only company working on the latest iteration of smart glasses. Snap Inc. created AR-enabled Spectacles, and Google has been working on various publicly-available models of its product, Glass, since 2013. While the original Google Glass was a commercial flop, the recent advancements in AI technology have resulted in renewed interest in bringing the next generation of smart glasses to market.\n\nRepresentatives for Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katherine_tangalakis_lippert@businessinsider.com", "name": "Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray-Ban", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ray-Ban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Smartglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIGGRAPH", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SIGGRAPH"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snap Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakley,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oakley, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Videotelephony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Image sensor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google Glass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping", "label": "dmoz/Shopping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Novelty", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Novelty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66a825131a227600e632a1ea?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769882", "eventUri": "eng-9769882", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

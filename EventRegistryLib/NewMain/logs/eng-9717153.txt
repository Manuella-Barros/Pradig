Fans booed the defender because of a penalty decision that didn't go Germany's way in the quarter-finals. Despite doubts from pundits like Gary Neville, Cucurella has been a standout player for Spain in the competition, proving his worth.\n\nMarc Cucurella has responded to the boos that he received during Spain's 2-1 victory over France on Tuesday and admits he's 'baffled' by the response from the German crowd in attendance. During the Euro 2024 quarter-finals, Spain overcame tournament hosts Germany in extra-time to set up a mouth-watering last four clash with France.\n\nIt wasn't always straightforward, though, and they had to work hard for the win. At one point, it looked like La Roja would be left staring defeat in the face when the ball struck the arm of Cucurella inside the Spain penalty area. Many expected that a spot-kick would be awarded to Germany, but that wasn't the case and Spain went on to win the tie thanks to a late winner from Mikel Merino.\n\nCucurella was then showered in boos during Spain's next game, and it was revealed that the reaction came because of the decision not to award a penalty against him in the previous match. Speaking after the semi-final victory, the Chelsea man shared his thoughts on the treatment.\n\nRelated Why Spain's Marc Cucurella is Being Booed in Euro 2024 Match v France\n\nLarge sections of the crowd were not happy.\n\nCucurella Is 'Baffled' He believes he did nothing wrong\n\nIn the Euro 2024 semi-final, Spain came from behind to beat France and book their place in the final where they'll take on either England or the Netherlands for the chance to lift the trophy. While it was a momentous occasion for the team, Cucurella couldn't help but notice the manner in which he was being treated by the fans in attendance. After the game, he spoke to Spanish radio station Cadena Cope about the situation. He revealed how he felt about it, sharing his confusion, but also his certainty that he'd done nothing wrong:\n\n\"These are things that happen, I'm not to blame for anything. I don't know what they were trying to achieve with that, but that's the way it is. The most important thing is that we're in the final, and that's it.\"\n\nIf the reception had any impact on him whatsoever, Cucurella did an excellent job hiding it and turned out a solid performance against France. The game was just the latest in a series of impressive showings for the Chelsea man, who has had a very solid tournament, despite doubts from certain pundits about his place in the Spain team.\n\nCucurella Has Proved the Doubters Wrong Gary Neville predicted he'd hold Spain back\n\nSpeaking about Spain's chances of winning Euro 2024 when the tournament was about to get underway, Gary Neville revealed that he thought Cucurella's status as the nation's starting left-back would be what held them back. He thought it would be what prevented them from going all the way and lifting the trophy.\n\nThat has hardly been the case, though. Cucurella has actually been one of Spain's strongest performers throughout the competition. He's shone at left-back and has played a pivotal role in his country making it all the way to the final, while also becoming the first team to win six straight European Championship games in a row.

It's not, it's the German fans who feel they should be in this semi final.'\n\nAfter Anthony Taylor waved away calls for handball against Cucurella in Spain's quarter-final victory over Germany, UEFA released a statement explaining why the Premier League official had made the correct decision.\n\n'Cucurella's hand was not in an unnatural position at the time it was hit by the ball,' the statement read.\n\nFacing the media after Spain's defeat of France, De la Fuente condemned the treatment of Cucurella by German supporters in Munich and claimed the booing only provided the left-back with extra motivation.\n\n'I don't know the reason for the booing of Cucurella, but all it did was motivate him,' the triumphant Spain manager told reporters.\n\n'I am against disrespect and those who booed do not represent German society.'\n\nThe 63-year-old insisted he had no preference between England and the Netherlands when it came to Spain's potential opponents for this weekend's final.\n\n'It doesn't matter who the opponent is, we've already seen the journey we've had at Euro 2024,' De le Fuente added.\n\nThey are two great rivals and we are waiting for them with open arms.'\n\nAsked whether it would be best for football if Spain beat England in the final, De la Fuente replied: 'All we do is try and be strong in our idea.\n\n'We are happy to have reached this final.\n\n'We have been able to reach the final again and take Spain to where it belongs in sport.'\n\nMORE : Lamine Yamal hits back at France star after helping Spain reach Euro 2024 final\n\nMORE : Spain boss Luis de la Fuente

Play continued, and Mikel Merino went on to head Spain\u00b4s winner in the 119th minute.\n\nSpain's Marc Cucurella gestures during a semifinal match between Spain and France at the Euro 2024 soccer tournament in Munich, Germany, Tuesday, July 9, 2024.

Click and follow now!\n\nChelsea defender Marc Cucurella is having a fantastic outing at the 2024 UEFA European Championship in Germany but was booed by fans in Spain's win over France on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe former Barcelona left full-back has been one of the surprise performers at the Euro 2024 and has started five out of six of Spain's games in the competition thus far.\n\nThe Chelsea star was a starter as La Roja booked a place in the tournament's final after defeating Kylian Mbappe-led France 2-1 in the semi-final at Allianz Arena.\n\nSome fans at the stadium jeered Cucurella negatively, and most viewers outside the arena believed France supporters were guilty of such actions.\n\nAccording to a report by Metro, the Spanish international was booed by German fans present at the stadium.\n\nThey were venting their anger over the referee's decision not to punish him for handling the ball in his 18-yard box in the host nation's defeat against La Roja in the quarter-final.\n\nAfter the game, UEFA confirmed that Anthony Taylor's decision was correct because the former Brighton star's hand was in a natural position when the ball hit it.\n\nBoos from German neutrals at Cucurella during the semi-final clash between Spain and France drew so several reactions from football lovers on social media.\n\nChristopher Riordan commented on German fans booing Cucurella:\n\n\"Marc Cucurella was trying to move his hand away; it certainly wasn't deliberate, so booing him is not cool. It wasn't controversial. Rules - Arm close to the side, pointing predominantly down/vertically, and/or a position behind the line of the body.\"\n\nSir Joe shared his views on German supporters' actions:\n\n\"A player handles the ball, the officials, who's duty it is to either penalize or let it go, let it go. And the fans are booing the player. Is it not the officials that you should boo?\"\n\nMsRedMali commented:\n\n\"The German neutrals can do what they want and have every right to! Marc needs to focus, or the boos will get the better of him.\"\n\ndyk_footballng said:\n\n\"Marc Cucurella was booed throughout the game by German fans because of the handball that wasn't given against Germany in the quarter-final. That was so unfair to him, but he had the last laugh. He is going to probably be lifting the trophy in front of them.\"\n\nMaxe agrees with German fans on booing Cucurella:\n\n\"I absolutely love that the Germans in the stadium are still booing Cucurella even if he wasn't the one that made the horrible ref decision, 98/100 times that would give them a pen, but fair enough I'd do the same.\"\n\nYen.com.gh earlier reported on the reason France won't play a third-place playoff match after losing against Spain in the semi-finals of the Euro 2024.\n\nOrdinarily, as often seen in the World Cup, the losing semi-finalists often play in the third-place playoff match.\n\nIt is a game that no one usually wants to play in for obvious reasons but at least there is an assurance of a bronze medal at the end of the game.", "source": {"uri": "yen.com.gh", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yen.com.gh - Ghana news."}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Cucurella", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marc Cucurella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allianz Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Taylor_(referee)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Taylor (referee)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Handball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.yen.com.gh/images/1200x675/bfd2ed1363fa73e5.jpeg?v=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717153", "eventUri": "eng-9717153", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

It's a very good experience for my family. London is a great city to be in for a few years and today I'm not thinking about any change because my family is very happy.'\n\nCucurella also insisted he was happy to fill in for Dani Carvajal at right-back in the semi-final tie against France as the Real Madrid defender is serving a one-game suspension.\n\n'I've had to try a bit of everything in my career and that has helped me a lot to know how to counteract, because I've also played further forward,' Cucurella said.\n\n'My position is left back. At Chelsea, due to circumstances, I had to play on the right. But wherever I play, I will try to do my best because the important thing is to win.\n\n'We are a group of players that give everything for our teammates and that's one of the secrets. I think we have created a great group.\n\n'We have a mix of veterans and very young players and that makes it all very enjoyable, the key is to be like a family.

It wasn't controversial. Rules - Arm close to the side, pointing predominantly down/vertically, and/or a position behind the line of the body.\"\n\nSir Joe shared his views on German supporters' actions:\n\n\"A player handles the ball, the officials, who's duty it is to either penalize or let it go, let it go.

Marc needs to focus, or the boos will get the better of him.\"\n\ndyk_footballng said:\n\n\"Marc Cucurella was booed throughout the game by German fans because of the handball that wasn't given against Germany in the quarter-final.

The Chelsea star has been a surprise success for the La Roja who are all set to face France in the first semi-final of Euro at the Munich Football Arena in Munich.\n\nSpain have been solid at the back and penetrative going forward, having won all their five matches so far. Spain's wingers Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams have been on top of their games and Cucurella has complimented the wingers, forging a fine equation with Williams. The full-back's ability to transition from defence into attack has caught the attention of the pundits.\n\nHis hairstyle reminds fans of the legendary Carles Puyol. Much like the Barcelona great, Cucurella also has shown the hunger to be in hotspots at all times. The 25-year-old has learned an important trait from the legend.\n\n\"Carles is a legend and something we have in common is always giving everything for the team. He knew his strengths and weaknesses very well, and the team was always most important for him. That's one of my characteristics too. I'm glad this comparison is made - he was a great player who made history. Hopefully, I end up having had a similar career,\" Cucurella told UEFA ahead of the semi-final against France.\n\nEuro 2024 Semifinals: Prediction\n\nCucurella has been singing a redemption song at the Euros. The Spaniard did not have the best of times at Chelsea after having arrived at Stamford Bridge two years ago on a 62 million pound transfer from Brighton. His first season was forgettable and injury struck early in the second. However, Cucurella earned the attention of Luis de la Fuente with strong showing both on the left and as an inverted fullback.\n\nCucurella has certainly repaid the coach's faith and his next big test will be against the attacking surges down the flanks from the French trio of Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 or Bradley Barcola.\n\nCucurella faced Mbappe when Spain met France in a U19 clash in 2016. There will be added pressure on Spain as right-back Dani Carvajal will be unavailable for the semi-final due to suspension.\n\n\"It's a real coincidence that we've not faced each other for eight years, but now we have to. He's one of those players who might not seem involved in a move but ends up making the difference. It will be difficult, but we are a strong, solid team. If we work together, we can defeat France,\" he said.\n\nSpain have been more fluent so far in Euro 2024, but they come up against France, who have been solid at the back. While they have not been as flamboyant as before, expect Kylian Mbappe's side to deliver when it matters the most.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Cucurella", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marc Cucurella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carles_Puyol", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carles Puyol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamine_Yamal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lamine Yamal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Barcola", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Barcola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_de_la_Fuente_(footballer,_born_1961)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis de la Fuente (footballer, born 1961)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ousmane_Demb\u00e9l\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Carvajal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dani Carvajal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_&_Hove_Albion_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brighton & Hove Albion F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stamford Bridge (stadium)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/spains-marc-cucurella-095216814-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=588p9N5I8jFlu4CavfdXOWplaLS4j2sJ", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717153", "eventUri": "eng-9717153", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

German fans are responsible for the boos, as they blamed Cucurella for their elimination in the previous round. Cucurella received a \"nightmare reception\" from the Allianz Arena crowd, taking the blame for the handball that denied their Euro 2024 dream.\n\nSpain took on France in Euro 2024 in the first semi-final of Euro 2024. While all eyes may have been on the big names such as Kylian Mbappe but fans watching would have noticed some interesting crowd reaction whenever Marc Cucurella got on the ball.\n\nIndeed, the Chelsea defender was being booed every time he got involved. Fans were left puzzled as the left-back hasn't done anything obvious to upset either his own supporters or the French members of the crowd.\n\nHowever, the boos are understood to come from a different group all together.\n\nCucurella booed in Spain vs France Boos come from German fans\n\nIt seems as though German fans in the crowd are booing Cucurella due to the handball incident he was involved in during the quarter-final clash.\n\nThey of course would have been playing in this game, in their home nation, in Munich, had they not lost to the Spaniards 2-1 in the quarter-final.\n\nThe most controversial moment in the game came when Cucurella appeared to handle the ball but no penalty was given. With the scoreline still level at 1-1, youngster Jamal Musiala tried his luck with a long-range effort and the ball made contact with the hand of Spain's Marc Cucurella inside the penalty area. Strong appeals from the German players were waved away by Anthony Taylor .\n\nWith the call going against them, Tancredi Palmeri explained then that Cucurella has taken the blame, getting a 'nightmare reception' from the German fans in the Allianz Arena. He wrote:\n\n\"Cucurella is having nightmare reception. Every ball he touches he is buried by whole Allianz Arena booing him. It's each German in the stadium taking the revenge for handball breaking their #EURO2024 dream.\"\n\nJournalist Miguel Delaney also remarked on social media:\n\nIt isn't really Cucurella's fault the ball hit his hand, or that the referee didn't give a penalty.\n\nMore to follow...", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Cucurella", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marc Cucurella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Handball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allianz Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Musiala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Musiala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Delaney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Delaney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Taylor_(referee)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Taylor (referee)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Handball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Handball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mixcollage-09-jul-2024-08-12-pm-3798.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717153", "eventUri": "eng-9717153", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

The 25-year-old was involved in a controversial moment against the home nation in the quarter-finals when the referee adjudged in extra-time that he had not handled the ball in the penalty area.\n\nThis decision was ultimately costly for Germany as Mikel Merino scored a header deep into extra time to knock the hosts out and see Cucurella's team progress. Unsurprisingly, local fans who bought tickets hoping their country would be facing France tonight have turned against the Chelsea man and are booing him every time he touches the ball.\n\nAfter the incident involving Cucurella last Friday, Germany head coach Julian Nagelsmann called for UEFA to review their rules surrounding handballs. He told reporters: \"When it happened, I couldn't see it well and all I was thinking was: I hope it is a penalty, while the Spanish were thinking: I hope it is not a penalty.\n\n\"Afterwards I saw it on television more clearly but at that time that is all I could think. They were more lucky than we were.\n\n\"There is a rule and I hope there is no wrong decision. They applied the rule and it was not a penalty. I do not feel cheated. For me the question is about making it more practical, more logical, in terms of how this [handball] rule is assessed.\n\nREAD MORE: Cucurella confirms Chelsea transfer decision\n\nREAD MORE: Neville haunted by brutal Cucurella comments\n\n\"I say this for football [in general] not today. You look at the hand, if it is at 3 o'clock, if it is a bit higher or a bit lower. But there are people with bigger muscles than me, different movements.\"\n\nUEFA revealed their rules on handball before the tournament and explained that for situations like Cucurella's where his arm was close to his body, the referee was right not to award a spot kick.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

London is a great city to be in for a few years and today I'm not thinking about any change because my family is very happy.'\n\nMORE : Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen send messages to England and Netherlands ahead of Euro 2024 semi-final\n\nMORE : Didier Deschamps will 'continue his mission' as France manager, says FFF president", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "louis_sealey@metro.co.uk", "name": "Louis Sealey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Cucurella", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marc Cucurella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stamford Bridge (stadium)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_de_la_Fuente_(footballer,_born_1961)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis de la Fuente (footballer, born 1961)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Lineker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gary Lineker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Deschamps", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Didier Deschamps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Football_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Football Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/micah-richards-0840.png?crop=0px%2C35px%2C953px%2C501px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717153", "eventUri": "eng-9717153", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

However, the hosts were knocked out by Spain in the quarter-finals and there was a controversial incident involving Cucurella during that match.\n\nThe game ended 1-1 after 90 minutes, with Mikel Merino scoring the winner for Spain in extra-time. Germany, though, felt aggrieved that they were not awarded a penalty when a Jamal Musiala shot struck Cucurella's hand inside the box in extra-time.\n\nReferee Anthony Taylor waved away Germany's protests and manager Julian Nagelsmann criticised the decision after the game, suggesting the handball law should be changed. \"I don't want to talk too much about it, but it would be nice if it would be assessed what is the intention,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not possible in football if someone shoots into the stand and hits a hand, it's never [a penalty], but when [the ball is] clearly going towards goal and hits a hand, you can't talk about intention.\n\n\"You have to see where the shot is aimed. We have 50 robots bringing us coffee, so there should be an AI calculating crosses, shots, where they are going. It's quite simple. We should really assess where the shot is going, but that is not the only reason we lost the game.\"\n\nFormer Germany captain Michael Ballack, meanwhile, fumed on Magenta TV: \"All the criteria for a penalty are met. The arm is outstretched, a clear advantage, and yet there will be experts who see it differently.\"\n\nGary Neville was among those felt Taylor made the right decision, posting on social media: \"Thank you for not being handball!!\" Cucurella was also asked about the incident ahead of the semi-final clash with France.\n\n\"I'm a player, and I don't get involved in that,\" he said. \"If the referees say it wasn't a handball, I respect that decision. Ultimately, they have to make the tough calls. If they've said it wasn't, I understand.\n\n\"I understand it's a contentious issue. We're tired of seeing some handballs called and others not. If Germany had won, we wouldn't be talking about this. These things happen; they're decisions. We could have complained that [Toni] Kroos should have been shown a card and sent off.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

At Brighton as well he was good. Then once he arrived at Chelsea his form completely dipped, and let's not ignore the fact that he has had some very poor games for us and has often had concentration lapses and can be overly rash and headless when playing.\n\nHis Chelsea form has not been great overall. But the second half of last season he started to show much better form and better quality, leaving out more of the brain farts from his game. And he has seemingly taken that into the Euros.\n\nMake no mistake, his Euros form has not just been consistent, it has been consistently fantastic.\n\nSo far at the Euros, Cucurella has:\n\nPlayed: 5\n\nTackles: 8\n\nBall Recoveries: 31\n\nPassing Accuracy: 91.2%\n\nDistance Covered: 53.27km\n\nAverage Rating: 7.5/10\n\nThat's not just consistent, that is excellent.\n\nLast night he helped his team reach the final of the Euros, beating France 2-1. And once again, he was one of the better performers on the pitch.\n\nStats vs France:\n\nPlayed 90 minutes\n\n2 clearances\n\n1 tackle\n\n41/48 (85 %) accurate passes\n\n5(4) long balls\n\n5(3) ground duels won\n\nFouled twice\n\nCucurella registered more forward passes (24) than any other French player managed all game between the two sides last night.\n\nCucurella has registered more successful tackles (9), more successful interceptions (6) and more blocks (4) than any other Spanish player during the Euros.\n\nHe's literally proving Gary Neville wrong right now as well, which I think we as Chelsea fans can collectively get behind and celebrate!\n\nWhatever you think of Cucurella and whether you rate him or not, I think we all need to be collectively praising his Euros so far, and also, a much better second half of the season with Chelsea - he's been excellent lately.\n\nI'm not interested in anyone calling this a flip flop opinion, I will ALWAYS praise our players when it is due and they deserve the praise, just as I will criticise when I think they are playing badly. It's so important to do both and drop any agendas. It's important to call out positivity just as much as it is negativity.\n\nDo I think Cucurella is now going to turn things around at Chelsea? I'm sceptical still at the moment - my mind does not just forget about the poor form he has shown and the many mistakes he has made at Chelsea. But I'm not so closed minded that I wont be prepared to give him, or any player a chance to prove me wrong. Not necessarily wrong, because as I said I rated him at Getafe and at Brighton. But perhaps to prove my recent thoughts on him wrong and show they can make it and be a Chelsea player.\n\nIf Cucurella is playing well then that's only a good thing for the team I love, so why would anyone be against that?\n\nAnd the thing that makes it even easier to back Cucurella is because he is just a really great guy, a great character, and I've heard he's a really funny and entertaining person to have around Cobham to help keep morale up. He deserves the praise, so we should all absolutely be giving it to him right now for his great and consistent performances at the Euros. If England can't win it, then I'm all for Spain and Cucurella to bring it home!\n\nI don't know what his Chelsea future holds, the club would listen to good offers for both/either of Ben Chilwell and Cucurella. So we will see. But he's put himself in a great position ahead of starting pre-season with Chelsea, and his technical and passing ability will make him a perfect Enzo Maresca player, if he can cut out the liability side of his game. Jury stays out, but my mind is completely open.\n\nIf you would like to feature on Talk Chelsea click here.

On one hand, his side holds the lead against France and looks to be on their way to their first UEFA Euro final appearance since 2012 and on the other hand, he's the only player who's being subjected to boos by the crowd.\n\nThe player has been subject to constant boos by the crowd and it seemed puzzling as to why he was the only one being booed. The answer lies in the fact that the game is being played in Germany and it's the neutral German fans booing the player rather than the French faithful.\n\nThe reason for these boos by the German crowd comes from the fact that Spain were the ones to knock out hosts Germany in the quarter-finals and book their place in the last four. Somewhat controversially, in the game vs Germany, the ball hit the arm of Marc Cucurella while the Chelsea defender was trying to block an effort while in the box and it looked to be a certain penalty for the hosts.\n\nHowever, referee Anthony Taylor waived off all appeals for a penalty during the game and the incident was deemed not to be a penalty by the VAR as well. However, the German faithful disagreed with that decision with former German captain Michael Ballack telling Magenta TV, \"Clear wrong decision. The arm is outstretched, a clear advantage, and yet there will be experts who see it differently.\"\n\nThe boos though don't seem to be having any effect on the fullback as he has continued to be one of his side's best players in the UEFA Euro semi-final against France.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "faiz_ahmed@news9live.com", "name": "Faiz Ahmed", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Cucurella", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marc Cucurella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allianz Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Taylor_(referee)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Taylor (referee)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ballack", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Ballack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Telekom", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Telekom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Economy_and_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Economy and Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/safeimagekit-GettyImages-2161380082.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717153", "eventUri": "eng-9717153", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

the Allianz targeted him after a controversial hand ball decision went in his favour during the quarter-final win over Germany.\n\nJamal Musiala's effort appeared to be heading for goal before it struck Cucurella's hand in the box as the two were locked at 1-1 during a tense period of extra-time, ultimately settled by Mikel Merino's brilliant late header.\n\nReferee Anthony Taylor had waved away calls from the German players and a UEFA statement later explained: \"Cucurella's hand was not in an unnatural position at the time it was hit by the ball.\"\n\nReflecting on being booed by supporters, Cucurella told Cadena Cope: \"These are things that happen, I'm not to blame for anything.\n\n\"I don't know what they were trying to achieve with that, but that's the way it is.\n\n\"The most important thing is that we're in the final, and that's it.\"\n\nSpain reached their first European Championship final since 2012 with a 2-1 victory over the French, with Lamine Yamal and Dani

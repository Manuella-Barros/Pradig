Melbourne's south-east that it took from the Liberals in 2014 if an election had been held at the weekend, a poll has found.\n\nThe result suggests Liberal leader Matthew Guy's hopes of becoming premier next year have been hurt by news of his high-priced Lobster Cave dinner in April with an alleged organised crime figure.\n\nAbout a third of people polled said the controversy would make them less likely to vote Liberal.\n\nAmong those who identified as Liberal supporters, between 17 and 21 per cent said they were now less likely to vote for Mr Guy.\n\nRelated Articles What will Guy's lobster dinner end up costing him? Guy calls for 'real time' monitoring of donations\n\nThe Fairfax Media-ReachTel poll, in four seats the Coalition must win to take back government next year, indicates the Guy-led opposition's aggressive focus on crime has been blunted by the \"lobster with an alleged mobster\" saga.\n\nIn all but one of the four seats polled, Carrum, more undecided voters indicated they were currently leaning towards voting Labor than Liberal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in a glimmer of hope for the embattled Opposition Leader, more people said Mr Guy should remain in the top job (about 40 per cent) than those who said he should stand down over the incident (about 34 per cent).\n\nYou will now receive updates from AM & PM Update Newsletter AM & PM Update Newsletter\n\nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy .\n\nAnd about half said the incident would have had no influence on their vote.\n\nIt is believed Mr Guy retains the support of most in his party room for now, despite having had the worst week of his parliamentary career.\n\nSenior Liberal MPs who spoke to Fairfax Media late last week said they had resolved to put the controversy behind them and back Mr Guy as their best hope to lead them to victory.\n\nFairfax asked voters in the swinging seats of Bentleigh, Mordialloc, Carrum and Frankston questions about their views on issues including who should lead Victoria; the Lobster Cave dinner and its implications for Mr Guy; Victoria's crime rate; and which issues the state's politicians should focus on.\n\nThe automated phone poll of more than 700 voters in each seat was conducted on Friday night.\n\nThe poll suggests the lead Premier Daniel Andrews has over Mr Guy as preferred premier is not insurmountable, despite the damage the dinner and donations saga has done to Mr Guy's standing.\n\nMr Andrews had a roughly 10 per cent lead over Mr Guy in Bentleigh, Mordialloc and Frankston, but was shaded by his conservative rival by 50.2 per cent to 49.8 per cent in Carrum.\n\nLabor holds Bentleigh, Carrum and Frankston by paper-thin margins of less than 1 per cent, and holds Mordialloc by a 2.1 per cent margin.\n\nIf the weekend poll results were replicated in an election, Labor would romp home with a two-party-preferred margin of 12 per cent in Bentleigh and 10 per cent in Mordialloc and win with less safe buffers of 2 per cent in Carrum and 4 per cent in Frankston.\n\nThe four seats along the Frankston railway line have been critical to the outcome of the past two state elections, swinging from Labor to Liberal when John Brumby was defeated in 2010, and back to Labor in 2014.\n\nThe poll was conducted days after Fairfax Media revealed Mr Guy went to dinner with, among others, prominent fruit-and-vegetable businessman Frank Lamattina and Mr Lamattina's cousin Tony Madafferi, who police suspect is the head of the Melbourne Mafia although he has never been charged with any crime.\n\nMr Guy claims not to have known beforehand that Mr Madafferi, who denies having Mafia links, would be present.\n\nLiberal operative Barrie Macmillan, who was also at the dinner, later discussed being the intermediary for a large donation to the party and dividing it into smaller, non-disclosable amounts. Mr Macmillan resigned last week after the scandal broke.\n\nBut if the poll is good news for Labor, it contains a warning for both major parties on the potential drift towards One Nation in Melbourne's outer suburbs.\n\nOne Nation received support from 7.8 per cent of those polled in Mordialloc, for example, eclipsing the Greens, who got 6.8 per cent in that electorate; it received 6.3 per cent support in Carrum, 5.3 per cent in Frankston and 5 per cent in Bentleigh.\n\nThere was overwhelming agreement in all seats polled that crime rates are worsening in Victoria, an issue the Liberals have targeted with a swag of \"zero tolerance\" policies such as mandatory sentencing for repeat violent offenders and harsher crackdowns on bail breaches.\n\nMore than two-thirds agreed that crime is increasing in Victoria, with as few as 3-7 per cent taking the view crime is getting better under the Andrews government.\n\nBut on the question of whether Mr Guy is himself tough on crime, the result was mixed.\n\nMore, especially men, took the position that he does have a tough stance on crime, but in each seat the proportion of people who said they didn't know was greatest, suggesting the opposition's message is not reaching many in the electorate.\n\nVoters were also polled on which political issues were most important to them.\n\nHousing affordability topped the list of concerns in every electorate, with transport and healthcare also of significant worry, followed by jobs and education.", "timeCrawl": "11:54:00", "sim": 0.8392156958580017, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8910609", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "id": 126, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized_Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized Crime", "id": 458, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "id": 459, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Liberalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Liberalism", "id": 492, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Melbourne's south-east that it took from the Liberals in 2014 if an election had been held at the weekend, a poll has found.\n\nThe result suggests Liberal leader Matthew Guy's hopes of becoming premier next year have been hurt by news of his high-priced Lobster Cave dinner in April with an alleged organised crime figure.\n\nAbout a third of people polled said the controversy would make them less likely to vote Liberal.\n\nAmong those who identified as Liberal supporters, between 17 and 21 per cent said they were now less likely to vote for Mr Guy.\n\nRelated Articles What will Guy's lobster dinner end up costing him? Guy calls for 'real time' monitoring of donations\n\nThe Fairfax Media-ReachTel poll, in four seats the Coalition must win to take back government next year, indicates the Guy-led opposition's aggressive focus on crime has been blunted by the \"lobster with an alleged mobster\" saga.\n\nIn all but one of the four seats polled, Carrum, more undecided voters indicated they were currently leaning towards voting Labor than Liberal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in a glimmer of hope for the embattled Opposition Leader, more people said Mr Guy should remain in the top job (about 40 per cent) than those who said he should stand down over the incident (about 34 per cent).\n\nAnd about half said the incident would have had no influence on their vote.\n\nIt is believed Mr Guy retains the support of most in his party room for now, despite having had the worst week of his parliamentary career.\n\nSenior Liberal MPs who spoke to Fairfax Media late last week said they had resolved to put the controversy behind them and back Mr Guy as their best hope to lead them to victory.\n\nFairfax asked voters in the swinging seats of Bentleigh, Mordialloc, Carrum and Frankston questions about their views on issues including who should lead Victoria; the Lobster Cave dinner and its implications for Mr Guy; Victoria's crime rate; and which issues the state's politicians should focus on.\n\nThe automated phone poll of more than 700 voters in each seat was conducted on Friday night.\n\nThe poll suggests the lead Premier Daniel Andrews has over Mr Guy as preferred premier is not insurmountable, despite the damage the dinner and donations saga has done to Mr Guy's standing.\n\nMr Andrews had a roughly 10 per cent lead over Mr Guy in Bentleigh, Mordialloc and Frankston, but was shaded by his conservative rival by 50.2 per cent to 49.8 per cent in Carrum.\n\nLabor holds Bentleigh, Carrum and Frankston by paper-thin margins of less than 1 per cent, and holds Mordialloc by a 2.1 per cent margin.\n\nIf the weekend poll results were replicated in an election, Labor would romp home with a two-party-preferred margin of 12 per cent in Bentleigh and 10 per cent in Mordialloc and win with less safe buffers of 2 per cent in Carrum and 4 per cent in Frankston.\n\nThe four seats along the Frankston railway line have been critical to the outcome of the past two state elections, swinging from Labor to Liberal when John Brumby was defeated in 2010, and back to Labor in 2014.\n\nThe poll was conducted days after Fairfax Media revealed Mr Guy went to dinner with, among others, prominent fruit-and-vegetable businessman Frank Lamattina and Mr Lamattina's cousin Tony Madafferi, who police suspect is the head of the Melbourne Mafia although he has never been charged with any crime.\n\nMr Guy claims not to have known beforehand that Mr Madafferi, who denies having Mafia links, would be present.\n\nLiberal operative Barrie Macmillan, who was also at the dinner, later discussed being the intermediary for a large donation to the party and dividing it into smaller, non-disclosable amounts. Mr Macmillan resigned last week after the scandal broke.\n\nBut if the poll is good news for Labor, it contains a warning for both major parties on the potential drift towards One Nation in Melbourne's outer suburbs.\n\nOne Nation received support from 7.8 per cent of those polled in Mordialloc, for example, eclipsing the Greens, who got 6.8 per cent in that electorate; it received 6.3 per cent support in Carrum, 5.3 per cent in Frankston and 5 per cent in Bentleigh.\n\nThere was overwhelming agreement in all seats polled that crime rates are worsening in Victoria, an issue the Liberals have targeted with a swag of \"zero tolerance\" policies such as mandatory sentencing for repeat violent offenders and harsher crackdowns on bail breaches.\n\nMore than two-thirds agreed that crime is increasing in Victoria, with as few as 3-7 per cent taking the view crime is getting better under the Andrews government.\n\nBut on the question of whether Mr Guy is himself tough on crime, the result was mixed.\n\nMore, especially men, took the position that he does have a tough stance on crime, but in each seat the proportion of people who said they didn't know was greatest, suggesting the opposition's message is not reaching many in the electorate.\n\nVoters were also polled on which political issues were most important to them.\n\nHousing affordability topped the list of concerns in every electorate, with transport and healthcare also of significant worry, followed by jobs and education.", "timeCrawl": "11:09:00", "sim": 0.7882353067398071, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8906147", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "id": 126, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized_Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized Crime", "id": 458, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "id": 459, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Liberalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Liberalism", "id": 492, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Madafferi has never been charged with a crime and denies any wrongdoing.\n\nThe Friday night poll suggests there is significant disquiet in the community about Guy's contact with an alleged Mafia figure, which raised questions about how organised crime might seek to buy political influence in Victoria, which has the weakest electoral donation disclosure regime in Australia.\n\nRelated Articles Opposition Leader dined with alleged mobster\n\nThe crime-fighting persona the Opposition Leader has cultivated over many months is tarnished now.

Opposition Leader.\n\nBut is it enough to end his tilt for the Premier's job?\n\nRevelations of a secret lobster dinner with alleged crime figure Tony Madafferi uncovered by an ABC-Fairfax investigation are not yet fatal.\n\nThere appears to be no active moves within the parliamentary team for a change in the leadership -- his team pointing to the fact the party room were united behind him this week.\n\nThe problem, and the greatest source of discontent, is outside Parliament and in party ranks, with officials reporting anger among the branch members.\n\nAnd in the broader public there are plenty of voters scratching their heads about why a political leader dined with an alleged mobster.\n\nThe greatest fear of nervous MPs is whether there's more dirt to surface on their leader.\n\n\"What else is going to come? We fear this is just the start,\" one figure said.\n\nRegardless of what the future holds, it is already troubling times for the Victoria's alternative premier.\n\nThe seafood and Grange meal is especially damaging for someone who has successfully smashed the Andrews-Labor Government on law and order amid soaring crime rates and a youth justice crisis.\n\nThe problem for Mr Guy is that his campaign on law and order is at best tainted, at worst completely in tatters.\n\nPremier Daniel Andrews bellowed in Parliament this week: \"The Leader of the Opposition has forfeited the right to lecture anybody on crime or community safety\".\n\nFor now, Mr Andrews is right.\n\nPolitics can often be as simple as \"optics\" and this dinner with Mr Madafferi, a man police have successfully banned from Crown Casino over alleged crime links, certainly is a terrible look.\n\nIt also shows an appalling lack of judgement, and process in his office.\n\nThe guests at the dinner should have been vetted, but importantly Mr Guy should have been able to make a call when he got to the dinner that it was inappropriate for him to be there.\n\nYes, it would have been awkward to leave a dinner so quickly but if he wants to be premier difficult decisions must be made.\n\nMr Guy says in hindsight he should not have gone, but he also said being there for two minutes or for hours would have been no different.\n\nThose closest to him are trying to blow the dinner off as a storm in the teacup and point to the scandal that engulfed Mr Andrews in opposition regarding the theft of an Age journalist's dictaphone and release of the its contents.\n\nLoyalists point to the fact Mr Andrews survived the scandal and became premier.\n\nMr Guy's changing story also has not been lost on keen observers of Spring Street politics.\n\nFirst there were 20 diners, then a dozen, despite reports it was six or seven, later confirmed by a caller to 3AW.\n\nThen there was the claim that no donations from any of the dinner guests have come to the Liberal party, yet Mr Guy attended a $2,000-a-head fundraiser with one of the guests in June.\n\nAnd while not a disclosable donation amount (that's a topic for another day), it added to the moving story.\n\nIn the wake of the revelations the Liberal party has conducted phone polling into their wider base, the results say that issues of concern for voters remain the same: law and order, cost of living and jobs.\n\nAnd as some point out voters usually cast their ballot according to how it will affect them personally.\n\nWhile Mr Guy kept up his tactic of asking questions on crime in question time, there were less questions than normal and a clear pivot to the energy pricing.\n\nThe State Opposition is set to make cost of living, with a focus on power bills, a major issue.\n\nThe federal party under Malcolm Turnbull has already made this step with the Prime Minister meeting with energy leaders and the issue regularly in talking points.\n\nThe 2018 election is set to be a tight affair -- Labor only needs to lose three seats to surrender its majority. It will be an election fought on a seat-by-seat basis and there are still Liberals who are confident Premier Andrews can be dumped after one term.\n\nWith 15 months to go before the state poll, crime is now at best a neutral issue for the Coalition, Mr Guy and his team will need to sharpen their attacks, with policy solutions, in other areas.\n\nAnd with Labor boasting an impressive agenda on infrastructure and keeping health and education out of the headlines, the challenge will be all the greater without a law and order and drum to bang.", "timeCrawl": "14:40:00", "sim": 0.7607843279838562, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8638654", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "id": 126, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "id": 276, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "id": 459, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Liberalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Liberalism", "id": 492, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Melbourne's alleged Mafia boss at a lobster restaurant earlier this year.\n\nTranscripts of the calls, obtained by Fairfax Media and Four Corners, also suggest that the Lobster Cave dinner attended by alleged Mafia boss Tony Madafferi was a secretive affair, not a semi-public function as depicted by Mr Guy.\n\nMr Guy said outside Parliament House that he did not know Mr Madafferi would be at the dinner until he was introduced to him in the restaurant as \"cousin Tony\".\n\nHe later said he was so confident he had done nothing wrong that he would refer himself to the state's anti-corruption commission, IBAC.\n\nIn transcripts of the phone recordings, the Liberal Party figure who organised the dinner, Barrie Macmillan, says he personally briefed Mr Guy's office about Mr Madafferi's presence at the dinner, and stressed the need to keep the meeting confidential.\n\n\"I had to forward the names to [Matthew Guy's private secretary]. I had to do it all through [her]. It was all kept fairly hush hush,\" says Mr Macmillan, who also attended the dinner.\n\n\"I explained the whole thing [to Mr Guy's secretary] and I said, the whole thing to her. And said, I don't want to put anything in writing here, so let's just talk on the phone and I then picked the venue and gave them the list of the people.\n\n\"Everyone I gave [to Mr Guy's office]: Antonio Madafferi, that's his full name; Frank Lamattina; Bruno Diaco.\n\n\"So this all started off in a big way with Matt, in helping Matt to become the next premier.\"\n\nHowever, Mr Guy insisted to reporters today that there was no way of him knowing the alleged crime figure would be at the Lobster Cave.\n\n\"Tell me how I would know that? I'm sure every politician has dined with people who they didn't know was going to be there,\" Mr Guy said.\n\nFairfax Media and Four Corners revealed that the Opposition Leader dined with Mr Madafferi and three of his relatives over several bottles of Penfolds Grange at the Beaumaris restaurant, and discussed the location of the Melbourne wholesale fruit and vegetable market. All four men are Liberal Party donors.\n\nMr Madafferi has been the subject of intense police scrutiny over a number of years.\n\nMr Guy subsequently dismissed claims the dinner was in any way a clandestine affair, stating: \"If it was so secretive ... why was it in the middle of a packed suburban restaurant? Cause it was. I wasn't ushered in by anyone in secret and ushered up to the back.\"\n\nBut the organiser of the dinner, Mr Macmillan, is recorded saying that Mr Guy's entry and exit from the restaurant were handled precisely to avoid any scrutiny.\n\n\"[The Lobster Cave] gave us a very, very private table. No one really saw Matthew with any of these people. I was very conscious, I stood in the street until Matthew's chauffeur dropped him off. He walked in behind me ... and we all left separately.\n\n\"I walked out with Matt when his driver came, so the other people didn't walk out with him ... you know, I'm not stupid.\n\nIn the covertly recorded conversations about the dinner reviewed by Fairfax Media and Four Corners, it appears the Liberal Party made an effort to keep the dinner private.\n\n\"I don't want to put anything in writing here, so let's just talk on the phone,\" Mr Macmillan says when describing how the dinner should be planned.\n\nThere are a number of references in the transcript to avoiding conversations on the phone or in a car.\n\nAlso during his press conference, Mr Guy downplayed reports that Grange was consumed at the dinner.\n\nHowever, Mr Macmillan says in the transcript: \"I wouldn't have liked to pay the bill, we had two bottles of Grange.\"\n\n\"We just drank that [bottles of Grange] and the menu was all picked out. We had top-shelf lobster and this and that and everything else.\"\n\nA second transcript describes three bottles of Grange being consumed. There is also reference to the resignation of Barry O'Farrell, who stepped down as NSW premier after allegations he was given a bottle of Grange as a gift he failed to disclose.\n\nMr Guy and the Liberal Party did not pay for the meal, which may have cost several thousand dollars.\n\nIn the transcript, Mr Macmillan suggests that market gardener Frank Lamattina had met Mr Guy at a Liberal fundraiser in November, 2016, where the Opposition Leader gave him his personal number and committed to attending an intimate dinner with him.\n\nMr Guy appears to have initially avoided this commitment, but later agreed to meet at the Lobster Cave when Mr Lamattina complained, saying: \"The promise is, you know, John Howard used to keep all his promises. Is there a problem?\"\n\nMr Guy told the media conference this morning that the dinner had nothing to do with political donations, despite the fact that the four businessman who attended, including Mr Madafferi, are all donors.\n\nHis office also insisted yesterday that 20 people had attended, which today he amended to say over \"a dozen, or maybe more\".\n\nHowever, Mr Macmillan repeatedly states on the transcript of the recording that a total of seven people were invited.\n\nMr Madafferi, a wealthy market gardener and the owner of the La Porchetta pizza chain, has repeatedly been accused by police in court of being a high-ranking member of Melbourne's Mafia and Mr Guy has previously been warned about associating with him.\n\nIn an affidavit filed in court in June to support Mr Madafferi's ban from Crown Casino and all Victorian racetracks, Detective Superintendent Peter Brigham said the police hold \"substantial intelligence\" indicating that Mr Madafferi had \"substantial and close involvement with serious criminal conduct including drug importation, murder and extortion\".\n\nMr Madafferi has never been charged with a criminal offence and denies any wrongdoing.\n\nMr Guy has cultivated a \"tough on crime\" persona as Opposition Leader, but has previously been warned about associating with alleged Mafia figures after he claimed as planning minister he had \"unwittingly\" become the star attraction at a 2013 fundraiser hosted by Mr Madafferi at his Docklands venue centre.\n\nA spokesman for Mr Guy acknowledged that the Opposition Leader had been at the dinner, but said it had been \"hosted and organised by Liberal Party member and executive member of AUSVEG Victoria, Frank Lamattina\", and was \"held in open view at a popular restaurant\".\n\nAlso at the dinner was Hawthorn footballer turned Liberal councillor Geoff Ablett, and two other Calabrian community members, Bruno Diaco, a relative of Mr Madafferi, and Vince Doria, a business partner of Mr Madafferi who co-owns the Docklands venue used for the 2013 fundraiser.\n\nMr Lamattina angrily declined to answer questions, stating: \"You print a lot of f***ing lies. If you want to see me you come and see me on the farm.\"\n\nMr Macmillan did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe Liberal Party is cash strapped, with some of its traditional wealthy donors withholding funds after a spat between party officials and long-time donors.\n\nA series of Fairfax Media and Four Corners reports over the past two years have shown that Tony Madafferi and Mr Lamattina were involved in a 2006 donations scandal in which the planned deportation of Mr Madafferi's brother, Francesco, a Mafia boss, was overturned after a long campaign of lobbying and donating to federal Liberal politicians.\n\nFrancesco, a violent criminal and drug trafficker, was later jailed in connection to Australia's biggest ecstasy importation.\n\nFor three decades, policing agencies have alleged Mr Madafferi holds a senior rank in Australia's secretive Calabrian Mafia organisation.\n\nThe Australian Federal Police covertly filmed Mr Madafferi in a city park and at Crown Casino with several notorious Mafia drug traffickers in 2008 as part of a probe into Australia's biggest ecstasy importation.\n\nAfter the Lygon Street murder of Mr Madafferi's lawyer and associate, Joe Acquaro, in 2015, Mr Madafferi's solicitor, Paulo Tatti, revealed in an affidavit filed in court that detectives had falsely accused Mr Madafferi of placing a $200,000 contract on Mr Acquaro's life.\n\nThere is no suggestion Mr Madafferi was involved in Mr Acquaro's unsolved murder.\n\nMr Madafferi gained further notoriety after a 2015 Fairfax Media and Four Corners expose about his political donation activity.\n\nThe expose detailed Mr Guy's appearance at the Madafferi political fundraiser in Docklands in 2013.\n\nMr Guy was planning minister at the time and his office claimed he had no role in Mr Madafferi's presence at the fundraiser.\n\nAfter the 2015 reports, Liberal politicians allegedly cut contact with Mr Madafferi.\n\nThe Howard government gave Mr Madafferi's brother, drug trafficker Francesco, a visa in 2006 after Tony Madafferi and Frank Lamattina lobbied and donated to several Liberal MPs.", "timeCrawl": "19:54:00", "sim": 0.7137255072593689, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2016-11-", "textStart": 4355, "amb": false, "textEnd": 4369}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8837118", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "id": 114, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized_Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized Crime", "id": 458, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Liberalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Liberalism", "id": 492, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"pinCnt": 3}}

Bentleigh, Mordialloc, Carrum and Frankston - the poll suggests Labor has extended its narrow winning margin from 2014.\n\nIt will also make it more difficult for the opposition to deny the consequences of Guy's terrible lapse of judgment in dining with alleged Mafia boss Tony Madafferi, even if Guy insists he did not know Madefferi would be at the dinner. Madafferi has never been charged with a crime and denies any wrongdoing.\n\nThe Friday night poll suggests there is significant disquiet in the community about Guy's contact with an alleged Mafia figure, which raised questions about how organised crime might seek to buy political influence in Victoria, which has the weakest electoral donation disclosure regime in Australia.\n\nRelated Articles Opposition Leader dined with alleged mobster\n\nThe crime-fighting persona the Opposition Leader has cultivated over many months is tarnished now. Roughly one-third of voters polled said they were less likely to vote for Guy.\n\nGranted, the proportion of voters polled who said the incident would have no influence on their vote was higher, but any loss of support is damaging, maybe even fatal, in seats where the Coalition must increase its 2014 vote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe poll has vindicated the Coalition's strategy of consistently hammering the Andrews government on crime; it shows barely anybody believes crime rates are improving under Labor.\n\nBut it also points to a high level of disengagement among voters with what politicians have to say; a huge chunk of those polled didn't know if Guy had a tough-on-crime stance, even though the Coalition has put \"zero tolerance\" at the heart of a slew of recent policy announcements it has made.\n\nThe danger for Guy and his party is that while many voters won't know where he stands on mandatory sentencing, they will know who he ate with at the Lobster Cave restaurant.\n\nThe poll isn't all good news for Labor either.\n\nAlthough it would smile at news of 10 and 12 per cent margins in Mordialloc and Bentleigh respectively, one could argue that its slender leads in Carrum and Frankston after such a car crash of a week for Guy exposes a shaky grip on the seats it holds further along the railway line.\n\nThese are seats where first-home buyers have migrated after being priced out of suburbs closer to the city, and where getting to work often means a grinding commute of an hour or more each way.\n\nAs much as the government will seek to make mileage out of Guy's slip, the poll results show its hold on power rests more with its performance on issues of bread and butter, not lobster and Grange.", "timeCrawl": "11:09:00", "sim": 0.6705882549285889, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8906127", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "id": 126, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Web_Design_and_Development", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Web Design and Development", "id": 261, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "id": 276, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "id": 301, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized_Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized Crime", "id": 458, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "id": 459, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Roadknight.\n\nView More Local BusinessList Your Business Here\n\nMichael Cardamone was a convicted rapist, out on parole and living in Whorouly where there was no police station and his parole officer was 33 kilometres away in Wangaratta.\n\nHe did not have constant supervision back in January 2016 when he murdered neighbour Karen Chetcuti Verbunt, and her family and friends want to know why.\n\nOpposition leader Matthew Guy took their questions to Victorian Parliament this week, as Karen's mother Clary Verbunt and friend Carol Roadknight traveled to Melbourne to watch from the public gallery.\n\n\"A key consideration in determining whether to grant parole is the availability of suitable accommodation that enables authorities to closely monitor the behaviour of the offender,\" he said.\n\n\"Given we know that Cardamone had already breached parole twice for drug and child pornography offences, how often was he required to report to his parole supervisor and how many other times did he fail to comply with his parole conditions?\"\n\nCardamone was released after four months in custody in 2015 when he was found not guilty of the child pornography offence.\n\nNEED FOR CHANGE: Opposition Leader Matthew Guy has pushed for more changes to parole law.\n\nPremier Daniel Andrews said the government was making \"significant reform\" to reduce the number of serious offences committed by those on parole, but did not have the specifics of the Cardamone case on hand.\n\nThe Corrections department told The Border Mail supervision and requirements for offenders who obtain parole had improved by providing additional oversight for serious violent and sex offenders.\n\n\"That does not for a moment though ease the pain and the grief of those who have been victims of crime committed by parolees,\" Mr Andrews said.\n\n\"The grief and the anguish of this family are all too real and serious, and I will follow up and write to them if there is anything further I can do.\"\n\nThe questions sparked an argument between Liberal and Labor MPs when Mr Andrews referenced Mr Guy's dinner with alleged Mafia boss Tony Madafferi.\n\n\"I wonder whether when the Leader of the Opposition is speaking to victims of crime he lets them know who he dines with, who he takes money from,\" he said.\n\nMr Guy's colleagues leaped to his defence, calling the premier's comments \"disgraceful\" when Ms Chetcuti's loved ones were present.\n\nOFFERING SUPPORT: Premier Daniel Andrews said his sympathies were with the family of Karen Chetcuti Verbunt.\n\nGuy was 'pretending to care': Andrews\n\nQuestions have been raised as to why Opposition Leader Matthew Guy chose to fight for the right of victims like Karen Chetcuti Verbunt in the same week he was under fire for associating with the mafia.\n\nThe Labor Party has insinuated his questions in Parliament this week were a tactic to distract attention away from criticism of the well-publicised lobster dinner with alleged Mafia boss Tony Madafferi.\n\nPremier Daniel Andrews told Mr Guy he had forfeited his right to lecture him on community safety.\n\n\"You pretend to care about victims when you take money from the people who make them victims,\" he said.\n\n\"But I have not risen to point out the galloping hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition and the fraudulent way in which he pretends to support victims.\"\n\nMr Andrews' office told The Border Mail the premier stood by his comments.\n\nDeputy Premier James Merlino stood by his leader, saying the issue should be raised because \"organised crime are the instigators of victims of crime\".\n\nCarol Roadknight, a friend of Ms Chetcuti Verbunt who was in Parliament to campaign for parole reform, said it was the Labor politicians who acted disrespectfully.\n\n\"Andrews never even turned his chair once to acknowledge Karen's friends and family sitting in the public gallery, he was too busy making jokes and laughing with his team,\" she said.\n\n\"I am disgusted with his and his government's behaviour today and I also asked him for an apology in Karen's name.\"\n\nMs Roadknight said Mr Andrews did acknowledge her emails and has now challenged him to meet with her after Cardamone is sentenced in court on August 25, giving him a deadline of September 2.", "timeCrawl": "07:50:00", "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "extractedDates":

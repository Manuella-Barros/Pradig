Polls opened in 20 EU countries early Sunday for the June 6-9 elections for a new European Parliament, the legislative branch of the 27-member bloc. Millions of Europeans have been casting their ballots this week in one of the world\u2019s biggest democratic elections. Far-right parties are looking to gain more power amid a rise in the cost of living and farmers\u2019 discontent, while the wars in Gaza and Ukraine are also key topics weighing on the minds of voters. The economy, jobs, poverty and social exclusion, public health, climate change and the future of Europe are also prominent issues. Official results are not expected before the last polling stations in all 27 EU nations close late Sunday. Currently: \u2014 An assault on the Danish prime minister is the latest in a recent surge in political violence in Europe \u2014 Italy\u2019s far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni tells the EU\u2019s traditional center parties their time is up \u2014 What\u2019s at stake: AP\u2019s explainer on how it works and the main issues \u2014 Overwhelmed by the elections? A guide to the key races to watch Here\u2019s the latest: A WIDESPREAD YAWN\u2019 IN SPAIN, WHERE TURNOUT APPEARS LOW MADRID \u2014 Mar\u00eda Del Mar Mira, a civil servant and historian in the central Letras neighbourhood of Madrid, expressed disappointment at not seeing the queues that normally form for national elections at her polling station in central Madrid. She said voters don\u2019t understand the importance of decisions taken in the European Parliament. \u201cWe should take this more seriously, because there are a lot of important things coming from there and the truth is it that we are taking a direction that reminds me of past and undesirable times,\u201d Mira said. Some 38 million Spaniards are eligible to vote Sunday to elect 61 members of the 720-seat European Parliament, with the conservative opposition and the ruling Socialists expected to get the most seats. Antonio Garc\u00eda Escolar, a producer and screenwriter from Madrid, also remarked on low interest in the vote, something he blamed on misinformation. \u201cWe have fallen into a widespread yawn,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are asleep, because we prefer reading a headline or what a YouTuber tells us and we don\u2019t seek truthful information.\u201d Garc\u00eda Escolar did not disclose who he voted for but said his vote was \u201cagainst fascism.\u201d \u201cFascism is not something that one learns in school, it is something that is dormant and that is inside all of us, that only awakens when fear is stirred,\u201d he said. Ana Cabanas, a lawyer from Madrid, said the economy and the agricultural policies that are decided in Brussels were some of the main topics that drove her to vote. \u201cI still believe in Europe and I want to have a say in matters that affect Spanish legislation and that are decided in Europe,\u201d Cabanas said. FRENCH VOTERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT MIGRATION AND WARS IN UKRAINE AND THE MIDDLE EAST PARIS \u2014 Migration has been one of the most important issues to French voters, and the party of far-right leader Marine Le Pen is hoping for a strong showing against the centrist party of President Emmanuel Macron. Jordan Bardella, Le Pen\u2019s 28-year-old protege and the current president of the far-right National Rally, gave strong performances in debates ahead of this weekend\u2019s election, something that could help Le Pen as she is expected to run for the French presidency in 2027. Bardella has fiercely opposed the EU Asylum and Migration Pact, a plan backed by Macron that seeks to harmonise the management of irregular migrant arrivals among EU nations. French voters are also focused on the war in Ukraine and Gaza. \u201cToday, in the context of a war in Ukraine and the Middle East, there\u2019s a different dimension than the national one,\u201d said Francois Tivolle, who cast his ballot in Paris\u2019 11th district. GERMANY\u2019S UNPOPULAR COALITION FACES ITS FIRST NATIONWIDE TEST SINCE TAKING OFFICE IN 2021 BERLIN \u2014 The European Parliament election gives political parties in Germany their first nationwide test since centre-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s government took office at the end of 2021. Pre-election surveys suggested that the mainstream conservative opposition, the Union bloc, can expect to remain Germany\u2019s strongest force in the EU legislature. They predict weak results for the three parties in Scholz\u2019s quarrelsome governing coalition, which has become very unpopular. The far-right Alternative for Germany can expect gains compared with the 11 per cent of the vote it won in 2019, but its performance may be hampered by a string of setbacks in recent months, including scandals surrounding its two lead candidates for the European Parliament. Germany elects 96 of the 720 lawmakers who will make up Europe\u2019s new Parliament, the biggest single share. Voter Laura Simon said in Berlin: \u201cI do hope that we will manage to avoid a shift to the right and that Europe will somehow remain united.\u201d HUNGARY\u2019S PRIME MINISTER FACES FIRST ELECTORAL TEST SINCE NEW RIVAL APPEARS BUDAPEST, Hungary \u2014 Many Hungarian view the election as a referendum on the popularity of Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, whose illiberal policies and his support for Russia have pushed him to the margins of the European Union. While Fidesz has dominated Hungarian politics since 2010, many Hungarians are deeply dissatisfied with the direction the country is going, and hope to deal a blow to Orb\u00e1n by supporting one of the most formidable challengers he\u2019s ever faced. P\u00e9ter Magyar, a 43-year-old lawyer and former insider within Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party, has built up Hungary\u2019s strongest opposition party in a matter of months and hopes to use a good showing in Sunday\u2019s elections to propel himself and his movement toward defeating the prime minister in the next national ballot scheduled for 2026. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s governing Fidesz party is expected to win the largest share of the vote after campaigning heavily on fears that the war in neighbouring Ukraine could escalate to involve Hungary directly. Hungary is set to take over the EU\u2019s rotating six-month presidency next month.

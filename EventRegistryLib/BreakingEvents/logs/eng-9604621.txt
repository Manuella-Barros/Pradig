The Office of President says the strike violates the union contract.\n\nNearly a third of the academic and graduate student workers of the University of California are on strike, after the union of 48,000 members escalated its labor standoff by walking off the job at UCLA and UC Davis this morning.\n\nWith as many as 2,000 UC Santa Cruz graduate students and academic workers picketing since last Monday, today's job action brings 12,000 more out of classrooms and laboratories, potentially crippling the university's mission of educating the roughly 80,000 undergraduates at the three campuses just two weeks before students begin to take their end-of-quarter finals.\n\nWorkers, including teaching assistants, academic researchers and graders, are striking not over pay and benefits but instead over the UC's response to pro-Palestinian protesters who were arrested by police or suspended from their campuses. Some union members were arrested or suspended for their role in the protests. Core to the union's demands is that the UC offer \"amnesty for those who experienced arrest or are facing University discipline,\" the union's public writings state.\n\nSome 60 academic workers began picketing at Royce Quad at UCLA by 9 a.m., where just weeks ago students at a large pro-Palestinian encampment were attacked by counter-protesters.\n\n\"UC, UC you're no good, treat your workers like you should,\" the picketing academic workers chanted, their ranks gradually growing as more striking workers arrived under a gray sky. \"When free speech is under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back,\" went another chant, the rhythmic pulses of a snare drum accompanying the picketers, who grew to more than 200 by 10:30 a.m.\n\nUC's Office of the President calls the strike illegal, saying that its contract with the union -- itself the result of a six-week long strike in late 2022 -- includes a no-strike provision. The union, UAW 4811, vehemently disagrees with that analysis, citing legal precedent that a union can strike over unfair labor practices that fall outside the scope of a union contract. It's a view shared by at least one UCLA law professor.\n\nBoth sides have leaned heavily on the state's Public Employment Relations Board to adjudicate their disputes.\n\nTwo days after police swept the encampments at UCLA and arrested scores of protesters, the union filed an unfair labor practice violation with the labor relations board. The union then filed similar violations after police cleared encampments at UC San Diego and UC Irvine that also led to arrests of protesters -- and another alleging that the UC changed its disciplinary rules unilaterally to punish academic workers.\n\n\"By summoning the police to forcibly arrest and/or issuing interim suspensions to these employees, the University has violated their employee rights,\" the union wrote in one of its submissions to the labor relations board. The union says its workers were not only rallying against the war in Gaza but also seeking ways to remove academic research funding sources tied to the U.S. military. Workers also oppose \"the discrimination and hostile work environment directed towards Palestinian, Muslim, and pro-Palestine Jewish employees and students.\"\n\nUnlike a systemwide strike, this \"stand up\" strike will pursue labor stoppages at certain campuses, a strategy employed by Detroit autoworkers in their successful campaign for higher compensation last year. The approach is meant to apply gradual pressure to management.\n\nWhile the strike is technically distinct from the larger protest movement against the war, the two movements are related. Last Thursday, several hundred UCLA members of the UAW 4811 held a rally in support of their impending strike. Moments later, they joined a student-led protest demanding that the UC call for a ceasefire and divest from weapons manufacturers and the Israeli economy. That same day, protesters erected a short-lived encampment and temporarily took over a campus building before being pushed out by police.\n\nIt was a clear sign that, despite hundreds of arrests in May, thousands of students, union members and some faculty remain passionate about their pro-Palestinian advocacy.\n\nAlmost 20,000 of the union's 48,000 members voted on whether to strike two weeks ago, and nearly 80% of those who did vote approved the strike authorization.\n\nThe UC sought an injunction to legally halt the strike, but the labor relations board wrote last week that UC hadn't established that an injunction is \"just and proper.\" The union hailed the ruling. However, the board wrote that it's leaving UC's request open in the event the university provides better evidence.\n\nIn a partial victory for the university, the board issued a complaint that the union \"failed to provide adequate advance notice of its work stoppage, and failed and refused to meet and confer in good faith.\" The UC press office, in announcing the board's response, wrote that the labor board \"found enough evidence to suggest that a violation may have occurred, and further examination is warranted.\"\n\nThe union argues in its latest unfair labor practice violation that the UC unilaterally implemented a disciplinary policy that affects UAW 4811 workers. The union seeks an order telling the UC to \"cease and desist from unilaterally changing the terms and conditions of employment related to discipline.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the UC Office of the President disputes that characterization, writing that these policies aren't new and reaffirm existing rules. The spokesperson, Heather Hansen, sought to invalidate the central thrust of the union's demands, writing to CalMatters last week: \"By requesting amnesty, UAW is asking the University not to follow its processes but rather to make an exception for its members so that they are not subject to the same accountability measures applicable to all other members of the UC community.\"\n\nNot all unionized workers have jobs with labor to withhold. Some are paid with fellowships to advance their own research. But most perform a job duty that's integral to the academic mission of the university. Systemwide, about 20,000 workers are graduate student teaching assistants, tutors or other instructional assistants.\n\nGraduate students teach classes, especially introductory courses, run discussion sections and grade student work.\n\nLast week, about 60% to 70% of UC Santa Cruz workers who could withhold their labor did, estimated Rebecca Gross, the unit chair of the union at the campus.\n\nOn the social media platform Reddit, individuals identifying themselves as UCLA students wrote that some of their discussion sessions are being canceled and that some of their courses are moving online. It \"is tragic for me bc (sic) I learn 80% of the material from discussion and problem solving sessions,\" wrote one poster.\n\nWho'll pick up the work that the striking workers won't do is an open question. The governing body of UCLA faculty sent a message to professors that \"faculty members cannot be required to take on additional responsibilities for teaching related to a work stoppage.\"\n\nMost protesters, including UAW 4811 members, who were arrested were cited for failing to follow police orders to disperse. At UCLA, administrators sent a notice to students and protesters on April 30, a day before police cleared the encampment, that \"the established encampment is unlawful and violates university policy\" and asked the participants to leave the area or face sanctions. The notice also said that \"law enforcement is prepared to arrest individuals, in accordance with applicable law.\"\n\nThe notice added that \"for students, those sanctions could include disciplinary measures such as interim suspension that, after proper due process through the student conduct process, could lead to dismissal.\"\n\nMembers of the encampment replied the same day, writing in part \"We will continue to remain here steadfast in our demands.\"\n\nThat night, counter-protesters attacked those in the encampment with pepper spray, wooden sticks and at least one firework as police stood by for hours and made no arrests. Local and national news outlets brought around-the-clock coverage to the violence.\n\nThe next afternoon, police ordered members of the encampment to disperse. Hours after those orders, police arrested more than 200 people.\n\n\"In contrast to the lack of police response to the violent attack by anti-Palestine counterprotesters on April 30, 2024, the University summoned a massive number of police officers on the evening of May 1, 2024 for the purpose of ejecting and arresting the employees engaged in peaceful protest in the UCLA Palestine Solidarity Encampment,\" union lawyers wrote in one of the unfair labor practice violations submitted to the state labor relations board.\n\nKai Shi, a mathematics doctoral student at UCLA, pushed back on the reason to call the police in the first place. \"Just because the police say it's unlawful doesn't mean that they're right,\" he said.\n\n\"The unlawful assembly is an excuse by the university to shut us down,\" Shi argued.\n\nUC San Diego issued at least 40 suspensions in the middle of May related to the pro-Palestinian protests, the union wrote in one of its unfair labor practice violations. \"Such extreme disciplinary measures in response to peaceful protest activity suppress free expression of ideas and violate the First Amendment,\" it read.\n\n\"We are standing up for justice in the workplace, in a way that directly affects not just us, but our students,\" said Anny Viloria Winnett, the unit chair of the local UCLA union chapter.\n\nShe said the union is taking on a \"fight for our ability to be safe on campus, our ability to have free speech and protest on our campus, but it's also a fight that our students led ... and we're just a continuation of that.\"",

Striking workers claim the UC system mishandling its response to campus protests over the war in Gaza.\n\nThose protests included an encampment of pro-Palestinian demonstrators on the Westwood campus that was cleared out days after a violent clash involving counter-protesters. The overnight police operation ended in about 200 arrests.\n\nWorkers represented by United Auto Workers Local 4811 have already been striking at UC Santa Cruz in what the union called the first wave of planned walkouts. According to the union, the second round of strikes will begin Tuesday at UCLA and UC Davis.\n\nThe strike is in response to what the unionized workers called egregious unfair labor practices, including \"summoning militarized police officers from numerous outside law enforcement to violently eject and arrest peaceful protesters.\"\n\nThe UC system has blasted the union's allegations and filed unfair labor practice complaints of its own, saying the union's labor contract has a no-strike provision and that the union's demands are outside the scope of union labor issues. In a statement released before the union's strike-authorization vote, officials at the University of California Office of the President said, \"UC believes that the vote currently being conducted by UAW leadership sets a dangerous precedent that would introduce non-labor issues into labor agreements. If a strike is allowed for political and social disputes, the associated work stoppages would significantly impact UC's ability to deliver on its promises to its students, community and the State of California.\"\n\nUAW Local 4811 is asking the UC schools to give amnesty to all academic employees and students who face arrest or disciplinary actions for protesting. The union wants the students to have guarantees of freedom of speech and political expression on campus and is asking for researchers to be able to opt out of funding sources tied to the Israeli Defense Force.\n\nSporadic disruptions continued following the dismantling of the pro-Palestinian encampment at UCLA. On May 6, about 40 people were arrested during protests on the campus over the war in Gaza.\n\nLast week, UCLA Chancellor Gene Block was one of three college presidents and chancellors who testified before the House Education and Workforce Committee about the demonstrations and allegations of antisemitism on campuses. Block said the school should have been prepared to immediately remove the original encampment.\n\nBlock, who is set to retire at the end of July, testified two days after it was reported that the university's police chief was removed from his job and reassigned. Chief John Thomas faced criticism over his handling of the demonstrations that included an attack on a pro-Palestinian encampment.\n\nBlock announced that a former Sacramento police chief would lead a new Office of Campus Safety that will oversee the UCLA Police Department.\n\nIsrael faces global criticism over the mounting death toll and humanitarian crisis in Gaza. More than 900,000 Palestinians have been displaced by fighting in the past few weeks alone, and now lack shelter, food, water and other essentials, the U.N. humanitarian agency said Wednesday.\n\nAt least 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed about 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.", "source": {"uri": "nbclosangeles.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The union's strike started last week with workers at UC Santa Cruz picketing, holding up signs calling for fair labor practices and divestment, a key demand of pro-Palestinian protesters at many U.S. universities. UAW 4811 represents 48,000 academic workers at all 10 UC campuses.\n\nOn Thursday, as Chancellor Gene Block testified before Congress, UCLA workers with the union stood alongside students and other protesters gathering at the campus to advocate the rights of Palestinians in the conflict. While they descended onto university grounds, and crowds there grew, Block faced off with lawmakers in Washington, D.C. during a special House hearing focusing on allegations of antisemitism and Gaza protests at college campuses.\n\nUAW 4811 first announced a potential strike the night after an attack on a pro-Palestinian encampment at UCLA. In a statement, the union states a group of counter-protesters were \"hitting protesters including members of UAW 4811 with sticks, spraying them with bear spray, and pelting them with bottles and fireworks.\" While failing to protect protesters in that instance, the union alleges, UC leaders have called in riot police to shut down protests.\n\n\"From the hours of unchecked violence at UCLA , to the continued use of riot police at campuses like UCLA, UCSD, and UC Irvine, UC has continuously violated workers' rights to free expression in our workplace despite UC police that should have protected us,\" the union's website reads.\n\nUnion leaders are calling for no arrests, expulsions, suspensions or other disciplinary action against students and workers taking part in the protests as well as the university's divestment from \"weapons manufacturers, military contractors, and companies profiting from Israel's war on Gaza.\"\n\nThe University of California has called some of the union's demands \"politically motivated,\" and therefore, the strike not legal. The public university system filed a court order with the state labor board last week attempting to stop the walkout, stating it would violate a \"no-strike\" clause in the union's contract. The UC alleged such a demonstration is not legal since the labor union's protests and negotiations \"must be tied to terms and conditions of employment and terms in the collective bargaining agreement.\"\n\n\"UAW's strike is unlawful because the goal is to pressure the University to concede to a list of politically motivated demands closely linked to the protests occurring across California and the nation,\" reads a May 21 statement from the UC Office of the President.\n\nCalifornia's Public Employment Relations Board declined the UC's request for injunctive relief, which would have put an immediate end to the strike. While it rejected the UC's request, the labor board ordered the University and union engage in formal mediation.\n\n\"'DENIED': UC is not above the law,\" the union wrote on social media after the rejected court order.\n\nWorkers at UC campuses will be called on by the union's leadership at different times to strike as part of its \"Stand Up\" protests, rather than having all union members demonstrate together at the same time. The union has said the leadership of UC schools have not negotiated with student protesters the same way other U.S. universities have, stating management at the California campuses \"must change course.\"\n\n\"At several other universities across the country, management has taken protesters' demands seriously and begun negotiations with coalitions of students, workers, and community members over their divestment from companies supplying arms to Israel's war in Gaza,\" reads a statement the union released earlier this month. \"This option is open to UC as well.\"\n\nLast week, Democratic Rep. Mark Takano of California's 41st congressional district asked Chancellor Block why UCLA leadership did not engage in negotiations with demonstrators, calling what happened at UCLA \"an unfortunate contrast\" to the other two schools whose leaders were questioned at the Congressional hearing, Rutgers and Northwestern universities.\n\nWhile deals were made with protesters at those campuses, there was no such deal at UCLA -- instead, outside law enforcement agencies responded, dismantled the pro-Palestinian encampment on campus and arrested more than 200 people.\n\nBlock said there was \"a real attempt for discussion\" which proved unsuccessful.\n\nHe said a UCLA vice chancellor sat inside the encampment with protesters and \"discussed potential solutions\" but that did not lead to any agreement. He said he called in LAPD and other police when it appeared the safety of the entire campus was at risk.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [],

Workers at UC Santa Cruz kicked off the walkouts last week and were joined Tuesday, May 28, by their union siblings at UCLA and UC San Diego. The union says workers at three more campuses could walk out by Friday.\n\nAlthough the strike comes at the start of summer break, it still has the potential to be very disruptive because graduate and postdoctoral students play an essential role in finalizing student grades, teaching summer courses and conducting time-sensitive research.\n\nThe union says that the strike is in response to \"egregious unfair labor practices\" committed by the UC System. The allegations include using law enforcement to \"violently eject and arrest peaceful protesters\" at UCLA, UC Irvine and UC San Diego; disciplining employees who participated in protests; and making changes to academic freedom and free speech rights on campuses.\n\nThe UC system, however, believes that these complaints are unrelated to union labor issues and the strike is therefore illegal. The UC system has filed multiple unfair labor practice charges with the Public Employment Relations Board in hopes of getting an injunction to halt the walkouts.\n\n\"The University remains disappointed that the UAW is engaging in an illegal strike in violation of our contract's mutually agreed no-strike clauses to advance issues that have no bearing on employment at UC,\" UC officials said in a May 23 statement.\n\nSo far the university's effort has been unsuccessful. Last Thursday, PERB rejected the UC's demand to immediately stop the strike. The board is still considering the UC's unfair labor practice charges, but a ruling is not expected for at least three weeks.\n\nAt UCLA, workers are planning to rally on campus at noon.\n\n\"I'm striking in solidarity with this historic student movement protesting the genocide in Gaza,\" said UCLA graduate worker Sebastian Cazares in an interview. \"We're also protesting the Gene Block administration and UCLA policies that have targeted journalists, suppressed free speech, abused students and sent weaponized state sanctioned violence on peaceful protesters.\"\n\nOver 200 protesters were arrested at UCLA during a May 1 police raid on the Palestine Solidarity Encampment. They night before protesters were attacked by a Pro-Israel mob with bear mace, pepper spray and wooden planks -- an incident which resulted in over 25 protesters being sent to the emergency room, according to medics at the encampment.\n\nApproximately a third of faculty members at UCLA have signed a letter vowing they will not perform any labor, such as grading student assignments, to replace the striking workers. Among them is Political Science Professor Michael Chwe.\n\n\"Me and my fellow faculty that are here very much supportive of the strike,\" he said following a UAW press conference last Thursday. \"The right to strike is a very basic democratic right, so we're grateful that the graduate student and postdocs have a union which can represent them and allow them to act collectively.\"", "source": {"uri": "whittierdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Whittier Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "clara_harter@whittierdailynews.com", "name": "Clara Harter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walkout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Auto_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Auto Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfair_labor_practice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unfair labor practice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Diego", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of California, San Diego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Santa_Cruz", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Santa Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academic freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Irvine", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Irvine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_(Polish_trade_union)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solidarity (Polish trade union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_spray", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pepper spray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_activism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Student activism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Government_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Government Agencies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor_Movement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor Movement", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management Relations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.whittierdailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/LDN-L-UCLA-CONGRESS-28-0524-1.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604621", "eventUri": "eng-9604621", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 250, "textEnd": 256}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-23", "textStart": 1546, "textEnd": 1552}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 2307, "textEnd": 2312}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

The walkouts unfold at a critical time in the academic year, as classes end and capstone projects, finals and grading are ahead -- work in which union members play a key role.\n\nThe planned expanded strike would be one of the biggest actions by an American labor union in support of Palestinians and comes as college leaders face scrutiny for calling in police in riot gear to clear pro-Palestinian encampments.\n\n\"I think the union is in a position to really just lift up this issue on the national stage and challenge sort of mainstream discourse and status quo,\" said Gene McAdoo, a doctoral student in the UCLA School of Education and Information Studies.\n\nUC officials charge the walkouts are illegal. However, its urgent request to the state labor board to immediately halt the strike was rejected by the panel, which ruled on Thursday that the UC's allegations did not meet the legal standard for intervention.\n\nThe academic workers contend that their free speech rights were violated when system leaders called on police to forcibly remove pro-Palestinian encampments at several campuses and activists at UCLA were not protected from an attack on the camp by counterprotesters for hours. Police later dismantled the UCLA encampment, making about 200 arrests, including some members of the striking union.\n\nRafael Jaime, the president of UAW 4811, was at the encampment during the attack in late April and witnessed the violence. He praised the labor board's denial of UC's injuction request, saying it \"proves that no employer gets to make up its own rules.\"\n\nDemands of union leaders include the protection of free speech on campus; an amnesty for all academic employees, students, student groups, faculty and staff who face disciplinary action or arrest due to participation in protests; and divestment by the university from \"weapons manufacturers, military contractors, and companies profiting from Israel's war on Gaza.\"\n\nUniversity officials have asserted the strike is unlawful because the goal is \"to pressure the University to concede to a list of politically motivated demands closely linked to the protests occurring across California and the nation.\"\n\nThe union on May 10 filed charges with the state labor board related to the treatment, university discipline and arrests of union members at UCLA and other campuses, including UC San Diego and UC Irvine. The charge accuses the universities of retaliating against the workers and unlawfully changing workplace policies to suppress pro-Palestinian speech.\n\nUC also filed an unfair labor practice charge with the labor board, alleging that the union's decision to walk out was in violation of the no-strike provision in its collective bargaining agreements. Both charges are pending.\n\nThe strike comes amid continuing upheaval on UCLA's campus.\n\nOn Thursday UCLA Chancellor Gene Block and two other university presidents testified before a Republican-led House Committee on Education and the Workforce, which is investigating antisemitism on campuses throughout the country. In his opening remarks to the panel, Block said that, \"with the benefit of hindsight,\" the university should have acted to \"immediately remove\" the encampment that pro-Palestinian protesters established in late April \"if and when the safety of our community was put at risk.\"\n\nBlock was also questioned about complaints that Jewish students were prevented from accessing parts of campus by pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nLater that day, more than two dozen officers in riot gear responded to the Westwood campus to remove a small encampment that protesters had erected.", "source":

The union then filed similar violations after police cleared encampments at UC San Diego and UC Irvine that also led to arrests of protesters -- and another alleging that the UC changed its disciplinary rules unilaterally to punish academic workers.\n\n\"By summoning the police to forcibly arrest and/or issuing interim suspensions to these employees, the University has violated their employee rights,\" the union wrote in one of its submissions to the labor relations board. The union says its workers were not only rallying against the war in Gaza but also seeking ways to remove academic research funding sources tied to the U.S. military. Workers also oppose \"the discrimination and hostile work environment directed towards Palestinian, Muslim, and pro-Palestine Jewish employees and students.\"\n\nUnlike a systemwide strike, this \"stand up\" strike will pursue labor stoppages at certain campuses, a strategy employed by Detroit autoworkers in their successful campaign for higher compensation last year. The approach is meant to apply gradual pressure to management.\n\nWhile the strike is technically distinct from the larger protest movement against the war, the two movements are related. Last Thursday, several hundred UCLA members of the UAW 4811 held a rally in support of their impending strike. Moments later, they joined a student-led protest demanding that the UC call for a ceasefire and divest from weapons manufacturers and the Israeli economy. That same day, protesters erected a short-lived encampment and temporarily took over a campus building before being pushed out by police.\n\nIt was a clear sign that, despite hundreds of arrests in May, thousands of students, union members and some faculty remain passionate about their pro-Palestinian advocacy.\n\nAlmost 20,000 of the union's 48,000 members voted on whether to strike two weeks ago, and nearly 80% of those who did vote approved the strike authorization.\n\nThe UC sought an injunction to legally halt the strike, but the labor relations board wrote last week that UC hadn't established that an injunction is \"just and proper.\" The union hailed the ruling. However, the board wrote that it's leaving UC's request open in the event the university provides better evidence.\n\nIn a partial victory for the university, the board issued a complaint that the union \"failed to provide adequate advance notice of its work stoppage, and failed and refused to meet and confer in good faith.\" The UC press office, in announcing the board's response, wrote that the labor board \"found enough evidence to suggest that a violation may have occurred, and further examination is warranted.\"\n\nThe union argues in its latest unfair labor practice violation that the UC unilaterally implemented a disciplinary policy that affects UAW 4811 workers. The union seeks an order telling the UC to \"cease and desist from unilaterally changing the terms and conditions of employment related to discipline.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the UC Office of the President disputes that characterization, writing that these policies aren't new and reaffirm existing rules. The spokesperson, Heather Hansen, sought to invalidate the central thrust of the union's demands, writing to CalMatters last week: \"By requesting amnesty, UAW is asking the University not to follow its processes but rather to make an exception for its members so that they are not subject to the same accountability measures applicable to all other members of the UC community.\"\n\nNot all unionized workers have jobs with labor to withhold. Some are paid with fellowships to advance their own research. But most perform a job duty that's integral to the academic mission of the university. Systemwide, about 20,000 workers are graduate student teaching assistants, tutors or other instructional assistants.\n\nGraduate students teach classes, especially introductory courses, run discussion sections and grade student work.\n\nLast week, about 60% to 70% of UC Santa Cruz workers who could withhold their labor did, estimated Rebecca Gross, the unit chair of the union at the campus.\n\nOn the social media platform Reddit, individuals identifying themselves as UCLA students wrote that some of their discussion sessions are being canceled and that some of their courses are moving online. It \"is tragic for me bc (sic) I learn 80% of the material from discussion and problem solving sessions,\" wrote one poster.\n\nWho'll pick up the work that the striking workers won't do is an open question. The governing body of UCLA faculty sent a message to professors that \"faculty members cannot be required to take on additional responsibilities for teaching related to a work stoppage.\"\n\nMost protesters, including UAW 4811 members, who were arrested were cited for failing to follow police orders to disperse. At UCLA, administrators sent a notice to students and protesters on April 30, a day before police cleared the encampment, that \"the established encampment is unlawful and violates university policy\" and asked the participants to leave the area or face sanctions. The notice also said that \"law enforcement is prepared to arrest individuals, in accordance with applicable law.\"\n\nThe notice added that \"for students, those sanctions could include disciplinary measures such as interim suspension that, after proper due process through the student conduct process, could lead to dismissal.\"\n\nMembers of the encampment replied the same day, writing in part \"We will continue to remain here steadfast in our demands.\"\n\nThat night, counter-protesters attacked those in the encampment with pepper spray, wooden sticks and at least one firework as police stood by for hours and made no arrests. Local and national news outlets brought around-the-clock coverage to the violence.\n\nThe next afternoon, police ordered members of the encampment to disperse. Hours after those orders, police arrested more than 200 people.\n\n\"In contrast to the lack of police response to the violent attack by anti-Palestine counterprotesters on April 30, 2024, the University summoned a massive number of police officers on the evening of May 1, 2024 for the purpose of ejecting and arresting the employees engaged in peaceful protest in the UCLA Palestine Solidarity Encampment,\" union lawyers wrote in one of the unfair labor practice violations submitted to the state labor relations board.\n\nKai Shi, a mathematics doctoral student at UCLA, pushed back on the reason to call the police in the first place. \"Just because the police say it's unlawful doesn't mean that they're right,\" he said.\n\n\"The unlawful assembly is an excuse by the university to shut us down,\" Shi argued.\n\nUC San Diego issued at least 40 suspensions in the middle of May related to the pro-Palestinian protests, the union wrote in one of its unfair labor practice violations. \"Such extreme disciplinary measures in response to peaceful protest activity suppress free expression of ideas and violate the First Amendment,\" it read.\n\n\"We are standing up for justice in the workplace, in a way that directly affects not just us, but our students,\" said Anny Viloria Winnett, the unit chair of the local UCLA union chapter.", "source": {"uri": "kqed.org",

And Who Gets To Decide? UC's 'Stand-Up' Strikes Offer A Case Study", "body": "The union that represents the University of California's academic workers launched the first in a series of strikes May 20 -- a move that could deal a blow to campus operations just a few weeks ahead of finals.\n\nUAW 4811 members work at all 10 of the system's campuses. Last Monday, workers at UC Santa Cruz began the first \"stand up\" strike. This Tuesday, workers at UCLA and UC Davis are expected to join them, and workers at other campuses stand at the ready.\n\nThe union has filed multiple unfair labor practice charges against UC, arguing that the system violated workers' rights when deploying police to dismantle encampments formed in protest of Israel's war effort in Gaza.\n\nMeanwhile, UC also filed its own unfair labor practice charge and asked the state's Public Employment Relations Board to put an end to the strike. Allowing it to continue, UC said in a press release, \"will cause the University and its students irreparable harm.\" Members of the union teach, research, and grade, meaning that work will be getting done at fewer and fewer campuses. The academic year ends in mid-June.\n\nThe system also asserts that the work stoppages are illegal, pointing to \"no strike\" clauses in the union contracts.\n\nBut some labor law experts say those \"no strike\" clauses are not so cut-and-dried.\n\nThat depends on where they live and where they work, said Jay Smith, a lecturer at USC's law school and an attorney who's represented labor unions throughout the country for nearly four decades.\n\nIf an employee works in the private sector, he said, their right to strike \"is protected and governed by federal law exclusively, and any state attempts to govern that are preempted.\"\n\nIn contrast, if someone works in the public sector -- like the academic workers at the University of California -- \"all labor relations, including the right to strike, are governed by state law, and sometimes by local law,\" Smith added.\n\n\"Some states prohibit all public sector employees from striking,\" he said. In those states, public employees risk getting fined, fired, or jailed for walking off the job. In the past 10 years, for instance, bus drivers in Mississippi and teachers in West Virginia took these risks to demand higher wages.\n\n\"No strike\" clauses are worked into contracts to maintain uninterrupted operations. They also compel unions and employers to settle disputes through arbitration or mediation.\n\nIn the private sector, almost all contracts between unions and their employers have \"no strike\" clauses during the term of the collective bargaining agreement, Smith said.\n\nTypically, unions go on strike \"only when the contract has expired or [when it's] been terminated, and they're usually striking in favor of getting a better contract from the employer. But they're doing so at a time when there is no contract in effect,\" he added.\n\nNot necessarily. In 1956, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Mastro Plastics Corp. v. NLRB. In the court's opinion:\n\nBasically, Smith said, the court \"decided that, for employees in the private sector, if their strike is significantly motivated by an employer's commission of serious unfair labor practices, the 'no strike' clause doesn't apply -- even if there is a contract in effect.\"\n\nThe union says employees are demanding workplace-related changes, including the right to opt out of military-funded research.\n\nThe union therefore takes issue with the arrest, suspension, and disclipline of members who participated in demonstrations at UCLA, UC San Diego, and UC Irvine. The union alleges that UC retaliated against employees for engaging in actions related to working conditions.\n\nThe California Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) enforces collective bargaining laws for the state's public sector employees. And \"California laws and [PERB] typically borrow extensively from both the statute and the legal precedence that exist in the private sector under the federal law,\" Smith said -- for example, that Supreme Court case.\n\nAfter reviewing the UC's press statement, Smith said the system is \"quoting the literal terms of the 'no strike' clause. And if you just look at the no strike clause, it certainly looks, on the face of it, like the University of California is correct and the UAW is wrong -- but that's only if you don't understand this additional issue.\"\n\nJ. Felix De La Torre, general counsel for PERB, said the agency has offered mediation to UC and the union. On May 23, PERB announced it would not pursue the injunction to stop the strikes, saying UC \"has not established that injunctive relief is 'just and proper'\" under the standard set by state law.\n\nHowever, the agency said it will leave UC's request open, \"in the event it learns of evidence or facts\" that support the system's request.\n\n\"If PERB seeks an injunction and a judge issues the injunction,\" Smith said, union members would be obligated to comply. If they defied it, \"a whole cascade of bad things could happen to them,\" including fines and being \"put in handcuffs for contempt of court.\"\n\nIn an email, De La Torre also told LAist that PERB hasn't reached a decision on UAW 4811's unfair labor practice charges.\n\n\"PERB must provide UC with an opportunity to file a position statement,\" he said. UC must respond to these charges by May 28. Then, a regional attorney will issue a decision.\n\nDe La Torre also noted that \"PERB has not determined that UAW's strike is unlawful.\" That's still being determined, and the process could take months.", "source": {"uri": "laist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LAist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfair_labor_practice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

(AP File)\n\nAcademic workers at UCLA and UC Davis are on strike, alleging violations of their rights by the University of California's actions during pro-Palestinian protests and encampment crackdowns as reported by Yahoo News.\n\nThe United Auto Workers Local 4811, which represents about 48,000 graduate student teaching assistants, tutors, researchers, and other across the 10 UC campuses and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, initiated the strike at UC Santa Cruz last week.\n\nThe walkouts are happening at a important time in the academic year as classes are concluding and finals are underway.\n\nThis expanded strike, one of the largest actions by an American labor union in support of Palestinians, follows clashes between police and protesters at various campuses. Despite UC officials claiming the walkouts are illegal, the state labor board rejected their request to halt the strike, stating it didn't meet the legal standard for intervention.\n\nRelated Story: UC Academic Workers Strike in Solidarity with Pro-Palestinian Protesters\n\nThe academic workers argue their free speech rights were infringed when university leaders called on police to forcibly remove pro-Palestinian encampments at several campuses. The demands include protection of free speech, amnesty for those facing disciplinary action or arrest due to protests, and divestment from entities profiting from Israel's actions in Gaza.\n\nThe strike is amidst ongoing upheaval on UCLA's campus, with Chancellor Gene Block testifying before a House Committee on Education and the Workforce regarding allegations of antisemitism and recent campus protests. Later, officers in riot gear removed a small encampment erected by protesters.", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GV Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anthony_haddad@gvwire.com", "name": "Anthony Haddad", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Davis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Davis"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walkout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

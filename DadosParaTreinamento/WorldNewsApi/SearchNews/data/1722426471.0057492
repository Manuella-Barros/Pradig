It comes as the search for the 19-year-old apprentice bricklayer enters its 13th day. Jay, from Lancashire, vanished after a night out at the NRG festival at Papagayo nightclub in Playa de las Americas on June 17. He went with two men he had met at the festival to an Airbnb in the north of the island in the Rural de Teno park. He called friends the next morning to say he was thirsty and was trying to walk back to their holiday accommodation - a journey that would have taken almost 11 hours. A former British detective, who exposed Jimmy Saville, has now said the Tenerife drugs scene could play a role in the disappearance.

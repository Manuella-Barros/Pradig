The guys are coming along too", "body": "Simone Biles is bringing back her Gold Over America Tour this fall, with a twist.\n\nThis time, the guys are invited too.\n\nThe decision to include the men on the 30-city tour that starts in Southern California on Sept. 17 and ends in Detroit on Nov. 3 was intentional. Biles, who will try to build on her haul of seven Olympic medals this summer in Paris, wanted to broaden the show.\n\n\"I think the first time we were very driven on female-forward cast and having the beauty in that and knowing that we can put on a show without the guys and just having the girls being in their feminine power and being beautiful and being the stars,\" Biles said ahead of the tour's announcement on Thursday. \"But this time around we're like 'OK, that worked but let's do it a little bit differently, let's invite the men.'\"\n\nThat includes Fred Richard, 20, who became the first American man to medal in the all-around at the world championships since 2010 when he earned bronze in Belgium last fall.\n\nRichard, who is eyeing making his first Olympic team, has made it his mission to help make men's gymnastics relevant in a country where the women have commanded much of the attention -- and much of the international success -- for decades.\n\nThe sophomore at Michigan has cultivated an avid following on social media thanks to an ability to make men's gymnastics look both fun and relatable, a somewhat difficult needle to thread.\n\n\"The goal is to get as many eyes on men's gymnastics side as possible and have more people understand who we are and what we do,\" Richard said. \"The dream is that someone walks down the street one day and someone says 'Name a male gymnast' and they actually name a male gymnast.\"\n\nWorking with the most decorated gymnast in the history of the sport for a couple of months might help. Richard called Biles a \"role model.\" She sees in Richard someone who has a unique ability to connect with an audience.\n\n\"I think it gets really intimate when you get on Fred's platform, just because how he talks to you, the kind of stuff that he puts out is really interesting,\" Biles said. \"I think it'll bring a whole different take.\"\n\nThe rest of the men's group won't be determined until after the run-up to the Paris Olympics.\n\n\"(The men) also bring a little bit, in the best way, sex appeal,\" Biles said. \"I think that's very interesting and it brings a different type of crowd too. It's like they can do really cool tricks with little to no effort without training and so I think it'll be a beautiful show.\"\n\nThe women joining Biles include 2020 Tokyo Olympic teammate Jordan Chiles and 2020 Olympic floor exercise champion Jade Carey, with the rest of the roster to be revealed in the coming weeks.\n\nBiles described the show as a \"celebration\" of gymnastics, though a celebration with decidedly personal elements.\n\nShe used the 2021 tour to help promote the importance of prioritizing mental health, a sometimes taboo subject Biles brought out into the open when she removed herself from multiple competitions at the Tokyo Games while battling \" the twisties.\"\n\n\"Obviously we want to bring the fun, we want to bring like the exhilarating feeling, we want to bring the golden side out of everybody but those touchy subjects or whatever we want to touch on, those will come whenever people get a chance to tell their stories at the Olympics,\" she said.\n\nThe show will also incorporate rhythmic gymnastics and Biles said there was even talk about having \"SlamBall\" players -- think basketball on trampolines -- be part of the show. All with the idea of bringing as many people into the tent as possible.\n\nThe 27-year-old laughed when asked if this would be her last time as an active participant in the tour. She just celebrated her first anniversary with Chicago Bears safety Jonathan Owens and said she's not thinking much long-term beyond 2024.\n\n\"I would never say never and I think that would be amazing to (do this) after every Olympic cycle,\" she said. \"I think that would be a beautiful thing. But right now I can't tell you yes or no. Like no definitive answers because I don't know what life will look like in the next few years to come.\"\n\nAP Olympics https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri":

The tour aims to promote men's gymnastics and celebrate the sport while addressing personal issues. Biles wants to expand the audience and bring in different elements such as rhythmic gymnastics and SlamBall. The tour includes other top female gymnasts like Jordan Chiles and Jade Carey. Fred Richard, the first American man to medal in all-around at the world championships since 2010, joins the male lineup to showcase the sport's appeal. The tour will incorporate personal stories and discuss mental health awareness, themes Biles has championed in the past. Biles remains uncertain about future participation in the tour beyond the 2024 Olympic cycle.\n\nSimone Biles is bringing back her Gold Over America Tour this fall, with a twist.\n\nThis time, the guys are invited too.\n\nThe decision to include the men on the 30-city tour that starts in Southern California on Sept. 17 and ends in Detroit on Nov. 3 was intentional. Biles, who will try to build on her haul of seven Olympic medals this summer in Paris, wanted to broaden the show.\n\n\"I think the first time we were very driven on female-forward cast and having the beauty in that and knowing that we can put on a show without the guys and just having the girls being in their feminine power and being beautiful and being the stars,\" Biles said ahead of the tour's announcement on Thursday. \"But this time around we're like OK, that worked but let's do it a little bit differently, let's invite the men.'\" That includes Fred Richard, 20, who became the first American man to medal in the all-around at the world championships since 2010 when he earned bronze in Belgium last fall.\n\nRichard, who is eyeing making his first Olympic team, has made it his mission to help make men's gymnastics relevant in a country where the women have commanded much of the attention -- and much of the international success -- for decades.\n\nThe sophomore at Michigan has cultivated an avid following on social media thanks to an ability to make men's gymnastics look both fun and relatable, a somewhat difficult needle to thread.\n\n\"The goal is to get as many eyes on men's gymnastics side as possible and have more people understand who we are and what we do,'' Richard said. \"The dream is that someone walks down the street one day and someone says Name a male gymnast' and they actually name a male gymnast.\" Working with the most decorated gymnast in the history of the sport for a couple of months might help. Richard called Biles a \"role model.'' She sees in Richard someone who has a unique ability to connect with an audience.\n\n\"I think it gets really intimate when you get on Fred's platform, just because how he talks to you, the kind of stuff that he puts out is really interesting,'' Biles said. \"I think it'll bring a whole different take.\" The rest of the men's group won't be determined until after the run-up to the Paris Olympics.\n\n\"(The men) also bring a little bit, in the best way, sex appeal,\" Biles said. \"I think that's very interesting and it brings a different type of crowd too. It's like they can do really cool tricks with little to no effort without training and so I think it'll be a beautiful show.\" The women joining Biles include 2020 Tokyo Olympic teammate Jordan Chiles and 2020 Olympic floor exercise champion Jade Carey, with the rest of the roster to be revealed in the coming weeks.\n\nBiles described the show as a \"celebration'' of gymnastics, though a celebration with decidedly personal elements.\n\nShe used the 2021 tour to help promote the importance of prioritizing mental health, a sometimes taboo subject Biles brought out into the open when she removed herself from multiple competitions at the Tokyo Games while battling \" the twisties.\" \"Obviously we want to bring the fun, we want to bring like the exhilarating feeling, we want to bring the golden side out of everybody but those touchy subjects or whatever we want to touch on, those will come whenever people get a chance to tell their stories at the Olympics,\" she said.\n\nThe show will also incorporate rhythmic gymnastics and Biles said there was even talk about having \"SlamBall\" players -- think basketball on trampolines -- be part of the show. All with the idea of bringing as many people into the tent as possible.\n\nThe 27-year-old laughed when asked if this would be her last time as an active participant in the tour. She just celebrated her first anniversary with Chicago Bears safety Jonathan Owens and said she's not thinking much long-term beyond 2024. \"I would never say never and I think that would be amazing to (do this) after every Olympic cycle,\" she said. \"I think that would be a beautiful thing. But right now I can't tell you yes or no. Like no definitive answers because I don't know what life will look like in the next few years to come.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Over_America_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold Over America Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Richard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fred Richard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Carey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jade Carey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slamball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slamball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythmic_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhythmic gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karate at the 2020 Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trampoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trampoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/AdminFiles/UserFiles/22_11_2018_14_00_28_6024474.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544587", "eventUri": "eng-9544587", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-17", "textStart": 950, "textEnd": 958}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-03", "textStart": 982, "textEnd": 988}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

The couple's journey from a courthouse in Houston to a sensational destination wedding in Cabo San Lucas has been nothing short of a fairytale, punctuated with moments of hilarity and earnest love.\n\nIn a candid revelation that has garnered both shock and amusement, Biles admitted to an unexpected turn of events during her pre-wedding party in Cabo last year.\n\nThe festivities, filled with love, laughter, and copious amounts of alcohol, led to Biles experiencing a blackout, humorously disclosed through a series of never-before-seen photos posted ahead of her anniversary. These images showcased the athlete's high spirits and the escalating revelry that eventually led to her missing the remainder of her own pool party.\n\nHighlighted in these candid snapshots is a moment of wisdom from Biles' mother, Nellie, cautioning her daughter to eat to mitigate the impending effects of her indulgence - advice humorously acknowledged by Biles as being \"good advice about 3 hrs before this.\" Such lighthearted moments underline the genuine and relatable nature of Biles' experiences amidst monumental life events.\n\nDespite the hiccup, Biles was all smiles and fully present for the exchange of vows, looking \"more than alert,\" a testament to her resilience and capacity to embrace the moment, irrespective of prior mishaps.\n\nThe celebration in Cabo was just the beginning; their legal marriage in Texas and subsequent destination wedding were attended by friends, family, and adorned with opulence, setting the stage for a loving, albeit sometimes comical, shared journey ahead.\n\nThe athlete's enthusiasm didn't just end with the wedding festivities. As Owens transitioned between NFL teams, moving from the Green Bay Packers to the Chicago Bears, Biles' support and excitement for her husband's new chapter were palpably expressed through their shared experiences and her jovial commentary on social media, celebrating everything from the move to the deep-dish pizzas of Chicago.\n\nThis dive into Simone Biles and Jonathan Owens' wedding anniversary not only highlights the joyous celebration of their union but also showcases their ability to navigate life's unpredictable moments with grace and humor. It's a reminder that at the heart of every grand celebration are genuine moments of love, laughter, and a touch of unpredictability that makes life truly beautiful.", "source": {"uri": "aceshowbiz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AceShowbiz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aceshowbiz_team@aceshowbiz.com", "name": "AceShowbiz Team", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wedding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabo_San_Lucas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabo San Lucas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cabo San Lucas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Power outage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pizza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Software", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Software", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/photo/2024/05/07/00223947.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544587", "eventUri": "eng-9544587", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Biles, who will try to build on her haul of seven Olympic medals this summer in Paris, wanted to broaden the show.\n\n\"I think the first time we were very driven on female-forward cast and having the beauty in that and knowing that we can put on a show without the guys and just having the girls being in their feminine power and being beautiful and being the stars,\" Biles said ahead of the tour's announcement on Thursday. \"But this time around we're like 'OK, that worked but let's do it a little bit differently, let's invite the men.'\"\n\nThat includes Fred Richard, 20, who became the first American man to medal in the all-around at the world championships since 2010 when he earned bronze in Belgium last fall.\n\nPeople are also reading...

WJBC mourns loss of former radio host Scott Laughlin\n\nRichard, who is eyeing making his first Olympic team, has made it his mission to help make men's gymnastics relevant in a country where the women have commanded much of the attention -- and much of the international success -- for decades.\n\nThe sophomore at Michigan has cultivated an avid following on social media thanks to an ability to make men's gymnastics look both fun and relatable, a somewhat difficult needle to thread.\n\n\"The goal is to get as many eyes on men's gymnastics side as possible and have more people understand who we are and what we do,\" Richard said. \"The dream is that someone walks down the street one day and someone says 'Name a male gymnast' and they actually name a male gymnast.\"\n\nWorking with the most decorated gymnast in the history of the sport for a couple of months might help. Richard called Biles a \"role model.\" She sees in Richard someone who has a unique ability to connect with an audience.\n\n\"I think it gets really intimate when you get on Fred's platform, just because how he talks to you, the kind of stuff that he puts out is really interesting,\" Biles said. \"I think it'll bring a whole different take.\"\n\nThe rest of the men's group won't be determined until after the run-up to the Paris Olympics.\n\n\"(The men) also bring a little bit, in the best way, sex appeal,\" Biles said. \"I think that's very interesting and it brings a different type of crowd too. It's like they can do really cool tricks with little to no effort without training and so I think it'll be a beautiful show.\"\n\nThe women joining Biles include 2020 Tokyo Olympic teammate Jordan Chiles and 2020 Olympic floor exercise champion Jade Carey, with the rest of the roster to be revealed in the coming weeks.\n\nBiles described the show as a \"celebration\" of gymnastics, though a celebration with decidedly personal elements.\n\nShe used the 2021 tour to help promote the importance of prioritizing mental health, a sometimes taboo subject Biles brought out into the open when she removed herself from multiple competitions at the Tokyo Games while battling \" the twisties.\"\n\n\"Obviously we want to bring the fun, we want to bring like the exhilarating feeling, we want to bring the golden side out of everybody but those touchy subjects or whatever we want to touch on, those will come whenever people get a chance to tell their stories at the Olympics,\" she said.\n\nThe show will also incorporate rhythmic gymnastics and Biles said there was even talk about having \"SlamBall\" players -- think basketball on trampolines -- be part of the show. All with the idea of bringing as many people into the tent as possible.\n\nThe 27-year-old laughed when asked if this would be her last time as an active participant in the tour. She just celebrated her first anniversary with Chicago Bears safety Jonathan Owens and said she's not thinking much long-term beyond 2024.\n\n\"I would never say never and I think that would be amazing to (do this) after every Olympic cycle,\" she said. \"I think that would be a beautiful thing.

Biles first stepped into the spotlight around 10 years ago, but her name is still well-known around the world.\n\nShe most recently won four gold medals in a history-making performance at the World Championship in 2023.\n\nBiles is turning her craft into a performance rather than a competition.\n\nBiles, along with Jade Cary, Jordan Chiles, Fred Richard and more cast members, will be heading to the Mile High City for the \"Gold Over America Tour.\" There will still be tumbles, twists and tricks, but it's more of a pop concert performance.\n\n\"The Gold Over America Tour enables fans to see some of the world's best gymnasts in a celebratory, non-competitive environment,\" USA Gymnastics President and CEO Li Li Leung said.\n\nThis isn't the first time Biles has been on tour. In 2021, Biles also performed on the \"Gold Over America Tour\" showcasing her athleticism. Now, she's going around the country again.\n\nThere are tour dates all throughout the country, with one stop in Denver on Sept. 25, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "kdvr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX31 Denver KDVR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maddie_rhodes@kdvr.com", "name": "Maddie Rhodes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ball Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Rodrigo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olivia Rodrigo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDVR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KDVR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Eilish", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billie Eilish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Over_America_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold Over America Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Richard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Richard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Li_Leung", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Li Li Leung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cary, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cary, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 22}], "image": "https://kdvr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2023/10/AP23281481717068-e1696773673176.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544587", "eventUri": "eng-9544587", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

The couple recently celebrated one year of nuptials and went down memory lane to mark the occasion.\n\nThe couple shared a video in which Owens can be seen holding back tears as Simone walks down the aisle with her father, looking stunning in a long white gown on their wedding day. Eventually, the tears win as Owens pulls out a napkin to control the waterworks. Once Simone gets to the altar and her father gives her over to Owens, she also sheds a few tears during the emotional moment.\n\nThe post, shared by TheYBF blog on Instagram, garnered comments from fans who found the moment sweet and, in some ways, redeeming for the NFL player. He has been under fire for saying he didn't initially know who Biles was when he met her and that he was the prize during a podcast interview earlier this year.\n\nNonetheless, they seem happy and enjoying life as a married couple. The two athletes sent one another sweet anniversary messages via Instagram.\n\n\"This is your sign to marry your best friend,\" the most decorated gymnast wrote in an Instagram caption. The image above the caption was one from their white wedding, which took place last year. Happy 1st anniversary \ud83e\udd35\ud83c\udffd\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd0d\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc70\ud83c\udffe\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f I'm excited for many more to come. I wish I could marry you a million times more! I love you so much!\"\n\nHer NFL player hubby replied to the love in the comment section, \"Crazy how fast time flies when you're with your best friend. To many more baby!!!! I love you so much \ud83d\udda4.\"\n\nOwens, who plays for the Chicago Bears, also posted an Instagram tribute to his wife on their one-year anniversary.\n\n\"Still can't believe this was a year ago already!!! Hands down the best day of my life \ud83d\udda4 I love you so much baby, this is to another amazing year \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffd Can't wait till we can go back and relive it again \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\ude01 #S&J\"\n\nThe couple publicly announced their relationship in March 2020 and had a dreamy wedding in April 2023 in Cabo, Mexico.", "source": {"uri": "essence.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Essence"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Altar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/65th_Annual_Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "65th Annual Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Female"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Male"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1971698655-Cropped-scaled.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544587", "eventUri": "eng-9544587", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 2128, "textEnd": 2138}], "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

The Guinness record-keepers confirmed the record on May 30 and notified the sisters.\n\nThe oldest, Norma, is 101. The next, Lorene, turns 99 on July 13.\n\nMaxine is 97, Doris turned 94 in June and Margaret will be 91 next month. The youngest, Elma, will turn 89 in July.\n\nTogether, the sisters have lived longer than any set of six siblings on record, an accomplishment that required submission of more than 100 documents including birth certificates, marriage certificates, school records, witness statements, a video and photographs of the sisters throughout the years.\n\n\"They were all very close and still are,\" Maxine's son, David Bequette, said. \"They're known for their gift of gab.\"\n\nThe sisters were all born into the Overall family in Farmington between 1923 and 1935, the daughters of Stanley and Ethel Overall. He was a carpenter, and she stayed home and raised the kids.\n\n\"My dad could do anything, he was very intelligent really,\" said Doris Griffith, who has lived in Columbia for the last 65 years. \"And my mother was a good homemaker. She always kept us in line and made us behave.\"\n\nTheir only other sibling was a brother, Stanley Overall Jr., who was killed near Farmington during a long bicycle ride in 2003. He was 81.\n\nSix siblings, 89 to 101\n\nMost of the sisters are in remarkably good health, one taking regular fitness classes and another walking nearly a mile every day for at least 50 years.\n\nThree still live in their own homes, two are in assisted living centers and the oldest recently moved to a memory care facility.\n\nAt 101, Norma Jacob, who lives in Marion, Ohio, struggles with Alzheimer's disease and was admitted not too long ago to the memory care facility near her home.\n\nLorene Kollmeyer, 99 in July, still lives in Farmington with her husband, Vernon, who turned 99 in May. They have been married for 77 years.\n\nMaxine Cole, 97, who also lives in Farmington, recently returned home from a rehabilitation center and lives on her own. She manages her yard work, takes fitness classes at the Farmington Senior Center, attends church and belongs to a number of local organizations.\n\nOn June 13, Doris Griffith of Columbia, sister No. 4, turned 94. She walks nearly a mile every day on the County House Trail.\n\nMargaret Norton, 91 in July, recently made the decision to move into an assisted living center in Farmington to address her physical challenges.\n\nThe youngest, Elma Jennings, 89 in July, also lives in Farmington in an assisted living center for rehab. She hopes to be discharged in time for the sisters' annual July birthday party.\n\nWith four of the sisters born in either June or July, they still hold a group celebration every summer, a tradition started by their mother.\n\n\"Three of us had birthdays in July, and my mother always had an annual July birthday picnic to celebrate,\" Elma said.\n\nUntil a few years ago, they took group trips to places like Branson or Washington, D.C.\n\n\"The Overall sisters were a hit everywhere they went,\" said Margaret's son, Pat Adams, who drove them to Washington, D.C., in 1998.\n\n\"They each have a wonderful sense of humor and possess the 'gift of gab',\" he said. \"They met with their member of Congress and with the U.S. Treasurer and had the time of their lives.\"\n\nNo matter where they go, the Overall sisters wear T-shirts carefully numbered with their birth order. Once they had printed on the back: \"Help I'm talking, and I can't shut up.\"\n\n\"They're just a lot of fun,\" Norma's son, Dean Jacob, said.\n\n\"When they're together, you can't get a word in edgewise,\" added Jay Jennings, Elma's son.\n\nThe Overall sisters grew up when it was difficult for families to get by, especially a family with seven children, but their sense of humor remained intact.\n\nMost were born before or during the Great Depression. They were young women during World War II, raised their families during the turbulent '60s and have survived the digital revolution.\n\n\"It was fun growing up,\" Doris said. \"My dad was from a big family, and so we had a lot of cousins nearby, and we just enjoyed our lives.\"\n\n\"Farmington was just a great place to live,\" Elma recalled.\n\nDocumenting their claims\n\nSubmitting documentation for the World Record book was a labor of love for several members of the family. The idea emerged from a news story about a dozen siblings who held the Guinness World Record for 12 siblings and their combined ages.\n\nThe sisters' children were then able to find records for other combined ages, but not for six living siblings.\n\nTo start the process, Dean Jacob made a few calls to cousins in and around Farmington to help put together a video about the sisters' ages and their history. Three separate videos were spliced together to submit -- one video of the four sisters in Farmington, another of Norma Jacob in Ohio and a third of Doris in Columbia.\n\n\"And so we thought, you know, this will do it,\" he said. \"Let's just submit this video and that'll be all they (Guinness) need.\"\n\nEventually, they discovered that the Guinness fact-checkers needed much more to verify their authenticity. Dean Jacob took the lead.\n\n\"Dean really went out of his way to say 'OK boys and girls, here's what we need,'\" Jay Jennings said. \"We need documents, we need pictures, we need drivers' licenses, birth certificates, all that stuff. Dean was the one who really made that happen.\"\n\nAlong with paper certification, Guinness also wanted actual witnesses to authenticate their claims.\n\n\"A verification from somebody that has known all of them,\" Bequette said. \"That would verify that, yes, they are actual, real people.\"\n\nOne witness turned out to be a funeral director who has known the family for years. Another was a writer for the newspaper in Farmington.\n\nBy the end of the process, Dean Jacob and his wife, along with the help of the sisters and cousins, had compiled at least 100 documents, photographs and witness statements.\n\n\"We applied with them in mid-February,\" Dean said. \"And we didn't submit everything until about the middle of May.\"\n\nAfter submission, Dean heard back from Guinness saying that it would take 12-15 weeks to verify the record, or they could expedite the process for a $650 and would hear back within a few days. Considering the sisters' ages, they decided that it would be best to move ahead quickly.\n\n\"You can't take anything for granted these days,\" Dean said.\n\nLong lives explained\n\nThey attribute their long lives to genes, primarily, but the sisters are known for their lighthearted spirit, their teasing and their sense of fun.\n\nOver nine decades they have always managed to get along with each other, they say.\n\n\"We did have words with one another,\" Elma said. \"But they weren't words that made us drift apart and not be friends.\"\n\n\"We've all been fortunate, I guess,\" Griffith said. \"To have such long, good lives.\"", "source": {"uri": "maryvilleforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Maryville Forum"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

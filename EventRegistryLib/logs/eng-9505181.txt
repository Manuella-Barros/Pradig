But could Chicago actually do the most surprising thing and trade up?\n\nBen Volin of the Boston Globe shared some predictions for the NFL draft, and he believes the Bears \"could get aggressive\" for Ohio State wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. Volin noted this, and other predictions, are \"educated guesses\" based on what he's heard around the league.\n\nIf the Patriots stay at No. 3 and draft Maye, then it seems all but certain that the Cardinals will draft Harrison at No. 4 to give Kyler Murray an elite receiver. But the Patriots wouldn't mind trading out of No. 3, and I've got my eye on the Bears at No. 9, who seem like they want to make a big splash and be the talk of the NFL this year.\n\nThe way to do that is trade up and get Harrison. The Bears are already drafting Williams at No. 1, and what better way to create excitement than to get the best quarterback and the best receiver in one draft? The Bears don't have a second-round pick, but I wonder if No. 9, No. 75, and multiple picks next year (maybe a first and a third?) would be enough for the Patriots to make the swap.\n\nObviously, the question is how much would it cost Chicago to make the move. Volin wonders if Nos. 9 and 75 (and perhaps first- and third-rounders in 2025) could do the trick.\n\nThe Bears could very well stay put at No. 9 and luck into LSU's Malik Nabers or Washington's Rome Odunze, who are both great receivers in their own right. So if there's smoke about Chicago considering moving up for Harrison Jr., it speaks to their belief in him as a top player on their board.\n\nHarrison Jr. has only met with the Bears, Arizona Cardinals and New York Giants during this pre-draft process, at least what's been made public at this time.\n\nIf the Bears were to somehow land both Williams and Harrison Jr. in this draft, it would be an absolute franchise-altering draft that could set this team up for years.\n\nFollow The Bears Wire Podcast:\n\nApple Podcasts | Spotify | Google Podcasts", "source": {"uri": "bearswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bears Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alyssa_barbieri@bearswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Alyssa Barbieri", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Harrison_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvin Harrison Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Globe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Boston Globe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harrison, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harrison, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyler_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyler Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_Odunze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome Odunze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://bearswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2023/10/USATSI_21490836.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

So we know what we're going to do, but everyone is going to have to wait until Thursday to go there.\"\n\nThe Bears have been expected to take Williams with the top pick for weeks after they sent Fields to the Pittsburgh Steelers on March 16 for a conditional sixth-round pick. Since then, Poles has spoken positively about the team's interactions with Williams, and that continued with the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner's visit to Lake Forest earlier this month. Williams was the only quarterback the Bears hosted on such a visit this year.\n\nPoles said Bears coaches used the time to test Williams' football understanding, and the team also sent Williams to dinner with a group of veteran players that included linebacker T.J. Edwards, wide receiver DJ Moore and tight end Cole Kmet. Poles believes the Bears culture is in a good place, and he solicited feedback from his veterans about whether Williams would be a good fit.\n\nPoles said they found Williams to be a \"really intelligent guy\" who does not necessarily fit the \"Hollywood\" stereotype some may associate with a prospect who already has made millions with name, image and likeness deals while spending his last two college seasons in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Came across as a really good teammate, easy to talk to, down to earth,\" Poles said. \"We've talked through this process about the whole Hollywood thing. He's all ball, wants to work, wants to get better, wants to win as a team.

And it's safe to say most teams either know what they plan to do with their first-round picks or have a strong sense of which way they're leaning.\n\nBears general manager Ryan Poles and right-hand man Ian Cunningham both met with the media on Tuesday at Halas Hall ahead of their travels to Detroit on Thursday.\n\nWith an NBC Sports mock draft filed, along with answers to questions about the draft from the front office, here's how the mock draft and the Bears align in the first round.\n\n\"The Bears make the obvious, correct pick in Williams to land their long-term answer under center. He walks into an excellent situation, taking control of an offense loaded with weapons,\" Connor Rogers wrote for NBC Sports.\n\nThis is a no-brainer pick and everyone and their mother knows this is the exact pick that will unfold on Thursday. But Poles didn't make mention of it on Thursday, preserving the moment for Roger Goodell to read Williams' name to the Bears on Thursday.\n\n\"I think it's one of those things that everyone has to tune in Thursday to watch,\" Poles said during the Bears' pre-draft press conference on Tuesday at Halas Hall.\n\nThere's zero competitive advantage to gain for Poles concealing the Bears' plans to draft Williams. And Poles admitted the league isn't in his ear asking them to keep it a secret.\n\nIt's his own installment. He wants to keep this moment exciting for Bears fans.\n\n\"Keenan Allen is 31 years old and has one year left on his contract. Getting a future WR1 in Odunze this far down the board is a steal, even if a receiver isn't a pressing need for Chicago,\" Kyle Dvorchak wrote for NBC Sports.\n\nPoles remained conservative about the No. 9 pick, contrary to his opinions on the No. 1 pick. He articulated a \"wait-and-see\" game plan for the No. 9 pick.\n\n\"It's hard to answer right now,\" Poles said about the No. 9 pick. \"As the draft unfolds, there's going to be some indicators that start to educate us on how we need to move to acquire the top talents in this draft.\"\n\nMORE: Bears GM Ryan Poles shares thought process behind how team will make No. 9 overall pick decision\n\nThis is a sensible answer from the Bears. Seemingly, it appears four quarterbacks will go with the first four picks in the draft, including Williams to the Bears. After that, it's uncertain how the Chargers, Giants, Titans and Falcons will draft.\n\nOne of the big three wide receivers could be there. Will they be left to draft the first defensive player of the draft? Will Joe Alt still be on the board by then?\n\nNo one can say for sure. But if Odunze is there, it makes sense for the Bears to draft him, even though they're top-heavy in their wide receiver room with DJ Moore and Keenan Allen.\n\nAllen, 31, has just one year left on his deal and was reluctant to take a pay cut from both the Chargers and Bears (according to reports) after coming off the best season of his career. Should the Bears fail to re-sign him, Odunze provides excellent insurance at the position long-term, with incredible diversity short-term as a big-bodied deep threat.\n\nBut it's likely the Bears play the No. 9 pick based on how the first eight draft.\n\n\"The nice thing is from the work that we've done I feel pretty good about just being flexible,\" Poles said.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Poles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Poles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Polish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halas_Hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Halas Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenan_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keenan Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Goodell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roger Goodell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/V1vC1zazkoYbWpr7.WaYIg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnchicago.com/4cb440b9790d042e74ff0301ae6e51cd", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

But he didn't have to.\n\nHe's going to take Caleb Williams with the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft. He knows it. We know it. The league knows. And even Poles struggled to be coy about it.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it's one of those things I think everyone's got to tune in on Thursday to watch and [find] out,\" Poles said Tuesday at Halas Hall when asked if he was ready to announce Williams as the pick. \"But I feel really good about our process and where we're headed. So we know what we're going to do, but everyone is going to have to wait until Thursday to go there.\"\n\nPoles smiled when asked if the league office preferred that he didn't reveal the pick prematurely. \"No one has told me, so it's my personal deal [to not announce it],\" Poles said. \"And it lets us have some excitement on Thursday, right?\"\n\nIt's hard to believe that just two not-so-short months ago, the Bears keeping Justin Fields and trading the No. 1 pick was a serious consideration and Williams was an enigma with a pink phone and fingernail polish who might not be 6-feet tall, might be more interested in his brand than his team and might not even want to play for the Bears.\n\nNow, Williams has answered all the Bears' questions and then some. Even the red flags -- like Williams' three-interception performance against Notre Dame in his first game against a ranked opponent last season -- are seen by Poles as an example of his resilience more than his weakness.\n\nThe Bears can't hide their excitement. In a draft process where a due diligence is paramount, the Bears have treated Williams like Cinderella and Jayden Daniels, Drake Maye, J.J. McCarthy and the rest of the top quarterbacks like the ugly step-sisters. Williams was the only quarterback Poles hosted for a top-30 visit. He was the only quarterback the Bears talked to on his pro day.\n\nWhen the Bears took Williams to dinner during his visit, instead of meeting with Poles, coach Matt Eberflus and others team honchos to get to know him better, they had Williams go with team leaders DJ Moore, Cole Kmet and T.J. Edwards for a tacit seal of approval.\n\n\"Really intelligent guy,\" Poles said. \"He came across as a really good teammate. Easy to talk to. Down to earth. We've talked through this process about the whole Hollywood thing. He's all ball. Wants to work. Wants to get better. Wants to win as a team. That's the No. 1 thing for him on top of being successful. So I think the biggest thing is, does he fit our culture and what we're trying to do? And all signs were that he does.\"\n\nPoles spent more time acknowledging reality than playing coy Tuesday -- which doesn't often happen prior to the draft, when the most inconsequential tidbit is treated like a state secret.\n\nBut that's a sign of just how fortuitous the Bears' draft situation is this year. There is excitement but no drama. The Bears won't have to sweat this time -- not with the No. 1 pick, anyway.\n\nIn the past they've come up one pick short of Aaron Donald, three picks short of Amari Cooper. They lost the coin flip for Terry Bradshaw. Now they have the No. 1 pick in a draft with a quarterback they are smitten with but don't have to trade up to get.

Conventional wisdom dictates that Ryan Poles will look to trade down from nine and add draft capital. But the Bears' general manager doesn't feel a pressing need to secure more picks.\n\nThe Bears' fast-improving roster -- one that should compete for a playoff spot this fall -- has Poles in a position where he doesn't feel the need to try to find extra bites at the apple.\n\n\"Things shift and change as you go along. It's gonna be hard to make this team now. It's gonna be really hard to make this team,\" Poles said Tuesday during his pre-draft availability at Halas Hall. \"That doesn't mean you don't want more shots later. We'll always welcome a lot of picks. But it doesn't force you to panic about the situation we're in right now with how many picks we have. So it fits our roster, but it also fits kind of like what we just talked about -- the current status of this draft and then, moving forward, what next year looks like as well.\"\n\nWith three or four quarterbacks expected to go in the top 10, the Bears should be in an excellent position to get an elite wide receiver, pass rusher, or left tackle at No. 9.\n\nWashington wide receiver Rome Odunze has a lot of fans inside Halas Hall, but Texas defensive tackle Byron Murphy II and tackles Joe Alt, JC Latham, and Taliese Fuaga also impressed during the pre-draft process.\n\nNo matter how the board falls, the Bears feel confident they will get a blue player who will deliver an immediate impact to a fast-improving roster.\n\n\"They've got to impact the football team from a skillset standpoint, but we always are gonna look at some key things when we talk about passion for the game, coach-ability, dependability, resilience,\" Poles said when asked about what he's looking for in a player at No. 9. \"Those things are gonna be consistent from the first overall pick to a seventh-round draft pick. We want guys that have that. We have an indicator we put on their tag. We would put a Bear head on their tag to, call them the Grizzly, the top Bear, they have those traits, so we're always looking to hit those. And obviously, the earlier in the draft, you want to have those.\n\n\"The other thing too is we had a good conversation with a Hall of Famer that Ian knows and he says you want the guys in that first round to be the cover of your album. You want those to be where everyone can look to that player and be like, alright, what he's made of is what we want to be a part of. So, that's important to us.\"\n\nRegarding what position the Bears might target at nine, Poles is open to any of the three premium positions the Bears need.\n\n\"The nice thing is, from the work that we've done, I feel pretty good about just being flexible,\" Poles said. \"That's why we did that project with kind of some premium positions with O-line, with D-line, receiver and all that feedback was outstanding. It gave you a real good feeling like there's different championship-caliber teams that have built their teams in different ways. And it really solidified just those premiums positions are important. So those three are there, it matches up with this draft pretty well.\"\n\nThere is minimal debate about the Bears' need at wide receiver and offensive tackle.\n\nThe Bears have two elite receivers in DJ Moore and Keenan Allen but have no depth behind them. Allen is also in the final year of his contract, so finding a long-term answer at No. 2 receiver should be high on the priority list.\n\nBraxton Jones has shown growth at left tackle, but the Bears could immediately upgrade Williams' blindside protection if they can land Alt or another top tackle.\n\nThe big debate comes on the defensive line and whether or not the priority should be at edge rusher or defensive tackle.\n\nThe Bears need to add a top-tier edge rusher opposite Montez Sweat. But they are also looking for a disruptive three-technique who can be the \"engine\" of head coach Matt Eberflus' defense.\n\nWhile the Bears hope that 2023 second-round pick Gervon Dexter will take a leap in 2024, Poles is open to drafting another defensive tackle with a high pick.\n\n\"We've talked about inside and outside,\" Poles said. \"Both are multipliers. Generally speaking, I would say the inside guy has the shortest path to the quarterback, so therefore, like if you have, we both have lived with really good elite players that are inside, and it changes everything, and it opens up a lot for other teams as well. Yeah, having that interior rush is probably a preference when you have an outside guy. It makes it really difficult to scheme up.\"\n\nPoles has turned the Bears' roster over in two years. He has added elite players in DJ Moore, Keenan Allen, Tremaine Edmunds, and Sweat while retaining star cornerback Jaylon Johnson and drafting potential stars in right tackle Darnell Wright, slot cornerback Kyler Gordon, and safety Jaquan Brisker.\n\nHe'll soon add a potentially \"generational\" quarterback in Williams and a blue player of his choosing at No. 9 should he stay put.\n\nHe should. The Bears can ace a potentially transformational draft by adding Williams and one of Odunze, Alt, Muphy, or LSU's Malik Nabers at No. 9.\n\nThat's too rare an opportunity to pass up for a few extra picks. The state of Poles' fast-improving roster has him confident that four picks is enough to deliver what the Bears need.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo

Now he just has to nail the pick.", "body": "Some calculated decisions aimed at fulfilling long-range plans -- plus a dose of good fortune -- have put Chicago Bears general manager Ryan Poles in the most enviable position for the past 3\u00bd months.\n\nSince last season ended, Poles has been able to chart critical steps in his bid to turn the franchise into a perennial contender while knowing that the NFL draft, which begins Thursday night in Detroit, offers a measure of hope that has been fleeting at Halas Hall over the last couple of decades.\n\nThe Bears have taken shots at quarterbacks since 2000 -- most notably Justin Fields, Mitch Trubisky, Jay Cutler and Rex Grossman -- but dreams have been short-lived and postseason success has been scarce.\n\nNothing is guaranteed even as the Bears move full speed ahead toward drafting USC quarterback Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick, but armed with two selections in the top nine, Poles has an opportunity to transform a franchise that hasn't won a playoff game since Jan. 16, 2011.\n\nDiscussing that opportunity Tuesday at Halas Hall with roughly 55 hours remaining, Poles expressed confidence his team will emerge on the other side of the weekend much different from the one that went 10-24 over the last two seasons.\n\nThe Bears are going to draft Williams with the top pick, although Poles said you'll have to wait to hear it officially.\n\n\"Everyone has got to tune in on Thursday to watch and figure out,\" he said. \"But I feel really good about our process and where we are and where we're headed. We know what we're going to do.\"\n\nBy waiting a year to address the quarterback situation and sticking with Justin Fields for the 2023 season, Poles was able to improve the infrastructure around the position and create what appears to be a stable environment for Williams.\n\nIt's worth watching how C.J. Stroud continues to develop in Houston after one of the finest rookie seasons in NFL history, as the Bears could have had him with last year's No. 1 pick. Heck, the Carolina Panthers could have chosen Stroud instead of Bryce Young a year ago after trading with the Bears for the top pick, and then the Bears probably wouldn't be sitting here at No. 1 this year. That's part of the good fortune that has shined on the organization.\n\nThere's a chance to build around Williams with the ninth pick, and the strength of this draft -- quarterbacks, wide receivers, offensive tackles -- sets up well with areas that could be \"wants\" for the Bears. It's also a spot where edge rushers or perhaps a defensive tackle could come off the board.\n\nPoles spoke earlier this spring about dividing staff members into groups to make cases for players with this second first-round pick, and he believes that process will pay dividends Thursday.,\n\n\"From the work that we've done, I feel pretty good about just being flexible,\" he said. \"That's why we did that project with some premium positions with O-line, with D-line, receiver. All of that feedback was outstanding. It gave you a really good feeling.\n\n\"There's different championship-caliber teams that have built their teams in different ways. And it really solidified (that) those premium positions are important. I'd say those three are three. It matches up with this draft pretty well.\"\n\nYou can make a strong case for the Bears to use the ninth pick on a receiver, an offensive tackle, an edge rusher or Texas defensive tackle Byron Murphy II. If a small cloud of players with similar grades is available when the Bears are on the clock at No. 9, a slight trade down might make sense with an appropriate offer. The Bears have done extensive work on a handful of players who would fit in a range for trading back.\n\nTwo league sources said the Bears have indicated to other teams they are open to conversations, although that's not a surprise. It would be more newsworthy if the Bears told teams they were locked in at No. 9.\n\nAnother source said the Atlanta Falcons have gotten a lot of chatter about trading the No. 8 pick. That might be more about finding a landing spot for the fourth quarterback to come off the board than trying to jump the Bears. The more quarterbacks selected before No. 9, the better things set up for Poles, and it's possible four are gone before No. 8.\n\nWhether it's staying put, moving down to add depth to a class that currently includes only two more selections (No. 75 in Round 3 and No. 122 in Round 4) or even moving up, the one thing Poles has to do is nail the high picks. There's depth with talent throughout the top half or two-thirds of Round 1, depending on whom you talk to from different teams, and Poles and the Bears figure to be the talk of the NFL on Thursday.\n\nIt has been a bumpy ride at times. There were tense moments in the building when the team came off a 4-13 season in 2022 and then started last season 0-4 and sat at 2-7 after the first week of November. That wasn't enjoyable. That wasn't part of any master plan.\n\n\"We have had those conversations and it does put a smile on your face in terms of the work that we've done,\" Poles said. \"I feel like we've done a good job getting the roster where it is. It makes me feel really fortunate about some of the things that happened to allow us to build the roster maybe a little bit more efficiently than if everything was kind of flat.\n\n\"So it's something to be proud of, but at the same time, the job's not done. I've talked about it before, it's on paper. You've got to play and you've got to win games in this league. That's what it comes down to, but we have taken the time just to -- for a second, not long -- but we're proud of where we've come from.\"\n\nThe Bears will be prouder of where they're headed if all of this comes together. Poles and assistant GM Ian Cunningham seemed at ease discussing what's ahead without really saying anything. They are in a great position.

The 2022 Heisman Trophy winner was the only quarterback prospect hosted by the Bears this month on a top-30 visit. Conversely, Williams only made one visit -- to Halas Hall -- during his pre-draft process.\n\nAfter trading Justin Fields to the Pittsburgh Steelers for a 2025 conditional sixth-round pick, the Bears shifted their focus to starting fresh at the quarterback position. The team sent a contingent of nine coaches and front office members to Los Angeles, where they spent two days in March getting to know Williams before USC's pro day.\n\nPrior to bringing the 22-year-old quarterback to Halas Hall for a visit on April 3, Bears brass arranged a dinner near the team's facility for Williams and several current players.\n\n\"That part, getting him with some of our players -- that's important to us,\" Poles said. \"We're in a really good place with our culture in our locker room. As much as I can, I want those guys a part of the process of building this team. I trust their feedback and I think that chemistry is really important, so that's why we did that.\"\n\nPoles said he was in a different room during the early April dinner at Sophia Steak in Lake Forest, while players like wide receiver DJ Moore, linebacker T.J. Edwards and tight end Cole Kmet had a chance to interact with the soon-to-be rookie quarterback.\n\nThe feedback Poles got from the veteran players who interacted with Williams was the final part of the Bears' evaluation process.\n\n\"Really intelligent guy,\" Poles said. \"Came across as a really good teammate, easy to talk to, down to earth. We've talked through this process about the whole Hollywood thing. He's all ball, wants to work, wants to get better, wants to win as a team. That's the No. 1 thing for him on top of being successful. I think the biggest thing is, does he fit in our culture and what we're trying to do? All signs were that he does, so that was positive.\"\n\nThe Bears enter the draft with a league-low four selections at Nos. 1, 9, 75 and 122. After compiling double-digit draft classes in his first two years as general manager, Poles said he does not feel a need to add more draft picks.\n\n\"I feel really good where we're at,\" Poles said. \"If that happens, that's great. If we have less, whatever we need to do to accomplish what we're setting out to do and improve our football team.\"\n\nAs part of the pre-draft preparations, Poles had coaches and scouts break off into groups to evaluate several positions that are in play with the No. 9 overall pick: offensive line, defensive line and wide receiver.\n\nPoles' operative is to remain \"flexible\" when the Bears are back on the clock about 90 minutes after drafting at the top of Round 1 and believes Chicago's biggest needs can be addressed with the team's second first-round selection.\n\n\"It gave you a real good feeling like there's different championship-caliber teams that have built their teams in different ways,\" Poles said. \"And it really solidified just those premiums positions are important. So those three are there. It matches up with this draft pretty well.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Polish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Forest,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lake Forest, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lake Forest, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halas_Hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Halas Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Poles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Poles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Kmet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cole Kmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0423%2Fr1323512_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lake Forest, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-03", "textStart": 1306, "textEnd": 1313}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

So we know what we're going to do, but everyone is going to have to wait until Thursday to go there.\"\n\nThe Bears have been expected to take Williams with the top pick for weeks after they sent Fields to the Pittsburgh Steelers on March 16 for a conditional sixth-round pick. Since then, Poles has spoken positively about the team's interactions with Williams, and that continued with the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner's visit to Lake Forest earlier this month. Williams was the only quarterback the Bears hosted on such a visit this year.\n\nPoles said Bears coaches used the time to test Williams' football understanding, and the team also sent Williams to dinner with a group of veteran players that included linebacker T.J. Edwards, wide receiver DJ Moore and tight end Cole Kmet. Poles believes the Bears culture is in a good place, and he solicited feedback from his veterans about whether Williams would be a good fit.\n\nPoles said they found Williams to be a \"really intelligent guy\" who does not necessarily fit the \"Hollywood\" stereotype some may associate with a prospect who already has made millions with name, image and likeness deals while spending his last two college seasons in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Came across as a really good teammate, easy to talk to, down to earth,\" Poles said. \"We've talked through this process about the whole Hollywood thing. He's all ball, wants to work, wants to get better, wants to win as a team. That's the No. 1 thing for him on top of being successful.\n\n\"I think the biggest thing is does he fit in our culture and what we're trying to do? And all signs were that he does, so that was positive.\"\n\nEdwards was at Halas Hall on Tuesday morning with right tackle Darnell Wright to accept the Brian Piccolo Awards, which are given annually to a Bears veteran and rookie who embody the \"courage, loyalty, teamwork, dedication and sense of humor\" for which Piccolo was known.\n\nEdwards was tight-lipped about the dinner with Williams, but he did say there will be excitement for a rookie quarterback to come in and make waves.\n\n\"It'd be incredible for all of us, right?\" Edwards said. \"I think that's the hope. Whoever comes in and whoever's under center -- whether it's someone who's here already or a new guy -- we're excited. We'll embrace them and they'll fit into our culture. Because I know our front office does their research for sure.\"\n\nWright called Williams \"a good player.\"\n\n\"I think once all the media stuff dies down, he'll get to work just like any other player would,\" Wright said. \"He'll be good.\"\n\nPoles spoke extensively about Williams at the NFL owners meetings last month. He and Cunningham spent more time Tuesday during their predraft news conference talking about the more uncertain No. 9 pick the Bears will make Thursday night. (If Poles needed a hint about whom to consider, Williams tweeted that Washington wide receiver Rome Odunze was on his Tuesday morning flight to Detroit for the draft and declared himself a \"Big fan!\")\n\nBut beyond that selection, Poles was asked about the big aspirations Williams will bring to Chicago. Williams declared in the fall he wants to win eight Super Bowls to surpass Tom Brady and hasn't backed down from the grand statement.\n\n\"I love it,\" Poles said. \"I think we all should have huge goals. We have huge goals here -- win multiple championships. And that's what we shoot for.\n\n\"You're more intentional when you have these goals. You have to live a certain way, you have to practice a certain way, you have to go about your business a certain way in order to accomplish those. If everything else is in line underneath that, that gets me excited.\"\n\nThat feeling keeps building as the Bears inch closer to their big moment Thursday night. Poles insisted he wasn't given a directive to keep quiet until then.\n\n\"It's my personal deal,\" he said. \"And it lets us have some excitement on Thursday, right?\"", "source": {"uri":

But could Chicago actually do the most surprising thing and trade up?\n\nBen Volin of the Boston Globe shared some predictions for the NFL draft, and he believes the Bears \"could get aggressive\" for Ohio State wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. Volin noted this, and other predictions, are \"educated guesses\" based on what he's heard around the league.\n\nObviously, the question is how much would it cost Chicago to make the move. Volin wonders if Nos. 9 and 75 (and perhaps first- and third-rounders in 2025) could do the trick.\n\nThe Bears could very well stay put at No. 9 and luck into LSU's Malik Nabers or Washington's Rome Odunze, who are both great receivers in their own right. So if there's smoke about Chicago considering moving up for Harrison Jr., it speaks to their belief in him as a top player on their board.\n\nHarrison Jr. has only met with the Bears, Arizona Cardinals and New York Giants during this pre-draft process, at least what's been made public at this time.\n\nIf the Bears were to somehow land both Williams and Harrison Jr. in this draft, it would be an absolute franchise-altering draft that could set this team up for years.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Globe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Boston Globe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Harrison_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marvin Harrison Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harrison, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harrison, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RnbQZ7UVq4kWpH5i8QpvwQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05NDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/chicago_bears_wire_usa_today_sports_articles_533/35a86c329e791364f2c25fc3a8025477", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

So we know what we're going to do, but everyone is going to have to wait until Thursday to go there.\"\n\nOf course, everyone knows where this is going. Poles was just having some fun. There's no point in playing coy. There's no point in lying. Poles has spoken openly about Williams -- and that continued on Tuesday.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Poles and assistant general manager Ian Cunningham's annual pre-draft news conference.\n\nThat would be Williams.\n\nThe Bears did have large contingents at the pro days for Jayden Daniels and J.J. McCarthy. But the team has been locked on Williams for some time now. Instead, the Bears brought in wide receivers, centers, tight ends and pass rushers.\n\nVisiting a team is only one part of the pre-draft process, too. Poles said other players who are high on the Bears' draft board didn't visit Halas Hall.\n\n\"The different prospects, the journey to collect all the information is different for everyone,\" Poles said. \"Our networks in the building know the player inside and out (and) that we really, really trust. You had the combine. There's different kinds of touchpoints. You don't have to necessarily bring everyone in on a visit.\"\n\nIt's common for teams to have dinner with draft prospects. But the Bears added a wrinkle for Williams' visit. He had dinner with tight end Cole Kmet, linebacker T.J. Edwards and receiver DJ Moore. Poles sat in another room. Williams also met with Bears coaches on his visit.\n\n\"Really intelligent guy,\" Poles said of the feedback. \"(Williams) came across as a really good teammate, easy to talk to, down to earth.\n\n\"We've talked through this process about the whole Hollywood thing. He's all ball, wants to work, wants to get better, wants to win as a team. That's the No. 1 thing for him on top of being successful. I think the biggest thing is: does he fit in our culture and what we're trying to do? And all signs were that he does, so that was positive.\"\n\nPoles didn't say it, but having the players meet Williams before the draft is also a good move after trading quarterback Justin Fields.\n\n\"As much as I can, I want those guys (to be) a part of the process of building this team,\" Poles said. \"I trust their feedback and I think that chemistry is really important, so that's why we did that.\"\n\nWilliams recently said as much on \"The Pivot Podcast\" with Ryan Clark, Channing Crowder and Fred Taylor.\n\n\"I love it,\" Poles said. \"I think we all should have huge goals. We have huge goals here -- win multiple championships. And that's what we shoot for. You're more intentional when you have these goals, you have to live a certain way, you have to practice a certain way, you have to go about your business a certain way in order to accomplish those. If everything else is in line underneath that, that gets me excited.\"\n\nThat could be Texas' Byron Murphy with the ninth selection.\n\nPoles said that he sees a high-end interior pass rusher -- who would be a three-technique tackle in coach Matt Eberflus' defense -- as a multiplier.\n\n\"Generally speaking, I would say the inside guy has the shortest path to the quarterback,\" Poles said. \"It changes everything.\"\n\nPoles also said that interior pass rush is \"probably a preference when you have an outside guy.\" The Bears defense already has defensive end Montez Sweat.\n\n\"It makes it really difficult to scheme up, so ...\" Poles said.\n\nOr so Poles said again. But this time the strength of the Bears' roster was highlighted. It doesn't have as many concerns as it did when Poles took over two years ago.\n\n\"Yeah, things shift and change as you go along,\" Poles said. \"It's going to be hard to make this team now. It's going be really hard to make this team. That doesn't mean you don't want more shots later. We'll always welcome a lot of picks. But it doesn't force you to panic about the situation we're in right now with how many picks we have.\"\n\nThis year's overall talent pool is also said to be thin because of the lack of underclassmen. Next year could be different.

Now he just has to nail the pick.", "body": "CHICAGO -- Some calculated decisions aimed at fulfilling long-range plans -- plus a dose of good fortune -- have put Chicago Bears general manager Ryan Poles in the most enviable position for the past 3 1/2 months.\n\nSince last season ended, Poles has been able to chart critical steps in his bid to turn the franchise into a perennial contender while knowing that the NFL draft, which begins Thursday night in Detroit, offers a measure of hope that has been fleeting at Halas Hall over the last couple of decades.\n\nThe Bears have taken shots at quarterbacks since 2000 -- most notably Justin Fields, Mitch Trubisky, Jay Cutler and Rex Grossman -- but dreams have been short-lived and postseason success has been scarce.\n\nNothing is guaranteed even as the Bears move full speed ahead toward drafting USC quarterback Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick, but armed with two selections in the top nine, Poles has an opportunity to transform a franchise that hasn't won a playoff game since Jan. 16, 2011.\n\nDiscussing that opportunity Tuesday at Halas Hall with roughly 55 hours remaining, Poles expressed confidence his team will emerge on the other side of the weekend much different from the one that went 10-24 over the last two seasons.\n\nThe Bears are going to draft Williams with the top pick, although Poles said you'll have to wait to hear it officially.\n\n\"Everyone has got to tune in on Thursday to watch and figure out,\" he said. \"But I feel really good about our process and where we are and where we're headed. We know what we're going to do.\"\n\nBy waiting a year to address the quarterback situation and sticking with Justin Fields for the 2023 season, Poles was able to improve the infrastructure around the position and create what appears to be a stable environment for Williams.\n\nIt's worth watching how C.J. Stroud continues to develop in Houston after one of the finest rookie seasons in NFL history, as the Bears could have had him with last year's No. 1 pick. Heck, the Carolina Panthers could have chosen Stroud instead of Bryce Young a year ago after trading with the Bears for the top pick, and then the Bears probably wouldn't be sitting here at No. 1 this year. That's part of the good fortune that has shined on the organization.\n\nThere's a chance to build around Williams with the ninth pick, and the strength of this draft -- quarterbacks, wide receivers, offensive tackles -- sets up well with areas that could be \"wants\" for the Bears. It's also a spot where edge rushers or perhaps a defensive tackle could come off the board.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halas_Hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Halas Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Poles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Poles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Cutler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jay Cutler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Grossman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rex Grossman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Trubisky", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Trubisky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Young", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/286/28655/2865596.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2011-01-16", "textStart": 985, "textEnd": 998}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

It's through another trade rumor.\n\nBoston Globe columnist Ben Volin suggests the New England Patriots could look to trade out of the third spot in order to accumlate picks.\n\nDuh. They should have been doing this all along.\n\nThis would be a wise maneuver considering the sorry state of the roster. Drafting Drake Maye or even Jayden Daniels won't help immediately on a team in total decay. The Patriots might be better off building the team up with extra picks, and maybe even using some of the extra picks accumlated to ensure they get the best QB in next year's draft.\n\nVolin suggests a team that could move up in the draft would be the Bears, as they try to add MHJ to create a three-headed monster for Williams to target.\n\nFor the Bears to do something of this nature would require giving up at least one of their second-round picks next year and maybe another pick like No. 75 this year. The revised Drafttek value chart would make this year's third and next year's second about what it takes to go from No. 3 to No. 9, but negotiations always are much tougher than the simple use of the value chart.\n\nIt might take the first-round Bears pick next year instead of the second-round pick. They have two second-round picks next year. Maybe both of them would do it.\n\nEither way, this is a rare opportunity to come away with the draft's top receiver. He's one who has visited Halas Hall and reportedly likes the ideao of playing in Chicago.\n\nUltimately, it's easy to see why nothing would happen.\n\nFor one thing, if any team was moving up to No. 3, it would make more sense if it was Minnesota. The Vikings have two first-round picks. They could easily find a way to make that deal with the Patriots to get whatever quarterback they want. They might not get the one they want at No. 11 if they wait there.\n\nBesides the Vikings factor, the Bears themselves would have to use logic and it's unlikely they'd conclude such a deal would be worthwhile.\n\nThe difference between getting Rome Odunze as the third receiver in this draft class and Harrison is not so great as to equal how much they're going to give up in draft capital to do it. Odunze is an outstanding receiver, a probable top-10 pick, and the Bears might not need to do anything exta to get him beyond hand a card to the commissioner.\n\nThat's a really good deal.\n\nThen again, depending on how the picks fall the Bears might not even be in position to draft Odunze.\n\nIn that case, perhaps they better look closely at the possibility suggested by Volin. It could be an all-or-nothing scenario. Either they go all out for the top receiver or they sit there and watch all three of them get taken before No. 9.\n\nThe cost of trading up might be high in terms of draft picks, how many more picks are the Bears going to need next year to have their team built the way they want it?\n\nThe Bears should be in position at this point to be competitive in the playoff chase. One extra dangerous target might be all they need to get over the hump, even with a rookie quarterback.\n\nThey might need a safety next year or maybe they'll still need a 3-technique. They never seem to be able to fill that spot and now the idea of signing one in free agency is gone after Matt Eberflus' former 3-technique, DeForest Buckner, signed a contract extension.\n\nEverything else should be in place, though. In that case, what purpose would they have for those picks then anyway? They might as well use them on Harrison.\n\nAnd having Harrison on the roster ensures they would be set up well should Keenan Allen leave after the final year of his contract in 2024. If they win this year, maybe he won't want to leave and they get him at a bargain rate.\n\nThe problem is, they would be in good shape if they just had Odunze as well, and they would get to keep those picks for whatever.\n\nIf they're set on a receiver, though, it might be worthwhile then to move up just a little to ensure they get one even if it's not Harrison.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gene_chamberlain@si.com", "name": "Gene Chamberlain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvin Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Globe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Boston Globe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harrison, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harrison, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Golden_Gophers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Golden Gophers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_Odunze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome Odunze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeForest_Buckner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DeForest Buckner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenan_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keenan Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Eberflus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Eberflus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3000,h_1687,x_0,y_85/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hw3y0b0793ak6xv02x", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Last year, for example, an unduplicated audience of approximately 54.4 million watched the three-day event and another 312,000 people attended in Kansas City.\n\nSo the last thing the league wants is for the NFL draft's pinnacle moment to be anti-climactic.\n\nThe last thing the NFL wants is for everyone to know the NFL draft doesn't really start with the first overall pick, because everyone knows days in advance who that pick is.\n\nThis, of course, presents something of a challenge because rarely is the first pick a surprise and that includes this year. The Chicago Bears, with the No. 1 overall pick of the draft, will select USC quarterback Caleb Williams with that premier pick.\n\nEveryone knows this.\n\nThere is zero competitive disadvantage at stake in the Bears admitting this. But Bears general manager Ryan Poles on Tuesday refused to confirm what everyone already knows.\n\n\"So, unfortunately, it's one of those things I think everyone has to tune in on Thursday to watch and figure out,\" Poles said at the team's pre-draft press conference. \"But I feel really good about our process and where we are and where we're headed.\n\n\"So, yeah, we know what we're going to do, but everyone is going to have to wait until Thursday to go there.\"\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause through channels that are not official but nonetheless are respected by clubs, the NFL has in the past suggested to some clubs it would be bad form to tip their pick days before it appears on national television. That's what a former NFL employee told OutKick has previously happened to protect the interest and maybe even the integrity of the event.\n\nPoles denied that has happened this year. At least as it pertains to him.\n\n\"No one has told me, so it's my personal deal,\" he said. \"Let's have some excitement on Thursday, right?\"\n\nThat's actually kind of fair. And smart.\n\nThe NFL has an entertainment drama it wants to maximize. Why wouldn't Poles protect that as a courtesy?\n\nIt still doesn't change the fact the pick is going to be Caleb Williams.\n\nIt still doesn't keep journalism nerds such as, well, me from tipping you to the fact the Bears only hosted one quarterback during their top 30 visits - that was Williams. And Williams visited only one team - that was the Bears.\n\nAnd it doesn't keep Poles from trying to make it interesting by suggesting some sort of fanciful misdirection is afoot.\n\n\"The journey to collect all the information is different for everyone,\" Poles said, offering a counterpoint to incontrovertible evidence that points at Williams as the pick.\n\n\"There are guys on our board that are high that didn't come in for their visit that we've had other touchpoints. Our network in the building knows the player inside and out that we really, really trust. You have the combine. There are different kinds of touchpoints. You don't necessarily have to bring everybody in on a visit.\"\n\nThe Bears had the most \"touchpoints\" with Williams. They used the top 30 visit, for example, to put him with possible or future teammates and coaches.\n\nSo what did the Bears learn from that investigation about Williams?\n\n\"I think it just confirmed a lot of the information that we got,\" Poles said. \"We're kind of testing where his football understanding is, that part. Getting him with the coaches, that was a very positive interaction there. Then getting him with some of our players.\n\n\"That's important to us. We're in a really good place with our culture in our locker room. As much as I can, I want those guys a part of the process of building this team. I trust their feedback. I think that chemistry is really important, so that's why we did that.\"\n\nSo who do the Bears think they're getting when they indeed select Williams with the top overall pick?\n\n\"Yeah, really intelligent guy,\" Poles said. \"Came across as a really good teammate, easy to talk to, down to earth. We've talked through this process about the whole Hollywood thing. He's all ball, wants to work, wants to get better, wants to win as a team.\n\n\"That's the number one thing for him on top of being successful. So I think the biggest thing is does he fit in our culture and what we're trying to do, and all signs were that he does. That was positive.\"\n\nPositive is a good word to repeat here. Because everyone is positive the Bears are picking Caleb Williams.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "armando_salguero@outkick.com", "name": "Armando Salguero", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Polish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Poles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Poles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2046569870.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Selecting Williams is potentially a franchise-altering moment, but there's more work to be done after Williams dons the Bears draft hat.\n\nHere's one final, keep-it-simple mock draft for Poles and the Bears to ace a rare opportunity:\n\nRound 1 (No. 1 overall): Caleb Williams, QB, USC\n\nThis has been a done deal for a while. Thursday merely makes it official.\n\nWilliams checked the final box for the Bears during his visit to Halas Hall. The Bears took Williams out to dinner with several members of the organization and veteran players.\n\nBarring an unforeseen issue, Williams will be the pick at No. 1. He has been the desired choice all along and has done nothing to move the Bears off their belief that he's the quarterback they need to elevate the franchise to new heights.\n\nThe Bears love Wiliams' tape and have had productive meetings with the USC star at the NFL Scouting Combine, during a three-day excursion to Los Angeles for his pro day, and again at Williams' 30 visit.\n\nDuring that trip to LA, the Bears got an even clearer picture of Williams, the person, and saw the ball come out of his hand live.\n\nThe tape and eye test matched. That was important, but the biggest boxes Williams' checked came during his dinner with the Bears' brass and his teammates two days before his pro day.\n\n\"When you talk to his teammates, they don't like him, they love him,\" Poles said of Williams at the league meetings. \"His leadership, how he brings people together. He's intentional with his leadership. Same goes with the staff. I'm having a hard time finding a person that doesn't like him or even love him and thinks that he can reach the highest limits.\"\n\nAccuracy, arm talent, vision, improvisational playmaking, touch, feel. You name it, Williams has it.\n\nOver the past two seasons at USC, Williams has thrown 72 touchdown passes and only 10 interceptions. The lack of talent on the 2023 Trojans forced Williams to try to play hero most of the time. The Bears have to be comfortable with Williams putting on the cape and making \"no, no, no, yes\" plays while also working to harness that unique playmaking ability.\n\nWilliams went 12-0 during his career when the Trojans allowed fewer than 34 points. He's very good within structure, but the lack of protection and poor defense forced him to play outside it for most of 2023. The 2022 film, when Williams had more talent around him, is a better indicator of what the Bears are getting at No. 1.\n\nEven Williams' worst game as a college quarterback -- a three-interception affair in a loss to Notre Dame -- was viewed as a positive by those inside Halas Hall.\n\nThe Bears were at the game in South Bend and watched Notre Dame trot out a completely different defensive game plan than they had shown in any previous game that season. Even as Williams struggled against a new look, his body language remained good, and the Bears watched him carefully as he went to the sideline after each turnover and tried to rally his teammates.\n\nWatching how Williams handled USC's 7-5 season was a vital touchpoint that showed the Bears how the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner handles the type of adversity that will surely come his way in the NFL.\n\n\"There have been quarterbacks in the past where they are undefeated for three years, they have a bunch of first round picks surrounding them at all times, so it's a projection of how they handle discomfort, how they handle pressure,\" Poles told NBC Sports Chicago during a sit-down in Orlando. \"So seeing some of these guys go through hard times is important because now you can actually talk about it and listen to them kind of go back and, 'OK, what can I kind of do to get better? How could I handle certain situations better?' There are so many learning lessons from that. It just makes you feel comfortable where, if you're in a situation like that, the kid is going to come out on the other side because if not they can crumble easily.\"\n\nWilliams will be the pick at No. 1 as long as his medicals check out during his visit to Halas Hall. There's no reason for him not to be.\n\n\"He's a franchise-changing prospect,\" one NFC scout told NBC Sports Chicago at the combine. \"Guys like Caleb Williams don't often come around. They'd be foolish to pass on him. I don't know if he's generational, but he's definitely the best quarterback prospect to come out since [Andrew] Luck.\"\n\nRound 1 (No. 9 overall): Rome Odunze, WR, Washington\n\nFor the last four months, trading down has been the expected move by the Bears at No. 9.\n\nThat's still in the cards, but from what I've gathered, there are a select few players the Bears would deem \"stick and pick\" selections.\n\nFor those inside Halas Hall, Odunze is atop that list. With the size, elite ball skills, physical run-after-the-catch ability, contested-catch prowess, and alignment versatility, Odunze is the ideal receiver to add to a receiving corps that already includes DJ Moore and Keenan Allen.\n\nAllen is 32, in the final year of his contract, and has dealt with soft tissue injuries over the past few seasons. With no reliable depth behind Allen and Moore, the Bears need to add a high-ceiling No. 3 receiver to ensure Williams has the proper support system around him.\n\nThe Bears must also plan for life after Williams, whether in a few years or 2025.\n\nOdunze checks all those boxes. Scouts have compared him to Davante Adams, Larry Fitzgerald, and Allen.\n\nIf the Bears don't take Odunze at No. 9, left tackle Joe Alt and defensive tackle Byron Murphy II appear to be the other two likely candidates if available. Alt is expected to be a top-7 pick.\n\nIf the Bears trade down, it will likely be for a non-Alt tackle, with Alabama's JC Latham and Oregon State's Taliese Fuaga the favored targets among tackles.\n\nBut I believe Odunze is who the Bears covet, and if the first eight picks fall their way, he very well could be available at No. 9.\n\nThird round (No. 75 overall): Austin Booker, DE, Kansas\n\nOpting not to trade down from No. 9 leaves the Bears with just two picks left in the draft, but there are still impact players to be found in the third and fourth rounds.\n\nBooker is one.\n\nA long, twitchy edge defender with explosive athleticism, Booker has all the traits the Bears covet in a defensive end.\n\nWhile he needs to get bigger and stronger, Booker has a good rush plan with the length and speed to get on top of quarterbacks and running backs in a heartbeat.\n\nHe was compared to Las Vegas Raiders star Maxx Crosby during the pre-draft process. That's a lofty comparison, but Booker has the tools and talent to become an extremely productive edge rusher with the right coaching and development.\n\nFourth round (No. 122 overall): Hunter Nourzad, IOL, Penn State\n\nThe Bears round out a short but potentially franchise-altering draft with their long-term answer at center.\n\nNourzad is a powerful center with solid length, good technique, and the ability to play in any scheme.\n\nThe Bears traded for Ryan Bates this offseason and signed Coleman Shelton to a one-year contract, but neither figure to factor into their long-term plans at center. The Bears love Bates, but he's probably best utilized as a swing interior lineman once all the pieces are in place.\n\nNourzad will need some fine-tuning, but he can be a good depth piece in 2024 with plans to take over in 2025.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportschicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports Chicago"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_schrock@nbcsportschicago.com", "name": "Josh

His predecessor, Ryan Pace, overspent and mortgaged future draft capital to build a bad team.\n\nRebuilds are always rough, but there was little doubt this one would be brutal. It's been awful, but it's almost over.\n\nPoles will complete his third offseason with the draft this week and has the Nos. 1 and 9 picks Thursday. That's the end of the rebuilding phase. There's no more time, no more margin. Now everyone will find out how sound his construction is.\n\n\"We've done a good job getting the roster where it is,\" he said Tuesday sitting next to assistant general manager Ian Cunningham. \"It's something to be proud of, but at the same time, the job's not done. It's on paper. You've got to play and you've got to win games... But we're proud of where we've come from.\"\n\nThe roster Pace left him is barely visible in the rearview mirror. Cornerback Jaylon Johnson, tight end Cole Kmet and offensive guard Teven Jenkins are the only starters left.\n\nPoles has made many good moves throughout the roster, but has yet to solve some of the biggest issues for any team. The Bears still have holes at premium positions, and he can fill them by drafting USC quarterback Caleb Williams first overall and addressing wide receiver, offensive tackle or defensive end at No. 9.\n\nWilliams is the key, and he'll become the single most important person at Halas Hall the moment the Bears draft. Turning around the hapless franchise hinges on him. Jobs are riding on his success -- especially Poles'.\n\nThat's not a bad thing for Poles, though. At least it's in his control now, as opposed to inheriting Justin Fields. Poles ultimately determined Fields wasn't a viable starting quarterback, and the rest of the NFL appeared to agree with him given all the Bears got in return for trading him to the Steelers was a conditional sixth-round draft pick in 2025.\n\nFields was the fourth quarterback chosen in 2021, when Pace traded a '22 first-round pick to move up from No. 20 to 11 to get him. That left Poles without a first-rounder in his first draft.\n\nBut now Poles has first choice of all the quarterbacks in a strong class. The Bears had high enough grades on multiple prospects to justify moving on from Fields. He'll finally get what everyone in his position wants: a handpicked quarterback who will be developed by the coaching staff he put together. Williams is the obvious choice.\n\nHe and the No. 9 pick will be the final pieces of the rebuild. From there, the Bears will measure themselves against the Chiefs, 49ers, Lions, Packers and everyone else at the top of the league. There won't be any more excuses about it being too soon to compete against anyone.\n\nThat's a big reason Poles keeps saying he plans to stay at No. 9 rather than trade back to parlay it into more assets: He's looking for quality over quantity, rather than turning over huge sections of the roster like he did in 2022 and '23.\n\n\"It's gonna be hard to make this team now,\" he said, knowing he couldn't have credibly asserted that the last two seasons.\n\nHe's fine, then, with having just four picks -- tying the fewest the Bears have ever had in a draft. After the first round, his only remaining selections are in the third (No. 75 overall) and fourth (No. 122) rounds.\n\n\"We'll always welcome a lot of picks, but [we don't] panic about the situation we're in right now with how many picks we have,\" Poles said. \"It fits our roster.\"\n\nThat's a far more comfortable position for him than when he took over, but it's no time to exhale. Quite the opposite. The next stage isn't any easier.", "source": {"uri": "chicago.suntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Sun-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Polish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Poles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Poles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Pace", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Pace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/484661b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5748x3281+0+276/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F25092783%2FBEARS_102323_01.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

The Bears own only four total picks in the seven-round draft, the last coming in the fourth round, No. 122 overall.\n\nAll rounds will be televised on ESPN/ABC and NFL Network and in Spanish on ESPN Deportes.\n\n-- The Beast is coming! Keep your eyes peeled for Dane Brugler's annual guide to the NFL Draft, publishing Wednesday, April 10.\n\n* Head coach: Matt Eberflus (third season with team)\n\n* Last year's record: 7-10\n\nThe Bears aren't your typical team with the first pick. They went 7-10 last season, winning five of their last eight games behind one of the NFL's best defenses in that span. The Bears have the first pick because of their trade with the Carolina Panthers last offseason. With Justin Fields traded to the Steelers, the Bears are expected to take a quarterback -- hello, Caleb Williams -- with that selection. The Bears' next quarterback will join a very favorable situation built by general manager Ryan Poles on offense. It includes wide receivers DJ Moore and Keenan Allen, tight ends Cole Kmet and Gerald Everett, running back D'Andre Swift and an offensive line featuring right tackle Darnell Wright. The Bears also have the ninth pick.\n\nQuarterback: Until the Bears' pick is officially made on April 25 in Detroit, the most important position in sports must be listed here. The only quarterbacks the Bears have under contract are Tyson Bagent and Brett Rypien.\n\nDefensive end: The trade acquisition of Montez Sweat helped transform the Bears defense into one of the league's best units. He made 6 1/2 sacks in eight games and was named to his first Pro Bowl. But the Bears still ranked 31st with only 30 sacks.\n\nDefensive tackle: Justin Jones, the Bears' starter at three-technique tackle for the past two seasons, left for the Arizona Cardinals in free agency. He received a three-year, $31.2 million contract. The Bears drafted Gervon Dexter in the second round last year to be Jones' eventual replacement. But Dexter needs to show significant improvement in his second season. He had 2 1/2 sacks in 17 games as a rookie.\n\nInterior offensive line: The Bears acquired veteran Ryan Bates from the Buffalo Bills for a fifth-round pick and signed Coleman Shelton in free agency. They will compete to be the starting center between guards Teven Jenkins and Nate Davis. Bates can also play guard, making him a top reserve should Jenkins and Davis miss time again in 2024. Jenkins is also entering the final year of his rookie contract after being drafted in the second round in 2021.\n\nPass catcher: This could be a receiver or a tight end. With the Bears drafting a quarterback, continuing to add around him is important. Even with Moore, Allen and Kmet on the roster, passing on playmakers makes for a bad process. This is widely considered a deep year for receivers in the draft, too.\n\nCan Caleb Williams make Chicago forget about the Bears' sad QB history?\n\nBears only have eyes for Caleb Williams at No. 1; could they go defensive tackle next?\n\nBears GM Ryan Poles must be ready for anything, but especially trading down at No. 9\n\nBears NFL Draft big board: Caleb Williams and 50 more prospects of interest\n\nBears NFL mock draft reaction: Is a Caleb Williams-Rome Odunze combo the way to go?\n\nBears NFL mock draft mailbag: Fans look to trade No. 9, add talent around Caleb Williams\n\nBears NFL Draft guide takeaways: Caleb Williams scouting report, prospects to watch at No. 9\n\nBears 2024 NFL Draft big board: 15 players to consider with the ninth pick\n\nWhy the Bears have reason to believe this reboot at quarterback will be different\n\nAll roads lead to Caleb Williams, and the Bears should feel good about that\n\nWhy Caleb Williams continues to check the 'person' boxes for the Bears\n\nBears pre-NFL Draft depth chart: More talent on offense for rookie QB, few holes on defense\n\nWhat the Keenan Allen trade means for the Bears offense and the No. 9 pick\n\nThe Bears and the No. 9 pick: Talented WRs, OTs and pass rushers to consider\n\nThis time, the Bears are ready to draft their next quarterback. Here's why\n\nApril 24: NFL beat writer mock draft 3.0\n\nAfter taking USC quarterback Caleb Williams at No. 1, Adam Jahns turns in a surprise pick at No. 9: Georgia tight end Brock Bowers.\n\nApril 22: Bears 7-round mock draft\n\nKevin Fishbain and Adam Jahns begin their final mock draft with Williams, then trade down from No. 9 to fill different needs in the trenches.\n\nApril 19: NFL analytics mock draft\n\nAustin Mock's Projection Model has the Bears taking Williams and Alabama edge rusher Dallas Turner in the first round.\n\nApril 17: Dane Brugler's 7-round mock draft\n\nBrugler predicts the Bears will take Williams and Washington wide receiver Rome Odunze in the first round, with an edge rusher and offensive tackle later.\n\nApril 8: Nick Baumgardner's mock draft\n\nBaumgardner has the Bears making a bold move up to No. 6 for LSU wide receiver Malik Nabers to pair with top pick Williams.\n\nApril 4: Bruce Feldman's mock draft\n\nFeldman shares coaching intel on each pick, including the Bears taking Williams at No. 1 and Nabers at No. 9.\n\nMarch 5: Dane Brugler's post-combine mock draft\n\nBrugler has the Bears trading up for Odunze at No. 5 after Williams, naturally, at No. 1.\n\nFeb. 22: Beat writer mock draft 1.0\n\nJahns takes Williams with the first pick, then trades down to No. 12 and picks edge rusher Jared Verse.\n\n2023: OT Darnell Wright, No. 10 -- The Bears put Wright through a grueling, private workout on Tennessee's campus before selecting him. He won Poles and offensive line coach Chris Morgan over -- and then he looked every bit like a future cornerstone as a rookie. Wright started every game and played every snap in his first season, which included playing hurt.\n\n2022: CB Kyler Gordon, No. 39 -- In Gordon, the Bears have one of the best young nickelbacks in the NFL. He followed up a steady rookie season with a better sophomore campaign, making three interceptions, forcing a fumble and recovering a fumble.\n\n2021: QB Justin Fields, No. 11 -- Fields was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers for a conditional sixth-round pick in the 2025 draft. He was a fan favorite and beloved by his teammates, but his passing numbers in 2023 still put him in the bottom third of the league. Fields was also drafted by former GM Ryan Pace and coach Matt Nagy.\n\n2020: TE Cole Kmet, No. 43 -- Kmet quickly won over Poles and coach Matt Eberflus. He signed a four-year, $50 million extension last year. He then delivered on the field with career highs in catches (73) and yards (719). He should be considered one of the best young tight ends in the league.\n\n2019: RB David Montgomery, No. 73 -- The Bears tried to re-sign Montgomery after the 2022 season, but he left for the rival Detroit Lions in free agency. He led the Lions with 1,015 yards and 13 touchdowns on 219 carries last season.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Williams is expected to be selected by Chicago at No. 1 overall, but there are questions about what Chicago will do with it's No. 9 overall pick.\n\nWide receiver Rome Odunze is one name that's been attached to the Bears in many mock drafts. Odunze is a projected top 10 pick, and has had a top 30 visit with the Bears.\n\nWhether he was having fun or gently advocating for the Bears to select Odunze at nine, Williams posted the following message on X, formerly Twitter: \"Oh shit yall I just saw Rome Odunze on my flight to Detroit!! Big fan!\"\n\nNot to be outdone, Odunze responded with jokes. \"I'm actually the pilot this morning. Don't worry I'll get Caleb to Detroit SAFELY!\" Odunze wrote.\n\nNaturally, Bears Nation had some thoughts and feelings about Williams' post, which was viewed over 3.1 million times at the time of publication.\n\nFormer Bears offensive lineman Kyle Long re-posted Williams, writing: \"Even if he misses his flight today he made his connection.\"\n\nWhen speaking with the media on April 23, Poles wouldn't come right out and admit the team was drafting Williams, but he continued to gush about the former USC star, as he had in previous pressers.\n\nWhen bringing Williams in for a visit earlier in April, Poles and the Bears elected to have the rookie QB meet with several team leaders, including wide receiver DJ Moore, linebacker T.J.

In fact we've known for a long time. Everything points to GM Ryan Poles selecting Caleb Williams to take over as the team's quarterback when the draft finally kicks off next Thursday. After that though, things get cloudier.\n\nThe Bears next selection is at No. 9, and what happens with the picks in between could determine what they decide to do. Here's a look at the full draft order for the first round.\n\nThe Bears have several options to consider with the No. 9 pick. An argument can be made that drafting a wide receiver, offensive tackle, pass rusher would all help the team in both the short and long term. Further, a trade up or a trade down could be on the table. The possibilities are numerous, and the team's final decision could depend on what happens in front of them- and the desperation of the teams behind them.\n\nLet's start with the teams in front of the Bears. Assuming quarterbacks come off the board with the top three picks, a big inflection point could be No. 4 with the Cardinals. They could stay put and draft one of the \"big three\" wide receivers, or potentially trade back to another QB-needy team. From there, the Chargers, Giants and Titans could all conceivably draft a wide receiver or an offensive tackle. Then there is the Falcons, who are widely speculated to be the first team to take a defensive player off the board.\n\nLet's say a big run on quarterbacks and offensive tackles occurs. In that scenario, an elite receiver could be left for the Bears, and they might jump at the chance to pair Williams with a playmaker for the duration of their careers. By adding Keenan Allen earlier this offseason to line up alongside DJ Moore, the Bears have ensured Williams will have two excellent WRs to target. But Allen turns 32 later this month and will likely only play in Chicago for a handful of seasons- if he signs a contract extension with the team. Maybe Poles views this as an opportunity for the team to set up their offense for the long term?\n\nWhat if the top shelf wide receivers are all gone by the time the Bears pick again, but a left tackle they covet is there? We know the Bears value building out the trenches given Poles' and assistant GM Ian Cunningham's OL pedigrees, so it shouldn't be a huge surprise if the team opts to bolster the unit.\n\nOr perhaps the Bears have an extremely high grade on a pass rusher who is still on the board, while their top offensive prospects are gone? If there's one guy they have circled as a force-multiplier on the defensive line, graded significantly better than the rest of the class, they could use the opportunity to add him and keep the defense on its upward trajectory from last year.\n\nThere's also a world in which every blue-chip player on the Bears board is gone by the time they pick. Or maybe only three quarterbacks get drafted among the top-eight picks and a QB-needy team gets antsy to make a move. In both of those cases, Poles could get on the phone and offer up the No. 9 pick to the highest bidder in the hopes of recouping a second or third-rounder. The Vikings, Broncos, Raiders and maybe even the Jets or Saints could be thinking about their next quarterback, and could be interested in making a deal with the Bears.\n\nThis is the draft order now, but things can change at any point between now and the start of the draft.

Even though he won't say it outright, he's going to select Caleb Williams to take over as the team's next quarterback. Shortly after that enormous decision becomes official, however, Poles will be faced with another big choice: what to do with the No. 9 overall pick.\n\n\"It's hard to answer right now,\" Poles said in his pre-draft press conference. \"As the draft unfolds, there's going to be some indicators that start to educate us on how we need to move to acquire the top talents in this draft.\"\n\nThe answer might be a game time decision, because there are several scenarios that could play out which would make a huge impact on what the Bears can do. Will a run on quarterbacks push down one of the \"big three\" wide receivers so that Poles can pair an elite pass catcher with Williams for the duration of their careers? Or does he move up for his favorite left tackle to protect Williams, if he gets the chance? Maybe all the Bears blue-chippers are gone by the time they're back on the clock and Poles decides to trade back?\n\n\"The nice thing is from the work that we've done I feel pretty good about just being flexible,\" Poles said.\n\nPart of that flexibility will be determining what position the team wants to address with their pick- or picks if they move back. Earlier this year, Poles' staff broke into groups to review premium offensive linemen, defensive linemen and wide receivers. They wanted to know how players in each group could impact the team in the long term and short term. They explored how different championship-caliber teams built their rosters around those premium groups. Then they debated.\n\n\"It really solidified just those premiums positions are important,\" Poles said. \"So those three are there, it matches up with this draft pretty well.\"\n\nAnd if it comes down to the opportunity to draft their WR3 compared to their DE1 (a scenario that very much could be in play), the Bears have a way to make their decision ahead of time. Poles and assistant GM Ian Cunningham sit down ahead of time and sequence their entire board from No. 1 to picks in the 200s. So if there comes a time when they need to decide between two players who each play a premium position, they'll just address their big board.\n\nWhen it comes to trade backs, the Bears have a similar method, but they rely on how many players they have in various tiers. Hypothetically speaking, let's say the Bears have a first-round grade on 15 players. Accordingly, the team wouldn't feel comfortable trading past No. 15 in the draft.\n\n\"So it kind of depends on the first couple of picks and how they move,\" Poles said. \"We'll count them up and say, 'You know what, here's the line. We can't go past that.'\"\n\nThe Bears likely have a cluster of players that they've honed in on as targets with the No. 9 pick already. They have worked through different outcomes and situations where they'll want to trade down. But they won't know which road they're taking until the picks start coming off the board for real.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Polish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Poles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Poles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://media.nbcchicago.com/2023/11/GettyImages-1750366089.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C7675px%2C4317px&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Chicago has only two quarterbacks on the current depth chart -- undrafted Tyson Bagent and journeyman backup Brett Rypien -- making the position a massive need.\n\n\"We're proud of where we've come from,\" Poles said. \"It's going to be hard to make this team now.\"\n\nWhen Poles traded the No. 1 pick to the Panthers weeks before the 2023 draft and received a 2024 first-rounder as part of the return package, he said the prevailing thought was to be in position to draft a quarterback should 2021 first-rounder Justin Fields not prove he's worthy of the QB1 role.\n\nLeadership changes in personnel and top coaching spots often drive decisions to move on from quarterbacks drafted by previous regimes.\n\nMore from this section Polarizing Michael Penix Jr. drawing heavy public interest Former Miami RB Henry Parrish Jr. returns to Ole Miss Jamal Mashburn Jr. transfers to Temple\n\nFields, drafted 11th overall when then-GM Ryan Pace and the Bears moved up from No. 20 in a deal with the New York Giants, was traded to the Steelers last month to be the backup to Russell Wilson in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe new brass has tracked Williams incessantly.\n\nPoles, head coach Matt Eberflus, offensive coordinator Shane Waldron and other members of the organization have spent countless hours to reach this point. The Bears met with Williams at the NFL Scouting Combine -- where Eberflus offers prospects the option of playing darts or putt-putt before the more intensive interview begins -- before his pro day workout (where new Bears wide receiver Keenan Allen made an appearance) and were the only team to host Williams at team headquarters for a \"top 30\" visit.\n\n\"The journey to collect all the information is different for everyone,\" Poles said. \"There's guys on our board that are high that didn't come in for a 30-visit that we've had other touchpoints. Our networks in the building know the player inside and out that we really, really trust.\"\n\nPoles called reports the Bears are shopping the No. 9 overall pick speculation and said he doesn't feel

Selecting Williams is potentially a franchise-altering moment, but there's more work to be done after Williams dons the Bears draft hat.\n\nHere's one final, keep-it-simple mock draft for Poles and the Bears to ace a rare opportunity:\n\nThis has been a done deal for a while. Thursday merely makes it official.\n\nWilliams checked the final box for the Bears during his visit to Halas Hall. The Bears took Williams out to dinner with several members of the organization and veteran players.\n\nBarring an unforeseen issue, Williams will be the pick at No. 1. He has been the desired choice all along and has done nothing to move the Bears off their belief that he's the quarterback they need to elevate the franchise to new heights.\n\nThe Bears love Wiliams' tape and have had productive meetings with the USC star at the NFL Scouting Combine, during a three-day excursion to Los Angeles for his pro day, and again at Williams' 30 visit.\n\nDuring that trip to LA, the Bears got an even clearer picture of Williams, the person, and saw the ball come out of his hand live.\n\nThe tape and eye test matched. That was important, but the biggest boxes Williams' checked came during his dinner with the Bears' brass and his teammates two days before his pro day.\n\n\"When you talk to his teammates, they don't like him, they love him,\" Poles said of Williams at the league meetings. \"His leadership, how he brings people together. He's intentional with his leadership. Same goes with the staff. I'm having a hard time finding a person that doesn't like him or even love him and thinks that he can reach the highest limits.\"\n\nAccuracy, arm talent, vision, improvisational playmaking, touch, feel. You name it, Williams has it.\n\nOver the past two seasons at USC, Williams has thrown 72 touchdown passes and only 10 interceptions. The lack of talent on the 2023 Trojans forced Williams to try to play hero most of the time. The Bears have to be comfortable with Williams putting on the cape and making \"no, no, no, yes\" plays while also working to harness that unique playmaking ability.\n\nWilliams went 12-0 during his career when the Trojans allowed fewer than 34 points. He's very good within structure, but the lack of protection and poor defense forced him to play outside it for most of 2023. The 2022 film, when Williams had more talent around him, is a better indicator of what the Bears are getting at No. 1.\n\nEven Williams' worst game as a college quarterback -- a three-interception affair in a loss to Notre Dame -- was viewed as a positive by those inside Halas Hall.\n\nThe Bears were at the game in South Bend and watched Notre Dame trot out a completely different defensive game plan than they had shown in any previous game that season. Even as Williams struggled against a new look, his body language remained good, and the Bears watched him carefully as he went to the sideline after each turnover and tried to rally his teammates.\n\nWatching how Williams handled USC's 7-5 season was a vital touchpoint that showed the Bears how the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner handles the type of adversity that will surely come his way in the NFL.\n\n\"There have been quarterbacks in the past where they are undefeated for three years, they have a bunch of first round picks surrounding them at all times, so it's a projection of how they handle discomfort, how they handle pressure,\" Poles told NBC Sports Chicago during a sit-down in Orlando. \"So seeing some of these guys go through hard times is important because now you can actually talk about it and listen to them kind of go back and, 'OK, what can I kind of do to get better? How could I handle certain situations better?' There are so many learning lessons from that. It just makes you feel comfortable where, if you're in a situation like that, the kid is going to come out on the other side because if not they can crumble easily.\"\n\nWilliams will be the pick at No. 1 as long as his medicals check out during his visit to Halas Hall. There's no reason for him not to be.\n\n\"He's a franchise-changing prospect,\" one NFC scout told NBC Sports Chicago at the combine. \"Guys like Caleb Williams don't often come around. They'd be foolish to pass on him. I don't know if he's generational, but he's definitely the best quarterback prospect to come out since [Andrew] Luck.\"\n\nFor the last four months, trading down has been the expected move by the Bears at No. 9.\n\nThat's still in the cards, but from what I've gathered, there are a select few players the Bears would deem \"stick and pick\" selections.\n\nOdunze is atop that list. With the size, elite ball skills, physical run-after-the-catch ability, contested-catch prowess, and alignment versatility, Odunze is the ideal receiver to add to a receiving corps that already includes DJ Moore and Keenan Allen.\n\nAllen is 32, in the final year of his contract, and has dealt with soft tissue injuries over the past few seasons. With no reliable depth behind Allen and Moore, the Bears need to add a high-ceiling No. 3 receiver to ensure Williams has the proper support system around him.\n\nThe Bears must also plan for life after Williams, whether in a few years or 2025.\n\nBut I believe Odunze is who the Bears covet, and if the first eight picks fall their way, he very well could be available at No. 9.\n\nOpting not to trade down from No. 9 leaves the Bears with just two picks left in the draft, but there are still impact players to be found in the third and fourth rounds.\n\nBooker is one.\n\nA long, twitchy edge defender with explosive athleticism, Booker has all the traits the Bears covet in a defensive end.\n\nWhile he needs to get bigger and stronger, Booker has a good rush plan with the length and speed to get on top of quarterbacks and running backs in a heartbeat.\n\nHe was compared to Las Vegas Raiders star Maxx Crosby during the pre-draft process. That's a lofty comparison, but Booker has the tools and talent to become an extremely productive edge rusher with the right coaching and development.\n\nThe Bears round out a short but potentially franchise-altering draft with their long-term answer at center.\n\nNourzad is a powerful center with solid length, good technique, and the ability to play in any scheme.\n\nThe Bears traded for Ryan Bates this offseason and signed Coleman Shelton to a one-year contract, but neither figure to factor into their long-term plans at center. The Bears love Bates, but he's probably best utilized as a swing interior lineman once all the pieces are in place.\n\nNourzad will need some fine-tuning, but he can be a good depth piece in 2024 with plans to take over in 2025.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams",

The Bears are in prime position to get a star at one of their three positions of need -- receiver, defensive line and left tackle.\n\nThe front office spent the past few weeks breaking into groups and analyzing the benefits of taking a player at each spot. They did historical studies of how championship franchises built their rosters around each position.\n\nThey broke down the difference between drafting a defensive tackle and end, too. Poles and assistant GM Ian Cunningham know the impact of the former. Poles was part of a Chiefs front office that drafted three-time Pro Bowl tackle Chris Jones and two-time Pro Bowl tackle Dontari Poe, and Cunningham was with the Eagles when they picked four-time Pro Bowl tackle Fletcher Cox.\n\n\"I would say the inside guy has the shortest path to the quarterback ...\" Poles said ... \"Really good elite players that are inside, it changes everything ... Having that interior rush is probably a preference when you have an outside guy. It makes it really difficult to scheme up.\"\n\nTexas' Byron Murphy II is the class of the defensive tackle class. The Bears used a second- and third-round pick on the position last year, though, and it might be hard to justify using another top pick on the same spot.\n\nAs for defensive end: Alabama's Dallas Turner, who toured Halas Hall the same day as Williams, might be drafted in the top eight. UCLA's Laiatu Latu has injury questions -- he once retired for medical reasons -- and Florida State's Jared Verse could be had later in the draft.\n\nAny of the top three receivers in the draft -- Ohio State's Marvin Harrison, LSU's Malik Nabers and Odunze -- would fit the Bears' needs at No. 9. All three might be gone by then. The same goes for Notre Dame's Joe Alt, the prototypical left tackle.\n\nIf that proves to be the case, Poles could be tempted to trade down to acquire more picks. The Bears have four entering the draft, the lowest number in the NFL this year -- and in franchise history.\n\nPoles traded down one spot in Round 1 last year and has moved down a combined five times on Day 3 the last two drafts.\n\nHe's maintained, however, that he's content with having four picks this time around.\n\n\"From the work that we've done, I feel pretty good about just being flexible ... \" Poles said. \"I feel really good where we're at. If [adding picks] happens, that's great.\"\n\nIf Poles has a chance to land a star at No. 9, he'd be wise to not to overthink it. Ozzie Newsome, the legendary former Ravens GM -- and Pro Football Hall of Fame tight end -- spoke to Poles and Cunningham about the kind of player they'd get there.\n\n\"He says, 'You want the guy s in that first round to be the cover of your album,'\" Poles said. \"You want those to be where everyone can look to that player and be like, 'All right, what he's made of is what we want to be a part of.'\"\n\nWilliams will be on the album cover. It's up to Poles to decide with whom to pair him.", "source": {"uri": "chicago.suntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Sun-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But that's not the case with their No. 9 choice.\n\nThey could stand pat and select a player, trade up or move down.\n\n\"It's hard to answer right now,\" general manager Ryan Poles said Tuesday during his annual pre-draft press conference at Halas Hall. \"As the draft unfolds, there's going to be some indicators that start to educate us on how we need to move to acquire the top talents in this draft.\"\n\nRoad to Canton: Remembering Devin Hester's remarkable rookie season 2024 Chicago Bears draft picks Where Bears pick in 2024 NFL Draft These Bears draft picks gained fame in other areas Scouting reports on Bears players entering draft 9 fun facts about No. 9 pick in NFL Draft\n\nThe Bears would only trade down if they were assured of still landing a player they were targeting. Last year they moved down from No. 9 to 10 and took right tackle Darnell Wright, obtaining a fourth-round choice from the Eagles in the deal.\n\n\"We need to count the players in certain ranges, and we would feel uncomfortable if we got outside of whatever threshold that is,\" Poles said. \"So it depends on the first couple of picks and how they move, and we'll count them up and say, 'You know what, here's the line. We can't go past that.'\"\n\nIn addition to their two first-round picks, the Bears have only two additional choices in this year's draft: one in the third round (75) and one in the fourth (122). They traded away five of their seven choices, acquiring defensive end Montez Sweat and receiver Keenan Allen, among others.\n\nPoles entered his first draft as Bears GM in 2022 determined to acquire more picks to bolster the roster. He accomplished that by completing four deals that generated five additional choices, increasing the number of Bears selections from six to 11. Despite having just four picks this year-which would be the fewest in franchise history-Poles is not motivated to add more choices because the roster has been strengthened and fewer underclassmen declared for the draft than usual.\n\n\"I feel really good where we're at,\" Poles said. \"It's going to be really hard to make this team now. That doesn't mean you don't want more shots later. We'll always welcome a lot of picks. But it doesn't force you to panic about the situation we're in right now with how many picks we have.\"\n\n\"I think we both feel comfortable with how the board is set based off of the draft class,\" added assistant general manager Ian Cunningham. \"Each year is different. This year I think there were 58 juniors that declared. So we kind of have to work in the constructs of this year with what we have given to us.\"\n\nCunningham, who has drawn interest from other NFL teams as a GM candidate, is excited to be entering his third season as Poles' assistant in Chicago.\n\n\"[I'm] just extremely grateful for the opportunity,\" Cunningham said. \"Not many people in any walk of life get to work with arguably one of their best friends. So for me to be able to work alongside him, for him to trust me, we all knew that this was his goal. I have a similar goal. But it means everything for me just to be able to work with him every single day. I know my opportunity will come. It's been fun. It's been a fun ride. Looking forward to this week and kind of seeing things through.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Poles told reporters that he and his staff were planning to break into three groups and debate the merits of drafting a receiver, tackle or defensive lineman at No. 9.\n\n\"The nice thing is from the work that we've done, I feel pretty good about just being flexible,\" Poles said. \"That's why we did that project with some premium positions with O-line, with D-line, receiver, and all that feedback was outstanding. ... There are different championship-caliber teams that have built their teams in different ways. And it really solidified that those premiums positions are important. So those three are there. It matches up with this draft pretty well.\"\n\nRegardless of who and where the Bears pick in the draft, they want all of their selections to possess the same characteristics.\n\n\"They've got to impact the football team from a skillset standpoint,\" Poles said. \"But we are going to look at some key things when we talk about passion for the game, coachability, dependability, resilience. Those things are going to be consistent from the first overall pick to a seventh-round draft pick. We want guys that have that. We have an indicator we put on their tag. We would put a Bear head on their tag [and] call them the grizzly, the top Bear. They have those traits, so we're always looking to hit those. And obviously, the earlier in the draft, you want to have those.\"", "source": {"uri": "polandsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Poland Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Polish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Poles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Poles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Hester", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devin Hester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montez_Sweat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montez Sweat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenan_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keenan Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Bearings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Bearings", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft_Toys", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft Toys", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Stuffed_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Stuffed Animals", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/Associations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/cbr1713940626.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Based on Williams' awards and evaluations, he'll be the most decorated and highly touted rookie to ever hear his name called as a Bear, maybe matched only by Dick Butkus and Johnny Lujack.\n\nWilliams will be the first Bears draft pick who won the Heisman Trophy since Rashaan Salaam. Of the four previous Heisman winners to be drafted by Chicago, only Lujack had a successful pro career. He's also the only other Heisman-winning quarterback to be drafted by the Bears.\n\nNo one has come to Halas Hall as the consensus top-rated prospect in a draft. No rookie has come to Halas Hall with the fame of Williams -- ironically, Justin Fields is probably a close second.\n\nWilliams alone creates the buzz felt at the Piccolo Award ceremony and the team's unveiling of its stadium plans, but April 25 could be significant because of what comes next as the Bears are scheduled to pick again at No. 9.\n\nIt would be one thing to come away from Thursday night with Williams, the best player and quarterback in the draft, someone expected to set records as a Bear. The second first-round pick is what provides the extra excitement.\n\nMaybe this won't be like 1965 when they drafted Butkus and Gale Sayers. Maybe it won't be 1983, the draft that included Jimbo Covert, Richard Dent, Willie Gault, Tom Thayer, Dave Duerson, Mike Richardson and Mark Bortz.\n\nThe last time the Bears had two first-round picks was 2003, but that's a draft rated among the team's best for the guys taken on Day 2 -- Lance Briggs and Charles Tillman. Three years earlier, the Bears came away with quite the defensive duo in Brian Urlacher and Mike Brown.\n\nIn 2020, when the Bears' website ranked the top 10 greatest drafts in team history, only one included a quarterback -- 1939, when they selected Sid Luckman. Of those 10 drafts, only two occurred in the last 40 years.\n\nThursday could set a new standard. The two top-10 picks might be enough to make the 2024 draft a fabled one.\n\nAfter Williams, the Bears get the privilege of possibly taking the best defensive player in the draft, perhaps an edge rusher to complement Montez Sweat (Dallas Turner? Laiatu Latu? Jared Verse?) or the three-technique tackle (Byron Murphy?) to best spark Matt Eberflus' scheme.\n\nThey can select a starting wide receiver to pair with Williams for the next decade (Rome Odunze? Marvin Harrison Jr.? Malik Nabers?) or draft an offensive lineman to protect Williams for the next decade (Joe Alt? Olu Fashanu? JC Latham? Taliese Fuaga? Troy Fautanu?).\n\nWho knows, maybe the Bears select one of the most gifted tight ends in recent memory (Brock Bowers?) to give Williams a unique weapon.\n\nHeck, they could even trade down 10 spots, get a second-round pick in return and still find a starting wide receiver, edge rusher or offensive lineman.\n\nEven the Bears can't mess this up. Then again, if any team can, based on their history, it'd be the Bears.\n\nThis is the type of draft that can define the Bears and start them in a new direction. Most of the other high draft picks they've had -- those opportunities -- haven't panned out.\n\nThe last time the Bears picked in the top three, it was Mitch Trubisky. Other top-10 picks in the past 26 years include Kevin White, Cedric Benson, David Terrell and Curtis Enis.\n\nIt's been a decade since a first-round pick eventually earned a contract extension from the Bears (Kyle Fuller) and 24 years since a top-10 pick went on to get a second contract (Urlacher).\n\nDraft picks are an opportunity. It took a savvy trade from Poles and some Panthers misfortune to get in this position, but there are no guarantees.\n\nIn the past, the Bears have squandered these opportunities. Bad teams in the fall and winter have created excitement for April, only for the team to botch the opportunity. It's been as simple as taking the wrong quarterback or improperly surrounding a quarterback or the wide receiver who never stayed healthy. They have given fans reason to be skeptical and cynical, and at best, only cautiously optimistic.\n\nThis time, they're drafting two top-10 players onto a team that won seven games last season, that has a couple of Pro Bowl players and a few more who are worthy.\n\nDraft picks are opportunities, and right now, the Bears are positioned to bring in a player in Williams with extraordinary potential, along with a top-five non-quarterback prospect, the type of player who, in any other draft, we would hail as a blue-chipper to be part of the Bears' foundation for years to come. He can still be that guy, but this time he'll be No. 2.\n\nDrafts are about hope, and the Bears have rarely, if ever, been able to offer more hope than they will Thursday night.", "source": {"uri":

The selection will begin with the first of 250+ picks over the course of three days as each team looks to find productive rookies that will contribute during this upcoming season.\n\nFor the Bears, they currently hold just four picks, though two of them happen to be within the top 10. It's an unusual situation for general manager Ryan Poles, who managed to make double-digit selections in his first two years with the Bears, but he sounds prepared for having fewer selections this year. \"I feel really good with where we're at,\" he said during a press conference on Tuesday.\n\nPoles doesn't need any advice from us, but if we were him, here is what we would and would not do when the draft gets underway on Thursday evening.\n\nDO draft Caleb Williams\n\nApr 24, 2024; Detroit, MI, USA; Southern California Trojans quarterback Caleb Williams reacts at the Play Football Prospect Clinic at The Corner Ballpark. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThis is like someone telling you that drinking water keeps you alive. The Bears are going to draft Williams No. 1 overall, which has been the plan for quite some time. They did their initial research on all the top prospects, but predictably zeroed in on the former Heisman Trophy winner as the draft process got underway. Months of work and meetings have led to this point, where Williams will walk across the stage in Detroit and hold up a Bears jersey shortly after 7:00 p.m. CT.\n\nDON'T try and move down too far to accumulate more picks\n\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS - DECEMBER 24: General manager Ryan Poles of the Chicago Bears attends the game between the Chicago Bears and the Arizona Cardinals at Soldier Field on December 24, 2023 in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Quinn Harris/Getty Images)\n\nTrading down in the first round always seems like a smart decision on the surface. It gives a team more picks to work with while still giving them a shot at landing a top player that may have been available earlier on in the draft. But with the Bears picking at No. 9 overall, any move down should only go so far.\n\nIf Chicago were to strike a deal with a team like Minnesota, Denver, or Las Vegas, they could add picks while only moving down 2-4 spots. They would still be almost guaranteed a top tackle or defensive line prospect, as well as potentially gaining a mid-round pick or more. Anything later, though, could result in them not getting one of their blue-chip players, even if the return were greater. If a trade down is on the table, Poles would be wise to limit how far he's willing to go.\n\nDO draft a wide receiver at some point\n\nSep 24, 2022; Seattle, Washington, USA; Washington Huskies wide receiver Rome Odunze (1) signals for a first down after catching a pass against the Stanford Cardinal during the first quarter at Alaska Airlines Field at Husky Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nGoing into the draft, the Bears are loaded at the top of their receiving depth chart with DJ Moore and Keenan Allen. Look below them, however, and there isn't much behind them. Tyler Scott didn't show much during his rookie season, Velus Jones Jr. looks like a lost cause on offense, and Dante Pettis is a WR5 at best. The Bears need another rookie they can develop and would be wise to invest in one during this year's draft, preferably with pick No. 9.\n\nThere is a realistic chance one of the top three wide receivers would be available at that pick, likely Washington's Rome Odunze. Even if the Bears chose to go in another direction, finding someone with the No. 75 pick would be paramount. Perhaps Odunze's college teammate, Jalen McMillan, or Florida State's Keon Coleman would be available. It's a deep receiver class, and someone of note should be on the board when that pick comes up. The Bears shouldn't enter Saturday without a rookie receiver.\n\nDON'T prioritize cornerback\n\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS - OCTOBER 22: Tyrique Stevenson #29 and Jaylon Johnson #33 of the Chicago Bears celebrate a third down stop against the Las Vegas Raiders at Soldier Field on October 22, 2023 in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Michael Reaves/Getty Images)\n\nThis Bears team doesn't have the same holes it once did, where nearly every position needed help when it came time for the draft. In fact, only a few position groups are in that position now. Units like linebackers and cornerbacks, however, are stacked with talent, and the Bears don't need to try to fill any sort of void there.\n\nSpeaking of cornerbacks, it's a position Poles knows well from the draft. His very first pick was Kyler Gordon back in 2022, and he made two more selections last year with Tyrique Stevenson and Terell Smith. Those decisions paid off as Gordon took another step in Year 2, while Stevenson and Smith both had solid rookie seasons. Not mention Jaylon Johnson becoming a Pro Bowl cornerback and getting extended for another four seasons. They didn't even lose anyone in free agency, and they are bringing the entire position group back. There are talented cornerbacks in this year's draft, but Poles should prioritize other positions that are more glaring.\n\nDO find defensive line help\n\nTexas Longhorns defensive lineman Byron Murphy II (90) celebrates after a sack against TCU Horned Frogs quarterback Josh Hoover (10) in the second quarter of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, November. 11, 2023, at Amon G. Carter Stadium in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nSpeaking of glaring positions, the defensive line is arguably the weakest spot on the team, whether that is at edge rusher or defensive tackle. The Bears still only have one bona fide pass rusher with Montez Sweat and have yet to replace the production of Justin Jones on the inside, who signed a multi-year deal with the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nWhile it would be great to see Chicago land Odunze at No. 9, the front four has to be taken into consideration there as well. Someone like Byron Murphy on the inside at three-technique could be the missing piece this group needs to become an elite defense. They could also beef up their outside with players like Jared Verse or Laiatu Latu and give the line another capable edge rusher opposite of Sweat. Similar to the sentiment that the Bears shouldn't leave Day 2 without a receiver, they should also make sure they have someone on their defensive line as well. It just depends on which part of the line they choose to focus on.\n\nDON'T pick in the top 10 next year\n\nA behind-the-scenes look at the NFL draft's green room outside the main theater area photographed on Tuesday, April 23, 2024. The NFL draft will be held in Detroit later this week.\n\nThis will be the third year in a row that the Bears will have finished with a top-10 selection in the NFL Draft, even if they have only held their own pick the last two years (their 2021 draft pick at No. 6 overall went to the New York Giants as part of the Justin Fields pick). Given how this team is set up going into the 2024 season, there shouldn't be a fourth season in a row that the Bears are picking inside the top 10.\n\nWith Williams as the new quarterback throwing to Moore and Allen behind an above-average offensive line and a top-10 defense with a scary secondary, this team is better than a 7-10 record. If all goes according to plan this next season, the Bears will be down the draft order, which would be music to everyone's ears.", "source": {"uri": "bearswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news",

All signs point to General Manager Ryan Poles selecting USC quarterback Caleb Williams, with the hope he can become a reasonable facsimile of Patrick Mahomes, but that hardly means it will be a dull Thursday night for Chicago fans.\n\nIn addition to the first pick, which they acquired from Carolina in the trade for the first overall pick in 2023, they hold their own first-rounder, at No. 9. No one, including Poles, seems certain whether the Bears will look to add another target for Williams -- Washington's Rome Odunze seems the most likely to still be on the board -- or perhaps strengthen the defense that seemed to turn a corner when Poles added Montez Sweat at the trade deadline last season.\n\nThe Bears reportedly have developed an interest in University of Texas defensive tackle Byron Murphy II, who profiles as a dynamic 3-technique force in the middle of the line. They passed up Jalen Carter to select offensive tackle Darnell Wright last year but appear intrigued about the disruptive potential of a defensive front featuring Murphy, veteran Andrew Billings and second-year guys Gervon Dexter Sr. and Zaach Pickens in a rotation that keeps fresh players in the mix.\n\nPoles has another decision to make, of course: Whether to use the No. 9 pick himself or trade down to a quarterback-needy team that wasn't able to grab one of the four expected to be selected in the top five of the draft -- Williams, LSU's Jayden Daniels, North Carolina's Drake Maye and Michigan's J.J. McCarthy.\n\nThat decision may come down to whether one of the players he covets slips through the teams making the first eight picks. Currently Washington, New England, Arizona, the Los Angeles Chargers, New York Giants, Tennessee and Atlanta have the selections between the Bears' two picks but most analysts are expected a lot of late trades.\n\nPoles has already given Williams a supporting cast far superior to anything the team had in three years with Justin Fields as the starting quarterback. He's traded for wide receiver Keenan Allen while signing free agent tight end Gerald Everett and running back D'Andre Swift this off-season. They join holdover wide receivers DJ Moore and Tyler Scott, tight end Cole Kmet and running back Khalil Herbert in a deep inventory of skill players.\n\nBut here's the catch: Allen was dumped by the Chargers because he's in the last year of his four-year, $80.1 million contract. The Bears are committed to carrying Moore at a cal value of a combined $32.2 million over the next two seasons.\n\nThis draft is considered rich with high-ceiling wide receivers, so it's safe to say that Poles will be watching to see whether Ohio State's Marvin Harrison Jr., LSU's Malik Nabers and Odunze are still on the board for the No. 9 pick. The Bears could allow Moore and Allen to help groom one of them and then pair look to extend either Allen or Moore to give them a long run together.\n\nThe Bears have also paid due diligence to the top offensive lineman in the draft class. Notre Dame tackle Joe Alt and Penn Sate tackle Olu Fashanu are considered to be at the head of that class, and you can argue that you should protect a quarterback if you're going to draft one.\n\nBraxton Jones, entering his third year, is currently the left tackle. Pro Football Focus ranked him 35th among 81 qualified tackles last season.\n\nThe line as a group finished last season ranked 19th by PFF, suggesting the need for some improvement. The Bears added center Ryan Bates in a trade with Buffalo but Poles may be motivated to look for a bigger upgrade.\n\nPoles' short history in the draft suggests he will trade down at some point for additional picks. They head toward Thursday night with only two picks after the first round -- one in the third round and another in the fourth. But Poles has been dropping hints that he's hunting only for quality this time around, not quantity.\n\nThe key to the draft for the Bears is what Poles does with the No. 9 pick. We're about to find out which direction he's taking.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He opted to leave that to commissioner Roger Goodell on Thursday night.\n\n\"So unfortunately it's one of those things I think everyone's got to tune in on Thursday to watch and figure out, but I feel really good about our process and where we are and where we're headed,' Poles said, smiling. 'So we know what we're going to do but everyone is going to have to wait until Thursday to go there.\"\n\nBarring a massive surprise, the Bears will kick off the draft by grabbing the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner and setting themselves on a course they hope takes them to the top of the NFL. They also have the ninth overall pick as well as a third-rounder (75) and a fourth-rounder (122).\n\nChicago has been the likely landing spot for Williams since he announced in an Instagram post in January that he was leaving USC and turning pro. The Bears are the only team Williams has visited, while his odds of going No. 1 overall have shortened all the way down to -20000 -- a virtual lock -- on DraftKings Sportsbook as of Tuesday evening.\n\n[Related: 2024 NFL odds: Caleb Williams opens as Offensive Rookie of the Year favorite]\n\nThe Bears are in this position thanks to a blockbuster trade last year with Carolina. Chicago sent the No. 1 pick in 2023 to the Panthers for receiver DJ Moore and their first-rounder this year. Carolina finished with a league-worst 2-15 mark after taking Alabama quarterback and 2021 Heisman winner Bryce Young first overall last year.\n\nWilliams checks all the boxes with his arm strength and ability to avoid defenders. He can extend plays and make throws on the run as well as in the pocket -- an area where former starter Justin Fields struggled. Fields was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers for a sixth-round pick in March, all but assuring that the Bears would take a quarterback with the top pick in Thursday's draft.\n\nWilliams had 93 touchdowns and 14 interceptions during three seasons at Oklahoma and USC. He threw for 72 TDs and just 10 interceptions in two years with the Trojans. He also showed the ability to run with 27 rushing touchdowns in college.\n\nWilliams followed coach Lincoln Riley from Norman to Los Angeles and won the Heisman in 2022. Williams threw for 4,537 yards, 42 touchdowns and five interceptions to lift USC from four wins in 2021 to 11 and an appearance in the Cotton Bowl.\n\nWilliams put up big numbers again last season while the Trojans struggled to an 8-5 record with one of the nation's worst defenses. He threw for 3,333 yards, 30 touchdowns and five interceptions in 12 games. He did not play in the Holiday Bowl.\n\nThe Bears have been eyeing Williams throughout the draft process. They met with him at the combine and spent a few days with him leading into his pro day in Los Angeles.\n\n[Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

Edwards.\n\n\"You get to know people and how they fit in the culture and things like that,\" Edwards said. \"At the end of the day once we get people here and once whoever is signed will be here, we'll hit the ground running with that.\"\n\nPoles said the feedback about Williams he got from the players at the dinner was positive.\n\n\"I think it just confirmed a lot of information that we got,' he said. \"You know, there's a kind of test to where his football understanding is. That part, getting him with some of our players. That's important to us. We're in a really good place with our culture in our locker room. As much as I can I want those guys a part of the process of building this team. I trust their feedback and I think that chemistry is really important so that's why we did that.'\n\nThe Bears are 10-24 in two seasons under Poles and coach Matt Eberflus. But after going 7-10 last season, they believe they are poised to take another big step.\n\nWilliams would have two star receivers to work with in Moore and the recently acquired Keenan Allen as well as two productive tight ends in Cole Kmet and newcomer Gerald Everett. He has big goals, saying on The Pivot Podcast recently that he hopes to spend 20 years with one team and chase Tom Brady's record seven Super Bowl wins.\n\n\"I love it,\" Poles said. \"I think we all should have huge goals. We have huge goals here -- win multiple championships. And that's what we shoot for. You're more intentional when you have these goals, you have to live a certain way, you have to practice a certain way, you have to go about your business a certain way in order to accomplish those. If everything else is in line underneath that, that gets me excited.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Some say the Bears will grab another pass-catching weapon for Williams -- putting that pick in a room with returning talent DJ Moore and Cole Kmet, plus newcomers Keenan Allen, Gerald Everett and D'Andre Swift.\n\nThe \"big three\" receiving prospects -- all expected to be picked in the top 10 -- are Marvin Harrison Jr. of Ohio State, LSU's Malik Nabers and Washington's Rome Odunze. There is a wide gap between those three and the rest, with another receiver not expected to be picked until deep in the first round.\n\nAlyssa Barbieri of Bears Wire says the \"most mocked\" pick is speedy 6-foot-3 Odunze, the nation's yardage leader in 2023. \"If one of the 'big three' wide receivers is going to fall to Chicago ... Odunze is the most likely,\" she wrote.\n\nThe NFL Mock Draft Database -- which compiles more than 1,200 mocks from across the Internet -- has the big three receivers gone by pick No. 9. The consensus has the Bears selecting edge rusher Jared Verse of Florida State, but with only 15 percent \"popularity\" meaning that not many mocks agree on the pick.\n\nSince the Bears have only four draft picks overall, the team could trade down if it is not able land one of the top receivers. Possible trade partners are the Vikings, Broncos, Raiders, Colts and Jaguars. A few mocks have them trading down a handful of picks to snag an edge rusher like Verse or Alabama's Dallas Turner, or even the second tier of receivers like LSU's Brian Thomas Jr. or Texas' Xavier Worthy.\n\nSports Illustrated's Albert Breer is confident the Bears are looking to either add a playmaker or trade down and add picks. \"Other teams have gotten the sense that Chicago will try to move down given their dearth of picks,\" Breer wrote. \"If the Bears stick, a couple of friends of GM Ryan Poles said they think he'll be looking to add talent around Williams.\"\n\nHere is a sampling of predictions for the Chicago Bears' No. 9 pick:\n\nHere are the Chicago Bears draft picks.

So we know what we're going to do but everyone is going to have to wait until Thursday.\"\n\nWilliams has been atop the Bears' draft board since the start of the pre-draft process. The Bears had a brief meeting with Williams at the combine, spent two days with him ahead of his pro day in Los Angeles, and then hosted him on a top-30 visit to Halas Hall.\n\nThat 30 visit included a dinner with several team veterans, including wide receiver DJ Moore, linebacker T.J. Edwards, and tight end Cole Kmet.\n\n\"Really intelligent guy. Came across as a really good teammate, easy to talk to, down to earth,\" Poles said when asked about the feedback he got from veterans about Williams. \"We've talked through this process about the whole Hollywood thing. He's all ball, wants to work, wants to get better, wants to win as a team. That's the No. 1 thing for him on top of being successful. I think the biggest thing is: Does he fit in our culture and what we're trying to do. And all signs were that he does, so that was positive.\"\n\nWilliams has checked every box for the Bears during the pre-draft process.\n\nThe initial meeting at the combine was all about football. The Bears used a multiple-day visit to Los Angeles to test Williams' football knowledge and see his interactions and relationships with his USC teammates during a pre-Pro-Day dinner.\n\nThe 30 visit was merely the final piece of a puzzle. It was important for Poles to involve key veteran players in the final evaluation of Williams.\n\n\"I think it just confirmed a lot of information that we got,\" Poles said of the 30 visit. \"You know, there's a kind of test to where his football understanding is. That part, getting him with some of our players. That's important to us. We're in a really good place with our culture in our locker room. As much as I can I want those guys a part of the process of building this team. I trust their feedback, and I think that chemistry is really important, so that's why we did that.\"\n\nThe Bears will make Williams the No. 1 overall pick on Thursday, and then a new era of Bears football will begin.\n\nPoles and his staff have flipped the roster over in two years and assembled a team that should compete for a playoff spot in 2024.\n\nThe excitement is overflowing at Halas Hall. But the draft-week celebration will be short-lived. Then, the real work begins.\n\n\"So it's something to be proud of, but at the same time, the job's not done,\" Poles said. \"I've talked about it before, on paper - it's on paper. You've got to play and you've got to win games in this league.

Because his moves can control the entire weekend, he feels confident and ready to go. He feels confident that his plan for the draft will be successful. Additionally, he feels good about the path his rebuild is on.\n\nWhile Poles was quiet about his moves, his first one is probably the worst-kept secret in the entire draft. The Bears have two top-ten picks, including the number one overall pick. Poles' pick at number one is all but guaranteed to be USC quarterback Caleb Williams.\n\nPoles wined and dined with Williams before and after USC's Pro Day. He had those dinners with some of Williams' former teammates and current Chicago Bears players. Williams was the only quarterback who went on a Top-30 visit. It is a 99.9 percent sure bet that Williams will be the pick. Either that or Poles is a great troll.\n\nIn his pre-draft press conference, Poles answered the question about his pick at number one. Of course, he kept mum.\n\n\"So unfortunately, it's one of those things I think everyone's got to tune in on Thursday to watch and figure out. But I feel really good about our process and where we are and where we're headed. So we know what we're going to do but everyone is going to have to wait until Thursday.\"\n\nWhile there is little suspense over what Poles does with the number one pick, there is a real mystery over what he does with the ninth pick. He has a ton of options there. It is in a spot where he can still select an elite prospect. On the other hand, he can move up to get an even better prospect, i.e. Marvin Harrison Jr. With just four picks, he could also move down and acquire some more picks.\n\nAssistant General Manager Ian Cunningham echoed that sentiment. He said based on the draft class the team is in a good position.\n\n\"We both feel comfortable with how the board set based off of the draft class. Each year is different, right? We kind of have to work in the constructs of this year with what we have given to us.\"\n\nThere are some who feel that this draft is top heavy except for a couple of positions. This class is loaded with wide receivers, for example. However, if the Bears wanted to make a splash he would do so by moving up for Harrison. There are those who feel Harrison is the best prospect, no matter the position, in this draft.\n\nPoles has put his job on the line for Williams. He will do everything he can to make sure he succeeds. He already revamped the offense. Williams will already enter the best situation for a quarterback selected number one.

They have been primarily connected to wide receivers, offensive linemen and EDGE rushers with that second selection if they keep it.\n\nThe MMQB's Albert Breer reported on Monday opposing teams \"have gotten the sense\" the Bears will attempt to move down to add more picks.\n\nAs things currently stand, Chicago only has four picks in the draft and none until No. 75 after the ninth spot. The reason for the limited pick capital is good because it's been traded to boost the roster.\n\nThe Bears traded their second-round pick to the Washington Commanders for Montez Sweat. They sent their fourth-rounder to the Los Angeles Chargers for Keenan Allen.\n\nBreer did cite a couple of friends of Bears general manager Ryan Poles who said if they don't trade down, they will \"be looking to add talent around Williams.\"\n\nIt's unclear if that means a receiver or offensive lineman.

We'll figure out who comes out of the first-round as a Pro Bowler, as a starter or even a contributor two to three years from now.\n\nThat said, this draft is also one of the deepest drafts in recent memory. At No. 9 overall, if the Bears decide to go with a wide receiver, defensive end, offensive lineman or defensive tackle, there are plenty of players that can make the immediate impact from Day 1.\n\nThe first reason why there's not a real wrong answer is because the Bears have developed a roster for the last two years based on draft picks and key free agent signings.\n\nThe biggest need Bears have to fill is at quarterback, and a generational quarterback prospect is filling that need. If the Bears want an edge rusher, that player would line up opposite Montez Sweat; if the Bears want a receiver, that player will join Keenan Allen and DJ Moore.\n\nIn reality, the Bears might have to decide between their top-rated edge rusher and perhaps the third-best receiver on their board. In that case, it comes down to the pre-draft evaluations general manager Ryan Poles has done and how he stacks different players.\n\n\"We sequence it to kind of sort that part out,\" Poles said. \"You work your stacks vertically and then you work horizontal and you work on the board that way.\"\n\nThe Bears stack players through a myriad of evaluation factors.\n\n\"That'll come down to all the characteristics that we look like, the skillset, the whole person,\" Poles said. \"We have this long process. Ian and I sit down, we actually sequence the board.\"\n\nThis leads to the second reason. Draft day is full of the unexpected. No one knows who's going to go where and when, or which teams will make a gambit to move up and grab a player they want.\n\nSpecifically, the Bears' decision also becomes more convoluted if more than three quarterbacks go off the board in the first round. Should JJ McCarthy go off in the top eight, it means there's another top player that could fall to the Bears.\n\nThe Bears are also in a position to trade back, too.\n\nShould Poles want to grab some more picks, it wouldn't be a bad idea to trade back from No. 9 with a team like the Saints, Raiders or Vikings, all teams that have more pressing needs than the Bears.\n\nTrading down means potentially losing out on a blue-chip player, players that are seen as immediate difference makers, but if Poles sees multiple blue-chip players still on the board and wants to take that risk. Plenty of analysts believe he could do so.\n\nThe one bad decision the Bears could make is if they trade all the way from No. 9 to way outside the top 15. The Bears, who are in a better position than a year ago, are still in need of playmakers. The Bears don't plan on being this high in the draft next year, why pass on a player that's rated high for a reason?", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Poles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Poles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montez_Sweat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montez Sweat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenan_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keenan Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_chip_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blue chip (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Chicago has only two quarterbacks on the current depth chart -- undrafted Tyson Bagent and journeyman backup Brett Rypien -- making the position a massive need.\n\n\"We're proud of where we've come from,\" Poles said. \"It's going to be hard to make this team now.\"\n\nWhen Poles traded the No. 1 pick to the Panthers weeks before the 2023 draft and received a 2024 first-rounder as part of the return package, he said the prevailing thought was to be in position to draft a quarterback should 2021 first-rounder Justin Fields not prove he's worthy of the QB1 role.\n\nLeadership changes in personnel and top coaching spots often drive decisions to move on from quarterbacks drafted by previous regimes.\n\nFields, drafted 11th overall when then-GM Ryan Pace and the Bears moved up from No. 20 in a deal with the New York Giants, was traded to the Steelers last month to be the backup to Russell Wilson in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe new brass has tracked Williams incessantly.\n\nPoles, head coach Matt Eberflus, offensive coordinator Shane Waldron and other members of the organization have spent countless hours to reach this point. The Bears met with Williams at the NFL Scouting Combine -- where Eberflus offers prospects the option of playing darts or putt-putt before the more intensive interview begins -- before his pro day workout (where new Bears wide receiver Keenan Allen made an appearance) and were the only team to host Williams at team headquarters for a \"top 30\" visit.\n\n\"The journey to collect all the information is different for everyone,\" Poles said. \"There's guys on our board that are high that didn't come in for a 30-visit that we've had other touchpoints.

(AP) -- The Chicago Bears know who they're taking with the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft and so does just about everyone else too.\n\nGeneral manager Ryan Poles just wasn't ready to announce it's Caleb Williams on Tuesday. He opted to leave that to commissioner Roger Goodell on Thursday night.\n\n\"So unfortunately it's one of those things I think everyone's got to tune in on Thursday to watch and figure out, but I feel really good about our process and where we are and where we're headed,\" Poles said, smiling. \"So we know what we're going to do but everyone is going to have to wait until Thursday to go there.\"\n\nBarring a massive surprise, the Bears will kick off the draft by grabbing the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner and setting themselves on a course they hope takes them to the top of the NFL. They also have the ninth overall pick as well as a third-rounder (75) and a fourth-rounder (122).\n\nChicago has been the likely landing spot for Williams since he announced in an Instagram post in January that he was leaving USC and turning pro.\n\nThe Bears are in this position thanks to a blockbuster trade last year with Carolina. Chicago sent the No. 1 pick in 2023 to the Panthers for receiver DJ Moore and their first-rounder this year. Carolina finished with a league-worst 2-15 mark.\n\nWilliams checks all the boxes with his arm strength and ability to avoid defenders. He can extend plays and make throws on the run as well as in the pocket -- an area where former starter Justin Fields struggled.\n\nWilliams had 93 touchdowns and 14 interceptions during three seasons at Oklahoma and USC. He threw for 72 TDs and just 10 interceptions in two years with the Trojans. He also showed the ability to run with 27 rushing touchdowns in college.\n\nWilliams followed coach Lincoln Riley from Norman to Los Angeles and won the Heisman in 2022. Williams threw for 4,537 yards, 42 touchdowns and five interceptions to lift USC from four wins in 2021 to 11 and an appearance in the Cotton Bowl.\n\nWilliams put up big numbers again last season while the Trojans struggled to an 8-5 record with one of the nation's worst defenses. He threw for 3,333 yards, 30 touchdowns and five interceptions in 12 games. He did not play in the Holiday Bowl.\n\nThe Bears have been eyeing Williams throughout the draft process. They met with him at the combine and spent a few days with him leading into his pro day in Los Angeles.\n\nWilliams also made a top 30 visit to Halas Hall and got to have dinner with some of the team's players, including linebacker T.J. Edwards.\n\n\"You get to know people and how they fit in the culture and things like that,\" Edwards said. \"At the end of the day once we get people here and once whoever is signed will be here, we'll hit the ground running with that.\"\n\nPoles said the feedback about Williams he got from the players at the dinner was positive.\n\n\"I think it just confirmed a lot of information that we got,\" he said. \"You know, there's a kind of test to where his football understanding is. That part, getting him with some of our players. That's important to us. We're in a really good place with our culture in our locker room. As much as I can I want those guys a part of the process of building this team. I trust their feedback and I think that chemistry is really important so that's why we did that.\"\n\nThe Bears are 10-24 in two seasons under Poles and coach Matt Eberflus. But after going 7-10 last season, they believe they are poised to take another big step.\n\nWilliams would have two star receivers to work with in Moore and the recently acquired Keenan Allen as well as two productive tight ends in Cole Kmet and newcomer Gerald Everett. He has big goals, saying on The Pivot Podcast that he hopes to spend 20 years with one team and chase Tom Brady's record seven Super Bowl wins.\n\n\"I love it,\" Poles said. \"I think we all should have huge goals. We have huge goals here -- win multiple championships. And that's what we shoot for. You're more intentional when you have these goals, you have to live a certain way, you have to practice a certain way, you have to go about your business a certain way in order to accomplish those. If everything else is in line underneath that, that gets me excited.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri":

There's no debate as to why that is: the Bears will be selecting their next franchise quarterback with the first overall pick, and it will be a decision that will be felt for many years to come.\n\nThere will be rampant discussion if Chicago's perceived top choice, Caleb Williams, will be the player that hoists the franchise on his shoulders and carries them to the promised land. There will be similarly fiery conversation of whether trading divisive but unquestionably talented quarterback Justin Fields was the right choice -- a decision that will be scrutinized and discussed more than any other.\n\nThough the Bears' imminent union with Williams casts a long shadow, it's important that we shed light on Chicago's other draft needs. The Bears were within striking distance of a playoff spot in 2023; a dynamic pass rusher or electric receiver from this year's draft could turn the tide their way in 2024.\n\nWith the draft just days away, let's discuss and rank the team's biggest needs.\n\n5. Linebacker\n\nDec 31, 2023; Chicago, Illinois, USA; Chicago Bears linebacker Tremaine Edmunds (49) wraps up Atlanta Falcons running back Bijan Robinson (7) for no gain in the first half at Soldier Field. Mandatory Credit: Jamie Sabau-USA TODAY Sports\n\nSlotting the linebackers as one of the Bears' biggest draft needs may come across as odd. The team boasts an imposing starting unit that features Tremaine Edmunds, T.J. Edwards and Jack Sanborn, after all. The concern begins to sprout as we move past the starting three, as the position is thin on quality players down the depth chart.\n\nSecond-year defender Noah Sewell stands out the most among the backups, but he has very limited NFL experience. Amen Ogbongbemiga has the most experience past the starters but had little production in 15 games played last year with the Chargers, and Micah Baskerville is inexperienced while being more of a project player than Sewell. Chicago has no true 'backers past those three down the depth chart.\n\nLinebacker won't be the focus in the first three to four rounds of the draft, but Poles may very well acquire more selections with the intent of bolstering the position in the later rounds -- or even look to undrafted free agency.\n\n4. Wide receiver\n\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS - DECEMBER 10: DJ Moore #2 of the Chicago Bears catches a touchdown pass during the third quarter in the game against the Detroit Lions at Soldier Field on December 10, 2023 in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Michael Reaves/Getty Images)\n\nI know, I know: we're all infatuated with top talent of the receiver class, such as Washington's Rome Odunze, LSU's Malik Nabers and -- dare I say it -- Ohio State's Marvin Harrison Jr. From a personal standpoint, I would be over the moon if the Bears took an aggressive approach and selected one of these ultra-productive pass catchers with the number nine overall pick. From an objective standpoint, however, Chicago already has a surplus of talent at the position. D.J. Moore, Keenan Allen -- ring a bell, anyone? Two Pro Bowl receivers who have consistently delivered throughout their careers?\n\nThe Bears have more glaring needs that can actively impede their success if they're not attended to. Having a three-headed monster at wide receiver is great, but let's remember this is a team sport. Having such a dangerous pass game doesn't matter if the quarterback doesn't have time to throw or opponents put up 34 points a game because the team can't disrupt the pocket.\n\nGetting a quality receiver for the vacant WR3 spot is important, but Chicago deems it as a lower priority in my book.\n\n3. Offensive guard\n\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS - DECEMBER 10: Teven Jenkins #76 of the Chicago Bears in action against the Detroit Lions at Soldier Field on December 10, 2023 in Chicago, Illinois.

General manager Ryan Poles wasted no time addressing the interior offensive line this offseason, trading this year's fifth-round pick for ultra-solid center Ryan Bates and signing Coleman Shelton to a one-year deal soon after. With both tackles spots solidified and having talented left guard Teven Jenkins fully healthy, that leaves only the right guard position with question marks.\n\nChicago brought in right guard Nate Davis last year with the intent of upgrading the position, but inconsistent play paired with several missed games leaves much to be desired. Versatile lineman Ja'Tyre Carter is the next man up, but he also had an up-and-down 2023. Drafting a high-profile guard in the third or fourth round would do much to propel the offensive line into a much more respectable unit this season.\n\n2.

The Bears had a pass-rushing crisis on their hands through the first half of last year, as opposing quarterbacks had full reign to sit in the pocket all day without even a hint of pressure coming his way. Poles quickly rectified the issue by bringing in immensely talented defensive end Montez Sweat from Washington, who righted a sinking ship of a defensive line and made opponents respect the Bears' rush again.\n\nAs incredible as Sweat is, he's only one person, which means Chicago should be gearing up to take a formidable edge rusher to help in Sweat's effort to get in the backfield. The number nine overall selection should be used to bring in an impact edge rusher, in my estimation. That could also come in the form of an explosive three-technique to power Matt Eberflus' defense.\n\nDefensive end and defensive tackle are two of the few real holes on the team's roster currently. As dazzling as some other positions may seem at number nine overall, Chicago will see more wins in 2024 should they put this concern to bed for good.\n\n1.

Mandatory Credit: Jason Parkhurst-USA TODAY Sports\n\nA shocking revelation, I know. Who would've thought that the team who traded their talented but flawed quarterback this offseason to make room for a generational prospect to line up under center in 2024 would have a quarterback problem? Just because it's obvious doesn't mean it's not the truth, however: Chicago desperately needs a QB in the upcoming draft, and a QB they will undoubtedly take with the number one overall pick.\n\nIf your next question is \"who\", then I can only assume you live in a secluded section of the world that has no access to the internet or TV, because the Bears will select USC phenom Caleb Williams with the top pick. He's essentially a Bear already; his name being called to begin the draft is just a formality.\n\nWhile the quarterback position is technically Chicago's biggest need heading into the 2024 NFL draft, it soon will be one of the Bears' biggest strengths.", "source": {"uri": "bearswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bears Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucas_hunt@bearswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Lucas Hunt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremaine_Edmunds", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tremaine Edmunds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Depth chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amen_Ogbongbemiga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amen Ogbongbemiga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijan_Robinson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bijan Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Poles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Poles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teven_Jenkins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teven Jenkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._J._Moore_(cornerback)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D.

Williams is expected to be taken in the first round of the NFL Draft.\n\nLAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- The Chicago Bears know who they're taking with the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft and so does just about everyone else too.\n\nGeneral manager Ryan Poles just wasn't ready to announce it's Caleb Williams on Tuesday. He opted to leave that to commissioner Roger Goodell on Thursday night.\n\n\"So unfortunately it's one of those things I think everyone's got to tune in on Thursday to watch and figure out, but I feel really good about our process and where we are and where we're headed,\" Poles said, smiling. \"So we know what we're going to do but everyone is going to have to wait until Thursday to go there.\"\n\nBarring a massive surprise, the Bears will kick off the draft by grabbing the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner and setting themselves on a course they hope takes them to the top of the NFL. They also have the ninth overall pick as well as a third-rounder (75) and a fourth-rounder (122).\n\nChicago has been the likely landing spot for Williams since he announced in an Instagram post in January that he was leaving USC and turning pro.\n\nThe Bears are in this position thanks to a blockbuster trade last year with Carolina. Chicago sent the No. 1 pick in 2023 to the Panthers for receiver DJ Moore and their first-rounder this year. Carolina finished with a league-worst 2-15 mark.\n\nWilliams checks all the boxes with his arm strength and ability to avoid defenders. He can extend plays and make throws on the run as well as in the pocket -- an area where former starter Justin Fields struggled.\n\nWilliams had 93 touchdowns and 14 interceptions during three seasons at Oklahoma and USC. He threw for 72 TDs and just 10 interceptions in two years with the Trojans. He also showed the ability to run with 27 rushing touchdowns in college.\n\nWilliams followed coach Lincoln Riley from Norman to Los Angeles and won the Heisman in 2022. Williams threw for 4,537 yards, 42 touchdowns and five interceptions to lift USC from four wins in 2021 to 11 and an appearance in the Cotton Bowl.\n\nWilliams put up big numbers again last season while the Trojans struggled to an 8-5 record with one of the nation's worst defenses. He threw for 3,333 yards, 30 touchdowns and five interceptions in 12 games. He did not play in the Holiday Bowl.\n\nThe Bears have been eyeing Williams throughout the draft process. They met with him at the combine and spent a few days with him leading into his pro day in Los Angeles.\n\nWilliams also made a top 30 visit to Halas Hall and got to have dinner with some of the team's players, including linebacker T.J. Edwards.\n\n\"You get to know people and how they fit in the culture and things like that,\" Edwards said. \"At the end of the day once we get people here and once whoever is signed will be here, we'll hit the ground running with that.\"\n\nPoles said the feedback about Williams he got from the players at the dinner was positive.\n\n\"I think it just confirmed a lot of information that we got,\" he said. \"You know, there's a kind of test to where his football understanding is. That part, getting him with some of our players. That's important to us. We're in a really good place with our culture in our locker room. As much as I can I want those guys a part of the process of building this team. I trust their feedback and I think that chemistry is really important so that's why we did that.\"\n\nThe Bears are 10-24 in two seasons under Poles and coach Matt Eberflus. But after going 7-10 last season, they believe they are poised to take another big step.\n\nWilliams would have two star receivers to work with in Moore and the recently acquired Keenan Allen as well as two productive tight ends in Cole Kmet and newcomer Gerald Everett. He has big goals, saying on The Pivot Podcast that he hopes to spend 20 years with one team and chase Tom Brady's record seven Super Bowl wins.\n\n\"I love it,\" Poles said. \"I think we all should have huge goals. We have huge goals here -- win multiple championships. And that's what we shoot for. You're more intentional when you have these goals, you have to live a certain way, you have to practice a certain way, you have to go about your business a certain way in order to accomplish those. If everything else is in line underneath that, that gets me excited.\"\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"},

By concealing the Bears' plan for the No. 1 overall pick, they won't magically hear better trade offers for the pick.\n\nPoles concurred with this notion on \"The Pat McAfee Show\" when asked if it's disappointing to lose leverage in a draft pick's value because everyone knows what you favor doing with it.\n\n\"When you have pretty good clarity, it really doesn't make a difference.\"\n\nMaybe, because the NFL Draft is a big deal for the teams and the league, too, the league is in Poles' ear telling him not to reveal the Bears' plan to draft Williams. But, according to Poles, that's not the case, either.\n\n\"No one's told me, so it's my personal ordeal. Let's have some excitement for Thursday, right?\"\n\nThe secrecy is this --- it's a major turning point in the organization.\n\nThe Bears have a tortured history of drafting, developing and starting quarterbacks. They've never had a true franchise signal-caller since the Sid Luckman days.\n\nSo, of course, the Bears want to hype up the idea that Williams has the best shot at being the guy who turns the ship around for good. The Bears have probably known it since Day 1 of the offseason. And they certainly knew it on March 16 when they traded Justin Fields to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nBut Poles and the Bears want to savor that moment for the fans, who they know haven't been excited about the Bears since 2018 when they finished 12-4 in the regular season before flopping their first-round game to the Eagles.\n\nThey want Bears fans to relish in the moment when Roger Goodell calls out Williams' name with the first pick, fortifying the next era of the Chicago Bears.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Poles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Poles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Polish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_McAfee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat McAfee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Luckman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sid Luckman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Goodell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Goodell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JgB9TTbjG0szEyVCrbnMeg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02Nzc7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnchicago.com/e5d42dcd1d7cfd9e30b970e948a407ba", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-16", "textStart": 1657, "textEnd": 1665}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

But there's much more to it than that. And that's why the Bears' general manager gets paid the big bucks.\n\nIt's Poles' job to know what it is that makes Caleb Williams' tick. Does he have the \"it\" factor that makes everyone around him better and tilts the field in his favor in crunch time? Does he instill confidence in his teammates and put fear into a defense in game-deciding moments? A good quarterback can make a good team better, but a great quarterback can put a good team on his shoulders and take it over the top.\n\nYou can already tell that Poles feels he has found something special in Williams. At his season-ending press conference in January, he promised \"to turn over every stone to make sure that we are going to make a sound decision for our organization\" to decide whether to keep Justin Fields or draft quarterback with the No. 1 overall pick. He turned over the first stone and was all but done.\n\nCaleb Williams changed everything for Poles. After trading the No. 1 overall pick prior to free agency last season, he was expecting a much longer process this time with the potential for an historic haul for the No. 1 pick.\n\n\"In my mind right now, I'm gonna take this all the way to April,\" he said on Jan. 10.\n\nBy March 16, after the NFL Combine but before Williams' pro day at USC, Fields was traded to the Steelers for a conditional sixth-round draft pick. Poles had seen -- and heard -- enough to know he had found his quarterback.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Poles' intuition is right. Williams has to be more than an upgrade over Fields. He has to do more than just step over the low bar of Bears quarterback performance over the last 30-plus seasons. He has to be \"the guy.\" He has to win playoff games. He has to be a difference-maker. He has to give the Bears something they haven't had since Jim McMahon was healthy, and Sid Luckman before that.\n\nBut Poles has earned the faith of Bears fans. He put himself in this fortuitous position when he traded the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 draft to the Panthers for a package that included wide receiver DJ Moore and the Panthers 2024 No. 1 pick that turned into gold.\n\nAnd Poles was the Chiefs' director of college scouting when they saw something special in Patrick Mahomes, who was 13-16 as a starter at Texas Tech, but has been the epitome of the it-factor quarterback who wills his team to victory in the biggest moments. Not everybody saw that coming.\n\nMahomes' success has been so spectacular -- three Super Bowl victories in the last five seasons -- any comparison to him is unfair. But there's no doubt that Poles feels he has a quarterback with that makeup. He sees the best in everything he does, from his lowest moment to his over-the-top bravado.\n\nAsked about Williams indicating on social media a goal of winning eight Super Bowls to break Tom Brady's record, Poles embraced it as a sign of driven competitor rather than suggest Williams should slow his roll.\n\n\"I love it,\" Poles said. \"You're more intentional when you have these goals -- you have to live a certain way. You have to practice a certain way. You have to go about your business a certain way in order to accomplish those. If everything else is in line underneath that, that gets me excited.\"\n\nAs we know by now, the unflappable, measured Poles is not the excitable type. But like every other talent evaluator, he thinks he knows special when he sees it.

While Chicago only has four selections in this draft, Poles said he doesn't feel the need to trade back and accumulate more. It certainly helps that two of those four picks are inside the top 10, including first and ninth overall.\n\nThe Bears have some needs to address on the roster, namely quarterback (hello, Caleb Williams) and pass rusher, and they could add more weapons or pass protection for their incoming rookie QB.\n\nStill, there are some scenarios that we'd like to see play out for Chicago this weekend. So we're imagining what a perfect draft would look like for the Bears.\n\nDraft Caleb Williams at No. 1\n\nApr 24, 2024; Detroit, MI, USA; Southern California Trojans quarterback Caleb Williams reacts at the Play Football Prospect Clinic at The Corner Ballpark. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThis is all but official. The Bears will make Caleb Williams the first overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft, and fans won't have to wait any longer to welcome the former Heisman-winning QB to the fold. Chicago hasn't made any attempt to hide their intentions about drafting Williams. They've spent extensive time with him this offseason -- both during his pro day and Top 30 visit, where Bears brass and players have had an opportunity to start building that foundation. Williams has also already been throwing with his two wideouts DJ Moore and Keenan Allen. We could really stop after this. Adding Williams already makes this a perfect draft.\n\nLand a top three wide receiver\n\nNov 11, 2023; Seattle, Washington, USA; Washington Huskies wide receiver Rome Odunze (1) celebrates scoring a touchdown against the Utah Utes during the second half at Alaska Airlines Field at Husky Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Steven Bisig-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Bears have done everything to make this an ideal landing spot for Williams as a rookie, so why would they stop now. Ideally, one of the \"big three\" wide receivers -- Marvin Harrison Jr., Malik Nabers and Rome Odunze -- will fall to Chicago at No. 9. With all of the chaos set to ensue after the Bears' first selection -- including teams looking to trade up for a quarterback -- it's definitely a possibility, although it would most likely be Odunze than Harrison or Nabers. Which wouldn't be a bad thing considering Williams and Odunze are already buddies. Not only did they travel to Detroit together for the draft, but Odunze was catching passes from Williams just last week, a workout that also included Bears wideouts DJ Moore and Keenan Allen.\n\nAdd a disruptive three-technique\n\nNov 18, 2023; Ames, Iowa, USA; Texas Longhorns defensive lineman Byron Murphy II (90) celebrates sacking the Iowa State Cyclones quarterback during the game at Jack Trice Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Aaron E. Martinez-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIf a top receiver isn't available -- or the Bears opt to pass on one -- it wouldn't be disappointing to see them target one of the top defensive players in the draft. During his pre-draft press conference, Poles said an interior pass rusher is \"probably a preference when you have an outside guy.\" And we know the Bears already have that guy in Sweat. So could we see Chicago target Texas defensive tackle Byron Murphy II at No. 9? He'd be a great fit as an explosive three-technique that this defensive line is currently missing. Illinois' Johnny Newton is certainly an option, as well, especially if the Bears elected to trade back and still target a top defensive lineman.\n\nAdd a productive edge rusher\n\nDec 2, 2023; Atlanta, GA, USA; Alabama Crimson Tide linebacker Dallas Turner (15) celebrates after a sack in the second quarter against the Georgia Bulldogs in the SEC Championship at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Mandatory Credit: John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIt certainly feels like pass rusher will be the pick at No. 9, if not wide receiver. And, depending on how the draft board falls, Chicago could very well be sitting there with the option to take their choice of defender. When looking at this defense, the only pressing need is pass rusher. The Bears are looking for a complement to star Montez Sweat, who was acquired via trade last year. This isn't a particularly deep edge rusher class, but there are three top options who could very well all be on the board come ninth overall: Dallas Turner, Jared Verse and Laiatu Latu. Considering Sweat and DeMarcus Walker are the only options off the edge right now, it wouldn't be a surprise to see Chicago make a move to add off the edge -- be it at No. 9 or in a trade back scenario.\n\nShore up pass protection\n\nEVANSTON, ILLINOIS - SEPTEMBER 30: Olumuyiwa Fashanu #74 of the Penn State Nittany Lions in action against the Northwestern Wildcats during the second half at Ryan Field on September 30, 2023 in Evanston, Illinois. (Photo by Michael Reaves/Getty Images)\n\nThe overwhelming consensus among fans and analysts appears to be the Bears targeting wide receiver or pass rusher with the No. 9 pick. But offensive tackle is certainly in play here. While Braxton Jones has been solid as a two-year starter at left tackle, we know Poles is always looking to upgrade and add competition. And this is a deep tackle group, as he's pointed out before. While Joe Alt figures to be off the board by ninth overall, one name to keep an eye on is Olu Fashanu, who was Williams' high school teammate at Gonzaga College High School in Washington, D.C. If Chicago can't land a playmaking receiver, shoring up pass protection -- with someone Williams said \"put his life on the line protecting me\" -- would be a great move.", "source": {"uri":

This may be the most impactful draft in Chicago Bears' history. General Manager Ryan Poles has some big decisions to make. While the number one pick is all but official to be Caleb Williams, what happens at nine is still a mystery.\n\nPoles has a lot of options at nine. Poles can use the pick, or he can move up to select an even better prospect or down to acquire a few more picks. With only four picks, Poles may want to acquire more to fill more holes.\n\nPoles has done an incredible job of revamping the offense. He added some firepower, bringing in running back D'Andre Swift, offensive linemen Ryan Bates, Coleman Shelton, Matt Pryor, and tight end Gerald Everett.\n\nThe cherry on top for Poles and the Chicago Bears was the acquisition of six-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Keenan Allen. Allen and D.J. Moore look to be one of the best wide receiver duos in the league. They combined for 2,607 receiving yards and 15 touchdowns.\n\nWilliams will come into an offense with plenty of weapons and an improved offensive line. He will have the best situation any quarterback chosen number one has ever had.\n\nAs mentioned, the Bears have a few holes to fill on the roster. Most notably, they need an edge rusher to complement Montez Sweat. They also have a need at defensive tackle. Do they feel comfortable with having second-year player Gervon Dexter as the starter, or do they get someone who can compete with him for the starting job?\n\nWhile those are valid needs, perhaps they can find players later in the draft. Poles has done a great job of improving the offense. he needs to continue that job so it carries over to multiple seasons.\n\nWhile adding Allen was a coup for Poles, there are concerns. He will be 32 this season. In addition, he is in the final year of his contract. He isn't in the Chicago Bears' long-term plans.\n\nThe Bears will need a young wide receiver who can start as WR3. Then, if Allen is just a one-year rental, that youngster can step up and be a great complement to Moore.\n\nPoles does wants to give Williams great tools for his rookie season and beyond. This is why he needs to add another receiver to target. Imagine if the stars align and he picks up Ohio State's Marvin Harrison Jr. They would have a generational talent at both quarterback and wide receiver.\n\nPoles would likely have to move up to get Harrison. However, he could stay pat and still have Rome Odunze from Washington available. In any other draft, Odunze would be the first wide receiver taken. With Harrison and LSU's Malik Nabers, however, many have Odunze WR3.\n\nHaving Williams grow and develop with Harrison or Odunze would help him greatly. There is nothing like the QB/WR relationship. Either one can make the other look better.\n\nFurthermore, having another receiver who can step up and make plays makes the Chicago Bears a more desirable place to play. That could be important when Moore's contract comes to an end. If he plays great alongside another great receiver, he will be more likely to return and continue the success.\n\nIt will be an interesting decision for Poles and the Chicago Bears. Whatever happens, there will be a lot more excitement surrounding the team. That is something we have not seen for quite a while.", "source": {"uri": "fullpresscoverage.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Full Press Coverage"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carlos_nazario@fullpresscoverage.com", "name": "Carlos Nazario", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Polish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Poles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Poles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Bates", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Bates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D'Andre_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "D'Andre Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Everett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gerald Everett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenan_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keenan Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gervon_Dexter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gervon Dexter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._J._Moore_(cornerback)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D.

He opted to leave that to commissioner Roger Goodell on Thursday night.\"So unfortunately it's one of those things I think everyone's got to tune in on Thursday to watch and figure out, but I feel really good about our process and where we are and where we're headed,\" Poles said, smiling. \"So we know what we're going to do but everyone is going to have to wait until Thursday to go there.\"Barring a massive surprise, the Bears will kick off the draft by grabbing the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner and setting themselves on a course they hope takes them to the top of the NFL. They also have the ninth overall pick as well as a third-rounder (75) and a fourth-rounder (122).Chicago has been the likely landing spot for Williams since he announced in an Instagram post in January that he was leaving USC and turning pro.The Bears are in this position thanks to a blockbuster trade last year with Carolina. Chicago sent the No. 1 pick in 2023 to the Panthers for receiver DJ Moore and their first-rounder this year. Carolina finished with a league-worst 2-15 mark.Williams checks all the boxes with his arm strength and ability to avoid defenders. He can extend plays and make throws on the run as well as in the pocket -- an area where former starter Justin Fields struggled.Southern California quarterback Caleb Williams speaks during a press conference at the NFL football scouting combine in Indianapolis, Friday, March 1, 2024. Williams is expected to be taken in the first round of the NFL Draft. Credit: AP/Michael ConroyWilliams had 93 touchdowns and 14 interceptions during three seasons at Oklahoma and USC. He threw for 72 TDs and just 10 interceptions in two years with the Trojans. He also showed the ability to run with 27 rushing touchdowns in college.Williams followed coach Lincoln Riley from Norman to Los Angeles and won the Heisman in 2022. Williams threw for 4,537 yards, 42 touchdowns and five interceptions to lift USC from four wins in 2021 to 11 and an appearance in the Cotton Bowl.Williams put up big numbers again last season while the Trojans struggled to an 8-5 record with one of the nation's worst defenses. He threw for 3,333 yards, 30 touchdowns and five interceptions in 12 games. He did not play in the Holiday Bowl.The Bears have been eyeing Williams throughout the draft process. They met with him at the combine and spent a few days with him leading into his pro day in Los Angeles.Williams also made a top 30 visit to Halas Hall and got to have dinner with some of the team's players, including linebacker T.J. Edwards.\"You get to know people and how they fit in the culture and things like that,\" Edwards said. \"At the end of the day once we get people here and once whoever is signed will be here, we'll hit the ground running with that.\"Poles said the feedback about Williams he got from the players at the dinner was positive.\"I think it just confirmed a lot of information that we got,\" he said. \"You know, there's a kind of test to where his football understanding is. That part, getting him with some of our players. That's important to us. We're in a really good place with our culture in our locker room. As much as I can I want those guys a part of the process of building this team. I trust their feedback and I think that chemistry is really important so that's why we did that.\"The Bears are 10-24 in two seasons under Poles and coach Matt Eberflus. But after going 7-10 last season, they believe they are poised to take another big step.Williams would have two star receivers to work with in Moore and the recently acquired Keenan Allen as well as two productive tight ends in Cole Kmet and newcomer Gerald Everett. He has big goals, saying on The Pivot Podcast that he hopes to spend 20 years with one team and chase Tom Brady's record seven Super Bowl wins.\"I love it,\" Poles said. \"I think we all should have huge goals. We have huge goals here -- win multiple championships. And that's what we shoot for. You're more intentional when you have these goals, you have to live a certain way, you have to practice a certain way, you have to go about your business a certain way in order to accomplish those. If everything else is in line underneath that, that gets me excited.\"\n\nSource link", "source": {"uri": "sportal.co.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportal - World Sports News - Live Scores"},

Or the organization can get flagged for a false start yet again.\n\nLet's face it, a year ago, the team was excited to build around Justin Fields and build a stadium in Arlington Heights.\n\nNow, in a span of 30 hours, the Bears announced plans to build a new lakefront stadium that will include a price tag of over $4 billion and then will draft the much hyped quarterback Caleb Williams.\n\nIt's easy to be skeptical when it comes to this team based on history. But I can tell you they are operating differently in both processes and gone are the days of doing business of a ma and pop shop.\n\nRyan Poles and Kevin Warren have both done this before.\n\nOn the football side of things, in 2017 when the other Ryan, Ryan Pace, decided to draft Mitch Truibisky with the second overall pick, he kept the entire building in the dark. Pace never even told his head coach he was drafting Trubisky. It was doomed to fail from the start.\n\nPoles was on the other side of history, as he was a part of the Chiefs organization when they traded up for Patrick Mahomes in that same draft. Poles learned to maneuver from Andy Reid and Brett Veach.\n\nNo promises that Williams will be Mahomes or close to that, though I believe he'll at least be an upper-tier QB and break every Bears passing record. And like the Chiefs did in Kansas City, Poles did everything possible to learn as much possible about his future quarterback involving everyone.\n\n* Poles dispatched his scouts and had them interview anyone who played with Williams at Oklahoma or USC to get their opinion on the QB.\n\n* Poles and Eberflus interviewed Kliff Kingsbury for their offensive coordinators vacancy. Even if Kingsbury wasn't going to get the job, they were able to get detailed info on Williams as Kingsbury worked at USC this past year.\n\n* Poles included his coaching staff including new offensive coordinator Shane Waldron in the decision process.\n\n* Poles and his staff got to know Williams off the field and even included current players during a recent dinner at Sofia Steak in Lake Forest.\n\nIf Williams fails like past Bears quarterbacks, it won't be because of the process. Poles gave Justin Fields another full year for evaluation, traded him to the team of his choice, did his due diligence with Williams, and has surrounded Williams with a good offense.\n\nI know you have been burned before Bears fans, but it's time to mend your broken QB heart and fall in love again. It's the only way to go.\n\nThe stadium is a different story.\n\nNobody is asking for $2 billion from the public to root for the quarterback.\n\nOn paper Warren is following his old playbook from when he was with the Vikings. Minnesota had a deal to build in the suburbs, then did a 180 and returned downtown to build the glorious US Bank Stadium. It's truly one of the nicest buildings in the NFL.\n\nAnd my goodness, do those rendering on the lakefront look awesome. Though I've never seen a bad stadium rendering.\n\nProblem is, this stadium process has resembled more of the Pace path.\n\nBuy land in Arlington Heights for $200 million with a team president you know will be retiring soon, spend more money on demolition of a beautiful racetrack, hire a new president, ditch the suburban plan, re-engage with Chicago, start a new fight with \"Friends of the Park,\" and hope you can secure over $2 billion in funds from the state.\n\nWhile Warren has been there and done that, this isn't exactly how you draw it up.\n\nEven if the Bears do get what they want, how long will this fight take? Where will fans park during construction of the new stadium while the Bears play at Soldier Field. Where are the tailgate spots for fans when construction is completed? And for all that money, are the Bears really solving traffic issues on game days? The lake is still to east and the train tracks to the west.\n\nJust like with projecting a quarterback, there's no telling how this will work out for certain. But long gone are the days Daniel Burnham and his \"make no little plans.\" The Bears and White Sox are asking for public money at the same time.\n\nThe Soldier Field rebuild lasted 20 whole years before wanting something new. Guaranteed Rate lasted 33 years and that doesn't count how it needed immediate renovations. The Bears must make sure this is done right before asking the fans for new PSL money.\n\nThe good news is, what's happening on the Bears' current field, is much more focused and the outlook is sharp.\n\nEnjoy draft night, Bears fans.\n\nIt should be the last big draft party we have for a while. Playoff parties will be in our future.", "source": {"uri": "dailyherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Any big surprise in store? Best pick of the last decade?", "body": "NFL draft week is finally here, and the Chicago Bears -- with two picks in the top nine -- will be at the center of attention Thursday night.\n\nBefore general manager Ryan Poles (almost certainly) chooses USC quarterback Caleb Williams at No. 1 shortly after 7 p.m. Thursday, the Tribune's Brad Biggs answers one more round of readers' draft questions in the weekly Bears mailbag.\n\nIs the wide receiver class in this draft deep enough to not care about getting one at No. 9? With only four picks and still several roster holes, wouldn't it be smart to trade down and fill those holes as the draft comes? Could you see the Bears trading back multiple times throughout the draft? -- @monturnerx\n\nI don't see as many holes as you perhaps do. Could the Bears use an edge rusher opposite Montez Sweat? Yes. Is it a glaring hole? Not like it was a year ago. Could they use an offensive tackle? Yes, if they have a high grade on one and aren't keen on left tackle Braxton Jones' developmental curve, it would make plenty of sense. Can they use a wide receiver? No question. They're a little thin after DJ Moore and Keenan Allen, and Allen is entering a contract year. Could they use a penetrating defensive tackle? No question.\n\nMost of these probably fall between what you would call a need and a want, and teams need to closely determine where they are before the draft. That's why general manager Ryan Poles was able to say with confidence that he has flexibility in reacting to what happens Thursday night in the first eight picks.\n\nI think there's a bit of a gap between the first three receivers -- Marvin Harrison Jr., Malik Nabers and Rome Odunze (put them in any order you like) -- and the rest of the class. So getting a top-three receiver considering Allen's age (32 on Saturday) and contract situation makes a lot of sense. Without a lot of picks, it's hard to say where the Bears could target another receiver.\n\nI wouldn't rule out a trade down. If the Bears do go that route, it opens the possibility they could draft a center (another position that sits between need and want after the acquisition of Ryan Bates and Coleman Shelton). But I don't think we'll see the Bears trade down time and time again to fill out a draft class. They're not at that point right now in team building where they need to fill depth. They need elite talent.\n\n\"Things shift and change as you go along,\" Poles said Tuesday. \"It's going to be hard to make this team now. It's going to be really hard to make this team. That doesn't mean you don't want more shots later. We'll always welcome a lot of picks. But it doesn't force you to panic about the situation we're in right now with how many picks we have. So it fits our roster but it also fits what we just talked about -- the current status of this draft and then moving forward what next year looks like as well.\"\n\nIs there any outcome of the draft that would be truly disappointing? Assuming Caleb Williams goes No. 1, what positional selection would make you scratch your head? -- @noahlaporte\n\nI don't know that there is one because when you look at how the board could shake out, there will be some top options at a handful of positions that make perfect sense for the Bears. That's one reason Ryan Poles and assistant GM Ian Cunningham were able to project so much confidence Tuesday when they discussed the draft without saying much of anything about their plans.\n\nDepending on how things go -- and I'm talking primarily about how many quarterbacks come off the board in the top eight picks after Caleb Williams goes No. 1 -- the Bears will have multiple options and all of them can be deemed good ones. They can sell almost any outcome here and walk away feeling confident they made moves to position themselves as a challenger in the NFC North. I really don't see a wild-card outcome that would be a head scratcher and have social media and sports-talk airwaves demanding explanations.\n\nMy guess right now is the Bears might be focusing on Washington wide receiver Rome Odunze and Texas defensive tackle Byron Murphy II if they stay at No. 9. There's a good chance one of them is available, and both could be on the board when the Bears go on the clock. Neither of those moves would be a head scratcher, and you also could make a good argument to draft an edge rusher or an offensive tackle. Heck, you could talk me into Georgia tight end Brock Bowers, too, and that possibility shouldn't be discounted even though the Bears have Cole Kmet and Gerald Everett. It will be fascinating. I can almost promise that.\n\nWhat would really surprise you on Thursday night? -- Paul P., Chicago\n\nThat's pretty open-ended. I'll share a really interesting one floating around that I heard from a team Tuesday morning. How about the Minnesota Vikings -- who own two first-round picks and are believed to be lurking for a possible trade up to nab one of the top quarterbacks -- dealing both of those picks and more to acquire Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert? In that scenario, the Chargers would select Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy with the fifth pick.\n\nCrazy? I think so. I can't imagine why the Chargers would want to deal Herbert, an elite quarterback who only needs more talent around him. That would constitute a bombshell Thursday night and would really energize the NFC North if the Vikings were able to solve their QB dilemma with a player of Herbert's caliber. Buckle up.\n\nHere's a question I'm surprised hasn't been addressed yet: What assurances does Caleb Williams have that he's not going to endure what his past two predecessors did -- get drafted by a head coach who gets fired after the first season? My hope was that they would have fired Matt Eberflus, hired a new coach and traded Justin Fields so it would be a clean slate. Or if they kept Eberflus, give some guarantee of at least two years so the rookie QB gets at least two seasons under the same head coach. -- Brien B., Omaha, Neb.\n\nThe only assurance Williams will receive is the fully guaranteed, four-year contract for the No. 1 pick that should be worth about $38.5 million. Draft picks don't get any promises in regard to what might happen with coaches, staff members, teammates, whatever.\n\nWe've been over this issue but it's been a few months. This was a hot topic back in January, and what's noteworthy is the Bears didn't rush into anything. As you recall, they met for a couple of days at the end of the season before deciding who would return and who wouldn't. It would not have been surprising if they had opted for an offensive-minded head coach, but Ryan Poles liked the way Eberflus kept the team together after a miserable start last season and how the defense got progressively better as the year went on. There was growth and development by younger players.\n\nWill there be pressure on Eberflus and his staff entering this season? Sure. There isn't a gig in the NFL that doesn't come with pressure. I'd also point out the overwhelming majority of questions regarding firings overlook the reality that it's really hard to get the next hire right. That's why we see the carousel for head coaches, coordinators and position coaches spinning annually.\n\nIn Drew Brees' prime, announcers harped on about how the Saints prioritized the interior of their offensive line due to Brees' height. If that was legitimately true (and not a talking point to fill time), should the Bears prioritize trading back for the great G/C prospects to offset Caleb Williams' height? -- Ryan W.\n\nThat's a good question because, according to the combine measurements, Williams is only one-eighth of an inch taller than the 6-1 Brees was when he came out of Purdue. However, you should consider that we're talking about different players. Brees was short for the position and was not particularly mobile. Williams is just a shade taller but he's able to reset in the pocket, elude rushers, create plays on the move and, when needed, tuck the ball and run. Because they are different athletically, I don't think you can just look at measurements and apply the same thinking.\n\nYou're right that the Saints put an emphasis on being strong from guard to guard to allow Brees to find throwing windows. That's something former Bears offensive coordinator Aaron Kromer talked about when he came from New Orleans. It was an interesting strategy and the Saints did a nice job of it, but it's not like that initiative came at the expense of locating high-caliber tackles. You still have to be elite on the edges.\n\nThe Bears have done some work on offensive linemen who are unlikely to be in play at No. 9, and one who jumps out is West Virginia center Zach Frazier. He might be the best at the position in this class and is probably a late first-round pick or early Day 2 selection. So I'd imagine he's in discussions in scenarios where the team trades the ninth pick Thursday.\n\nWhat has been the best Bears' draft pick over the last decade? -- Dylan J., Peoria\n\nThat's another open-ended question and you could make a good case for a handful of players. Cornerback Tyrique Stevenson has a chance to be a really impactful player as a second-round pick a year ago, but it's too early to tell what his career arc will look like. Cornerback Jaylon Johnson, a second-round pick in 2020, belongs in this conversation. Free safety Eddie Jackson was a fourth-round selection in 2017 and had a really strong career for the Bears.\n\nIf I had to pick one right now, I'd probably go with recently retired left tackle Charles Leno, a seventh-round pick by GM Phil Emery in 2014. The 246th pick that year, Leno made 141 career starts and 94 were with the Bears. He was added to the Pro Bowl roster in 2018, and while Leno was never an elite talent, the Bears got solid play out of him for a long time without ever having to pay him top money at the position.\n\nWhat's absent is a lot of picks at the top of the draft where you look back and say, \"That was a home run.\" Linebacker Roquan Smith, the eighth pick in 2018, remains fantastic. You should get that with some kind of regularity when you're picking that high. That's why it's imperative the Bears come out of this draft with a special talent at No. 9 or after a slight trade down.\n\nIf the Bears draft one of the top three receivers, could three alpha receivers be content with a rookie quarterback? -- Bobby D., Arizona\n\nFair question. My first reaction is it's not about the experience of the quarterback but the performance. If a 10-year veteran is stinking it up, things won't be peachy for three alpha receivers just because the quarterback has some experience.\n\nDJ Moore proved to be a total pro last season, especially at the beginning of the year when he inexplicably wasn't getting the ball. He didn't have any history I'm aware of for complaining about subpar QB play when he was with the Carolina Panthers, and there was a lot of that going on. Keenan Allen is entering a contract year so I doubt he's going to create waves, but I don't have any insight into his locker-room demeanor. A rookie needs to find his way. I don't believe this would be a concern for Ryan Poles if he uses the ninth pick on a wide receiver.\n\nIn fact, I'd probably flip this around and turn it into a positive. What better situation for a rookie quarterback? Moore, Allen and a top-three receiver in this draft class would put a rookie quarterback in a tremendous position to learn and succeed.\n\nThere have been numerous scenarios for what the Bears will do with their ninth pick. Rarely, if ever, do I see a scenario similar to what worked so well for them last year: receiving a player (DJ Moore) as part of a draft trade. Any chance the Bears might find a draft partner several selections down who might be willing to part with a talented player at a key position -- perhaps from a cap-strapped team -- to move up in the draft? If so, what might such a scenario look like? -- Jim A., Plymouth, Minn.\n\nIn your scenario, which I believe is highly unlikely, you trade the uncertainty of how a draft pick will develop and perform in return for a player with a high salary-cap number. Keep making moves like this (trading for Moore, trading for Montez Sweat, trading for a player in your scenario, spending in free agency) and you're going to run into cap issues and before long have an aging roster. The Bears need to trust in their scouting department, believe in their player development program and select a rookie who can flourish for them while benefiting from a cost-controlled four-year contract that will include a fifth-year option.\n\nWhen does DJ Moore get a contract extension? And do you think Keenan Allen gets an extension before the season? -- rtindenverco\n\nRelated Articles\n\nThat's hard to forecast and the team will keep any contract talks super buttoned up. It was pretty clear the Bears' first priority last offseason was getting a new deal done with tight end Cole Kmet, and that process stretched out over a few months. Attention has rightfully been on free agency and the draft, and there's no rush to get something done with Moore, who has two years remaining on the contract the Bears inherited when they acquired him in a trade from the Carolina Panthers. My guess -- and this is just a hunch -- is that topic could be introduced later this spring or this summer. Does that mean something will get done? I have no guess on that. It takes two sides to hammer out a deal and you never know how things will go.\n\nAs far as Allen, the Bears picked up a player with an outstanding track record who is coming off an elite season. That being said, I don't understand why there would be any urgency to consider a new contract for him at this point. Allen turns 32 on Saturday and will be entering his 12th NFL season. He did not slow down in 2023 but he will before long. I wouldn't rule out Allen being with the Bears beyond this season, but we have to see if they draft a wide receiver in Round 1 and how Allen plays this season. Allen might not be in a rush either.\n\nRyan Poles and the front office could feel differently, but as methodical as the Bears have been with some of their cash/cap decisions, you have to expect they would carefully weigh a big investment in a player of Allen's age and experience, especially when they're going to be paying Moore a lot.\n\nThere are so many mock drafts on the sports websites, newspapers, podcasts, etc., and each seem to stretch credulity to get clicks. Aside from the Bears not taking Caleb Williams, what's the silliest mock draft selection you've seen this year? -- @caljestice\n\nIt will be easy to call them all silly by the time the dust settles Thursday night and Round 1 is in the books. An incredible mock draft will nail five or six picks. Between the unpredictability of trades and not fully knowing how teams weigh the character of individual prospects or how they delineate between needs/wants and draft grades, it's a crap shoot. Throw in medical information and, well, we're all guessing.\n\nThe most amusing stuff I saw this year was silly-season mocks by wishcasters in which the Bears opted to build around Justin Fields with their draft capital. Here's another chance for you to mock my final mock draft.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brad_biggs@sports.yahoo.com",

Most of the chatter in the draft has revolved around what the next few teams in line will do with their respective selections, but it appears that the Bears may not be one hundred percent on selecting Williams as their man to replace Justin Fields, who was traded in the offseason after an up and down stint in Chicago.\n\nRecently, former NFL player and current Bears general manager Ryan Poles broke down his thought process heading into the draft, and didn't provide a whole lot of insight as to whether Williams is indeed in Chicago's sights.\n\n\"We know what we're gonna do, but everyone's gonna have to wait until Thursday,\" said Poles, per Stacey Dales of the NFL Network on X, the social media platform formerly referred to as Twitter.\n\nThe quarterback position for the Bears became vacant when Poles and the rest of the Chicago brass opted to trade former starter Justin Fields to the Pittsburgh Steelers in exchange for some (shockingly low) draft compensation. Fields had an up and down stint in Chicago, struggling to stay healthy and times and showing flashes of the tools that made him a top pick in the 2021 Draft but also not fully being able to put everything together. He is widely expected to back up Wilson in Pittsburgh.\n\nIt's likely that if he was eligible to enter the draft a year ago, that Caleb Williams would have been the number one overall pick in 2023. The Heisman Trophy winner began his college career in Oklahoma and then followed head coach Lincoln Riley after he abandoned that university in favor of the sunny skies of Southern California, taking over as the new head coach/quarterback duo for USC.\n\nThere, Williams dazzled NFL scouts with his impressive combination of speed, accuracy, arm strength, and IQ of the game, all of which led him to be billed as one of the most highly touted quarterback prospects in years.\n\nThere has been little doubt both throughout the college football 2023 season and this current NFL offseason as to who the Bears would select with their number one overall pick. For a time, there was speculation that Chicago might opt to keep Fields and trade their number one pick, but that obviously went out the window once Fields was sent to Pittsburgh.\n\nIn any case, the Bears have already made some additions to help Williams out upon his presumptive arrival, including most notably the signing of former Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Keenan Allen, helping bolster a receiver core that wasn't exactly otherworldly this past season.\n\nThe NFL Draft is slated to take place on Thursday evening.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jackson_stone@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jackson Stone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Dales", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stacey Dales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lincoln Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenan_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keenan Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Sooners_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma Sooners football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Ryan-Poles-refuses-to-declare-Caleb-Williams-1st-overall-pick-before-NFL-Draft.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

So we know what we're going to do but everyone is going to have to wait until Thursday.\"\n\nWilliams has been atop the Bears' draft board since the start of the pre-draft process. The Bears had a brief meeting with Williams at the combine, spent two days with him ahead of his pro day in Los Angeles, and then hosted him on a top-30 visit to Halas Hall.\n\nThat 30 visit included a dinner with several team veterans, including wide receiver DJ Moore, linebacker T.J. Edwards, and tight end Cole Kmet.\n\n\"Really intelligent guy. Came across as a really good teammate, easy to talk to, down to earth,\" Poles said when asked about the feedback he got from veterans about Williams. \"We've talked through this process about the whole Hollywood thing. He's all ball, wants to work, wants to get better, wants to win as a team. That's the No. 1 thing for him on top of being successful. I think the biggest thing is: Does he fit in our culture and what we're trying to do. And all signs were that he does, so that was positive.\"\n\nWilliams has checked every box for the Bears during the pre-draft process.\n\nThe initial meeting at the combine was all about football. The Bears used a multiple-day visit to Los Angeles to test Williams' football knowledge and see his interactions and relationships with his USC teammates during a pre-Pro-Day dinner.\n\nThe 30 visit was merely the final piece of a puzzle. It was important for Poles to involve key veteran players in the final evaluation of Williams.\n\n\"I think it just confirmed a lot of information that we got,\" Poles said of the 30 visit. \"You know, there's a kind of test to where his football understanding is. That part, getting him with some of our players. That's important to us. We're in a really good place with our culture in our locker room. As much as I can I want those guys a part of the process of building this team. I trust their feedback, and I think that chemistry is really important, so that's why we did that.\"\n\nThe Bears will make Williams the No. 1 overall pick on Thursday, and then a new era of Bears football will begin.\n\nPoles and his staff have flipped the roster over in two years and assembled a team that should compete for a playoff spot in 2024.\n\nThe excitement is overflowing at Halas Hall. But the draft-week celebration will be short-lived. Then, the real work begins.\n\n\"So it's something to be proud of, but at the same time, the job's not done,\" Poles said. \"I've talked about it before, on paper - it's on paper.

But the No. 9 selection offers more intrigue and speculation -- and it could very well depend on how the board falls early Thursday night.\n\nAccording to CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones, the belief is the Bears will target pass rusher or wide receiver with the ninth overall selection -- with the caveat that it's always possible they trade back.\n\nWhile the Bears already have a dynamic receiver duo with DJ Moore and Keenan Allen, it's never a bad thing to add more weapons for your young quarterback. Especially given Allen is only locked in for this year before Chicago has to decide whether to extend him.\n\nAdding someone like Rome Odunze or Malik Nabers to this receiver room would give them one of the best groups in the NFL.\n\nI could see Chicago taking a receiver at No. 9 to prove to Williams and the rest of the league how serious the Bears are about this offense. Remember, they locked up offensive coordinator Shane Waldron with lightning speed in the offseason.\n\nOn the other hand, edge rusher is one of the team's biggest needs heading into the draft. While the Bears acquired stud Montez Sweat last year, they're missing a true complement opposite him.\n\nThere's a good chance Chicago will be in a position to land their pick of edge rusher at ninth overall, be it Dallas Turner, Jared Verse or Laiatu Latu. But that could also mean someone like Byron Murphy II is on the table as arguably the best interior pass rusher in this draft.\n\nOther sources have pointed out the Bears could use the pick on a pass rusher to take some pressure off Montez Sweat. It's a good idea, and it makes roster-composition sense. But the Bears sent a second-round pick to Washington for Sweat (and then paid him) because they didn't anticipate strong options in free agency or the draft this year.\n\nGeneral manager Ryan Poles said he's comfortable with just four draft picks this year, which makes sense given what they've added in exchange for three of those lost selections (Sweat, Allen and Ryan Bates).\n\nPass rusher and receiver certainly make sense for Chicago at No. 9, and it could ultimately come down to how the board falls.\n\nFollow The Bears Wire Podcast:\n\nApple Podcasts | Spotify | Google Podcasts",

Last month, the Bears traded Justin Fields to the Pittsburgh Steelers for a sixth-round pick in 2025 -- and it's all but official that the team will use their No. 1 pick to nab USC Quarterback and 2022 Heisman Winner Caleb Williams.\n\nMORE: 7 big takeaways from the Chicago Bears new stadium proposal\n\nAfter that, however, things get a little blurry. What remains up in the air is who they'll take with their No. 9 pick and what direction the team will take for their picks in the third and fourth round. And then, of course, there's the NFL Draft trade rumors.\n\nAs day one gets underway, here's what to know.\n\nThe draft begins on Thursday, Apr. 25. The league will go through the entire first round that night.\n\nThe second and third rounds take place on Friday, Apr. 26. A marathon session on Saturday, Apr. 27 takes care of rounds four through seven.\n\nThe draft begins at 7 p.m. on Apr. 25. The second round picks up at 6 p.m. on Apr. 26 and day three begins at 11 a.m.\n\nThe 2024 NFL Draft will be available on ESPN, ABC, and NFL Network.\n\nFor full analysis and more, here's how to watch 2024 NFL Draft Week coverage on NBC Sports Chicago.\n\nWilliams has checked every box for the Bears during the pre-draft process. They tape and person match all the criteria laid out by general manager Ryan Poles, and those inside Halas Hall are convinced that Williams is uniquely wired to thrive in the Chicago pressure cooker.\n\nThe 2022 Heisman Trophy winner and potential No. 1 overall pick by the Bears has a world of talent. He has elite arm talent, rare off-script playmaking ability, and has had NFL evaluators drooling since he burst on the scene at Oklahoma in 2021.\n\nBut the criticism of Williams intensified during the 2023 season. As USC struggled due to a horrific defense and leaky offensive line, Williams was forced to try to put the Trojans on his back. The hero ball approach led to some jaw-dropping highlights but also some poor decisions.\n\nA 52-42 loss to undefeated Washington was the perfect example of the uphill battle Williams faced trying to draft the Trojans' flawed roster to wins on a weekly basis. It's a loss that led to a viral moment that has served as a crutch for some of Williams' biggest critics to latch onto.\n\nAfter the loss, cameras caught Williams going into the stands to be embraced by his mother, who tried to shield him from the cameras as he cried. This moment has become one that critics cite as the reason he can't be relied on to be a leader in the NFL.\n\nFormer NFL star and six-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Gerald McCoy doesn't have time for those who view emotion as a weakness.\n\n\"People question why he's crying after games. People who question Caleb Williams crying after games or an athlete crying after games have never worked extremely hard for anything,\" McCoy, now an analyst for NFL Network, told NBC Sports Chicago at Radio Row for Super Bowl 58. \"You have no idea the hours as athletes that we put in. Everybody handles stuff differently. He's showing passion. You mean to tell me you're questioning his toughness or what he is because he chooses to deal with loss by going to talk to his mom?! Because he's going to cry?! You know how many people cry to their moms behind closed doors? They just don't do it on camera. He's Caleb Williams. He's always on camera. There's a lot of athletes that you guys will be surprised to do a lot of crying in the locker room.\n\n\"So don't question his toughness because he's crying after losing. We put a lot into this sport, a lot more than just our bodies. So his passion and who he is as a person, if that's why you wouldn't pick him or want him as your leader, alright whatever. Then I don't want you as a fan anyway. Caleb is one of those guys.\"\n\nThe Bears have several paths they can go down with their second first-round pick this year. For the last four months however, trading down has been the expected move by the Bears at No. 9.\n\nThat's still in the cards -- but there are a select few players the Bears would deem \"stick and pick\" selections.\n\nFor those inside Halas Hall, Rome Odunze, a wide receiver from Washington, is atop that list. With the size, elite ball skills, physical run-after-the-catch ability, contested-catch prowess, and alignment versatility, Odunze is the ideal receiver to add to a receiving corps that already includes DJ Moore and Keenan Allen.\n\nAllen is 32, in the final year of his contract, and has dealt with soft tissue injuries over the past few seasons. With no reliable depth behind Allen and Moore, the Bears need to add a high-ceiling No. 3 receiver to ensure Williams has the proper support system around him.\n\nThe Bears must also plan for life after Caleb Williams, whether in a few years or 2025.\n\nOdunze checks all those boxes. Scouts have compared him to Davante Adams, Larry Fitzgerald, and Allen.\n\nIf the Bears don't take Odunze at No. 9, left tackle Joe Alt and defensive tackle Byron Murphy II appear to be the other two likely candidates if available. Alt is expected to be a top-7 pick.\n\nIf the Bears trade down, it will likely be for a non-Alt tackle, with Alabama's JC Latham and Oregon State's Taliese Fuaga the favored targets among tackles.\n\nHere's a look at Chicago Bears' insider Josh Schrock's latest mock draft.\n\nThird round (No. 75 overall) prediction: Austin Booker, DE, Kansas\n\nOpting not to trade down from No. 9 leaves the Bears with just two picks left in the draft, but there are still impact players to be found in the third and fourth rounds.\n\nBooker is one.\n\nA long, twitchy edge defender with explosive athleticism, Booker has all the traits the Bears covet in a defensive end.\n\nWhile he needs to get bigger and stronger, Booker has a good rush plan with the length and speed to get on top of quarterbacks and running backs in a heartbeat.\n\nHe was compared to Las Vegas Raiders star Maxx Crosby during the pre-draft process. That's a lofty comparison, but Booker has the tools and talent to become an extremely productive edge rusher with the right coaching and development.\n\nFourth round (No. 122 overall) prediction: Hunter Nourzad, IOL, Penn State\n\nThe Bears round out a short but potentially franchise-altering draft with their long-term answer at center.\n\nNourzad is a powerful center with solid length, good technique, and the ability to play in any scheme.\n\nThe Bears traded for Ryan Bates this offseason and signed Coleman Shelton to a one-year contract, but neither figure to factor into their long-term plans at center. The Bears love Bates, but he's probably best utilized as a swing interior lineman once all the pieces are in place.\n\nNourzad will need some fine-tuning, but he can be a good depth piece in 2024 with plans to take over in 2025.\n\nHere's the exact order for the first round of this year's draft. As mentioned above, this order can change at any time with a trade.\n\nThe amount of time NFL teams have to decide on their picks varies by round.\n\nIn the first round, every team is allotted 10 minutes per pick, which means the Bears pick might not come right at 7 p.m.\n\nFrom there, the league picks up the pace. Teams get seven minutes per pick in the second round, then five minutes per pick for rounds three through six. For round seven, teams only get four minutes to make their picks.\n\nAs soon as a team hands in its draft selection card to an NFL runner, the clock resets for the next pick.\n\nIf a team allows the clock to expire without making a pick, the next team in line has the opportunity to turn in their card for the next pick instead. However, the team that ran out of time doesn't forfeit the pick entirely. They can still make their pick later, whenever they turn in their card.\n\nThe Bears on Wednesday gave fans and all of Chicago a first look at what they're planning to build along the city's lakefront, announcing everything from a location to roofing plans to green space to plaza details.\n\nThe team revealed plans for more than just a stadium, rather showcasing an entertainment hub that can host Super Bowls, playoffs, concerts and more.\n\n\"We have the best museums in the country. We have the most beautiful lakefront. We have the most vivid downtown architectural design. And this affords us the opportunity to be able to bring this all together in the greatest city on the planet,\" Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren said during a press conference live Wednesday.",

(AP) -- The Chicago Bears know who they're taking with the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft and so does just about everyone else too.\n\nGeneral manager Ryan Poles just wasn't ready to announce it's Caleb Williams on Tuesday. He opted to leave that to commissioner Roger Goodell on Thursday night.\n\n\"So unfortunately it's one of those things I think everyone's got to tune in on Thursday to watch and figure out, but I feel really good about our process and where we are and where we're headed,\" Poles said, smiling. \"So we know what we're going to do but everyone is going to have to wait until Thursday to go there.\"\n\nBarring a massive surprise, the Bears will kick off the draft by grabbing the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner and setting themselves on a course they hope takes them to the top of the NFL. They also have the ninth overall pick as well as a third-rounder (75) and a fourth-rounder (122).\n\nChicago has been the likely landing spot for Williams since he announced in an Instagram post in January that he was leaving USC and turning pro.\n\nThe Bears are in this position thanks to a blockbuster trade last year with Carolina. Chicago sent the No. 1 pick in 2023 to the Panthers for receiver DJ Moore and their first-rounder this year. Carolina finished with a league-worst 2-15 mark.\n\nWilliams checks all the boxes with his arm strength and ability to avoid defenders.\n\nHe can extend plays and make throws on the run as well as in the pocket -- an area where former starter Justin Fields struggled.\n\nWilliams had 93 touchdowns and 14 interceptions during three seasons at Oklahoma and USC. He threw for 72 TDs and just 10 interceptions in two years with the Trojans. He also showed the ability to run with 27 rushing touchdowns in college.\n\nWilliams followed coach Lincoln Riley from Norman to Los Angeles and won the Heisman in 2022. Williams threw for 4,537 yards, 42 touchdowns and five interceptions to lift USC from four wins in 2021 to 11 and an appearance in the Cotton Bowl.\n\nWilliams put up big numbers again last season while the Trojans struggled to an 8-5 record with one of the nation's worst defenses. He threw for 3,333 yards, 30 touchdowns and five interceptions in 12 games. He did not play in the Holiday Bowl.\n\nThe Bears have been eyeing Williams throughout the draft process. They met with him at the combine and spent a few days with him leading into his pro day in Los Angeles.\n\nWilliams also made a top 30 visit to Halas Hall and got to have dinner with some of the team's players, including linebacker T.J. Edwards.\n\n\"You get to know people and how they fit in the culture and things like that,\" Edwards said. \"At the end of the day once we get people here and once whoever is signed will be here, we'll hit the ground running with that.\"\n\nPoles said the feedback about Williams he got from the players at the dinner was positive.\n\n\"I think it just confirmed a lot of information that we got,\" he said. \"You know, there's a kind of test to where his football understanding is. That part, getting him with some of our players. That's important to us. We're in a really good place with our culture in our locker room. As much as I can I want those guys a part of the process of building this team. I trust their feedback and I think that chemistry is really important so that's why we did that.\"\n\nThe Bears are 10-24 in two seasons under Poles and coach Matt Eberflus. But after going 7-10 last season, they believe they are poised to take another big step.\n\nWilliams would have two star receivers to work with in Moore and the recently acquired Keenan Allen as well as two productive tight ends in Cole Kmet and newcomer Gerald Everett. He has big goals, saying on {a href=\"https://twitter.com/Realrclark25/status/1781410722892693797?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1781410722892693797%7Ctwgr%5E37c4c59fe4e130f690f59dc87cf076ac0d10c2d4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.si.com%2Fnfl%2F2024%2F04%2F21%2Fcaleb-williams-spend-career-bears-tom-brady-super-bowl-record\"}The Pivot Podcast{/a} that he hopes to spend 20 years with one team and chase Tom Brady's record seven Super Bowl wins.\n\n\"I love it,\" Poles said. \"I think we all should have huge goals. We have huge goals here -- win multiple championships. And that's what we shoot for. You're more intentional when you have these goals, you have to live a certain way, you have to practice a certain way, you have to go about your business a certain way in order to accomplish those. If everything else is in line underneath that, that gets me excited.\"\n\nAP NFL: {a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\"}https://apnews.com/hub/nfl{/a}", "source": {"uri":

With only four picks and still several roster holes, wouldn't it be smart to trade down and fill those holes as the draft comes? Could you see the Bears trading back multiple times throughout the draft? -- @monturnerx\n\nI don't see as many holes as you perhaps do. Could the Bears use an edge rusher opposite Montez Sweat? Yes. Is it a glaring hole? Not like it was a year ago. Could they use an offensive tackle? Yes, if they have a high grade on one and aren't keen on left tackle Braxton Jones' developmental curve, it would make plenty of sense. Can they use a wide receiver? No question. They're a little thin after DJ Moore and Keenan Allen, and Allen is entering a contract year. Could they use a penetrating defensive tackle? No question.\n\nPeople are also reading...

That's why general manager Ryan Poles was able to say with confidence that he has flexibility in reacting to what happens Thursday night in the first eight picks.\n\nI think there's a bit of a gap between the first three receivers -- Marvin Harrison Jr., Malik Nabers and Rome Odunze (put them in any order you like) -- and the rest of the class. So getting a top-three receiver considering Allen's age (32 on Saturday) and contract situation makes a lot of sense. Without a lot of picks, it's hard to say where the Bears could target another receiver.\n\nI wouldn't rule out a trade down. If the Bears do go that route, it opens the possibility they could draft a center (another position that sits between need and want after the acquisition of Ryan Bates and Coleman Shelton). But I don't think we'll see the Bears trade down time and time again to fill out a draft class. They're not at that point right now in team building where they need to fill depth. They need elite talent.\n\n\"Things shift and change as you go along,\" Poles said Tuesday. \"It's going to be hard to make this team now. It's going to be really hard to make this team. That doesn't mean you don't want more shots later. We'll always welcome a lot of picks. But it doesn't force you to panic about the situation we're in right now with how many picks we have. So it fits our roster but it also fits what we just talked about -- the current status of this draft and then moving forward what next year looks like as well.\"\n\nIs there any outcome of the draft that would be truly disappointing? Assuming Caleb Williams goes No. 1, what positional selection would make you scratch your head? -- @noahlaporte\n\nI don't know that there is one because when you look at how the board could shake out, there will be some top options at a handful of positions that make perfect sense for the Bears. That's one reason Ryan Poles and assistant GM Ian Cunningham were able to project so much confidence Tuesday when they discussed the draft without saying much of anything about their plans.\n\nDepending on how things go -- and I'm talking primarily about how many quarterbacks come off the board in the top eight picks after Caleb Williams goes No. 1 -- the Bears will have multiple options and all of them can be deemed good ones. They can sell almost any outcome here and walk away feeling confident they made moves to position themselves as a challenger in the NFC North. I really don't see a wild-card outcome that would be a head scratcher and have social media and sports-talk airwaves demanding explanations.\n\nMy guess right now is the Bears might be focusing on Washington wide receiver Rome Odunze and Texas defensive tackle Byron Murphy II if they stay at No. 9. There's a good chance one of them is available, and both could be on the board when the Bears go on the clock. Neither of those moves would be a head scratcher, and you also could make a good argument to draft an edge rusher or an offensive tackle. Heck, you could talk me into Georgia tight end Brock Bowers, too, and that possibility shouldn't be discounted even though the Bears have Cole Kmet and Gerald Everett. It will be fascinating. I can almost promise that.\n\nWhat would really surprise you on Thursday night? -- Paul P., Chicago\n\nThat's pretty open-ended. I'll share a really interesting one floating around that I heard from a team Tuesday morning. How about the Minnesota Vikings -- who own two first-round picks and are believed to be lurking for a possible trade up to nab one of the top quarterbacks -- dealing both of those picks and more to acquire Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert? In that scenario, the Chargers would select Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy with the fifth pick.\n\nCrazy? I think so. I can't imagine why the Chargers would want to deal Herbert, an elite quarterback who only needs more talent around him. That would constitute a bombshell Thursday night and would really energize the NFC North if the Vikings were able to solve their QB dilemma with a player of Herbert's caliber. Buckle up.\n\nHere's a question I'm surprised hasn't been addressed yet: What assurances does Caleb Williams have that he's not going to endure what his past two predecessors did -- get drafted by a head coach who gets fired after the first season? My hope was that they would have fired Matt Eberflus, hired a new coach and traded Justin Fields so it would be a clean slate. Or if they kept Eberflus, give some guarantee of at least two years so the rookie QB gets at least two seasons under the same head coach. -- Brien B., Omaha, Neb.\n\nThe only assurance Williams will receive is the fully guaranteed, four-year contract for the No. 1 pick that should be worth about $38.5 million. Draft picks don't get any promises in regard to what might happen with coaches, staff members, teammates, whatever.\n\nWe've been over this issue but it's been a few months. This was a hot topic back in January, and what's noteworthy is the Bears didn't rush into anything. As you recall, they met for a couple of days at the end of the season before deciding who would return and who wouldn't. It would not have been surprising if they had opted for an offensive-minded head coach, but Ryan Poles liked the way Eberflus kept the team together after a miserable start last season and how the defense got progressively better as the year went on. There was growth and development by younger players.\n\nWill there be pressure on Eberflus and his staff entering this season? Sure. There isn't a gig in the NFL that doesn't come with pressure. I'd also point out the overwhelming majority of questions regarding firings overlook the reality that it's really hard to get the next hire right. That's why we see the carousel for head coaches, coordinators and position coaches spinning annually.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn Drew Brees' prime, announcers harped on about how the Saints prioritized the interior of their offensive line due to Brees' height. If that was legitimately true (and not a talking point to fill time), should the Bears prioritize trading back for the great G/C prospects to offset Caleb Williams' height? -- Ryan W.\n\nThat's a good question because, according to the combine measurements, Williams is only one-eighth of an inch taller than the 6-1 Brees was when he came out of Purdue. However, you should consider that we're talking about different players. Brees was short for the position and was not particularly mobile. Williams is just a shade taller but he's able to reset in the pocket, elude rushers, create plays on the move and, when needed, tuck the ball and run. Because they are different athletically, I don't think you can just look at measurements and apply the same thinking.\n\nYou're right that the Saints put an emphasis on being strong from guard to guard to allow Brees to find throwing windows. That's something former Bears offensive coordinator Aaron Kromer talked about when he came from New Orleans. It was an interesting strategy and the Saints did a nice job of it, but it's not like that initiative came at the expense of locating high-caliber tackles. You still have to be elite on the edges.\n\nThe Bears have done some work on offensive linemen who are unlikely to be in play at No. 9, and one who jumps out is West Virginia center Zach Frazier. He might be the best at the position in this class and is probably a late first-round pick or early Day 2 selection. So I'd imagine he's in discussions in scenarios where the team trades the ninth pick Thursday.\n\nWhat has been the best Bears' draft pick over the last decade? -- Dylan J., Peoria\n\nThat's another open-ended question and you could make a good case for a handful of players. Cornerback Tyrique Stevenson has a chance to be a really impactful player as a second-round pick a year ago, but it's too early to tell what his career arc will look like. Cornerback Jaylon Johnson, a second-round pick in 2020, belongs in this conversation. Free safety Eddie Jackson was a fourth-round selection in 2017 and had a really strong career for the Bears.\n\nIf I had to pick one right now, I'd probably go with recently retired left tackle Charles Leno, a seventh-round pick by GM Phil Emery in 2014. The 246th pick that year, Leno made 141 career starts and 94 were with the Bears. He was added to the Pro Bowl roster in 2018, and while Leno was never an elite talent, the Bears got solid play out of him for a long time without ever having to pay him top money at the position.\n\nWhat's absent is a lot of picks at the top of the draft where you look back and say, \"That was a home run.\" Linebacker Roquan Smith, the eighth pick in 2018, remains fantastic. You should get that with some kind of regularity when you're picking that high. That's why it's imperative the Bears come out of this draft with a special talent at No. 9 or after a slight trade down.\n\nIf the Bears draft one of the top three receivers, could three alpha receivers be content with a rookie quarterback? -- Bobby D., Arizona\n\nFair question. My first reaction is it's not about the experience of the quarterback but the performance. If a 10-year veteran is stinking it up, things won't be peachy for three alpha receivers just because the quarterback has some experience.\n\nDJ Moore proved to be a total pro last season, especially at the beginning of the year when he inexplicably wasn't getting the ball. He didn't have any history I'm aware of for complaining about subpar QB play when he was with the Carolina Panthers, and there was a lot of that going on. Keenan Allen is entering a contract year so I doubt he's going to create waves, but I don't have any insight into his locker-room demeanor. A rookie needs to find his way. I don't believe this would be a concern for Ryan Poles if he uses the ninth pick on a wide receiver.\n\nIn fact, I'd probably flip this around and turn it into a positive. What better situation for a rookie quarterback? Moore, Allen and a top-three receiver in this draft class would put a rookie quarterback in a tremendous position to learn and succeed.\n\nThere have been numerous scenarios for what the Bears will do with their ninth pick. Rarely, if ever, do I see a scenario similar to what worked so well for them last year: receiving a player (DJ Moore) as part of a draft trade. Any chance the Bears might find a draft partner several selections down who might be willing to part with a talented player at a key position -- perhaps from a cap-strapped team -- to move up in the draft? If so, what might such a scenario look like? -- Jim A., Plymouth, Minn.\n\nIn your scenario, which I believe is highly unlikely, you trade the uncertainty of how a draft pick will develop and perform in return for a player with a high salary-cap number. Keep making moves like this (trading for Moore, trading for Montez Sweat, trading for a player in your scenario, spending in free agency) and you're going to run into cap issues and before long have an aging roster. The Bears need to trust in their scouting department, believe in their player development program and select a rookie who can flourish for them while benefiting from a cost-controlled four-year contract that will include a fifth-year option.\n\nWhen does DJ Moore get a contract extension? And do you think Keenan Allen gets an extension before the season? -- rtindenverco\n\nThat's hard to forecast and the team will keep any contract talks super buttoned up. It was pretty clear the Bears' first priority last offseason was getting a new deal done with tight end Cole Kmet, and that process stretched out over a few months. Attention has rightfully been on free agency and the draft, and there's no rush to get something done with Moore, who has two years remaining on the contract the Bears inherited when they acquired him in a trade from the Carolina Panthers. My guess -- and this is just a hunch -- is that topic could be introduced later this spring or this summer. Does that mean something will get done? I have no guess on that. It takes two sides to hammer out a deal and you never know how things will go.\n\nAs far as Allen, the Bears picked up a player with an outstanding track record who is coming off an elite season. That being said, I don't understand why there would be any urgency to consider a new contract for him at this point. Allen turns 32 on Saturday and will be entering his 12th NFL season. He did not slow down in 2023 but he will before long. I wouldn't rule out Allen being with the Bears beyond this season, but we have to see if they draft a wide receiver in Round 1 and how Allen plays this season. Allen might not be in a rush either.\n\nRyan Poles and the front office could feel differently, but as methodical as the Bears have been with some of their cash/cap decisions, you have to expect they would carefully weigh a big investment in a player of Allen's age and experience, especially when they're going to be paying Moore a lot.\n\nThere are so many mock drafts on the sports websites, newspapers, podcasts, etc., and each seem to stretch credulity to get clicks. Aside from the Bears not taking Caleb Williams, what's the silliest mock draft selection you've seen this year? -- @caljestice\n\nIt will be easy to call them all silly by the time the dust settles Thursday night and Round 1 is in the books. An incredible mock draft will nail five or six picks. Between the unpredictability of trades and not fully knowing how teams weigh the character of individual prospects or how they delineate between needs/wants and draft grades, it's a crap shoot. Throw in medical information and, well, we're all guessing.\n\nThe most amusing stuff I saw this year was silly-season mocks by wishcasters in which the Bears opted to build around Justin Fields with their draft capital.

Here are five potential trade partners.\n\nThe 2024 NFL Draft is just two days away. Chicago Bears General Manager Ryan Poles is set to run the most important draft in franchise history. It looks as if he decided on who he selects at the top. It is all but guaranteed that USC quarterback Caleb Williams will be the pick.\n\nWhat Poles does with the number nine pick is the real mystery. He has a lot of options there. He will be in a position to pick up another elite prospect. Does he add help for Williams, or does he improve the defense?\n\nAnother option for Poles is a trade. The Chicago Bears have only four picks. If Poles wants to fill more holes he may want to trade down to acquire more picks. However, he could decide to blow things up and go up for another \"generational\" talent.\n\nPoles could want to take the best quarterback and best wide receiver prospect in the draft. That would put the NFL on notice that the Chicago Bears are back. He already revamped the offense and it looks as if the points will be plenty this season.\n\nImagine a wide receivers room with D.J. Moore, Keenan Allen, and Marvin Harrison Jr. That would be crazy. Harrison is mentioned because he is likely the only prospect Poles would move up to select.\n\nSome may feel that with just four picks the Bears don't have the assets to trade up. However, they have five picks in the first four rounds of next year's draft, including two second-round picks. Poles could use a combination of the ninth pick and a couple of those 2025 picks.\n\nHere are five potential trade partners for the ninth pick of the draft:\n\nPoles could decide to amass many picks to fill holes and add depth. He can do that while still getting even more help for Williams. This class is deep at wide receiver. Poles can select a very good wide receiver as late as the fourth round.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars lost their top wide receiver, Calvin Ridley, via free agency. If one of the big three receivers is available at nine, the Jaguars could pull the trigger and pick up a great replacement.\n\nTrading down from nine to 17 should garner the Bears many picks. Jacksonville has eight picks the Bears could choose from. Poles could garner a few additional picks and solidify the roster even more than he already has.\n\nThe New England Patriots have the third pick in the draft. They are always in search of additional picks both in the present draft and in future drafts. They have a history of wheeling and dealing every year.\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals are the one team linked with Harrison the most. They own the fourth pick and would be the first team not going after a quarterback. That means if Poles wants Harrison he needs to leapfrog over Arizona.\n\nThe Patriots could use multiple trades to move up and down. The ninth position is a great spot to make a deal. They can move down to nine and then move back up, similar to what the Cardinals did last year. They traded down from number three. Later, they moved back up to six. They ended up with multiple additional draft picks.\n\nPoles could get ahead of the Cardinals and acquire the two best prospects in the draft.\n\nThe Denver Broncos need a quarterback. Sure, they just picked up Zack Wilson. They also have Jarrett Stidham and Ben DiNucci. They are not screaming elite, though. It isn't even screaming average. They will want to add to that quarterback room.\n\nLike the Jaguars, the Broncos have eight picks to work with. Should a quarterback they want be available at nine, they would certainly pull the trigger on a deal.\n\nPoles could end up taking the Cardinals' spot. There are reports that Arizona is ready to sell that pick. They could prioritize additional picks to having the top wide receiver prospect. Additionally, they may want to find protection for quarterback Kyler Murray.\n\nIf the Chicago Bears make this trade it could go down to the wire. However, with the top three picks likely to be quarterbacks, if Poles can get to four he will get his man.\n\nLike the Cardinals, the Los Angeles Chargers announced their pick is for sale. Having this gives Poles an opportunity to wheel and deal if he covets Harrison.\n\nThe Chargers have a new coach, Jim Harbaugh. He wants to acquire some picks so he can fill holes in the roster. Their priority is likely selecting protection for Justin Herbert. They would want to make sure he stays upright. Last season, he suffered an injury that cut his season short.\n\nAdditionally, the Chargers need targets for Herbert. In addition to losing Allen in the trade with the Bears, they lost tight end Gerald Everett (also to the Bears but via free agency).\n\nIf there is a run on quarterbacks and the big three wide receivers, super tight end prospect Brock Bowers or the best offensive lineman prospect in the draft, Joe Alt, could be available at nine.\n\nWith the Bears' fourth-round pick acquired for Allen, the Chargers have nine picks. That gives them plenty of opportunities to find wide receivers later in the draft.\n\nThere are many opportunities for Poles to trade either up or down. Poles might want to make a big splash in the draft. Moving up from nine to select Harrison would be a huge splash. However, he could trade down and solidify the roster. That could make them contenders for the NFC North title.\n\nAs Poles stated when he became Chicago Bears GM, this could be the draft that gives the team a hold of the division that they won't let go anytime soon.", "source": {"uri": "fullpresscoverage.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Full Press Coverage"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carlos_nazario@fullpresscoverage.com", "name": "Carlos Nazario", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Polish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvin Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenan_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keenan Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Ridley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Ridley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Herbert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Herbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyler_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyler Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Everett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gerald Everett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Harbaugh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Harbaugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrett_Stidham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarrett Stidham"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/fullpresscoverage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/images1.jpg?fit=300%2C168&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Contrasting reports set the stage for the Bears' pick", "body": "Pass rusher with the No. 9 pick? Contrasting reports set the stage for the Bears' pick originally appeared on NBC Sports Chicago\n\nWhile discussing the prospects of the 2024 NFL Draft on Tuesday, Bears general manager Ryan Poles said their answer for the No. 9 pick in the draft will be a game-time decision.\n\n\"It's hard to answer right now,\" Poles said of the No. 9 pick. \"As the draft unfolds, there's going to be some indicators that start to educate us on how we need to move to acquire the top talents in this draft.\"\n\nThis is a sensible strategy for the Bears. Most reports would indicate four quarterbacks will go with the first four picks in the draft. But after that, it's unpredictable; no one knows precisely what the Chargers, Giants, Titans and Falcons are thinking before the Bears' No. 9 pick.\n\nBut recent reports suggest the Chicago Bears are leaning toward wide receiver or pass rusher.\n\n\"Sources around the league seem to believe the Chicago Bears will go one of two ways with the No. 9 pick: pass rusher or wide receiver,\" CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones wrote on Tuesday.\n\nHere's what The Athletic's draft expert Dane Brugler said about the No. 9 pick, too.\n\nOne thing Jones wrote in his report catches the eye, however. He writes the Bears were previously disinclined by the pass-rushing talent in the draft, and that's why they traded for Montez Sweat at the previous NFL trade deadline.\n\n\"Other sources have pointed out the Bears could use the pick [No. 9] on a pass rusher to take some pressure off Montez Sweat. It's a good idea, and it makes roster-composition sense. But the Bears sent a second-round pick to Washington for Sweat (and then paid him) because they didn't anticipate strong options in free agency or the draft this year. And like so many teams in this draft, a trade-down is always possible,\" Jones wrote.\n\nThe Bears didn't pounce for an edge rusher in free agency. They could've taken their licks on blue-chip pass-rushers like Jonathan Greenard or Danielle Hunter. But they didn't.\n\nAnd while it's not an underwhelming defensive end draft, it's not top-heavy. Some believe the best value lies towards the bottom of the first round with UCLA's Laiatu Latu, Florida State's Jared Verse and Penn State's Chop Robinson.\n\nThe top three receivers --- Marvin Harrison Jr., Malik Nabers and Rome Odunze --- all seemingly outweigh the potential of the best edge rushers i.e. Alabama's Dallas Turner and Texas' Byron Murphy.\n\nFrom these reports, you can glean the Bears' focus lies on one of the top three receivers if available. If all three receivers are unavailable, the likelihood of a trade-down scenario seemingly appears stronger for an edge rusher later in the first round.\n\nStay tuned, as the Bears first must see how the first eight teams draft before theirs. However it unfolds, Poles is confident in how the front office will address that pick.\n\n\"The nice thing is from the work that we've done I feel pretty good about just being flexible,\" Poles said.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score":

After trading quarterback Justin Fields to the Pittsburgh Steelers for a sixth-round pick in 2025, what the Chicago Bears will do with their first pick is easy to predict.\n\nAfter that, however, things get a little blurry.\n\nAs the NFL Draft approaches, here's what Bears fans should know.\n\nThe draft begins on Thursday, Apr. 25. The league will go through the entire first round that night.\n\nThe second and third rounds take place on Friday, Apr. 26. A marathon session on Saturday, Apr. 27 takes care of rounds four through seven.\n\nThe draft begins at 7 p.m. on Apr. 25. The second round picks up at 6 p.m. on Apr. 26 and day three begins at 11 a.m.\n\nThe 2024 NFL Draft will be available on ESPN, ABC, and NFL Network.\n\nFor full analysis and more, here's how to watch 2024 NFL Draft Week coverage on NBC Sports Chicago.\n\nWilliams has checked every box for the Bears during the pre-draft process. They tape and person match all the criteria laid out by general manager Ryan Poles, and those inside Halas Hall are convinced that Williams is uniquely wired to thrive in the Chicago pressure cooker.\n\nThe 2022 Heisman Trophy winner and potential No. 1 overall pick by the Bears has a world of talent. He has elite arm talent, rare off-script playmaking ability, and has had NFL evaluators drooling since he burst on the scene at Oklahoma in 2021.\n\nBut the criticism of Williams intensified during the 2023 season. As USC struggled due to a horrific defense and leaky offensive line, Williams was forced to try to put the Trojans on his back. The hero ball approach led to some jaw-dropping highlights but also some poor decisions.\n\nA 52-42 loss to undefeated Washington was the perfect example of the uphill battle Williams faced trying to draft the Trojans' flawed roster to wins on a weekly basis. It's a loss that led to a viral moment that has served as a crutch for some of Williams' biggest critics to latch onto.\n\nAfter the loss, cameras caught Williams going into the stands to be embraced by his mother, who tried to shield him from the cameras as he cried. This moment has become one that critics cite as the reason he can't be relied on to be a leader in the NFL.\n\nFormer NFL star and six-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Gerald McCoy doesn't have time for those who view emotion as a weakness.\n\n\"People question why he's crying after games. People who question Caleb Williams crying after games or an athlete crying after games have never worked extremely hard for anything,\" McCoy, now an analyst for NFL Network, told NBC Sports Chicago at Radio Row for Super Bowl 58. \"You have no idea the hours as athletes that we put in. Everybody handles stuff differently. He's showing passion. You mean to tell me you're questioning his toughness or what he is because he chooses to deal with loss by going to talk to his mom?! Because he's going to cry?! You know how many people cry to their moms behind closed doors? They just don't do it on camera. He's Caleb Williams. He's always on camera. There's a lot of athletes that you guys will be surprised to do a lot of crying in the locker room.\n\n\"So don't question his toughness because he's crying after losing. We put a lot into this sport, a lot more than just our bodies. So his passion and who he is as a person, if that's why you wouldn't pick him or want him as your leader, alright whatever. Then I don't want you as a fan anyway. Caleb is one of those guys.\"\n\nThe Bears have several paths they can go down with their second first-round pick this year. For the last four months however, trading down has been the expected move by the Bears at No. 9.\n\nThat's still in the cards -- but there are a select few players the Bears would deem \"stick and pick\" selections.\n\nFor those inside Halas Hall, Rome Odunze, a wide receiver from Washington, is atop that list. With the size, elite ball skills, physical run-after-the-catch ability, contested-catch prowess, and alignment versatility, Odunze is the ideal receiver to add to a receiving corps that already includes DJ Moore and Keenan Allen.\n\nAllen is 32, in the final year of his contract, and has dealt with soft tissue injuries over the past few seasons. With no reliable depth behind Allen and Moore, the Bears need to add a high-ceiling No. 3 receiver to ensure Williams has the proper support system around him.\n\nThe Bears must also plan for life after Caleb Williams, whether in a few years or 2025.\n\nOdunze checks all those boxes. Scouts have compared him to Davante Adams, Larry Fitzgerald, and Allen.\n\nIf the Bears don't take Odunze at No. 9, left tackle Joe Alt and defensive tackle Byron Murphy II appear to be the other two likely candidates if available. Alt is expected to be a top-7 pick.\n\nIf the Bears trade down, it will likely be for a non-Alt tackle, with Alabama's JC Latham and Oregon State's Taliese Fuaga the favored targets among tackles.\n\nHere's a look at Chicago Bears' insider Josh Schrock's latest mock draft.\n\nThird round (No. 75 overall) prediction: Austin Booker, DE, Kansas\n\nOpting not to trade down from No. 9 leaves the Bears with just two picks left in the draft, but there are still impact players to be found in the third and fourth rounds.\n\nBooker is one.\n\nA long, twitchy edge defender with explosive athleticism, Booker has all the traits the Bears covet in a defensive end.\n\nWhile he needs to get bigger and stronger, Booker has a good rush plan with the length and speed to get on top of quarterbacks and running backs in a heartbeat.\n\nHe was compared to Las Vegas Raiders star Maxx Crosby during the pre-draft process. That's a lofty comparison, but Booker has the tools and talent to become an extremely productive edge rusher with the right coaching and development.\n\nFourth round (No. 122 overall) prediction: Hunter Nourzad, IOL, Penn State\n\nThe Bears round out a short but potentially franchise-altering draft with their long-term answer at center.\n\nNourzad is a powerful center with solid length, good technique, and the ability to play in any scheme.\n\nThe Bears traded for Ryan Bates this offseason and signed Coleman Shelton to a one-year contract, but neither figure to factor into their long-term plans at center. The Bears love Bates, but he's probably best utilized as a swing interior lineman once all the pieces are in place.\n\nNourzad will need some fine-tuning, but he can be a good depth piece in 2024 with plans to take over in 2025.\n\nHere's the exact order for the first round of this year's draft. As mentioned above, this order can change at any time with a trade.\n\nThe amount of time NFL teams have to decide on their picks varies by round.\n\nIn the first round, every team is allotted 10 minutes per pick, which means the Bears pick might not come right at 7 p.m.\n\nFrom there, the league picks up the pace. Teams get seven minutes per pick in the second round, then five minutes per pick for rounds three through six. For round seven, teams only get four minutes to make their picks.\n\nAs soon as a team hands in its draft selection card to an NFL runner, the clock resets for the next pick.\n\nIf a team allows the clock to expire without making a pick, the next team in line has the opportunity to turn in their card for the next pick instead. However, the team that ran out of time doesn't forfeit the pick entirely. They can still make their pick later, whenever they turn in their card.\n\nThe Bears on Wednesday gave fans and all of Chicago a first look at what they're planning to build along the city's lakefront, announcing everything from a location to roofing plans to green space to plaza details.\n\nThe team revealed plans for more than just a stadium, rather showcasing an entertainment hub that can host Super Bowls, playoffs, concerts and more.\n\n\"We have the best museums in the country. We have the most beautiful lakefront. We have the most vivid downtown architectural design. And this affords us the opportunity to be able to bring this all together in the greatest city on the planet,\" Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren said during a press conference live Wednesday.",

Thankfully for Williams, the Bears also own the ninth overall pick in the draft.\n\nWhile Williams isn't the one making the final decision, he's hinted at his former high school teammate, Olu Fashanu, being the second pick of the night for Chicago.\n\nThe Bears do have a need at offensive tackle, and Fashanu is considered by many to be the second-best tackle in this draft class.

Of course, more deals could be on the horizon to change what the Bears are working with, again.\n\nPoles got this year's No. 1 overall pick in the deal that sent last year's No. 1 overall pick to Carolina. He acquired the No. 122 overall pick from Philadelphia when they swapped places with the Bears last year to draft Jalen Carter. The Bears ended up with Darnell Wright after that move.\n\nThe Bears' second-round pick belongs to the Commanders thanks to the move that brought Montez Sweat to Chicago. The Chargers have their fourth-rounder due to the Keenan Allen trade. The Bears sent their fifth-round pick to Buffalo for versatile interior offensive lineman Ryan Bates and their sixth-round pick to Miami for fellow interior o-lineman Dan Feeney. In 2022, the Bears traded away their seventh-round pick to the Dolphins for wide receiver N'Keal Harry.\n\nThe first round of the draft begins at 7 p.m. on Thursday.

If he did have a say, though, he knows which player he would like to see join him for his debut NFL season.\n\nWilliams spoke with reporters in Detroit on April 24 -- one day before the draft -- and fielded a question about who he would take if he were picking for the Bears at No. 9. Without hesitation, he landed on one name: Penn State offensive tackle Olu Fashanu.\n\n\"If I was able to choose and I was picked No. 1 [by] the Bears, I would probably go Olu Fashanu because I know he'd put his life on the line for me protecting me,\" Williams said, via Yahoo Sports. \"And then, geez, I would probably go one of the top three wide receivers -- whoever is there at nine!\"\n\nFashanu would be an interesting choice for the Bears' ninth overall selection. The 21-year-old left tackle did not give up a sack and allowed just one total quarterback hit in two seasons (1,263 snaps) over the past two seasons starting for the Nittany Lions. His resume is impressive enough for him to potentially be a top-10 pick on the first night.\n\nThe Bears have a two-year starter at left tackle in Braxton Jones, but an investment in the position is not completely out of the question as the team explores its options for surrounding its new franchise quarterback with talent and support. The Bears did hold several official visits with potential first-round offensive tackles during the pre-draft process, but there are no reports to suggest Fashanu took a Top 30 visit with Chicago.\n\nDraft day has officially arrived, but the fans at large are still no closer to knowing what the Bears will do with the No. 9 overall pick in the first round. Part of the reason why could be that the Bears themselves do not yet know what they want to do with the pick and are instead waiting to see how the draft board falls before locking in on specifics.\n\nStill, there are a few candidates who seem more likely to land in Chicago than others.\n\nThe first -- and most obvious -- option is one of the three top wide receivers in the class: Ohio State's Marvin Harrison Jr., LSU's Malik Nabers or Washington's Rome Odunze. The Bears have two Pro Bowl-quality receivers in DJ Moore and Keenan Allen, but they could feel the best winning approach is to pair a high-level playmaker with their new quarterback in hopes they can develop into a dynamic duo together for years to come.\n\nThe Bears hosted Top 30 visits with all three top receivers as well as Texas speedster Xavier Worthy, who broke the NFL Combine record in the 40-yard dash (4.21 seconds).\n\nThe other likely suspects for the Bears at No. 9 are the edge rushers. Chicago still needs a quality partner to play opposite Montez Sweat on their defensive line and took time to scope out several of the top pass rushers in the class over the past month, visiting with Alabama's Dallas Turner, Florida State's Jared Verse, UCLA's Laiatu Latu and Penn State's Chop Robinson. If things fall right, the Bears could have their choice of the four.\n\nMost people expect the Bears will either target a wide receiver, edge rusher or left tackle at No. 9. It is also still perfectly valid to question whether the Bears will make the pick at all given they could trade back a little further into the round to acquire more capital. After all, they have a long wait in store for them between the ninth pick and the 76th.\n\nCould the Bears take things in a less expected direction, though, and use their No. 9 selection on a defensive tackle for Matt Eberflus' defense?\n\nThe possibility of the Bears targetting Texas defensive tackle Byron Murphy with the ninth pick has gained steam in recent weeks. Brad Biggs of The Chicago Tribune raised the subject in his April 21 column, acknowledging that Murphy has a chance to be the first defensive player selected and that the Bears would be an \"ideal landing spot.\"\n\nThe Bears have talent at defensive tackle -- veteran Andrew Billings and two Day 2 picks from 2024 (Gervon Dexter Sr. and Zacch Pickens) -- but they lost their three-technique defensive tackle when they let Justin Jones walk this spring free agency. If the role is truly the \"engine\" of the defense that Eberflus claims it to be, then a top-10 investment in the position would make sense, especially as the position's price rises.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_j_wilson@heavy.com", "name": "Jordan J.

General manager Ryan Poles will have several options, depending on how the board falls, including adding another blue chip player at No. 9.\n\nBut trading back is always a possibility. Especially considering Chicago has just four total picks after dealing some away in trades (for Montez Sweat, Keenan Allen and Ryan Bates).\n\nAhead of the draft, our Bears Wire staff is taking a crack at predicting what Chicago does with its first-round selections at first and ninth overall. While it's an unanimous decision at No. 1, there were some different directions we went at No. 9.\n\nAlyssa Barbieri\n\nNov 11, 2023; Seattle, Washington, USA; Washington Huskies wide receiver Rome Odunze (1) celebrates scoring a touchdown against the Utah Utes during the second half at Alaska Airlines Field at Husky Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Steven Bisig-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNo. 1: QB Caleb Williams, USC\n\nThis has been the pick for weeks now. The only thing left is for the Bears to turn in the card on draft night. Williams is coming into arguably the best situation for a No. 1 rookie quarterback ever, which includes a slew of offensive weapons (like DJ Moore, Keenan Allen and Cole Kmet), a solid offensive line, a potential top-five defense and a QB-friendly offensive coordinator in Shane Waldron.\n\nNo. 9: WR Rome Odunze, Washington\n\nI know I'm going to get my hopes up, but the dream scenario is Odunze falling to Chicago at ninth overall and the Bears landing Williams yet another weapon to help make this transition as seamless as possible. Chicago already has a 1-2 punch at wideout with DJ Moore and Keenan Allen and adding Odunze to the mix would give them one of the best receiver corps in the NFL. Odunze has size (6'3\"), speed (4.45) and elite ball skills that would make him a solid get for the Bears offense. Plus, adding another weapon for your rookie quarterback is never a bad thing. The fact that Odunze has been working out with Williams - along with Moore and Allen - is just too much at this point. I'm going to be seriously disappointed if this doesn't come to pass.\n\nBrendan Sugrue\n\nTexas Longhorns defensive lineman Byron Murphy II (90) celebrates after a sack against TCU Horned Frogs quarterback Josh Hoover (10) in the second quarter of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, November. 11, 2023, at Amon G. Carter Stadium in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nNo. 1: QB Caleb Williams, USC\n\nNo explanation needed. Williams has been penciled in for a long time and now it's about to become reality.\n\nNo. 9: DT Byron Murphy II, Texas\n\nDepending on how the draft progresses, there are a few directions the Bears can go. Wide receiver is on many fans' minds, and there's a realistic possibility someone like Rome Odunze or Malik Nabers is available at No. 9. But even if they are, it sounds like the Bears are extremely high on Byron Murphy. The Texas standout would give Matt Eberflus his coveted three-technique defensive tackle and raise the play of everyone on the line, including Montez Sweat. He's someone who has the potential to turn this defense into a top-five unit in 2024.\n\nIt seems odd to not give Williams a game-changing weapon or even better protection with a tackle, but I could easily see Murphy being the top target all along.\n\nRyan Fedrau\n\nMalik Nabers 8 as the LSU Tigers take on Texas A&M in Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, November 25, 2023.\n\nNo. 1: QB Caleb Williams, USC\n\nThe Bears haven't made it a secret, they love Caleb Williams. They're going to take him. He is considered far and away the top quarterback on the board, and it's up to Williams and the Bears to prove the experts and fans correct. It's hard to see them making any other decision unless something unforeseen happens between now and draft time.\n\nNo. 9: WR Malik Nabers, LSU\n\nCaleb Williams is going to have one of the most talented offenses that a number-one pick quarterback has had in years. This roster is a playoff roster, and with Malik Nabers joining DJ Moore and Keenan Allen, it's going to be hard to stop Chicago's passing attack. Now, the Bears are low on draft capital in this draft, so if Nabers, or another top target is off the board at 9, don't be surprised to see them trade down to acquire additional picks to help fill out this roster.\n\nNate Atkins\n\nEVANSTON, ILLINOIS - SEPTEMBER 30: Olumuyiwa Fashanu #74 of the Penn State Nittany Lions in action against the Northwestern Wildcats during the second half at Ryan Field on September 30, 2023 in Evanston, Illinois. (Photo by Michael Reaves/Getty Images)\n\nNo. 1: QB Caleb Williams, USC\n\nCaleb Williams has exceptional arm talent, mobility, and leadership skills, making him the perfect fit for the Bears offensive scheme under coordinator Shane Waldron. Caleb's ability to make accurate throws on the run and extend plays with his legs will add a new dimension to the offense.\n\nHe has the potential to be a franchise quarterback and can become the cornerstone of the Bears for years to come. Williams will compete for the starting job from day one, and Chicago has already begun surrounding him with the tools he needs to succeed.\n\nNo. 9: OT Olu Fashanu, Penn State\n\nWilliams' high school teammate, Olu Fashanu, is a talented offensive tackle who will be a key contributor to Chicago's offensive line. His size, strength, and athleticism make him an ideal fit for their outside zone running scheme and play-action passing game.\n\nOlu's experience in a pro-style offense at Penn State has prepared him well for the NFL. The Bears will ask Fashanu to compete for a starting role at left tackle, hoping he becomes a long-term starter on offense.\n\nVinnie Parise\n\nOct 28, 2023; Berkeley, California, USA; USC Trojans quarterback Caleb Williams (13) gestures after scoring a touchdown against the California Golden Bears during the third quarter at California Memorial Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Darren Yamashita-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNo. 1: QB Caleb Williams, USC\n\nThe Chicago Bears are going to select Caleb Williams with the first overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. This has been the consensus ever since they traded Justin Fields to the Pittsburgh Steelers back in March. Williams is going to come in hoping to be the savior at quarterback that the Bears have always needed. If he does that, he will be a legend in town forever.\n\nNo. 9: WR Rome Odunze, Washington\n\nIf Rome Odunze is there for the Bears at 9, they have to make that move. He is an explosive WR that proved he can be amazing at a high level. The Washington star would be a great addition to a Bears offense that has slowly been building.

Ouch.\n\nSome Bears fans assumed the decision between Williams or Fields was a difficult one --- one that would drag Poles to his wit's end in trying to decide. That doesn't appear to have been the case, according to this report. But, as Poles said, it was difficult for the Bears to trade Fields, who Poles jokingly said he wished was a meaner person so it would be easier to trade him.\n\nOn March 16, just under two weeks after the NFL Scouting Combine, the Bears traded Fields to the Steelers for a conditional sixth-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. But the Bears had known well before then they planned to trade him.\n\nAt the combine, Poles hinted about the Bears trading Fields by saying the team wished to \"do right by\" Fields, giving him ample time and opportunity to fit with his next team. They did that, trading him a few days after NFL free agency opened and choosing a trade partner of Fields' preference.\n\nNow, the path for the Bears to draft Williams is wide open. They met with him. He met with them. They only met with each other during top-30 visits leading up to the draft. And now the time has finally come for the two to officially join forces.\n\nAll that's left is for Roger Goodell to read his name to the Bears on Thursday night in Detroit.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NFL Scouting Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Goodell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Goodell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ji94i5LH_sWLDaNpR6BCXA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnchicago.com/86b6e44c87a586aa150537deb76eda51", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-16", "textStart": 994, "textEnd": 1002}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

(AP) - The Chicago Bears know who they're taking with the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft and so does just about everyone else too.\n\nGeneral manager Ryan Poles just wasn't ready to announce it's Caleb Williams on Tuesday. He opted to leave that to commissioner Roger Goodell on Thursday night.\n\n\"So unfortunately it\u00b4s one of those things I think everyone\u00b4s got to tune in on Thursday to watch and figure out, but I feel really good about our process and where we are and where we\u00b4re headed,\" Poles said, smiling. \"So we know what we\u00b4re going to do but everyone is going to have to wait until Thursday to go there.\"\n\nBarring a massive surprise, the Bears will kick off the draft by grabbing the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner and setting themselves on a course they hope takes them to the top of the NFL. They also have the ninth overall pick as well as a third-rounder (75) and a fourth-rounder (122).\n\nChicago has been the likely landing spot for Williams since he announced in an Instagram post in January that he was leaving USC and turning pro.\n\nThe Bears are in this position thanks to a blockbuster trade last year with Carolina. Chicago sent the No. 1 pick in 2023 to the Panthers for receiver DJ Moore and their first-rounder this year. Carolina finished with a league-worst 2-15 mark.\n\nFILE - Southern California quarterback Caleb Williams speaks during a press conference at the NFL football scouting combine in Indianapolis, Friday, March 1, 2024. Williams is expected to be taken in the first round of the NFL Draft. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy, File)\n\nWilliams checks all the boxes with his arm strength and ability to avoid defenders. He can extend plays and make throws on the run as well as in the pocket - an area where former starter Justin Fields struggled.\n\nWilliams had 93 touchdowns and 14 interceptions during three seasons at Oklahoma and USC. He threw for 72 TDs and just 10 interceptions in two years with the Trojans. He also showed the ability to run with 27 rushing touchdowns in college.\n\nWilliams followed coach Lincoln Riley from Norman to Los Angeles and won the Heisman in 2022. Williams threw for 4,537 yards, 42 touchdowns and five interceptions to lift USC from four wins in 2021 to 11 and an appearance in the Cotton Bowl.\n\nWilliams put up big numbers again last season while the Trojans struggled to an 8-5 record with one of the nation's worst defenses. He threw for 3,333 yards, 30 touchdowns and five interceptions in 12 games. He did not play in the Holiday Bowl.\n\nThe Bears have been eyeing Williams throughout the draft process. They met with him at the combine and spent a few days with him leading into his pro day in Los Angeles.\n\nWilliams also made a top 30 visit to Halas Hall and got to have dinner with some of the team's players, including linebacker T.J. Edwards.\n\n\"You get to know people and how they fit in the culture and things like that,\" Edwards said. \"At the end of the day once we get people here and once whoever is signed will be here, we\u00b4ll hit the ground running with that.\"\n\nPoles said the feedback about Williams he got from the players at the dinner was positive.\n\n\"I think it just confirmed a lot of information that we got,\" he said. \"You know, there\u00b4s a kind of test to where his football understanding is. That part, getting him with some of our players. That\u00b4s important to us. We\u00b4re in a really good place with our culture in our locker room. As much as I can I want those guys a part of the process of building this team. I trust their feedback and I think that chemistry is really important so that\u00b4s why we did that.\"\n\nThe Bears are 10-24 in two seasons under Poles and coach Matt Eberflus. But after going 7-10 last season, they believe they are poised to take another big step.\n\nWilliams would have two star receivers to work with in Moore and the recently acquired Keenan Allen as well as two productive tight ends in Cole Kmet and newcomer Gerald Everett. He has big goals, saying on The Pivot Podcast that he hopes to spend 20 years with one team and chase Tom Brady's record seven Super Bowl wins.\n\n\"I love it,\" Poles said. \"I think we all should have huge goals. We have huge goals here - win multiple championships. And that\u00b4s what we shoot for. You\u00b4re more intentional when you have these goals, you have to live a certain way, you have to practice a certain way, you have to go about your business a certain way in order to accomplish those. If everything else is in line underneath that, that gets me excited.\"\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

If you've waited until the big day to dig into the storylines, you may be wondering exactly what Bears GM Ryan Poles is working with this year. If that's the case, we've got you covered.\n\nPoles has done lots of wheeling and dealing to end up with the team's current slate of picks. Of course, more deals could be on the horizon to change what the Bears are working with, again.\n\nPoles got this year's No. 1 overall pick in the deal that sent last year's No. 1 overall pick to Carolina. He acquired the No. 122 overall pick from Philadelphia when they swapped places with the Bears last year to draft Jalen Carter. The Bears ended up with Darnell Wright after that move.\n\nThe Bears' second-round pick belongs to the Commanders thanks to the move that brought Montez Sweat to Chicago. The Chargers have their fourth-rounder due to the Keenan Allen trade. The Bears sent their fifth-round pick to Buffalo for versatile interior offensive lineman Ryan Bates and their sixth-round pick to Miami for fellow interior o-lineman Dan Feeney.

Nothing less. Same person every day. What they saw at the dinner is the person I am five years from now, 10 years from now, 15 years from now. Maybe just a couple more accolades on that list. Just being the same guy, getting around them, learning them and them learning me.\"\n\nWide receiver DJ Moore, tight end Cole Kmet, and linebacker T.J. Edwards were among the veterans at the dinner.\n\nWilliams liked that members of the offense and defense were present at the dinner. He hopes that will allow everyone on the team, even those who weren't present, to get a complete understanding of who he is through word of mouth.\n\n\"I enjoyed all of them,\" Williams said. \"It was defensive guys and offensive guys in there. It was a good mix to be able to go back to the guys - if that was the place to go, that I was going to go - it was good for them to be able to go back to the guys and speak on how I am instead of all the stuff that everybody sees everyday on me.\"\n\nThere has been a lot of talk about Williams' ability to win over a locker room that was strong in its support of keeping quarterback Justin Fields, who was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nSeveral veterans, including Moore, cornerback Jaylon Johnson, and defensive end Montez Sweat have offered their advice to Williams on how to ingratiate himself to the locker room.\n\nDuring an interview on \"Up and Adams,\" Johnson referred to Williams as \"Hollywood.\" That phrase was uttered again Tuesday when Poles explained what he learned about Williams from the dinner and what the veterans took away.\n\n\"Really intelligent guy. He came across as a really good teammate,\" Poles said about Bears veterans' feedback of Williams. \"Easy to talk to, down to earth. You know, we've talked through this process about, you know, the whole Hollywood thing. He's all ball, wants to work, wants to get better, wants to win as a team. That's the No. 1 thing for him on top of being successful. So I think the biggest thing is: Does he fit with our culture and what we're trying to do? And all signs were that he does, so that's a positive.\"\n\nThe Bears settled on Williams as the No. 1 pick early in the pre-draft process. He is the only quarterback they hosted on a top-30 visit, and the Bears are the only team Williams visited.\n\nEveryone knows Williams will be the No. 1 pick Thursday, even if Poles wouldn't publicly declare his intentions Tuesday.\n\n\"I think everyone's got to tune in on Thursday to watch and figure out,\" Poles said. \"But I feel really good about our process, and where we are and where we're headed.

Scouts and coaches would be divided into three groups. Each would be assigned a specific position and have to argue the merits of drafting it at the 9th spot. This would help give the team clarity on where their focus should be. One group would argue wide receivers, another offensive tackles, and the last would handle pass rushers.\n\nIt appears the field has shifted in recent weeks. According to Jonathan Jones of CBS Sports, the Bears have narrowed their focus to two positions at #9.\n\n\"Sources around the league seem to believe the Chicago Bears will go one of two ways with the No. 9 pick: pass rusher or wide receiver.\n\nThe Bears sent a fourth-round pick to L.A. to get Keenan Allen in the offseason, but he's 32 this season with one year left on his deal. I sent Chicago Rome Odunze in my mock with the thought Allen is a one-year veteran rental to lead the wide receiver room in a crucial Caleb Williams rookie year. Also, the Bears have been very serious about commitment under president Kevin Warren. I could see Chicago taking a receiver at No. 9 to prove to Williams and the rest of the league how serious the Bears are about this offense. Remember, they locked up offensive coordinator Shane Waldron with lightning speed in the offseason.\n\nOther sources have pointed out the Bears could use the pick on a pass rusher to take some pressure off Montez Sweat. It's a good idea, and it makes roster-composition sense. But the Bears sent a second-round pick to Washington for Sweat (and then paid him) because they didn't anticipate strong options in free agency or the draft this year.\"\n\nOffensive tackle was a worthwhile discussion, but it's not what you'd call a pressing need. Braxton Jones proved last year he can be a solid option on the left side. Darnell Wright could become a stud on the right side. The Bears have far more pressing needs at receiver and pass rusher. Keenan Allen turns 32 this year and will be a free agent in 2025. Their best option opposite Montez Sweat right now is DeMarcus Walker. Neither situation is ideal.\n\nThe Chicago Bears must wait to see how the board unfolds.\n\nAs things stand, quarterbacks are expected to go in the first three picks. The first situation to watch is Arizona at #4. Some think they may trade back to another QB-needy team. However, it feels more likely they stay put and take a top receiver, likely Marvin Harrison Jr. If that happens, the Chargers at #5 become the trade-up spot, with the Giants eyeing a QB at #6. If that happens, New York will likely grab the next receiver. Then you can safely assume Notre Dame left tackle Joe Alt goes to Tennessee at #7.\n\nAtlanta at #8 is the team that will likely dictate what the Chicago Bears do. Most predict they will take the best pass rusher on their board. If that happens, one can safely assume Poles grabs that last receiver. However, there is a chance the Falcons move down with a team wanting to come up for said receiver. In such an event, the Bears will take the pass rusher instead. Either way, the team should end up with a blue-chip talent. The wild card in all of this is whether Poles is determined to trade down himself.", "source": {"uri": "sportsmockery.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mockery"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Any big surprise in store? Best pick of the last decade?", "body": "Brad Biggs, Chicago Tribune\n\nNFL draft week is finally here, and the Chicago Bears -- with two picks in the top nine -- will be at the center of attention Thursday night.\n\nBefore general manager Ryan Poles (almost certainly) chooses USC quarterback Caleb Williams at No. 1 shortly after 7 p.m. Thursday, the Tribune's Brad Biggs answers one more round of readers' draft questions in the weekly Bears mailbag.\n\nIs the wide receiver class in this draft deep enough to not care about getting one at No. 9? With only four picks and still several roster holes, wouldn't it be smart to trade down and fill those holes as the draft comes? Could you see the Bears trading back multiple times throughout the draft? -- @monturnerx\n\nI don't see as many holes as you perhaps do. Could the Bears use an edge rusher opposite Montez Sweat? Yes. Is it a glaring hole? Not like it was a year ago. Could they use an offensive tackle? Yes, if they have a high grade on one and aren't keen on left tackle Braxton Jones' developmental curve, it would make plenty of sense. Can they use a wide receiver? No question. They're a little thin after DJ Moore and Keenan Allen, and Allen is entering a contract year. Could they use a penetrating defensive tackle? No question.\n\nPeople are also reading...

That's why general manager Ryan Poles was able to say with confidence that he has flexibility in reacting to what happens Thursday night in the first eight picks.\n\nI think there's a bit of a gap between the first three receivers -- Marvin Harrison Jr., Malik Nabers and Rome Odunze (put them in any order you like) -- and the rest of the class. So getting a top-three receiver considering Allen's age (32 on Saturday) and contract situation makes a lot of sense. Without a lot of picks, it's hard to say where the Bears could target another receiver.\n\nI wouldn't rule out a trade down. If the Bears do go that route, it opens the possibility they could draft a center (another position that sits between need and want after the acquisition of Ryan Bates and Coleman Shelton). But I don't think we'll see the Bears trade down time and time again to fill out a draft class. They're not at that point right now in team building where they need to fill depth. They need elite talent.\n\n\"Things shift and change as you go along,\" Poles said Tuesday. \"It's going to be hard to make this team now. It's going to be really hard to make this team. That doesn't mean you don't want more shots later. We'll always welcome a lot of picks. But it doesn't force you to panic about the situation we're in right now with how many picks we have. So it fits our roster but it also fits what we just talked about -- the current status of this draft and then moving forward what next year looks like as well.\"\n\nIs there any outcome of the draft that would be truly disappointing? Assuming Caleb Williams goes No. 1, what positional selection would make you scratch your head? -- @noahlaporte\n\nI don't know that there is one because when you look at how the board could shake out, there will be some top options at a handful of positions that make perfect sense for the Bears. That's one reason Ryan Poles and assistant GM Ian Cunningham were able to project so much confidence Tuesday when they discussed the draft without saying much of anything about their plans.\n\nDepending on how things go -- and I'm talking primarily about how many quarterbacks come off the board in the top eight picks after Caleb Williams goes No. 1 -- the Bears will have multiple options and all of them can be deemed good ones. They can sell almost any outcome here and walk away feeling confident they made moves to position themselves as a challenger in the NFC North. I really don't see a wild-card outcome that would be a head scratcher and have social media and sports-talk airwaves demanding explanations.\n\nMy guess right now is the Bears might be focusing on Washington wide receiver Rome Odunze and Texas defensive tackle Byron Murphy II if they stay at No. 9. There's a good chance one of them is available, and both could be on the board when the Bears go on the clock. Neither of those moves would be a head scratcher, and you also could make a good argument to draft an edge rusher or an offensive tackle. Heck, you could talk me into Georgia tight end Brock Bowers, too, and that possibility shouldn't be discounted even though the Bears have Cole Kmet and Gerald Everett. It will be fascinating. I can almost promise that.\n\nWhat would really surprise you on Thursday night? -- Paul P., Chicago\n\nThat's pretty open-ended. I'll share a really interesting one floating around that I heard from a team Tuesday morning. How about the Minnesota Vikings -- who own two first-round picks and are believed to be lurking for a possible trade up to nab one of the top quarterbacks -- dealing both of those picks and more to acquire Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert? In that scenario, the Chargers would select Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy with the fifth pick.\n\nCrazy? I think so. I can't imagine why the Chargers would want to deal Herbert, an elite quarterback who only needs more talent around him. That would constitute a bombshell Thursday night and would really energize the NFC North if the Vikings were able to solve their QB dilemma with a player of Herbert's caliber. Buckle up.\n\nHere's a question I'm surprised hasn't been addressed yet: What assurances does Caleb Williams have that he's not going to endure what his past two predecessors did -- get drafted by a head coach who gets fired after the first season? My hope was that they would have fired Matt Eberflus, hired a new coach and traded Justin Fields so it would be a clean slate. Or if they kept Eberflus, give some guarantee of at least two years so the rookie QB gets at least two seasons under the same head coach. -- Brien B., Omaha, Neb.\n\nThe only assurance Williams will receive is the fully guaranteed, four-year contract for the No. 1 pick that should be worth about $38.5 million. Draft picks don't get any promises in regard to what might happen with coaches, staff members, teammates, whatever.\n\nWe've been over this issue but it's been a few months. This was a hot topic back in January, and what's noteworthy is the Bears didn't rush into anything. As you recall, they met for a couple of days at the end of the season before deciding who would return and who wouldn't. It would not have been surprising if they had opted for an offensive-minded head coach, but Ryan Poles liked the way Eberflus kept the team together after a miserable start last season and how the defense got progressively better as the year went on. There was growth and development by younger players.\n\nWill there be pressure on Eberflus and his staff entering this season? Sure. There isn't a gig in the NFL that doesn't come with pressure. I'd also point out the overwhelming majority of questions regarding firings overlook the reality that it's really hard to get the next hire right. That's why we see the carousel for head coaches, coordinators and position coaches spinning annually.\n\nIn Drew Brees' prime, announcers harped on about how the Saints prioritized the interior of their offensive line due to Brees' height. If that was legitimately true (and not a talking point to fill time), should the Bears prioritize trading back for the great G/C prospects to offset Caleb Williams' height? -- Ryan W.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThat's a good question because, according to the combine measurements, Williams is only one-eighth of an inch taller than the 6-1 Brees was when he came out of Purdue. However, you should consider that we're talking about different players. Brees was short for the position and was not particularly mobile. Williams is just a shade taller but he's able to reset in the pocket, elude rushers, create plays on the move and, when needed, tuck the ball and run. Because they are different athletically, I don't think you can just look at measurements and apply the same thinking.\n\nYou're right that the Saints put an emphasis on being strong from guard to guard to allow Brees to find throwing windows. That's something former Bears offensive coordinator Aaron Kromer talked about when he came from New Orleans. It was an interesting strategy and the Saints did a nice job of it, but it's not like that initiative came at the expense of locating high-caliber tackles. You still have to be elite on the edges.\n\nThe Bears have done some work on offensive linemen who are unlikely to be in play at No. 9, and one who jumps out is West Virginia center Zach Frazier. He might be the best at the position in this class and is probably a late first-round pick or early Day 2 selection. So I'd imagine he's in discussions in scenarios where the team trades the ninth pick Thursday.\n\nWhat has been the best Bears' draft pick over the last decade? -- Dylan J., Peoria\n\nThat's another open-ended question and you could make a good case for a handful of players. Cornerback Tyrique Stevenson has a chance to be a really impactful player as a second-round pick a year ago, but it's too early to tell what his career arc will look like. Cornerback Jaylon Johnson, a second-round pick in 2020, belongs in this conversation. Free safety Eddie Jackson was a fourth-round selection in 2017 and had a really strong career for the Bears.\n\nIf I had to pick one right now, I'd probably go with recently retired left tackle Charles Leno, a seventh-round pick by GM Phil Emery in 2014. The 246th pick that year, Leno made 141 career starts and 94 were with the Bears. He was added to the Pro Bowl roster in 2018, and while Leno was never an elite talent, the Bears got solid play out of him for a long time without ever having to pay him top money at the position.\n\nWhat's absent is a lot of picks at the top of the draft where you look back and say, \"That was a home run.\" Linebacker Roquan Smith, the eighth pick in 2018, remains fantastic. You should get that with some kind of regularity when you're picking that high. That's why it's imperative the Bears come out of this draft with a special talent at No. 9 or after a slight trade down.\n\nIf the Bears draft one of the top three receivers, could three alpha receivers be content with a rookie quarterback? -- Bobby D., Arizona\n\nFair question. My first reaction is it's not about the experience of the quarterback but the performance. If a 10-year veteran is stinking it up, things won't be peachy for three alpha receivers just because the quarterback has some experience.\n\nDJ Moore proved to be a total pro last season, especially at the beginning of the year when he inexplicably wasn't getting the ball. He didn't have any history I'm aware of for complaining about subpar QB play when he was with the Carolina Panthers, and there was a lot of that going on. Keenan Allen is entering a contract year so I doubt he's going to create waves, but I don't have any insight into his locker-room demeanor. A rookie needs to find his way. I don't believe this would be a concern for Ryan Poles if he uses the ninth pick on a wide receiver.\n\nIn fact, I'd probably flip this around and turn it into a positive. What better situation for a rookie quarterback? Moore, Allen and a top-three receiver in this draft class would put a rookie quarterback in a tremendous position to learn and succeed.\n\nThere have been numerous scenarios for what the Bears will do with their ninth pick. Rarely, if ever, do I see a scenario similar to what worked so well for them last year: receiving a player (DJ Moore) as part of a draft trade. Any chance the Bears might find a draft partner several selections down who might be willing to part with a talented player at a key position -- perhaps from a cap-strapped team -- to move up in the draft? If so, what might such a scenario look like? -- Jim A., Plymouth, Minn.\n\nIn your scenario, which I believe is highly unlikely, you trade the uncertainty of how a draft pick will develop and perform in return for a player with a high salary-cap number. Keep making moves like this (trading for Moore, trading for Montez Sweat, trading for a player in your scenario, spending in free agency) and you're going to run into cap issues and before long have an aging roster. The Bears need to trust in their scouting department, believe in their player development program and select a rookie who can flourish for them while benefiting from a cost-controlled four-year contract that will include a fifth-year option.\n\nWhen does DJ Moore get a contract extension? And do you think Keenan Allen gets an extension before the season? -- rtindenverco\n\nRelated ArticlesChicago Bears | Chicago Bears sign assistant GM Ian Cunningham to a contract extensionChicago Bears | Column: When Chicago's sports executives speak, people listen -- then decipher the real meaningChicago Bears | 2024 NFL draft: Everything you need to know, including when the Chicago Bears pick and how you can watchChicago Bears | How will Caleb Williams fit into the team culture the Chicago Bears are building? 'He's all ball, wants to work.'Chicago Bears | Taxpayers would pick up half the tab for Bears' lakefront stadium development, sources say\n\nThat's hard to forecast and the team will keep any contract talks super buttoned up. It was pretty clear the Bears' first priority last offseason was getting a new deal done with tight end Cole Kmet, and that process stretched out over a few months. Attention has rightfully been on free agency and the draft, and there's no rush to get something done with Moore, who has two years remaining on the contract the Bears inherited when they acquired him in a trade from the Carolina Panthers. My guess -- and this is just a hunch -- is that topic could be introduced later this spring or this summer. Does that mean something will get done? I have no guess on that. It takes two sides to hammer out a deal and you never know how things will go.\n\nAs far as Allen, the Bears picked up a player with an outstanding track record who is coming off an elite season. That being said, I don't understand why there would be any urgency to consider a new contract for him at this point. Allen turns 32 on Saturday and will be entering his 12th NFL season. He did not slow down in 2023 but he will before long. I wouldn't rule out Allen being with the Bears beyond this season, but we have to see if they draft a wide receiver in Round 1 and how Allen plays this season. Allen might not be in a rush either.\n\nRyan Poles and the front office could feel differently, but as methodical as the Bears have been with some of their cash/cap decisions, you have to expect they would carefully weigh a big investment in a player of Allen's age and experience, especially when they're going to be paying Moore a lot.\n\nThere are so many mock drafts on the sports websites, newspapers, podcasts, etc., and each seem to stretch credulity to get clicks. Aside from the Bears not taking Caleb Williams, what's the silliest mock draft selection you've seen this year? -- @caljestice\n\nIt will be easy to call them all silly by the time the dust settles Thursday night and Round 1 is in the books. An incredible mock draft will nail five or six picks. Between the unpredictability of trades and not fully knowing how teams weigh the character of individual prospects or how they delineate between needs/wants and draft grades, it's a crap shoot. Throw in medical information and, well, we're all guessing.\n\nThe most amusing stuff I saw this year was silly-season mocks by wishcasters in which the Bears opted to build around Justin Fields with their draft capital. Here's another chance for you to mock my final mock draft.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Professional Sports Sports Football (american) National Football League Team Sports Player

But there's still some important work for general manager Ryan Poles to do in the draft.\n\nWhen looking at this offense, there aren't a lot of concerns. In fact, quarterback is the one glaring hole, and it'll be officially addressed when Williams is selected at No. 1 overall. Outside of that, the Bears have some explosive weapons and a solid offensive line.\n\nAhead of the 2024 NFL draft, we're projecting what the Bears starting offense will look like:\n\nQB Caleb Williams\n\nNov 18, 2023; Los Angeles, California, USA; USC Trojans quarterback Caleb Williams (13) scrambles during the second quarter against the UCLA Bruins at United Airlines Field at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Mandatory Credit: Jason Parkhurst-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Bears finally made a decision at quarterback when they traded Justin Fields to the Steelers, an indication that Chicago is entering its Caleb Williams era. Williams is the best prospect in this draft class and some have touted him as a generational prospect. He'll be tasked with starting immediately as a rookie, as Tyson Bagent would be the only other quarterback on the roster.\n\nRB D'Andre Swift\n\nOct 15, 2023; East Rutherford, New Jersey, USA; Philadelphia Eagles running back D'Andre Swift (0) carries the ball during the first half against the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports\n\nChicago added a dynamic running back in Swift in free agency, and he'll serve as the new starting running back in Shane Waldron's offense. Swift joins a running back group that also features Khalil Herbert and Roschon Johnson, giving the Bears a nice complement of backs with unique skillsets. Swift is coming off a career year, where he rushed for 1,000-plus yards, and he also gives Chicago a receiving threat out of the backfield.\n\nWR DJ Moore\n\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS - OCTOBER 15: DJ Moore #2 of the Chicago Bears takes the field prior to the game against the Minnesota Vikings at Soldier Field on October 15, 2023 in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Michael Reaves/Getty Images)\n\nThere's no disputing who's WR1, as Moore is the most reliable passing catching option currently on the roster. Moore is coming off a career year, where he totaled 96 catches, 1,364 yards and eight touchdowns. He's a playmaker in every sense, and he'll be key to Caleb Williams' rookie success.\n\nWR Keenan Allen\n\nJan 8, 2023; Denver, Colorado, USA; Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Keenan Allen (13) catches the ball and runs for a touchdown in the first quarter against the Denver Broncos at Empower Field at Mile High. Mandatory Credit: Isaiah J. Downing-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Bears made a splash trading for Allen during the first wave of free agency, which addressed a huge hole at receiver. Allen is a six-time Pro Bowler who's consistently been one of the NFL's best wideouts -- and now he teams up with Moore. Allen is coming off a 1,000-yard season, where he played just 13 games in 2023. While Allen has just one year left on his current contract, the expectation is Chicago will at some point sign him to a contract extension after giving up a fourth-round pick for him.\n\nWR (Rookie)\n\nJan 1, 2024; New Orleans, LA, USA; Washington Huskies wide receiver Rome Odunze (1) warms up before playing against the Texas Longhorns in the 2024 Sugar Bowl college football playoff semifinal game at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWhile Chicago made a huge addition with Allen, the Bears could double-dip at receiver this offseason. If things go right, Chicago might be able to snag wither Malik Nabers or Rome Odunze, who would be WR1 prospects any other draft cycle. If they're both off the board, the Bears could trade back and still land a playmaker, like Brian Thomas Jr. or Xavier Worthy. Imagine that cast of weapons for Williams.\n\nTE Cole Kmet\n\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS - DECEMBER 10: Cole Kmet #85 of the Chicago Bears runs the ball after a catch during the second quarter in the game against the Detroit Lions at Soldier Field on December 10, 2023 in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Quinn Harris/Getty Images)\n\nAfter signing a four-year contract extension, Kmet went on to have his best season with the Bears. He emerged as a true threat in the passing game, setting career highs with 73 catches for 719 yards while adding six touchdowns. He'll again be a focal point in 2024. And he'll work with a new face that will serve as the perfect complement to his skillset: Gerald Everett, who signed with the team this offseason.\n\nLT Braxton Jones\n\nDec 31, 2023; Chicago, Illinois, USA; Chicago Bears offensive lineman Braxton Jones (70) blocks against the Atlanta Falcons at Soldier Field. Mandatory Credit: Jamie Sabau-USA TODAY Sports\n\nJones, a former fifth-round pick, has been a solid left tackle for the Bears, and the assumption right now is he'll once again be the guy in 2024. But we know Poles is always looking to upgrade positions -- especially premium ones -- and we could very well see Chicago land a top tackle prospect in the draft. Poles noted offensive tackle is the deepest position group in this draft class.\n\nLG Teven Jenkins\n\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS - DECEMBER 10: Teven Jenkins #76 of the Chicago Bears in action against the Detroit Lions at Soldier Field on December 10, 2023 in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Michael Reaves/Getty Images)\n\nJenkins has been the Bears' best offensive lineman for the past couple of seasons, and hopefully he won't have to make a position switch for the third straight year. Jenkins has been solid both at left guard and right guard, where his only issue has been staying healthy. He's still yet to play an entire season, which could very well explain the Ryan Bates trade, as the team looks to lock down a key reserve.\n\nC Coleman Shelton\n\nNov 26, 2023; Glendale, Arizona, USA; Los Angeles Rams center Coleman Shelton (65) against the Arizona Cardinals at State Farm Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIt certainly looks like there will be competition at center between newcomers Shelton and Bates. Right now, the edge goes to Shelton, who was the starting center for the Rams over the past two years. There will certainly be competition between Shelton and Bates, but Shelton's experience is why I have him penciled in as the starting center.\n\nRG Nate Davis\n\nLANDOVER, MARYLAND - OCTOBER 05: Head coach Matt Eberflus of the Chicago Bears greets Nate Davis #64 prior to the game against the Washington Commanders at FedExField on October 05, 2023 in Landover, Maryland.

But due to personal matters and later injury, Davis was never able to really settle into his role and notably struggled. While Chicago could very well find an upgrade at guard, Davis' cap hit ($11.35 million with a dead money hit of $11 million) certainly would make it difficult for the team to part ways with him. But that doesn't mean there won't be competition, perhaps from Bates, for the starting job.\n\nRT Darnell Wright\n\nJan 7, 2024; Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA; Chicago Bears offensive tackle Darnell Wright (58) during the game against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field. Mandatory Credit: Jeff Hanisch-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWright was Chicago's top draft pick last year, and he more than lived up to the hype. Wright had an impressive rookie year, where he was the only offensive lineman to play in every game last season and showed plenty of promise. While Wright did have his rookie moments, he showed solid development and the potential to be a franchise right tackle for the Bears.", "source": {"uri": "bearswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news",

He said it will match his navy suit -- which has silver accents -- and the dress his girlfriend wears to Thursday night's NFL draft.\n\nPainting his nails helps Caleb Williams relax.\n\n\"I feel comfy in my own skin,\" the USC quarterback said.\n\nSuch declarations have been a Rorschach test for a segment of the Bears' fan base eager to poke holes in Williams' prospect status -- on the field, no one in this draft has fewer -- or to stick up for the since-departed Justin Fields. Nonetheless, there's no questioning Williams' comfort level as an iconoclast. He was the first quarterback to skip medical testing at the NFL Scouting Combine. He doesn't have an agent. So sure was Williams of his status as the draft's No. 1 overall pick that he visited one NFL facility -- Halas Hall -- during the pre-draft process.\n\nHe was proven right. The Bears will draft him No. 1 overall Thursday.\n\nWilliams was college football's first Name, Image and Likeness millionaire. He does Dr Pepper commercials and flies to Formula 1 races. Denzel Washington takes him to dinner to give him advice about handling celebrity. When Steak 48 in Beverly Hills wouldn't let Williams in -- he'd recently cut his hair and was wearing a sweatsuit -- Washington walked up to the ma\u00eetre d and turned into his furious character from \"Training Day.\"\n\n\"'Movie Denzel,'\" Williams said. \"He goes off on the guy and he goes back to regular Denzel. He's giving me wisdom.\"\n\nWhen Williams walks across the stage Thursday night -- silver pinkie and all -- he will be unlike any quarterback to ever put on a Bears jersey. Given the franchise's woeful history at the position, that's a good thing.\n\n\"He handles the criticism and the media that's thrown at him very well, honestly,\" Washington receiver Rome Odunze said. \"He continues to be his own person, which is very commendable. On top of that, he's a tremendous football player.\"\n\nHe's clearly the top choice in this year's draft. The Bears confirmed as much this offseason.\n\nAfter general manager Ryan Poles first met Williams at the NFL Scouting Combine, he traded Fields and led a contingent of coaches and executives to USC's pro day in March. When Williams came to Halas Hall earlier this month, the Bears sent him to dinner with their veteran players.\n\n\"I'm just one of them -- nothing more, nothing less,\" Williams said. \"Same person every day. What they saw at the dinner is the person that I am five years from now, 10 years from now, 15 years from now.\n\n\"Hopefully with a couple more accolades on that list.\"\n\nThe Bears -- whose greatest quarterback, Sid Luckman, retired 74 years ago -- would happily take that. They've already spent the offseason building support for the USC star, trading for receiver Keenan Allen, signing running back D'Andre Swift and hiring offensive coordinator Shane Waldron, whom Williams praised for helping revive Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith's career.\n\n\"You have a lot to work with where you could potentially have a superstar player ...\" NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah said of Williams. \"I think he's extremely gifted. Does he have the upside, the potential, of being a top- five to -10 quarterback? He does.\"\n\nWilliams fielded increasingly ridiculous questioning Wednesday, from what player he'd like to trade closets with (Odell Beckham Jr.) to his expected Madden rating (81) to the first NFL jerseys he'd owned (Troy Polamalu, followed by Barry Sanders and Walter Payton). He smiled and refused to say which number he'll wear for the Bears, not wanting to jinx anything. Unofficially, he became the first draft prospect ever asked why didn't sign his SAG card.\n\nThe Bears say they're not worried about what Poles calls \"the whole Hollywood thing\" moving forward. Williams said he knows \"who I am, how hard I work, what I do in my daily life, how I act, how I treat people with respect.\"\n\nThe Bears believe Williams puts football first, something the quarterback reiterated at his pro day and at the NFL's charity event Wednesday. He bemoaned the fact that he hasn't been a part of a team since USC lost their regular season finale Nov. 18.\n\n\"That's probably the toughest part to me, and something I really want to get back to,\" he said Wednesday. \"In the locker room, to be around the guys.\"\n\nWhen Williams gets handed the navy jersey to match his suit Thursday night, he'll inherit one of the most difficult tasks across American sports -- to be a transcendent quarterback for a founding franchise that's never had one.\n\nThe Bears' quarterback history is so star-crossed that the McCaskey children grew up teasing their father Ed for calling heads when NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle flipped a silver dollar in a hotel ballroom prior to Super Bowl IV. Tails handed the Steelers the No. 1 overall draft pick -- and quarterback Terry Bradshaw, who won four Super Bowls on the way to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Bears never recovered.\n\n\"If you get too locked into the past, it can hold you back,\" chairman George McCaskey told the Sun-Times last month. \"That applies to success in the past or struggles in the past. This is a completely different situation. I think the important thing is to make the most of the opportunity.\"\n\nHistory always hovers at Halas Hall like mist, though.\n\nFifty-four years after the Bradshaw coin flip -- and one year after Poles traded the No. 1 overall pick, and a chance to draft a passer, to the Panthers -- the Bears are ready for their first-ever top pick at quarterback.\n\nWilliams is too.\n\n\"Chicago, if that's the place for me [Thursday], I can't wait,\" he said. \"All I've heard is great things about you all, and I'm ready to go.\"", "source": {"uri": "chicago.suntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Legendary Jerry Rice's son says he and Caleb Williams can be the Brady-Gronk of Chicago Bears\n\nUSC quarterback Caleb Williams is expected to be selected by the Chicago Bears as the first pick overall in the 2024 NFL Draft. The Bears are trying to revamp their franchise with Williams as head of this project, which also includes a project to build a brand new, state-of-the-art $5 billion lakefront stadium.\n\nAnticipating Williams' arrival, the Bears are prepared to offer him a substantial contract. However, their appeal extends beyond financial rewards. The prospect of being the face of a franchise on the rise, coupled with the allure of a proposed new stadium, is a compelling proposition that could sway Williams' decision.\n\nThe Chicago Bears announced their new project during a press conference on Wednesday, revealing the proposed design of their new domed stadium. The team's president, Kevin Warren, led the announcement. However, the project is causing a stir as it requires approximately $2 billion in public funding.\n\nOn his recent appearance on The Pivot, Williams was asked about the moment when the Bears traded away former high draft pick Justin Fields. Williams says it triggered a ton of phone calls and messages for him.\n\nAnd then he explained how that was the moment he knew the Bears thing was very real.\n\nI end up calling a couple of people and was like, 'Well, we know where [the Chicago Bears'] mind and heart is at at this instance, let's prepare, get ready and handle things accordingly'.

Last year, fans opted for a costly trade down for wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, passing on offensive tackle Darnell Wright in the process.\n\nThis year's fan-sourced mock draft started with a free space at No. 1 overall in Williams, and then the wheels started turning:\n\nThere was no point in leaving this one up to chance.\n\nWilliams has checked every box for the Bears during the pre-draft process. They tape and person match all the criteria laid out by general manager Ryan Poles, and those inside Halas Hall are convinced that Williams is uniquely wired to thrive in the Chicago pressure cooker.\n\nThe 2022 Heisman Trophy winner is embracing the pressure and expectations that will come with being a franchise savior, and the Bears have done their part to show Williams they are willing to invest in the necessary infrastructure for him to reach his lofty potential.\n\nArm talent, accuracy, escapability, and off-schedule playmaking -- Williams has it all. And the Bears will have their best chance at breaking an 80-year quarterback curse come Thursday when the No. 1 overall pick is holding up a blue and orange jersey.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the trade-down won out as fans elected to send the No. 9 pick to the Philadelphia Eagles for No. 22, No. 50, No. 120, and a 2024 third-round pick (this didn't meet the 25-character limit on the artist formerly known as Twitter but was necessary to get the deal done).\n\nGRADE: B-plus\n\nIf the four players listed aren't available, trading down is the best option. Going down to 22 is far, but it's a risk worth taking with no sure-fire elite edge rusher in the class. Getting the No. 50 overall pick is a much-needed Day 2 pickup.\n\nIt wasn't surprising to see Bowers, Latu, Latham, Dallas Turner, Latham, and Taliese Fuaga all go between nine and 22.\n\nBut the Bears caught a break here as Texas defensive tackle Byron Murphy, arguably the top defensive player in the class, fell to No. 22.\n\nGiven the choice between Murphy, Texas wide receiver Adonai Mitchell, Georgia offensive tackle Amarius Mims, and another trade down, Bears Twitter smartly elected to take Murphy and run.\n\nIn Murphy, the Bears get a twitchy, explosive defensive tackle that can cause consistent disruption from the interior. According to Pro Football Focus, he led all interior defensive linemen with a 19.6 percent pressure rate last season.\n\nMurphy is powerful, has a quick first step, and has the balance and flexion needed to shoot gaps and cause havoc in the backfield.\n\nHead coach Matt Eberflus gets the \"engine\" of his defense.\n\nGRADE: A\n\nThe Bears are back on the lock at No. 50 and had several intriguing wide receiver prospects to choose from as they look to get Williams another weapon.\n\nGiven the choice between Oregon's Troy Franklin, Florida's Ricky Pearsall, and Georgia's Ladd McConkey, Bears Twitter went with McConkey in a landslide.\n\nMcConkey is a Day 1-ready slot receiver who is a crisp route-runner with great hands. McConkey does a great job manipulating corners to create leverage and has the quickness and agility needed to rack up yards after the catch.\n\nWhile I like McConkey, his ceiling is probably as an excellent No. 3 receiver in a specific role. I think both Franklin and Pearsall have a higher upside, but there's no question McConkey will give the Bears' offense a lift immediately. They just might have missed out on a bigger prize.\n\nBut after a back-and-forth debate, Bears Twitter opted to pass on both Booker and Kneeland, as well as UCF receiver Javon Baker, and trade down to accumulate more picks.\n\nThe Bears send No. 75 to the Indianapolis Colts for Nos. 82 and 117.\n\nI understand the desire to add another pick, but Kneeland or Booker would fill another immediate need. Booker reminds scouts of Maxx Crosby, while Kneeland is a raw, toolsy prospect with a high ceiling.\n\nReturn isn't worth passing on Booker and Kneeland.\n\nGRADE: D+\n\nThe Bears luck out, and Booker is still on the board at 82, but Kansas State guard Cooper Beebe won the day in the war room, and it wasn't particularly close.\n\nBeebe is a big, powerful guard who is a bulldozer in the run game. His short arms could decrease his margin for error at the next level. Beebe is a strong pass-protector with good processing skills in stunts and games.\n\nBears Twitter came into the draft looking to add depth to the line and ensure there's a plan to protect Williams after 2024.\n\nWhile the Bears signed Coleman Shelton and traded for Ryan Bates this offseason, they still need to address the center position long-term.\n\nGiven a choice between USC wide receiver Brendan Rice, Colorado State edge rusher Mohamed Kamara, Pittsburgh offensive tackle Matt Goncalves, and Georgia center Sedrick Van Pran, the choice was easy.\n\nVan Pran is a scheme-versatile center with a high football IQ and tremendous athleticism. He has quick hands and great play strength. His technique still needs some polishing, but he should be a good depth piece in 2024 and can take over in 2025.\n\nGiven that the Bears have three picks in seven selections here, I probably would have taken Rice and banked on Van Pran being available at 120.\n\nWith the Bears back on the clock at 120, it is finally time to address the lack of edge-rushing depth by selecting Kamara.\n\nKamara relies heavily on his power since he lacks the prototypical length for a top-tier edge rusher. He was incredibly productive at Colorado State, thanks to his violent hands and the type of constant force and aggression that will lead to production in the NFL.\n\nHe's a decent depth piece, but this is where passing on Booker and Kneeland bites you.\n\nGRADE: C-plus\n\nThe draft ends with the Bears selecting another slot receiver, this time in the form of Luke McCaffrey.\n\nMcCaffrey doesn't have the explosion of his brother Christian, but he's got good hands and is a hard-nosed receiver who doesn't mind running into the teeth of the defense.\n\nThe former quarterback still needs to improve his route running, but with coaching, he could become a decent depth receiver.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

And make it memorable.\n\n\"I mean, football is about having fun,\" Williams said with a smile inside the Corner Ballpark facility on the site of the old Tiger Stadium.\n\nThat's a philosophy Williams likely will carry with him into the NFL and into Halas Hall when he arrives as the new Chicago Bears quarterback at the end of this week. The Bears are expected to draft Williams with the No. 1 pick a little after 7 p.m. Thursday, and the hope is before long he'll become the emcee of many an end-zone dance party.\n\nWilliams welcomed follow-up questions about his enthusiastic participation in Wednesday's wiggle-worthy moments with the kids in the clinic.\n\n\"I was joining in,\" he said. \"You've got to lead by example. I'm not like Beyonce or anything, but I'm all right. I'm not bad. I'll get out there. My hips don't lie.\"\n\nThe NFL draft finally has arrived, and almost the entire football world agrees that Williams is the no-brainer No. 1 selection for the Bears, who will be cashing in a gift from last year's predraft trade with the Carolina Panthers.\n\nIn Williams, the Bears will be landing a prospect with a wide range of quarterbacking gifts and an abundance of self-confidence. In many respects, it feels like an inflection point.\n\nMaybe Williams is finally the guy with the complete toolbox -- of talent, of football IQ, of leadership skills, of unflappable composure -- who will change the Bears' fortune.\n\nWilliams long ago made one of the top goals on his football climb to one day become the top pick in the NFL draft. That box is about to be checked.\n\n\"(I feel) very normal, very calm,\" he said Wednesday. \"I prepared myself mentally for it. And I also prepared myself physically to put myself in this position for the past 12 years now. So I'm ready for the moment, ready to go, ready to lock and load.\"\n\nAs for his day-before-the-wedding note to Bears fans?\n\n\"I can't wait,\" Williams said. \"All I've heard is great things about you all. And I'm ready to go.\"\n\nA lot to learn\n\nWednesday's availability with Williams came with a bit of a Super Bowl media day feel -- not only in the mob of reporters that swarmed the quarterback to pepper him with questions, but also in the wide range of subjects covered. From football philosophy to style preferences to Hollywood name-drops.\n\nWilliams offered his suggestion for whom the Bears should choose with the No. 9 pick: Penn State offensive tackle Olu Fashanu, who, not coincidentally, was a teammate at Gonzaga College High School in Washington, D.C.\n\nWilliams later shared the most famous contact in his iPhone: Denzel Washington.\n\nAnd when a young girl asked what advice he would give his 13-year-old self, Williams smiled.\n\n\"Keep going,\" he said. \"Keep going. You're going to do it.\"\n\nYou can learn a lot about a person in such settings. And it became apparent Williams also has a lot to learn about Chicago, the city counting on him to be its quarterback savior. For real this time.\n\nWilliams admitted he has no idea what a Chicago-style hot dog is. (He prefers his hot dogs loaded with the good stuff from Ben's Chili Bowl, a D.C. favorite.)\n\nWilliams has not yet sampled Malort. (Probably a wise choice.)\n\nHe also wasn't ready to share his Bears jersey number. Nor did he have much ambition to learn all there was to learn about the city when he dropped into town earlier this month for his predraft visit to Halas Hall.\n\n\"I wanted to get around the coaches and players,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, I'll be spending 12 hours a day in there and I'll be in the city probably once a month. So I was heavily into actually being in the facility around the guys and coaches.\"\n\n'I'm really ready'\n\nWilliams has become much more familiar with the Bears as a team over the past three months. He has forged an early connection with general manager Ryan Poles and coach Matt Eberflus.\n\n\"It's been fun to be around them,\" he said. \"They're very detailed. They always have a plan. And they seem like they're very routine-like, which is how I've been throughout my whole life.\"\n\nWilliams expressed admiration for what Bears offensive coordinator Shane Waldron did in 2022 to help the career resurgence of Seattle Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith.\n\nAnd during his visit to Lake Forest a few weeks back, Williams enjoyed the dinner he had with a group of future teammates that included T.J. Edwards, DJ Moore and Cole Kmet.\n\n\"It was great,\" Williams said. \"It was really just to get around the players. Obviously they're going to give the real take of me and get an idea of how I am going to be every day. That's what that was about.\n\n\"I'm just one of them. Nothing more, nothing less. I'm the same person every day. And what they saw at that dinner is the person I'll be five years from now, 10 years from now, 15 years from now.\"\n\nMore than anything, Williams expressed a combination of fulfillment and eagerness for what this week represents. He was 10 years old when he began dreaming about becoming the No. 1 pick, a fantasy that's about to become reality.\n\n\"This is surreal,\" he said.\n\nBut Williams also described himself as \"ready\" for Thursday night because it will open the bridge for him to cross from being a college superstar and highly regarded NFL prospect to becoming a Chicago Bear, surrounded by teammates with a similar purpose as his.\n\n\"I'm really ready,\" Williams said. \"Because I want to get back to a football team. I haven't been on a football team since Nov. 18 (his last game at USC). So that has probably been the toughest part for me. It's something I really want to get back to. Get back in the locker room, be around the guys, be involved every single day and let it rip.\"\n\nThe next step\n\nWilliams even answered a question about the other huge Bears storyline of the day: the team's official proposal of a $4.6 billion project to build a new fixed-roof stadium on the Museum Campus downtown.\n\nIn an ideal world for the Bears, the grand opening of that venue would be in four years or so, at the height of Williams' powers in Chicago and in the league.\n\n\"If that was the place, I would be excited,\" Williams said. \"But that wouldn't be for a couple years obviously. It takes a while to build things like that.\"\n\nThat last sentiment is as true for stadium building as it is for quarterback emergence. But at the very least, Williams has arrived at a point in his football journey where he always knew he would be. At the NFL draft, as the likely No. 1 pick.\n\n\"As a kid, I did dream of this,\" he said. \"I set my goals. I went after it. I got it. I'm here. I'm ready for the moment.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_wiederer@sports.yahoo.com", "name": "Dan Wiederer", "type":

He fits the Poles profile as a former four-star athlete with leadership qualities. And by loading up with weapons, Poles would be giving rookie quarterback Caleb Williams a better chance to hit the ground running.\n\nThe catch is whether Odunze will still be on the board at No. 9. If not, the Bears could trade down, possibly for Texas defensive tackle Byron Murphy II, LSU wide receiver Brian Thomas, Jr., Alabama edge rusher Dallas Turner or Penn State offensive tackle Olu Fashanu.\n\nJust as the Bears can't keep hoping for a thriving offense without a quarterback, they can't expect to be a great defense without a pass rush. They can solve both problems with the Nos. 1 and 9 picks.\n\nVerse is a well-rounded pass rusher who had nine sacks each of the last two seasons and would be a nice fit opposite Montez Sweat. Sweat was the only Bear with five or more sacks last season, and they didn't add any significant help in free agency.\n\nA wide receiver like Odunze would be more exciting, but the Bears have had one of the NFL's worst pass rushes the last two seasons and they can't win like that.\n\nI love the top three receivers in this draft -- Marvin Harrison is the player most likely to make the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Odunze is a great fit with the Bears and LSU's Malik Nabers is more physically gifted than either of them. The problem: all three will be gone when the Bears pick ninth.\n\nPresuming the top eight picks are four quarterbacks, three receivers and Alt -- in some order -- Poles would be well-served to trade down. Perhaps the Raiders or Broncos would be willing to pay a hefty ransom to move up and take quarterback Michael Penix.\n\nCoach Matt Eberflus has never been shy about touting the importance of a star defensive tackle in his defense.

Their other two selections come in the third and fourth round.\n\nThe draft serves as the foundation of any NFL team, so it's a good time to evaluate exactly where this roster stands before the new crop of Bears join the fray. Especially as Poles looks to fill some roster holes at positions ranging from defensive line to wide receiver to quarterback.\n\nLet's take a look at where the Bears' roster stands ahead of the 2024 NFL draft.\n\nQuarterback\n\nINDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA - MARCH 02: Caleb Williams #QB14 of Southern California looks on during the NFL Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium on March 02, 2024 in Indianapolis, Indiana. (Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)\n\nPosition need: High\n\nRight now, the Bears don't have a starting quarterback on the roster. That's obviously going to change pretty soon when Chicago makes Caleb Williams the first overall pick in the NFL draft. But even more than (presently) not having a starter on the roster, there's a question of who will serve as the veteran mentor for Williams during his rookie year.\n\nBagent is technically a veteran, but he started just four games in relief of an injured Fields. When Nathan Peterman was on the roster, it was more of a mentorship role than counting on him to go into games. The Bears added Brett Rypien this offseason, but it'll be interesting to see if Chicago makes another move to add a veteran quarterback to work with Williams this season. -- Alyssa Barbieri\n\nRunning back\n\nMar 14, 2024; Lake Forest, IL, USA; Chicago Bears running back D'Andre Swift speaks during a press conference at Halas Hall. Mandatory Credit: Kamil Krzaczynski-USA TODAY Sports\n\nPosition need: Low\n\nThe Bears' running back room as a whole is a fairly complete unit. They have Swift, a dynamic dual-threat back who can run in between the tackles but can also catch passes out of the backfield. Johnson gives them a tough presence inside, but also someone with pass-catching abilities. Finally, Herbert provides a spark as a one-cut runner.\n\nThe position group may not be the best in the league, but it feels complete. Swift was their major acquisition, and the Bears will want to see more from Johnson. Unless they make a surprise move and move Herbert, who is in the last year of his deal, it's hard to see them adding another notable piece with four players already on the roster. -- Brendan Sugrue\n\nWide receiver\n\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS - OCTOBER 15: DJ Moore #2 of the Chicago Bears takes the field prior to the game against the Minnesota Vikings at Soldier Field on October 15, 2023 in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Michael Reaves/Getty Images)\n\nPosition need: Moderate\n\nEntering the offseason, wide receiver was among the biggest needs on the roster. And it's safe to say GM Ryan Poles delivered with one noteworthy move that altered the trajectory of the position group. The Bears made a splash when they traded for Pro Bowl wideout Keenan Allen, solidifying a solid 1-2 punch at receiver alongside DJ Moore. Moore and Allen should help make incoming rookie quarterback Caleb Williams' transition to the NFL as seamless as possible.\n\nOutside of Moore and Allen, the Bears return second-year pro Tyler Scott and Velus Jones Jr., as well as re-signed Dante Pettis. Jones and Pettis are expected to serve key roles on special teams fielding kickoffs and punters, respectively. Overall, Chicago could serve to add more depth. But the Bears have one of the best receiver duos in the league with Moore and Allen -- and they might not be done just yet. -- Alyssa Barbieri\n\nTight end\n\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS - JANUARY 08: Tight end Cole Kmet #85 of the Chicago Bears carries the ball after making a catch during the 3rd quarter of the game against the Minnesota Vikings at Soldier Field on January 08, 2023 in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Michael Reaves/Getty Images)\n\nPosition need: Moderate\n\nIt's not outlandish to say the Bears have two top-25 tight ends on the roster with Kmet and Everett, so why would tight end still potentially be a need going into the draft? It's because of Waldron's desire to use 12 and 13 personnel. They would need another capable tight end to run 13 personnel, whether that's someone who exclusively blocks or a player who can be a threat as a receiver.\n\nCarlson isn't a viable option at this point, leaving Waldron with no one else at the position. It wouldn't be shocking to see Chicago use one of their few remaining draft picks on a tight end, but perhaps they look at other avenues like undrafted free agents instead. -- Brendan Sugrue\n\nOffensive line\n\nJan 7, 2024; Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA; Chicago Bears offensive tackle Darnell Wright (58) during the game against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field. Mandatory Credit: Jeff Hanisch-USA TODAY Sports\n\nPosition need: Moderate\n\nChicago's offensive line made strides last season, where they were generally a solid unit with one glaring hole at center. The Bears made it a point to address the interior deficiencies with the additions of Ryan Bates and Coleman Shelton, who will ultimately compete for the starting center job. There's also depth behind guards Teven Jenkins and Nate Davis. They also have a solid pair of young tackles in Darnell Wright and Braxton Jones, but it wouldn't be a huge shock for them to upgrade over Jones (if possible). -- Alyssa Barbieri\n\nEdge rusher\n\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS - DECEMBER 10: Montez Sweat #98 of the Chicago Bears reacts during the second half in the game against the Detroit Lions at Soldier Field on December 10, 2023 in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Quinn Harris/Getty Images)\n\nPosition need: High\n\nThe good news? The Bears' edge rusher position is in much better shape than it was this time last year. The bad news? There is still plenty of work to be done. Sweat can only play one side at a time, and Walker is, at best, a rotational player. Chicago still needs another productive player at the position.\n\nEven if Walker winds up starting again in 2024, there is very little depth behind him. Robinson, Martin, and Kareem all combined for 2.5 sacks last season. Though Chicago essentially only has three picks to use on the roster aside from the quarterback position heading into the draft, one would expect them to come away with an edge rusher. -- Brendan Sugrue\n\nDefensive tackle\n\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS - DECEMBER 31: Gervon Dexter Sr. #99 of the Chicago Bears celebrates after a sack during the fourth quarter against the Atlanta Falcons at Soldier Field on December 31, 2023 in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Justin Casterline/Getty Images)\n\nPosition need: Moderate\n\nWhen looking at Chicago's defense, it's a unit that has the potential to be a top-five group in the NFL. But the biggest concern remains the defensive line -- even with last year's additions, including Montez Sweat. The Bears certainly have a bigger need at edge rusher, but the interior defensive line is missing some key depth following the departure of Jones in free agency.\n\nBillings is locked in as the starting nose tackle, and Dexter is a favorite to step into that starting three-technique job. But there's depth concerns behind them, including Pickens, who's coming off an up-and-down rookie year. Meanwhile, it's unclear whether Cowart will serve a significant role as depth past the preseason and Dwumfour is merely a training camp body and practice squad candidate. -- Alyssa Barbieri\n\nLinebacker\n\nChicago Bears linebackers T.J. Edwards (53) and Tremaine Edmunds (49) celebrate his interception of a pass intended for Detroit Lions wide receiver Donovan Peoples-Jones (19) during first half action Sunday, Nov 19, 2023.\n\nPosition need: Low\n\nOutside of cornerback, there isn't a position on the Bears that is as solidified as the linebackers. All three starters are returning after having solid seasons, and they have key depth with players like Sewell and Ogbongbemiga behind them. It's a solid group that doesn't need much more help than it already has.\n\nWith only four picks heading into the draft, there isn't a reason for the Bears to use any of them on a linebacker. They should be able to find other depth pieces via undrafted free agents, like Baskerville was in 2023. -- Brendan Sugrue\n\nCornerback\n\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS - OCTOBER 15: Jaylon Johnson #33 of the Chicago Bears in action against the Minnesota Vikings at Soldier Field on October 15, 2023 in Chicago, Illinois.

That has to do with the return of Johnson, who signed a massive four-year extension to keep him in place as this defense looks to take a step forward. Johnson is coming off a career year where he unlocked his ballhawking ability while proving to be one of the game's best cover corners.\n\nCouple that with the returns of young stars Stevenson and Gordon, and Chicago has a solid starting trio. Stevenson had a strong close to his rookie season while Gordon thrived playing exclusively one position. Smith also gives them solid depth should any injuries occur. So it's highly unlikely the Bears target a cornerback in the NFL draft -- especially with just four draft picks and several holes to fill. -- Alyssa Barbieri\n\nSafety\n\nOct 5, 2023; Landover, Maryland, USA; Chicago Bears safety Jaquan Brisker (9) celebrates after a turnover against the Washington Commanders during the second half at FedExField. Mandatory Credit: Brad Mills-USA TODAY Sports\n\nPosition need: Moderate\n\nSafety isn't quite as strong as cornerback, but it's a fairly solid position for the Bears now that they have Byard to pair with Brisker. Those two should be able to play well off each other, with Byard having the ability to play free safety but also the flexibility to move up in the box as a solid tackler. Brisker, meanwhile, is a true strong safety and will be primed to make big plays in the box.\n\nThat's not to say the Bears can't use depth at the position, though. Owens is a capable third safety, but questions remain when it comes to Hicks and the other players. Byard hasn't missed a game due to injury, but he's on the wrong side of 30. Brisker has been banged up off and on as well, and reserves have needed to come in for relief. Safety shouldn't be a priority in the draft, but picking up a rookie who can provide depth wouldn't be the worst move. -- Brendan Sugrue\n\nSpecial teams\n\nAug 12, 2023; Chicago, Illinois, USA; Chicago Bears kicker Cairo Santos (8) helmet bumps punter Trenton Gill (16) after kicking a 49-yard field goal in the second half against the Tennessee Titans at Soldier Field.

Santos has solidified the kicker position since his arrival in 2020, and he's since earned two contract extensions (the most recent being his most lucrative). Scales is the longest-tenured player on Chicago's roster, and he's been a mainstay at long snapper. Gill is entering his third season with the Bears, and while they could look to eventually upgrade at punter, he's been solid in two years. -- Alyssa Barbieri", "source": {"uri":

About Craig Krenzel, Jonathan Quinn, Rick Mirer, Cade McNown, Mike Glennon and Caleb Hanie? About the mighty swings and misses on Mitch Trubisky and Justin Fields?\n\nThat will be the dream when the Bears choose first overall in the NFL draft Thursday night. If Williams is as good as advertised, the former USC quarterback will have a stadium named after him when the franchise wants a new one in 25 years.\n\nGeneral manager Ryan Poles is keeping his cards close to his vest, but if he doesn't use the No. 1 pick on Williams, it will be beyond an upset. Somewhere, someone will start taking a chisel to a blank gravestone.\n\nNothing is guaranteed in the NFL and certainly not inside Halas Hall, but there's little doubt that Williams is considered the top quarterback in a class that has more than a few good ones. You're right: It would be so in keeping with Bears history for Poles to go against conventional thinking and choose another quarterback, but this is no time to play hero. The franchise never has had this opportunity before. This is the time to go with the purported sure thing. Everything points to the kid being worth it. He can make all the throws, and he can run. He doesn't just want to be great, he'll be shocked if he isn't great in the NFL. The only time the Bears have seen something like him is across a line of scrimmage.\n\nThe risks and the rewards are huge. If Poles is wrong about Williams, and LSU's Jayden Daniels or North Carolina's Drake Maye become this year's Patrick Mahomes, he'll make former Bears general manager Ryan Pace look misunderstood. But if Poles is right about Williams, if the kid is a once-in-a-decade talent, he'll get a statue outside Caleb Williams/Costco Stadium.\n\nWhy, yes, this does feel odd and more than a bit disorienting. A mountain of ugly history swept away with one Roger Goodell announcement, just like that? That's the idea. From zero to 60 m.p.h. in the blink of an eye. That's the prize for decades of mediocre to bad quarterbacking. That's how winning the lottery works.\n\nGrowing pains are a good possibility for Williams. The Texans' C.J. Stroud - another quarterback the Bears could have drafted - had a fabulous rookie season in 2023, but he's an anomaly. Toddlers fall, puppies make messes and young quarterbacks struggle. Williams will struggle.\n\nBut there's no point in tiptoeing around here. We know what he's supposed to be, and so does he, which is why he has talked openly about winning eight Super Bowls, one more than Tom Brady's record seven. You want to tell him to slow down, but, you know, kids these days.\n\nI realize the amount of pressure all of this puts on a 22-year-old. But there's no avoiding the elements involved here: an original NFL franchise, a calamity of quarterbacks for the past 75 years and the No. 1 overall pick in the draft. Start saving, savior.\n\nChicago has fallen for many false prophets. This isn't that. Watch for both arm strength and accuracy out of Williams. When you see it, you'll finally understand what you've been missing. I know, I know: He had a bad game against Notre Dame last season, with one touchdown pass and three interceptions in a loss. Every Fighting Irish fan and every can't-let-go Fields fan will tell you all about it. But he had a combined 29 TD passes and two interceptions the rest of the season. Perhaps that's worth considering. Just a thought.\n\nThere will be talk that we're building up Williams so that we can tear him down when he inevitably fails. Listen, my eyes are scarred from watching inept Bears quarterbacks. I would love some optical relief. And so would you. How much more fun would watching a great quarterback be than debating whether Fields is good or bad?\n\nIs Caleb Williams The One? There's no point in thinking he isn't. Right now, he's the one and only, the answer to Bears fans' prayers. They'll know soon enough whether anyone up there is listening. But for now, they should enjoy what they've never had before: a real, live quarterback.", "source": {"uri": "chicago.suntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Sun-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Poles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Poles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Krenzel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Craig Krenzel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cade_McNown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cade McNown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Quinn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Quinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Mirer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Mirer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Hanie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Hanie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Glennon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Glennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Trubisky", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Trubisky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halas_Hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halas Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Pace", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Pace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Goodell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roger Goodell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_scrimmage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Line of scrimmage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Notre Dame Fighting Irish football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d4df962/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3438x1963+0+165/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F25226819%2Fwilliams_caleb.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAccording to CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones, the belief around the league is the Bears will target pass rusher or wide receiver with the ninth overall selection -- with the caveat that it's always possible they trade back.\n\nI could see Chicago taking a receiver at No. 9 to prove to Williams and the rest of the league how serious the Bears are about this offense. Remember, they locked up offensive coordinator Shane Waldron with lightning speed in the offseason.\n\nOther sources have pointed out the Bears could use the pick on a pass rusher to take some pressure off Montez Sweat. It's a good idea, and it makes roster-composition sense. But the Bears sent a second-round pick to Washington for Sweat (and then paid him) because they didn't anticipate strong options in free agency or the draft this year.\n\nCaleb Williams and Rome Odunze return flight to Chicago?\n\nThere's been a lot of smoke about Odunze being a target for the Bears, if he's available, at No. 9. Adding fuel to the fire is future Bears quarterback Caleb Williams sharing a flight to Detroit with Odunze along with an interesting nugget from NFL Network's Tom Pelissero: Odunze recently caught balls from Williams in a pre-draft workout. Guess who was also in attendance? Williams' future Bears teammates DJ Moore and Keenan Allen.\n\nThe only question now is will Williams and Odunze be sharing another flight, only this time to Chicago?\n\nRome Odunze or Byron Murphy could be the pick at No. 9\n\nNov 18, 2023; Ames, Iowa, USA; Texas Longhorns defensive lineman Byron Murphy II (90) celebrates sacking the Iowa State Cyclones quarterback during the game at Jack Trice Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Aaron E. Martinez-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Chicago Tribune's Brad Biggs believes the Bears could be eyeing wide receiver Rome Odunze or defensive tackle Byron Murphy II with the ninth overall pick. Depending on how the board falls, one or both could be available.\n\nMy guess right now is the Bears might be focusing on Washington wide receiver Rome Odunze and Texas defensive tackle Byron Murphy II if they stay at No. 9. There's a good chance one of them is available, and both could be on the board when the Bears go on the clock.\n\nBrock Bowers could be in play at No. 9\n\nGeorgia tight end Brock Bowers (19) scores a touchdown during the second half of a NCAA college football game against Ole Miss in Athens, Ga., on Saturday, Nov. 11, 2023. Georgia won 52-17.\n\nAccording to Sportskeeda's Tony Pauline, Georgia tight end Brock Bowers has generated interest from Chicago. Pauline believes Bowers isn't expected to get outside of the top 10, where he noted the Bears and New York Jets as two teams in play for him.\n\nThe expectations are that Bowers will be selected by either the Chicago Bears with the ninth selection or the new York Jets at pick 10. This, of course, assumes he makes it that far.\n\nSources tell me there's a real possibility a team trades from the middle part of Round 1 in front of the Jets to secure Bowers. Speculatively, I'd say look at the Titans or Falcons, or even the Bears themselves, being the target of the team that wants to move up for Bowers.\n\nPauline also noted we could see a team make a push to move inside the top 10 to draft Bowers.\n\nChicago could take first defensive player at No. 9\n\nDec 2, 2023; Atlanta, GA, USA; Alabama Crimson Tide linebacker Dallas Turner (15) celebrates after a sack in the second quarter against the Georgia Bulldogs in the SEC Championship at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

Carter Stadium in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nThe Athletic's Dan Brugler believes it's a \"very realistic scenario\" that Chicago could draft Byron Murphy II at No. 9 -- that is if the top three receivers Marvin Harrison Jr., Malik Nabers and Rome Odunze are all off the board.\n\nBears could trade back from No. 9\n\nMar 16, 2023; Lake Forest, IL, USA; Chicago Bears general manager Ryan Poles speaks during a press conference at Halas Hall.

The Bears used the 2023 first-round pick on offensive lineman Darnell Wright, who started every game last season. That 2023 second rounder turned into defensive back Tyrique Stevenson, who made 16 starts and registered four interceptions as a rookie. Moore had a career year in his first season in Chicago, posting career-highs in receptions (96), receiving yards (1,364) and receiving touchdowns (8).\n\nFor the Panthers, this move has backfired terribly (so far).\n\nThe player the Panthers took at No. 1 -- Alabama quarterback Bryce Young -- struggled on what was the league's worst team during the 2023 season. The Panthers' miserable 2023 season resulted in having the NFL's worst record and sending their first-round pick to the Bears, who weren't all that much better and earned a second top-10 selection on their own.\n\nWhile the Bears held the top overall selection briefly in 2023, the team appears set to use its No. 1 pick for the first time in nearly eight decades ... and draft a potential franchise-altering talent in quarterback Caleb Williams.\n\nNFL DRAFT HUB: Latest NFL Draft mock drafts, news, live picks, grades and analysis.\n\nWhile the Baltimore Ravens, Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks have never picked No. 1 overall in the NFL draft, the Bears' last No. 1 selection came long before any of those franchises even existed. You would have to go deep into the way-back machine to locate the Bears' No. 1 picks.\n\nHave the Bears ever had the No. 1 pick?\n\nYes. Well, for starters, the Bears had the No. 1 pick for two months last year before trading it to the Panthers for a bounty that could help the team dig itself out of the NFC North cellar.\n\nWhen did the Bears own the No. 1 overall pick and actually use it? Dust off your pro football history books, sports fans. The NFL draft was still a relatively fresh concept the previous two times that the Bears selected at No. 1.\n\nThe NFL held its first draft in 1936, and five years later the Bears had the No. 1 pick for the first time. The Bears selected Michigan halfback Tom Harmon with the No. 1 pick in the 1941 draft.\n\nHarmon never played a down for the Bears. Harmon had a decorated career with the Wolverines, winning the 1940 Heisman Trophy and would eventually be enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame. At first, Harmon wanted to bypass pro football for a career in acting. World War II put both his young acting career and prospective pro football career on hold. A pilot during the conflict, Harmon survived a bomber crash and being shot down in China. He was presented with both the Purple Heart and Silver Star, but his war service took a physical toll that hindered his return to pro football. Harmon signed with the Rams in 1946 and played two seasons for the team (notably, the first two seasons for the team in Los Angeles). While sharing backfield duties with Fred Gehrke (whose side hustle as an artist made the Rams the first NFL team to have a helmet logo) and pro football pioneer Kenny Washington, Harmon rushed for 542 yards and scored seven total touchdowns (six rushing, six receiving, one punt return) in his two NFL seasons.\n\nSix years later, in the 1947 draft, the Bears held the No. 1 overall selection again and drafted Oklahoma State halfback Bob Fenimore. Fenimore -- who finished third in the 1945 Heisman Trophy voting -- had an injury-riddled 1946 season for Oklahoma State. Despite that, the Bears still chose Fenimore with the top pick. It didn't go well. Fenimore lasted just one season in the NFL, with 189 yards rushing, 219 yards receiving and three touchdowns scored.\n\nBears picking in the top five of the NFL draft\n\nThe 2024 NFL draft will make the 20th time that the Bears have picked in the top five, including three times with the No. 2 overall pick.\n\nThe Bears' first No. 2 pick was quarterback Sid Luckman, who led the Bears to four NFL championships and is in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The team's most recent No. 2 pick, quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, was named the Nickelodeon Valuable Player of the Bears' wild-card playoff loss to the New Orleans Saints during the 2020 season.\n\nIn 1965, the Bears selected all-time great players with back-to-back picks at Nos. 3-4: linebacker Dick Butkus and running back Gale Sayers. Despite the presence of the two iconic players, the Bears enjoyed just two winning seasons in the seven years the two Hall of Famers were on the team.\n\nIn this year's draft, the Bears also will have two top-10 selections.\n\nThis is the 21st time going back to the first common-era draft in 1967 after the AFL-NFL merger agreement that a team has owned two top-10 first-round picks.", "source":

And there's been plenty of reports indicating general manager Ryan Poles could be looking to add another weapon for Williams -- although perhaps not the one many have been thinking.\n\nAccording to Sportskeeda's Tony Pauline, Georgia tight end Brock Bowers has generated interest from Chicago.

Make sure to follow the Tribune's Brad Biggs, Colleen Kane and Dan Wiederer for the latest news all weekend.\n\nIt's all happening in downtown Detroit, where top prospects will walk the red carpet at Campus Martius Park and Hart Plaza before Round 1 -- and the traditional booing of Commissioner Roger Goodell -- starts at 7 p.m. Thursday CDT. Rounds 2 and 3 will happen Friday beginning at 6 p.m., with Rounds 4-7 kicking off at noon Saturday.\n\nYou can watch on ABC-7, ESPN, ESPN Deportes and NFL Network or stream on the ABC and ESPN apps. ESPN Radio, SiriusXM and Westwood One Sports will have live radio coverage.\n\nThe Bears own the No. 1 pick for the fourth time in franchise history but have used it only twice. Remember, they traded last year's No. 1 to the Carolina Panthers before the draft for the Nos. 9 and 61 picks, a first-round pick this year (No. 1), a second-round pick in 2025 and wide receiver DJ Moore.\n\n2024 Bears picks\n\nAll signs point to USC quarterback Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick. The Bears brass has had many looks at and chats with the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner -- including at the NFL scouting combine, USC pro day and a trip to Halas Hall.\n\n\"It was great,\" Williams said of the extended time with the Bears at his pro day. \"Just building a relationship. They're trying to see if I'm the right fit to be the first pick as a quarterback and possibly the face of the franchise. They're trying to figure out if this is the guy they should invest all the time, energy and effort and money into, which is obviously important. It was great.\"\n\nGeneral manager Ryan Poles also has grown increasingly smitten.\n\n\"When you talk to his teammates, they don't like him, they love him,\" Poles said of Williams. \"It's his leadership, how he brings people together. ... Same goes with the staff. I'm having a hard time finding a person who doesn't like him or even love him and (doesn't) think he can reach the highest limits. The feedback has been good.\"\n\nThings get a little more unpredictable for the Bears at No. 9. Wide receiver? Edge rusher? Trade down -- or trade up? Here's Brad Biggs' latest mock draft, which has the Bears selecting a wide receiver.\n\n\"We have different tiers on our draft board,\" Poles said late last month. \"And I like the numbers in terms of the talented players who can get down to 9.\"\n\nMeet the Bears' two previous No. 1 picks: Michigan halfback Tom Harmon (1941) and Oklahoma A&M halfback Bob Fenimore (1947).\n\nHarmon, who grew up in Gary, was considered by many who covered college football -- including the Tribune -- to be its best player in 1940. He won the Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award and AP Athlete of the Year award.\n\nBut instead of signing a contract with the Bears after they drafted him on Dec. 10, 1940, Harmon signed one for $15,000 with Columbia Pictures -- to star in a film called \"Harmon of Michigan.\" The Tribune called the movie's storyline \"a weak, stupid and incredible affair, punctuated with banal dialog and incident.\" He followed that up with a deal to be a radio sports director in Detroit.\n\nHarmon did play football in Chicago in 1941 but not for the Bears -- before more than 98,000 fans at Soldier Field as part of the Chicago Tribune All-Star Charity Football Game.\n\nUnlike Harmon, Fenimore -- nicknamed \"Blonde Bomber\" -- did sign with the Bears after he was drafted on Dec. 16, 1946, but not before a trade was considered with the Buffalo Bisons of the All-America Football Conference. Trade talk was abandoned, however, after Bisons team doctors reported calcium spots on Fenimore's injured knee.\n\n\"As for calcium spots on Fenimore's knee, that's the bunk,\" Bears owner and coach George Halas told the Tribune in January 1947.\n\nFenimore played in 10 games for the Bears during the 1947 season but wrote a letter to Halas stating he would sit out the next season because of back and groin injuries incurred from exercising on a horse apparatus at a gym. He remained in Oklahoma, where he became an insurance salesman.\n\nThere have been six No. 9 picks in franchise history, including a first-ballot Hall of Famer.\n\nHere are the prospects from Illinois high schools and colleges and Notre Dame, in order of ranking on Drafttek.com's 600-player big board as of April 19.\n\nIf you need a refresher, the Lions (12-5) had the best record in the division, won their first playoff game in 32 years and added a second win in the divisional round before collapsing in the NFC championship game. The Packers (9-8) finished second, followed by the Vikings and Bears at 7-10 each. Here's what each team needs -- and doesn't need -- in this draft.\n\nLions\n\nThey own the No. 29 pick -- which, barring a move, would be the latest the franchise has made a first-round pick.\n\nGM Brad Holmes is prepared to potentially disappoint Detroiters who show up waiting for their favorite team to be on the clock at the end of the night only to learn he traded out of the first round with an offer too good to refuse.\n\n\"Hopefully our fans will forgive us,\" Holmes said with a grin.\n\nThe Lions could use help at cornerback, defensive end and guard, while they are pretty set on the interior of the defensive line and at middle linebacker.\n\nPackers\n\nThe Packers made a big investment in their secondary by signing safety Xavier McKinney. But it wouldn't be a surprise if they addressed that area again early in the draft.\n\nSafety was one of their biggest weaknesses last season, and they didn't keep any of the three players who earned the most playing time at that position for them a year ago, including Jonathan Owens, who left for the Bears.\n\nThe Packers also need help at cornerback and need to make up for offseason losses on the offensive line and at linebacker.\n\nThey have plenty of young talent at wide receiver after drafting Christian Watson and Romeo Doubs in 2022 and Jayden Reed and Dontavyion Wicks last year. They also selected two tight ends -- Luke Musgrave and Tucker Kraft -- in the first three rounds last year.\n\nThey seem set at quarterback with 2023 fifth-round pick Sean Clifford backing up Jordan Love. But with 11 total draft picks, the Packers could give Love more playmakers or add quarterback depth.\n\nVikings\n\nQuarterback. It has been quarterback for a bit now.\n\nAfter Kirk Cousins departed as a free agent, the Vikings acquired an additional first-round pick in a trade and now have the 11th and 23rd selections as potential fuel to move up. They also hired Josh McCown, an 18-year NFL veteran, as their new quarterbacks coach.\n\n\"Just because something's risky doesn't mean you have to stay away from it,\" GM Kwesi Adofo-Mensah said. \"It's something that is hard to grasp, but if you grasp it, you know what the rewards are, right?\"\n\nThe Vikings also have glaring holes at cornerback, guard and defensive tackle. But they are pretty set at wide receiver -- especially in a deep class -- as well as safety and tight end.", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"},

The only question is how much time they'll use before submitting the draft card. Drag it out and let the television networks talk about the direction of the team or waste no more time without Williams as a Bear and submit it immediately?\n\nAs for the No. 9 pick, there are several directions that Chicago can go, whether that's trading down or staying put. Regardless, there will be plenty of options on the board to address one of their pressing needs.\n\nSo when exactly can Bears fans expect to the team to make their second selection? (Assuming they don't trade down.)\n\nWith the way things panned out last year, it looks like Chicago will be picking at ninth overall before 8:20 p.m. CT. It's worth noting the Eagles traded up with the Bears, which added extra time (along with additional trades before). So Chicago would likely be picking around 8:10-8:20 p.m. CT -- depending on how many trades go down.\n\nThe Bears have some needs they need to address in this draft, including quarterback (which will be remedied right away), pass rusher and wide receiver.\n\nWith two top-10 picks, Chicago can add two blue chip players to the roster as they look to contend for the playoffs this year. But it also wouldn't be a surprise to see them trade back from No. 9.\n\nFollow The Bears Wire Podcast:\n\nApple Podcasts | Spotify | Google Podcasts", "source": {"uri": "bearswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bears Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alyssa_barbieri@bearswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Alyssa Barbieri", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_chip_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blue chip (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://bearswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2022/03/471730348.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

And make it memorable.\n\n\"I mean, football is about having fun,\" Williams said with a smile inside the Corner Ballpark facility on the site of the old Tiger Stadium.\n\nThat's a philosophy Williams likely will carry with him into the NFL and into Halas Hall when he arrives as the new Chicago Bears quarterback at the end of this week. The Bears are expected to draft Williams with the No. 1 pick a little after 7 p.m. Thursday, and the hope is before long he'll become the emcee of many an end-zone dance party.\n\nWilliams welcomed follow-up questions about his enthusiastic participation in Wednesday's wiggle-worthy moments with the kids in the clinic.\n\n\"I was joining in,\" he said. \"You've got to lead by example. I'm not like Beyonce or anything, but I'm all right. I'm not bad. I'll get out there. My hips don't lie.\"\n\nThe NFL draft finally has arrived, and almost the entire football world agrees that Williams is the no-brainer No. 1 selection for the Bears, who will be cashing in a gift from last year's predraft trade with the Carolina Panthers.\n\nIn Williams, the Bears will be landing a prospect with a wide range of quarterbacking gifts and an abundance of self-confidence. In many respects, it feels like an inflection point.\n\nMaybe Williams is finally the guy with the complete toolbox -- of talent, of football IQ, of leadership skills, of unflappable composure -- who will change the Bears' fortune.\n\nWilliams long ago made one of the top goals on his football climb to one day become the top pick in the NFL draft. That box is about to be checked.\n\n\"(I feel) very normal, very calm,\" he said Wednesday. \"I prepared myself mentally for it. And I also prepared myself physically to put myself in this position for the past 12 years now. So I'm ready for the moment, ready to go, ready to lock and load.\"\n\nAs for his day-before-the-wedding note to Bears fans?\n\n\"I can't wait,\" Williams said. \"All I've heard is great things about you all. And I'm ready to go.\"\n\nWednesday's availability with Williams came with a bit of a Super Bowl media day feel -- not only in the mob of reporters that swarmed the quarterback to pepper him with questions, but also in the wide range of subjects covered. From football philosophy to style preferences to Hollywood name-drops.\n\nWilliams offered his suggestion for whom the Bears should choose with the No. 9 pick: Penn State offensive tackle Olu Fashanu, who, not coincidentally, was a teammate at Gonzaga College High School in Washington, D.C.\n\nWilliams later shared the most famous contact in his iPhone: Denzel Washington.\n\nAnd when a young girl asked what advice he would give his 13-year-old self, Williams smiled.\n\n\"Keep going,\" he said. \"Keep going. You're going to do it.\"\n\nYou can learn a lot about a person in such settings. And it became apparent Williams also has a lot to learn about Chicago, the city counting on him to be its quarterback savior. For real this time.\n\nWilliams admitted he has no idea what a Chicago-style hot dog is. (He prefers his hot dogs loaded with the good stuff from Ben's Chili Bowl, a D.C. favorite.)\n\nWilliams has not yet sampled Malort. (Probably a wise choice.)\n\nHe also wasn't ready to share his Bears jersey number. Nor did he have much ambition to learn all there was to learn about the city when he dropped into town earlier this month for his predraft visit to Halas Hall.\n\n\"I wanted to get around the coaches and players,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, I'll be spending 12 hours a day in there and I'll be in the city probably once a month. So I was heavily into actually being in the facility around the guys and coaches.\"\n\nWilliams has become much more familiar with the Bears as a team over the past three months. He has forged an early connection with general manager Ryan Poles and coach Matt Eberflus.\n\n\"It's been fun to be around them,\" he said. \"They're very detailed. They always have a plan. And they seem like they're very routine-like, which is how I've been throughout my whole life.\"\n\nWilliams expressed admiration for what Bears offensive coordinator Shane Waldron did in 2022 to help the career resurgence of Seattle Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith.\n\nAnd during his visit to Lake Forest a few weeks back, Williams enjoyed the dinner he had with a group of future teammates that included T.J. Edwards, DJ Moore and Cole Kmet.\n\n\"It was great,\" Williams said. \"It was really just to get around the players. Obviously they're going to give the real take of me and get an idea of how I am going to be every day. That's what that was about.\n\n\"I'm just one of them. Nothing more, nothing less. I'm the same person every day. And what they saw at that dinner is the person I'll be five years from now, 10 years from now, 15 years from now.\"\n\nMore than anything, Williams expressed a combination of fulfillment and eagerness for what this week represents. He was 10 years old when he began dreaming about becoming the No. 1 pick, a fantasy that's about to become reality.\n\n\"This is surreal,\" he said.\n\nBut Williams also described himself as \"ready\" for Thursday night because it will open the bridge for him to cross from being a college superstar and highly regarded NFL prospect to becoming a Chicago Bear, surrounded by teammates with a similar purpose as his.\n\n\"I'm really ready,\" Williams said. \"Because I want to get back to a football team. I haven't been on a football team since Nov. 18 (his last game at USC). So that has probably been the toughest part for me. It's something I really want to get back to. Get back in the locker room, be around the guys, be involved every single day and let it rip.\"\n\nWilliams even answered a question about the other huge Bears storyline of the day: the team's official proposal of a $4.6 billion project to build a new fixed-roof stadium on the Museum Campus downtown.\n\nIn an ideal world for the Bears, the grand opening of that venue would be in four years or so, at the height of Williams' powers in Chicago and in the league.\n\n\"If that was the place, I would be excited,\" Williams said. \"But that wouldn't be for a couple years obviously. It takes a while to build things like that.\"\n\nThat last sentiment is as true for stadium building as it is for quarterback emergence. But at the very least, Williams has arrived at a point in his football journey where he always knew he would be. At the NFL draft, as the likely No. 1 pick.\n\n\"As a kid, I did dream of this,\" he said. \"I set my goals. I went after it. I got it. I'm here. I'm ready for the moment.\"", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_wiederer@chicagotribune.com", "name": "Dan Wiederer",

The star USC quarterback is expected to be a very good player once he reaches the NFL.\n\nBut the question is what are the Bears going to do with the ninth overall pick? Most people believe that they will select one of the top receivers in Rome Odune or Malik Nabers, if they are available. If not, it feels like defense (or trading back) is on the table.\n\nThere's been some debate about who the best receiver in this loaded class is. While Nabers has been gaining plenty of steam, Marvin Harrison Jr. appears to have the edge in that conversation.\n\nThere's been some discussion about whether the Bears would consider moving up to land Harrison Jr. With a lot of teams putting a lot of stock on QBs, maybe he falls enough for the Bears to pull the trigger?\n\nIt's certainly telling that Harrison Jr. only had two Top 30 visits -- with the Arizona Cardinals and the Bears.\n\nWould Chicago trade next year's first to do it? Would they even need to? There are a lot of questions that come with the idea. If the option is there, general manager Ryan Poles will have no choice but to at least consider it.\n\nHarrison Jr. is incredible and could be one of the best receivers in the NFL, if he lives up to his current trajectory. That is something you simply can't ignore if you have the opportunity.\n\nIf Harrison Jr. came to the Bears, he'd have the luxury of playing with some other incredible players, as well. With DJ Moore and Keenan Allen already there, that would be one of the best trios in the league.\n\nLearning how to develop into a star with those mentors around would be great for him. A few years from now, Harrison Jr. could be an even better player if he had great leadership playing alongside him in his early years.\n\nHaving all of these incredible weapons around Williams would be great for him, as well. Although it may be hard for a variety of reasons, it is an idea to think about for Poles and his team.\n\nFollow The Bears Wire Podcast:\n\nApple Podcasts | Spotify | Google Podcasts", "source": {"uri": "bearswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bears Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vincent_parise@bearswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Vincent Parise", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harrison, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harrison, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malik_Nabers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malik Nabers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Harrison_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marvin Harrison Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Poles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Poles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenan_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keenan Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://bearswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2024/03/USATSI_22631026.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

USC QB rejects draft rumors, will be 'excited' to go to Chicago", "body": "The Bears have made it clear who they intend on taking with the first overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, but does that prospect have an interest in going to the Windy City?\n\nChicago has been on the clock ever since Carolina secured the worst record in the NFL for 2023. The Bears own the No. 1 selection after acquiring Carolina's pick last year, and they have first dibs on taking Caleb Williams, the USC QB regarded as the top prospect in the draft class.\n\nThe Trojans QB is not only viewed as the top QB, but he's also considered to be a generational talent. Chicago may not have come out and specifically said they plan to take the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner, but the team's trade of Justin Fields cleared the way for the club to select a quarterback.\n\nWilliams hasn't discussed his draft process much in the time leading up to Thursday's draft night, but he did previously share his opinion on the possibility of going to the NFC North team.\n\nHere's what Williams said about being drafted by the Bears.\n\nMORE NFL DRAFT: Big board top 200 | 7-round mock draft | Mock with trades\n\nWilliams spoke to ESPN's Pete Thamel in February about the 2024 NFL Draft, stating how excited he is to take the next step in his football career, no matter if it's with the Bears or if it's with another team.\n\n\"If I get drafted by the Bears, I'll be excited,\" he said. \"If they trade the pick and I get drafted by someone else, I'm just as excited. Speaking about Chicago, they have a talented team, a talented offense and defense. For anyone to be in that situation, I think they'd be excited.\"\n\nMORE: Who is Caleb Williams' dad? Meet Carl Williams, the 'QB Dad' doubling as agent\n\nPossibilities about Williams dictating where he ended up in the NFL arose when Williams' father, Carl, mentioned the desire of his son to be a player-owner. The USC QB's dad also works as his agent and business manager, and there were rumblings that Williams would use this tactic to go to the club he wanted to.\n\nThose rumors were put to bed soon after, but then the idea of Williams pulling an Eli Manning was brought up by former NFL QB Robert Griffin III. The current ESPN analyst said in March that he believed Williams was better suited elsewhere than Chicago and that he should demand a trade if he were to be taken by the Bears.\n\nDespite all of these speculations and murmurs in the media world, Williams has been clear that he is open to whatever happens on draft night. At the end of the day, it's his dream to play in the NFL and will be \"excited\" for whatever opportunity comes.\n\n\"This is what I've been preparing for my whole life,\" Williams said of the draft. \"Since I was 10 or 11, this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. At that age until now, it basically feels like your whole life.\n\n\"I'm excited. I'm ready to get back on a football team around my teammates and my brothers -- my new brothers now.\"\n\nWhen Williams presumably hears his name called by the Bears early on Thursday night, he then joins a city rich in sports history. The QB said he has only been to Chicago once, but he has studied iconic Chicago athletes, such as Bulls legend Michael Jordan and Bears Hall of Famer Walter Payton.\n\nMORE: Why Caleb Williams is drawing comparisons to Patrick Mahomes\n\n\"I'm 22. I didn't really get to see those players,\" Williams said. \"As the saying goes, the legends live on. That's my goal of playing football. It's not money, it's not fame ... it's to be immortal. I want to reach that sense of being a legend. Being at the table ... and having a rightful seat through hard work and energy and time I've put into this game that we all love.\n\n\"It's appealing to be in a city like that, with legends that you've looked up to ... reach for the standard they set and try to do anything to get there.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eli Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Payton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walter Payton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Griffin_III", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Griffin III"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2022-11/Caleb%20Williams%20112222%281%29.jpg?itok=qot93qbw", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

When last season ended -- with a flurry of USC defeats, without an invitation to a major bowl game, without even a top-10 finish in his bid to repeat as Heisman Trophy winner -- Williams understood the year qualified as a disappointment.\n\nThere were struggles, frustrations and outside disillusionment. There was also a need for Williams to convert all the hardship into growth.\n\nThus, shortly after the season ended, as he shifted his focus to the NFL -- where the Chicago Bears are expected to make him the No. 1 pick in next week's draft -- Williams came to the realization that 2023, in his words, was \"one of my most important years of playing football so far.\"\n\n\"It's not like any other season I've had,\" he said.\n\nOn record alone, that rang true. USC's 7-5 regular season fell well short of the previous year's 11-3 finish and Oklahoma's 7-2 mark in 2021 in games in which the freshman Williams threw at least 10 passes.\n\nThe losing was more frequent and taxing than ever. And the avalanche of scrutiny and criticism that came with it was, at times, unnerving.\n\nWilliams' own play faltered periodically. In many instances, the failures of his team fell squarely on his shoulders with all the weight of a river hippo.\n\nHe threw three first-half interceptions in a blowout loss at Notre Dame, and instantly questions emerged about how good he really was.\n\nAfter an early November home loss to Washington killed USC's Pac-12 championship hopes, Williams climbed into the stands at the L.A. Memorial Coliseum and cried in his mother's arms. Another tidal wave of criticism crashed down.\n\nUSC went from 6-0 in early October to 7-5 after Williams' final college game, a 38-20 home loss to rival UCLA.\n\nWith every stumble, the noise amplified.\n\n\"It was tough for me,\" Williams said. \"I'm a competitor. I like to win. Being that close to (the) losing was difficult. But I had people in my corner to help me figure out the energy and feeling I was feeling.\"\n\nAmong them was Lincoln Riley, Williams' coach for all three of his college seasons, who visited with the quarterback deep into last season and helped him steady himself.\n\n\"He sat me down and said, 'You either grow from something like this or you keep feeling this feeling and you'll stay where you are,'\" Williams said.\n\nThe true test of Williams' growth will come at the next level -- very likely in Chicago. Bears general manager Ryan Poles has been immersed in a monthslong vetting process of not only Williams' football skills, but also his focus, mental toughness and emotional maturity. It's a journey Poles began with great curiosity and now is finishing with equal parts optimism and comfort.\n\n\"You have to look at past behavior and past struggles,\" Poles told the Tribune. \"Even if those weren't handled in the best way, you just want to hear guys take ownership of where they came up short. If they are blind to it or deny it but you can see it very clearly, that would be a concern of mine.\"\n\nWith Williams, Poles said he has few concerns, expressing confidence that the quarterback has the leadership chops to complement his rare playmaking gifts.\n\nIn a way, the Bears feel fortunate Williams endured all he did in 2023: the losing, the criticism, the mental fatigue. It has lessened the guessing game of how he might respond when adversity hits during his rookie season and beyond.\n\n\"I think it's a positive,\" Poles said. \"It's something that's going to help him in the future.\"\n\nDuring multiple get-togethers with Williams during the predraft process -- from the scouting combine to USC's pro day to an April visit at Halas Hall -- Poles came away pleased with how Williams processed his struggles and pushed through them. The Bears GM is convinced Williams has the requisite thick skin to survive in the NFL.\n\n\"I know he does,\" Poles said. \"But I also think there's room for growth there too. And he's already been in the limelight. He has been in the spotlight. So I know that's developing at a really good rate that I feel comfortable with.\n\n\"The other thing, too, is he has really, really high expectations of himself. So when he talks about last year, he wanted to win the Heisman back to back. He wanted to play in the college football playoffs and win a championship. That was his mindset. So when that started to deteriorate, that was really hard for him. But what I have expressed to him and what he has expressed (back) is maybe that was actually the best thing for him.\"\n\nOn several occasions this offseason, Poles emphasized the need to evaluate the wiring and personality of this year's draft-eligible quarterbacks -- and Williams specifically -- to learn how they handle pressure and how they might handle it in Chicago.\n\nThere's an important distinction there, and after two roller-coaster seasons leading the football operations at Halas Hall, Poles better understands the zeal of a fan base that's waiting for -- and in some cases demanding -- the team's resurgence. There are deep scars here, some acquired very recently. And past suffering can affect the city's collective patience level.\n\n\"When you have a passionate fan base that has gone through a lot of adversity for a long period of time, it gets emotional,\" Poles said. \"And I've felt that personally. It's the highs and the lows. It's like, 'You're the best thing ever.' And then, like, 'You're the worst ever.'\n\n\"So you have to be able to stay right in the middle. Never get too high, never get too low and have the internal confidence to not be pushed up and down by the noise and social media and all those things. Because honestly -- and I relate it to myself -- if you make decisions or you play off emotions to prove people wrong and you get outside of what you do really well, those are the critical mistakes that set you back.\"\n\nThat will be a major challenge for Williams and a lesson he'll have to learn quickly as he acclimates to Chicago with expectations higher than ever for a rookie quarterback here.\n\nWilliams will join a Bears team that appears to have enough talent to challenge for a playoff berth next season. And he'll succeed a quarterback in Justin Fields whose popularity inside and outside the building was undeniable and whose most loyal and vocal backers have reacted to his exit with threats to expedite the deadline for Williams' projected emergence.\n\nIf this kid's a so-called \"generational talent,\" he should be able to win the NFC North right away.\n\nIf comparisons to Patrick Mahomes are so prevalent, then why wouldn't Williams be able to top C.J. Stroud's historic rookie season with the Houston Texans last year?\n\nWelcome to Chicago, kid. Buckle in.\n\nWhile Poles has been at Halas Hall for only 27 months, he's aware that 104 seasons of Bears history frames everything the team does. Within that frame is a well-documented narrative of quarterback failure.\n\nSince the franchise's only Super Bowl win 38 years ago, 15 quarterbacks have started in Week 1. Twenty-nine others have started at least one game.\n\nThe hyperspeed revolving door to the quarterbacks room can be dizzying. The high-profile fizzles of Fields and Mitch Trubisky and Jay Cutler and Rex Grossman and Cade McNown create additional frustration.\n\nStruggle. Reboot. Repeat.\n\nNow, as Williams comes aboard, Chicago has a very real and understandable fear that history is destined to repeat itself, specifically as it relates to the Bears tradition of botching the development plans for young quarterbacks with misaligned timelines.\n\nFields went through a bumpy rookie season with Matt Nagy as head coach, had to shift midseason to a new play caller in Bill Lazor, then transitioned through a full reboot of the front office and coaching staff from 2021 to 2022.\n\nTrubisky experienced similar early turbulence when his rookie-season head coach (John Fox) and play caller (Dowell Loggains) were replaced by Nagy for Year 2.\n\nGrossman was another first-round pick whose original coaching staff was fired after his rookie season. And Cutler? In eight seasons as a Bear, he had six offensive coordinators and never was afforded the continuity to build knowledge and momentum within one system.\n\nStruggle. Reboot. Repeat.\n\nSo who will guarantee Williams won't suffer a similar fate during his early years, particularly after Bears coach Matt Eberflus seemed to be skating on thin ice for the final three months of last season?\n\nEberflus faced speculation about his job security after the team's horrific 0-4 start; after three unfathomable late-game collapses over an 11-game span; and after a sequence of disconcerting assistant coach departures, including two in-season exits and five more firings immediately after the season.\n\nPoles, though, remains steadfast in endorsing Eberflus as the leader who will guide this team and its young quarterback to new heights, even as outsiders express legitimate concern about what might happen if he doesn't. Poles believes that trepidation has clouded the big-picture assessment of Eberflus -- 10-24 as Bears coach -- without fully recognizing the context of the last two seasons.\n\n\"It's the trauma from the past that gets leaked into the situation,\" he said.\n\nThe strides made in 2023, Poles said, provide evidence the team is climbing under Eberflus: \"It's easy to see where it's trending.\"\n\nBeyond that, Poles hopes Williams recognizes the efforts he and Eberflus have made to set up the quarterback for success. In March alone, the Bears traded for 10,000-yard receiver Keenan Allen and signed running back D'Andre Swift and tight end Gerald Everett in free agency.\n\nIn January, the Bears hired Shane Waldron as their offensive coordinator with Thomas Brown slotted behind him as the passing game coordinator -- a potential smooth-transition successor in the event things go so well that Waldron leaves quickly for a head coaching opportunity.\n\n\"When you look at the history of the last two quarterbacks here, usually it's about the supporting cast and it's about putting guys in a position to be successful,\" Poles said. \"I think Caleb knows, both verbally and by action, that I really value that and understand that part of it.\"\n\nPoles also is aware this is the first time in Williams' football life he has had to make such a high-stakes leap of faith.\n\n\"From high school to college, you can dictate where you're going,\" Poles said. \"So now there has to be some trust (from him) that you are going to do everything you say you are going to do. For me, this is actually really nice. Because there's action prior to when he walks in where he can say, 'OK, he means it.'\"\n\nEventually, amid all this conversation, Williams will be turned loose to do what he does best. Play ball. Make plays. Become a multiplier.\n\nThe Bears will lean into the special gifts Williams possesses, including his pocket feel, his extended-play creativity, his vision and his ability to make throws to every level of the field from a multitude of arm angles and with varying velocity.\n\nAt the behest of co-director of player personnel Jeff King, Poles has adopted a system of classifying quarterbacks into two categories: artist or surgeon. He agrees with Williams' self-assessment that he can be highly effective wearing either a painter's smock or, when the moment calls for it, ER scrubs.\n\n\"I like to think that when it's time to be surgical, it's time to be surgical,\" Williams said.\n\nBut there's no question his imaginative playmaking artistry defines him more as a quarterback. So what has Poles enjoyed most about that artwork?\n\n\"If you really watch the tape, you're drawn to his ability to change ball speed with accuracy,\" he said. \"You'll see a lot of guys who are high-velocity, high-speed throwers. ... But you love those guys who have the ability to demonstrate feel, have touch, show loft.\n\n\"(Caleb) changes speeds, uses his anticipation. Those are the kind of things I don't think many people study or see that I think are really impressive.\"\n\nIn 26 starts at USC, Williams averaged 314 passing yards and 2.8 touchdown passes, putting together a dazzling highlight reel. But inside league circles there's a consensus that Williams isn't credited enough for how well he can handle the simple parts of playing the position.\n\nOf all the Williams tape Poles has scrutinized and admired, he still finds himself particularly drawn to the quarterback's breakout moment at Oklahoma. There's something captivating about that 2021 performance that speaks to Williams' blend of competitiveness, composure and confidence.\n\nIn his first meaningful college action as a freshman, Williams seemed totally at ease. In the Red River Rivalry against No. 21 Texas, no less, with the Sooners trailing 28-7 in the second quarter.\n\nThat's when Riley summoned Williams to step in for sophomore starter Spencer Rattler for a fourth-and-1 play from the Sooners 34. And that's when Williams, out of the shotgun, turned a basic quarterback run that appeared to be stopped short of the line to gain into a David Blaine magic act, a 66-yard escape and sprint into the end zone at the Cotton Bowl.\n\nThat touchdown was worth far more than six points. It was a detonation of energy for Oklahoma that became the fuel for a ridiculous rally. By afternoon's end, Williams had led the Sooners from 21 points down -- and out of a 38-20 halftime hole -- to a 55-48 victory,\n\nHe threw for 212 yards and rushed for 88 more. He threw touchdown passes of 14 and 52 yards to receiver Marvin Mims. And on the final possession in a tie game, Williams' last three completions set up the Sooners for Kennedy Brooks' game-winning 33-yard touchdown run in the final seconds.\n\n\"It was just, 'Hey, we need you to make plays.' Now, can you play free and -- in that game and on that stage -- capitalize?\" Poles said. \"You're always looking for that low heart rate. And Caleb just doesn't get all amped up and make mistakes.\n\n\"I just like his cool under pressure in those big moments.\"\n\nPoles also is aware of what Williams is about to become as an NFL quarterback, both in Chicago and nationally. Win or lose, success or failure, he'll have to get used to an existence in which every breath he takes, every move he makes, they'll be watching him.\n\nThe media. Fans. Social media trolls. Everyone will have an opinion to offer.\n\nWilliams is already a made-for-\"First Take\" character, whose relatively ordinary journey through the predraft process nevertheless has been subject to nonstop debate and arguments and hot takes.\n\nShould Caleb Williams refuse to be drafted by the Bears?\n\nAt one point this spring, former quarterback and current ESPN analyst Robert Griffin III thought so, and a whole carnival of discussion broke out. Poles said those sentiments pissed him off. (Griffin has since reversed course.)\n\nIs LSU's Jayden Daniels actually the better quarterback and a safer pick?\n\nIn early March, ESPN's Dan Orlovsky said so point blank, and a legion of Williams doubters amplified the sentiment. (Just weeks earlier, Orlovsky had tabbed Drake Maye over Williams as the top QB in this class.)\n\nWhat's the deal with Williams' painted fingernails and the color of his phone case?\n\nWell, that's where the hellscape inside the social media sewer takes over. And good luck wading through all of that.\n\nThe point is the Bears won't just be drafting a quarterback Thursday night. They'll be signing up for the entire spectacle, uniting with a prospect whose entire professional existence will play out on center stage with every spotlight trained on him.\n\nPoles said he has had detailed discussions about that with Bears President Kevin Warren.\n\n\"We're going to be very intentional as an organization with how we protect our players, specifically the ones who come in with this kind of wake behind them,\" Poles said. \"We're going to make sure we keep the main thing the main thing. Because this game is extremely hard, especially as a rookie.\"\n\nEberflus already has hinted that he and Waldron will emphasize leadership development with their new quarterback. And Williams has acknowledged that necessary evolution as he transitions from a college locker room to one full of adult professionals.\n\n\"I wouldn't say I necessarily need to make a jump,\" he said. \"I would say there are small things you may need to correct or adapt to going into an NFL locker room where I'm 22 and (teammates) have kids and they're ranging to 35 (years old) and things like that.\n\n\"It's just adapting to the situation, understanding what the team needs from me and going about it that way.\"\n\nBlending Williams into the Halas Hall locker room may require extra efforts initially. He'll need to form connections organically while also proving with both his play and his leadership traits that he can become the engine for a sustained run of success.\n\nIn the earliest stages, Williams may have to snuff out any preconceived notions that he is high-maintenance or self-absorbed.\n\nLast month, for example, Bears cornerback Jaylon Johnson made a 25-minute appearance on the \"Up & Adams\" show with Kay Adams and, as he often does, offered candid thoughts on everything from his new contract to the Fields trade to his work with his foundation. Poles heard every word of that interview and nodded through much of it.\n\nBut when Adams opened the door for Johnson to weigh in on Williams' personality, Johnson's sincere excitement and calls for patience were drowned out by his expressed concern about the quarterback's makeup.\n\n\"You just humble yourself coming in the building,\" Johnson said. \"It's one of those things where you can't bring that Hollywood stuff into the building. Especially not with guys who have played this game at a high level for consecutive years in the league. ... We're going to see through it. It's like: 'Nah. What you did in college? The Hollywood? Nah. You've got to prove yourself. That stuff doesn't matter.'\n\n\"You've got to get to know him too. There's a fine line between trying to prove a point to him but also getting to know him.\"\n\nNaturally, the social media aggregation machine took over, and one honest 68-second response became the answer that was clipped and went viral, spawning new questions about how difficult it may become for Williams to fit in at Halas Hall.\n\nPoles didn't love Johnson's perception of Williams, and he believes it will change once Bears players have the opportunity to meet and be around their new quarterback.\n\n\"That Hollywood thing?\" Poles said. \"Like, (Williams) lives in Hollywood right now. He's only been there for two years. And he has some really cool things going on. He took advantage of this NIL (name, image and likeness) thing (in college athletics) to set himself up business-wise. And he's going to do really well in his life because of it.\n\n\"But he's very low-key. He's not a spotlight guy. He tries to move under the radar. And I really don't think he needs the flashy lights to feed off in order to be successful. He's very focused and low-key and down to earth more than I think he is portrayed.\"\n\nIf anything has been difficult for Poles in working toward this draft decision that likely will define his career, communicating his visions and plans to his son may have presented the biggest challenge.\n\nMason Poles is in fifth grade and will turn 11 this week.\n\nFor the last two years, Mason had a personal bond with Fields. He had a signed Fields jersey on his bedroom wall. He dressed as Fields last Halloween. So when his dad relayed the news that he was trading Fields to the Steelers so the Bears could start over at quarterback, Mason was crestfallen.\n\nNaturally, Poles gravitated toward his most accessible talking points.\n\nIt's a business decision as much as anything else. Time simply ran out on Justin to prove he could play at a high enough level to become the Bears' franchise quarterback. There's a chance here with a new quarterback that is totally worth taking.\n\nEventually, though, Poles figured out a better way to speak the Generation Alpha language. He sent Mason to YouTube to immerse himself in Williams highlights.\n\n\"I did,\" Poles said with a grin. \"And now the background screen on his phone is Caleb.\"\n\nAh, yes. Hope, it seems, remains extremely pliable under the right conditions. And as Williams himself promised while sitting on a dais at the combine last month, he plans to work his way into the league with a combination of fearlessness and ambition.\n\n\"I tend to like to create history and rewrite history,\" he said.\n\nWhen Williams arrives at Bears headquarters Friday, Poles might as well be waiting by the George Halas statue out front with a box of pens. The next few chapters of Bears history figure to soon be in Williams' hands.", "source": {"uri": "courant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hartfort Courant"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Williams, the sensational quarterback prospect, sent out a tweet that instantly became the talk of the town among NFL enthusiasts and draft pundits. \"Oh shit yall I just saw Rome Odunze on my flight to Detroit!! Big fan! \ud83d\ude02,\" Williams tweeted, hinting at an unexpected encounter that has fans dreaming of what could be a dynamic duo in Chicago.\n\nRome Odunze, a highly touted wide receiver prospect, played along with the fun, replying, \"I'm actually the pilot this morning. Don't worry I'll get Caleb to Detroit SAFELY! #nosoulshaveperished.\" This playful exchange not only showcased their camaraderie but also fueled rumors and hopes among the Bears' faithful, particularly because the Chicago Bears hold the coveted first and ninth picks in the upcoming draft.\n\nThe interaction between Williams and Odunze comes at a time when speculation is rampant about the Bears' draft strategy. With two top ten picks, the team has a significant opportunity to reshape its roster. Fans and analysts alike are buzzing about the possibility of the Bears using their ninth pick to draft Odunze, a move that many believe could bring a new era of offensive firepower to the team.\n\nSocial media reactions were swift and enthusiastic. Max Markham (@MaxMarkhamNFL) expressed his excitement with a succinct, \"Lets get it.\" Meanwhile, the Justin Fields Fan Club (@JustinFieldsFC) hinted at a future pairing, tweeting, \"2 future Bears \ud83d\udc40.\" The sentiment was echoed by @ImBearingDown, who posted, \"Future teammates.\"\n\nFurther fueling the speculation, Luke Mallette (@LukeMallette2) suggested more such interactions in the future, tweeting, \"Might be many more flights together in the future \ud83d\udc40.\" Bartholomew Willijax (@B_Willijax) warmly invited both players to the city, saying, \"We will gladly welcome you both to Chicago.\"\n\nThe playful banter between Williams and Odunze was not lost on Robert Schmitz (@robertkschmitz), who playfully chided, \"Caleb don't just tease us like this.\" Brandon, @DrakeMayeMVP, voicing a confident prediction, stated, \"Yeah he's definitely a Bear.\" Six Point Sports (@SixPointSports) added to the anticipatory atmosphere with, \"Something tells me it might not be their last flight together \ud83d\udc40.\"\n\nThis flurry of tweets underscores a broader narrative of hope and excitement surrounding the Bears' draft prospects. With a critical offseason ahead, the team's management is under considerable pressure to deliver a draft class that can turn the franchise's fortunes around. The Williams-Odunze tweet exchange adds a personal touch to the proceedings, making the draft feel like more than just business -- it's about potential relationships and team dynamics that could define the Bears for years to come.\n\nChicago, a city that breathes sports as much as it does the windy chill off Lake Michigan, is ripe with anticipation. The Bears have struggled in recent seasons to find a consistent winning formula, and the upcoming draft presents a perfect storm of opportunity and high stakes. The possible addition of a talent like Odunze to catch passes from a potential franchise quarterback like Williams could ignite the offense, bringing much-needed dynamism and excitement back to Soldier Field.\n\nThe engagement from the fanbase on social media also highlights the modern era of sports fandom, where fans feel more connected to the players and the team's decision-making processes. This interaction between draft prospects and fans serves to enhance the excitement surrounding the draft and deepen the connection between the team and its supporters.\n\nAs draft day approaches, all eyes will be on the Bears' management to see how they navigate their picks. Will they capitalize on this public sentiment and draft chemistry, or will they chart a different course? Either way, the saga of Caleb Williams and Rome Odunze, at least for now, has given Bears fans something to dream about, a brief respite from the off-season's usual tensions and uncertainties.\n\nIn essence, this simple yet captivating exchange between two top prospects may have subtly tilted the scales of fan expectations, setting the stage for what could be one of the most pivotal drafts in recent Chicago Bears history.

When they went out to dinner the night before the actual Halas Hall visit, Williams ate with some of his new teammates. The new quarterback needs to get to know the people he's leading.\n\n\"I think it just confirmed a lot of information that we got,\" GM Ryan Poles said Tuesday while discussing the upcoming NFL draft. \"You know, there's a kind of test to where his football understanding is. That part, getting him with some of our players. That's important to us.\n\n\"We're in a really good place with our culture in our locker room. As much as I can I want those guys a part of the process of building this team. I trust their feedback and I think that chemistry is really important so that's why we did that.\"\n\nPoles' own impressions of Williams from the visit to Halas Hall, the pro day at USC and the combine are exactly what he hoped.\n\n\"Yeah, really intelligent guy,\" Poles said. \"He came across as a really good teammate. Easy to talk to, down to earth.\n\n\"You know, we've talked through this process about you know the whole Hollywood thing. He's all ball, wants to work, wants to get better, wants to win as a team. That's the No. 1 thing for him on top of being successful. So I think the biggest thing is does he fit with our culture and what we're trying to do and all signs were that he does so that's a positive.\"\n\nWhat's more important is how he fits with the other players because, after all, Williams will be replacing a popular quarterback in Justin Fields. The locker room and the hearts of many fans belonged to Fields.\n\n\"Whoever comes in and whoever's under center -- whether it's someone who's here already or a new guy, we're excited,\" linebacker T.J. Edwards said. \"We'll embrace them and they'll fit into our culture. Because I know our front office does their research for sure.\"\n\nThe dinner, like all of the predraft talk, won't matter in a few weeks.\n\n\"At the end of the day, once we get people here and once whoever is signed will be here, we'll hit the ground running with that,\" linebacker T.J. Edwards said.\n\nEdward admitted it wasn't easy losing a QB as popular as Fields.\n\n\"It's tough man,\" he said. \"You grow with these guys. You go through a lot. Go through all those uncomfortable times of losing games but also the good times of winning. But sadly that is the NFL. That is the reality of what we do.\n\n\"You just wish him the best. Good people-like I said, anyone who comes in here is truly a good person. So with good people you want them to have great things moving forward and that's what we want for him.\"\n\nAs a Chicago area native and longtime Bears fan, Edwards knows what it would mean to the city if Williams turns out to be the real deal.\n\n\"It'd be incredible for all of us, right?\" Edwards said. \"I think that's the hope.\"\n\nThe energy is high at Bears offseason workouts going on at Halas Hall with the new faces from free agency.\n\n\"There's always a buzz when it comes to football time in Chicago,\" Edwards said. \"There's so many great things happening here.\n\n\"We added a lot of great pieces. I think that first team meeting we had in the offseason was exciting -- to see some new faces, some familiar faces. Whoever comes here, we're excited.\"\n\nTackle Darnell Wright experienced the predraft and draft process just last year. The winner of this year's rookie Brian Piccolo Award thinks Williams will be more a part of the team after all the draft hoopla ends.\n\n\"There's a lot of media stuff that goes on during the draft,\" he said. \"I think once all the media stuff dies down he'll get to work just like any other player would. He'll be good.\"\n\nThen comes the hard part and that's learning everything to succeed in the NFL.\n\n\"When I was a rookie my head was just spinning, just trying to figure out the playbook and things like that,\" Edwards said.\n\nThe Pivot podcast recently put out its interview with Williams and in it he said he wanted to pursue Tom Brady's seven Super Bowl rings. People in Chicago wouldn't mind this a bit.\n\n\"I think we all should have huge goals,\" Poles said. \"We have huge goals here -- win multiple championships and that's what we shoot for.\n\n\"You're more intentional when you have these goals. You have to live a certain way. You have to practice a certain way. You have to go about your business a certain way, in order to accomplish those. If everything is aligned underneath that, that gets me excited.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gene_chamberlain@si.com", "name": "Gene Chamberlain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Poles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Poles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halas_Hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Halas Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Polish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Eberflus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Eberflus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Piccolo_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Piccolo Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_8256,h_4644,x_0,y_0/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hw6fj2ayq8cq1fdw1d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

It's been known for weeks that quarterback Caleb Williams is expected to be the pick at No. 1. But Chicago also has the ninth overall selection, which presents more intrigue with different possibilities.\n\nThe Bears had one of the best salary cap situations ahead of free agency. General manager Ryan Poles made some splashes, including adding weapons like wide receiver Keenan Allen (via trade), running back D'Andre Swift and tight end Gerald Everett, along with safety Kevin Byard. Now, ahead of the draft, Chicago remains in a great place with the cap.\n\nAccording to Over The Cap, the Bears currently have $22.81 million in available salary cap space, which is the 12th most in the NFL. They currently have 68 players on their roster, and they'll need to get that number to 90 by training camp.\n\nIt's more than enough to sign their new rookie class -- which currently would consist of just four players -- and gives Chicago some freedom to make some additional moves in free agency to add a slew of undrafted free agents or veterans after the draft.\n\nFollow The Bears Wire Podcast:\n\nApple Podcasts | Spotify | Google Podcasts", "source": {"uri": "bearswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bears Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alyssa_barbieri@bearswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Alyssa Barbieri", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Poles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Poles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D'Andre_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D'Andre Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Everett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gerald Everett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenan_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keenan Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Byard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Byard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bearswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2023/03/USATSI_20240851.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

But the No. 9 selection offers more intrigue and speculation -- and it could very well depend on how the board falls early Thursday night.\n\nAccording to CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones, the belief is the Bears will target pass rusher or wide receiver with the ninth overall selection -- with the caveat that it's always possible they trade back.\n\nWhile the Bears already have a dynamic receiver duo with DJ Moore and Keenan Allen, it's never a bad thing to add more weapons for your young quarterback. Especially given Allen is only locked in for this year before Chicago has to decide whether to extend him.\n\nAdding someone like Rome Odunze or Malik Nabers to this receiver room would give them one of the best groups in the NFL.\n\nOn the other hand, edge rusher is one of the team's biggest needs heading into the draft. While the Bears acquired stud Montez Sweat last year, they're missing a true complement opposite him.\n\nThere's a good chance Chicago will be in a position to land their pick of edge rusher at ninth overall, be it Dallas Turner, Jared Verse or Laiatu Latu. But that could also mean someone like Byron Murphy II is on the table as arguably the best interior pass rusher in this draft.\n\nGeneral manager Ryan Poles said he's comfortable with just four draft picks this year, which makes sense given what they've added in exchange for three of those lost selections (Sweat, Allen and Ryan Bates).\n\nPass rusher and receiver certainly make sense for Chicago at No. 9, and it could ultimately come down to how the board falls.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_Odunze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome Odunze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenan_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keenan Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disc jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore,_Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moore, Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moore, Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laiatu_Latu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laiatu Latu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Verse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jared Verse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Poles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Poles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Bates", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Bates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Byron Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montez_Sweat", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montez Sweat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/81wnGXN4opfOE9a9AJRHpA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/chicago_bears_wire_usa_today_sports_articles_533/b6ef369c6e152983fbfd47dd87527e68", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Williams will be the Bears' third quarterback taken in the first round since releasing Jay Cutler in 2017. After his dazzling performances at Oklahoma and USC, the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner could finally be the solution to the Bears' seemingly endless quest for an elite quarterback.\n\nIf the book of legendary Bears defensive players is as thick as an encyclopedia, the book of great Bears quarterbacks is more like a pamphlet. Hall of Famer Sid Luckman, nearly 75 years removed from his retirement, remains the gold standard as the Bears' best and most accomplished quarterback. Jim McMahon, beloved as he may be as Chicago's only Super Bowl winner, was not a particularly great player. The frequently scrutinized Jay Cutler holds the Bears' all-time passing records for completions, yards, and touchdowns, all while making one postseason appearances (with one playoff win) in eight seasons.\n\nWilliams is thought to be a generational talent. While Bears fans and the organization are undoubtedly hoping he lives up to the hype, Williams won't need to be elite in order to rewrite many of Chicago's tepid quarterback records.\n\nMitch Trubisky has the (fairly low) high mark for Bears rookie quarterbacks with 2,193 passing yards, which isn't even top-60 all-time among rookies.\n\nIn fairness, the Bears have historically not started their youngsters in Week 1. Kyle Orton is their lone post-merger opening day rookie starter, and that was because of injury to Rex Grossman. Orton, Trubisky, and Justin Fields are the only Bears rookies to reach double-digit starts.\n\nTrubisky may lead in these two categories, but he only threw a paltry 7 touchdowns in 12 games. That must be some way off the Bears' rookie franchise record, right? Well...\n\nThat is not a typo. In 1942, Charlie O'Rourke threw 11 touchdowns while serving as Sid Luckman's backup, and his record still holds up today. O'Rourke enlisted in the US Navy and while he did return to the NFL, he never played for the Bears again.\n\nAssuming Williams bucks the historical trend and starts right away, he'll have ample time to supplant Trubisky and O'Rourke atop these lists.\n\nThe Bears are the only team in NFL history to have never had a 4,000-yard passer. Erik Kramer came close to cracking that mark in 1995, but missed out by 162 yards. There have only been 12 instances of a Bears QB passing for 3,000 yards, fewer than the Carolina Panthers (16) and Jacksonville Jaguars (15), who didn't enter the league until 1994.\n\nCould Williams light up the league and end the Bears' 4,000-yard drought? It's possible, but it's unlikely. Only five rookie quarterbacks have ever eclipsed 4,000 yards in a season, although two of them (Justin Herbert and C.J. Stroud) have occurred within the last five years.\n\nOh yes, the Bears are also the only team without a 30-touchdown passer.\n\nOnce again, Erik Kramer was the closest with 29 in his aforementioned career-best 1995 season. Of the 12 times in which Bears QBs threw for at least 20 touchdowns, five of them were prior to the AFL-NFL merger.\n\nAgain, it'll be a very tall order for Williams to reach this landmark in his first year. Justin Herbert is the only rookie with a 30+ touchdown pass season.\n\nWould you believe that the Bears haven't had a starting quarterback play the whole regular season in over a decade? Jay Cutler's first season with the Bears back in 2009 saw him go 16-for-16, then never again through the rest of his Chicago tenure. Vince Evans, Jim Harbaugh, Erik Kramer, and Rex Grossman are the other 16-game starters.\n\nSince 2010, Bears fans have witnessed sporadic appearances from Todd Collins, Caleb Hanie, Jason Campbell, Jimmy Clausen, Matt Barkley, Brian Hoyer, Mike Glennon (who signed a 3-year, $45 million deal to replace Cutler, by the way!), Nathan Peterman, Tyson Bagent, and many others they probably wish to forget.\n\nWe're only four seasons into the 17-game era, so by default this is the franchise record that Williams has the best chance to set in year one.\n\nYes, traditional passer rating is a flawed, antiquated metric for measuring a quarterback's performance, particularly as the game has evolved heavily in favor passing offenses. Case in point: Mitch Trubisky is the Bears' all-time leader in passer rating (min. 1500 attempts). In 1994, an 87.2 passer rating would've made Trubisky an MVP contender and one of the clear-cut best at his position. That's a below-average number in today's NFL.\n\nIn the Super Bowl era, Bears quarterbacks are dead last in average passer rating at 71.4, with the highest interception rate (4.0%) in the league and the worst completion percentage (56.4%).\n\nWith 1500 pass attempts as the qualifier, it'll take at least three seasons for Williams to be eligible to unseat Trubisky as Chicago's passer rating king. By then, we should have a good idea as to whether or not Caleb is indeed the franchise QB the Bears have been yearning for.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB

Even the best insiders can get 100% accuracy. However, they do often have a good idea of how the top of the 1st round will play out. That is why listening to them when the draft is close is important. Everybody knows the Chicago Bears are taking quarterback Caleb Williams at #1. That's been a done deal for months. The great intrigue is what they do with the 9th pick. They could stay put and simply take the best player on their board. Most presume it will be Washington wide receiver Rome Odunze.\n\nHowever, some well-connected insiders don't see it happening that way. In fact, they envision the exact same scenario: the Bears trading down from #9 with the New Orleans Saints. Start with Benjamin Allbright of KOA Colorado. He does one mock draft every year, and it is often among the most accurate. Here is what he posted.\n\n9. Saints (via CHI)* - OT Olu Fashanu Saints move up and fill a huge need.\n\n10. Jets - TE Brock Bowers Versatile mismatch TE/ off the line Y for Aaron Rodgers. Fuaga a consideration here.\n\n11. Chargers (via Minn)* - OL JC Latham I think the Chargers can get quality WR help later.\n\n12. Eagles (via Den)* - CB Quinyon Mitchell Eagles trade up to get their corner. (give up pick 50)\n\n13. Raiders - CB Terrion Arnold Raiders could look to go OL here as well. Not buying Penix at 13 hype.\n\n14. Bears (via NO)* - DT Byron Murphy Bears land the premier IDL talent in the draft.\n\nIf you still aren't convinced, let's move to the local side. Jeff Hughes of Da Bears Blog has some of the most proven connections in the business. Here is his prediction for how the top 10 unfolds.\n\nThe fact these two guys are saying the exact same thing 24 hours before the draft can't be a coincidence. They're hearing something. New Orleans desperately needs tackle help and isn't afraid to move up. Dropping to #14 should give the Bears an excellent spot to still land a pass rusher. It's a win-win.\n\nAlways examine these Chicago Bears based on their actions.\n\nWhat do we know about them? GM Ryan Poles said he wants to build through the draft. To do that, you need picks. Chicago only has four at present due to prior trades. He had 11 and 10 in his first two years. It seems unlikely he'd be content with that. Then there is Matt Eberflus. He's the head coach. His background is defense. The Bears have a glaring void on the defensive line with no pass rusher opposite Montez Sweat. Would the team really ignore that problem in favor of another receiver? That feels hard to believe.\n\nTrading with New Orleans accomplishes two goals. They get another Day 2 pick in the deal, maybe the 45th overall. Poles could use that and the 75th to keep building around Williams. Meanwhile, the 14th pick can go towards a dynamic rusher who can provide help up front on defense. It might not be the sexiest outcome Chicago Bears fans hoped for, but it is logical. Much depends on how the other seven picks ahead of #9 unfold. If there is a run on tackles, it might scuttle their plans.", "source": {"uri": "sportsmockery.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mockery"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erik_lambert@sportsmockery.com", "name": "Erik Lambert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_Odunze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome Odunze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Saints"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Bowers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brock Bowers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Byron Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Blackhawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Blackhawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Buffaloes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Poles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Poles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montez_Sweat", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montez Sweat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Eberflus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Eberflus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Gay_Men", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Gay Men", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Bearings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Bearings", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft_Toys", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft Toys", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Stuffed_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Stuffed Animals", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.sportsmockery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Ryan-Poles-1-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

That 2023 second rounder turned into defensive back Tyrique Stevenson, who made 16 starts and registered four interceptions as a rookie. Moore had a career year in his first season in Chicago, posting career-highs in receptions (96), receiving yards (1,364) and receiving touchdowns (8).\n\nFor the Panthers, this move has backfired terribly (so far).\n\nThe player the Panthers took at No. 1 -- Alabama quarterback Bryce Young -- struggled on what was the league's worst team during the 2023 season. The Panthers' miserable 2023 season resulted in having the NFL's worst record and sending their first-round pick to the Bears, who weren't all that much better and earned a second top-10 selection on their own.\n\nWhile the Bears held the top overall selection briefly in 2023, the team appears set to use its No. 1 pick for the first time in nearly eight decades ... and draft a potential franchise-altering talent in quarterback Caleb Williams.\n\nWhile the Baltimore Ravens, Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks have never picked No. 1 overall in the NFL draft, the Bears' last No. 1 selection came long before any of those franchises even existed. You would have to go deep into the way-back machine to locate the Bears' No. 1 picks.\n\nYes. Well, for starters, the Bears had the No. 1 pick for two months last year before trading it to the Panthers for a bounty that could help the team dig itself out of the NFC North cellar.\n\nWhen did the Bears own the No. 1 overall pick and actually use it? Dust off your pro football history books, sports fans. The NFL draft was still a relatively fresh concept the previous two times that the Bears selected at No. 1.\n\nThe NFL held its first draft in 1936, and five years later the Bears had the No. 1 pick for the first time. The Bears selected Michigan halfback Tom Harmon with the No. 1 pick in the 1941 draft.\n\nHarmon never played a down for the Bears. Harmon had a decorated career with the Wolverines, winning the 1940 Heisman Trophy and would eventually be enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame. At first, Harmon wanted to bypass pro football for a career in acting. World War II put both his young acting career and prospective pro football career on hold. A pilot during the conflict, Harmon survived a bomber crash and being shot down in China. He was presented with both the Purple Heart and Silver Star, but his war service took a physical toll that hindered his return to pro football. Harmon signed with the Rams in 1946 and played two seasons for the team (notably, the first two seasons for the team in Los Angeles). While sharing backfield duties with Fred Gehrke (whose side hustle as an artist made the Rams the first NFL team to have a helmet logo) and pro football pioneer Kenny Washington, Harmon rushed for 542 yards and scored seven total touchdowns (six rushing, six receiving, one punt return) in his two NFL seasons.\n\nSix years later, in the 1947 draft, the Bears held the No. 1 overall selection again and drafted Oklahoma State halfback Bob Fenimore. Fenimore -- who finished third in the 1945 Heisman Trophy voting -- had an injury-riddled 1946 season for Oklahoma State. Despite that, the Bears still chose Fenimore with the top pick. It didn't go well. Fenimore lasted just one season in the NFL, with 189 yards rushing, 219 yards receiving and three touchdowns scored.\n\nThe 2024 NFL draft will make the 20th time that the Bears have picked in the top five, including three times with the No. 2 overall pick.\n\nThe Bears' first No. 2 pick was quarterback Sid Luckman, who led the Bears to four NFL championships and is in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The team's most recent No. 2 pick, quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, was named the Nickelodeon Valuable Player of the Bears' wild-card playoff loss to the New Orleans Saints during the 2020 season.\n\nIn 1965, the Bears selected all-time great players with back-to-back picks at Nos. 3-4: linebacker Dick Butkus and running back Gale Sayers. Despite the presence of the two iconic players, the Bears enjoyed just two winning seasons in the seven years the two Hall of Famers were on the team.\n\nThese are the Bears' all-time top-five picks:\n\nIn this year's draft, the Bears also will have two top-10 selections.\n\nThis is the 21st time going back to the first common-era draft in 1967 after the AFL-NFL merger agreement that a team has owned two top-10 first-round picks.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This could be the case at No. 9 in Round 1 or even later in Rounds 3 (75) and 4 (122).\n\n\"Yeah, we've talked about inside and outside,\" Poles said during the press conference with assistant Ian Cunningham participating. \"Both are multipliers.\n\n\"Generally speaking, I would say the inside guy has the shortest path to the quarterback, so therefore like, if you have, we both have lived with, really good elite players that are inside and it changes everything and it opens up a lot for other teams as well. Yeah, having that interior rush is probably a preference when you have an outside guy. It makes it really difficult to scheme up.\n\nThe draft followers immediately will start thinking defensive tackle Byron Murphy II from Texas over one of the edge rushers, should the Bears have all of them graded similarly. Alabama's Dallas Turner, Florida State's Jared Verse and UCLA's Laiatu Latu are the highest-rated players in most analysts' draft ratings among edges.\n\nInitially, many analysts had Illinois defensive tackle Jer'Zhan \"Johnny\" Newton graded higher than Murphy but he was unable to participate in predraft workouts because of foot surgery he underwent after the season. It's possible he would be rated higher now, as he was able to hold a personal workout for personnel people last week.\n\nThe Bears are not entering the draft thinking it must be a particular player, and Poles won't even reveal he's taking QB Caleb Williams No. 1, although he made it obvious with his comments and earlier actions that this is the case.\n\n\"So unfortunately it's one of those things I think everyone's got to tune in on Thursday to watch and figure out, but I feel really good about our process and where we are and where we're headed,\" Poles said of Williams. \"So we know what we're going to do but everyone is going to have to wait until Thursday to go there.\"\n\nThe needs at positions like edge rusher, defensive tackle or wide receiver could be met at any time.\n\n\"The nice thing is from the work that we've done I feel pretty good about just being flexible,\" Poles said.\n\nPoles did say they'll have a preset line set to how far back they could trade in Round 1 should they decide to take that route.\n\n\"As the draft unfolds, there's going to be some indicators that start to educate us on how we need to move to acquire the top talents in this draft.\n\nEither, way, Poles said he feels no pressure to trade back for more picks even though they have just four mainly because the roster looks much better than a few years ago.\n\n\"Things shift and change as you go along,\" Poles said. \"It's gonna be hard to make this team now. It's gonna be really hard to make this team.\n\n\"That doesn't mean you don't want more shots later. We'll always welcome a lot of picks. But it doesn't force you to panic about the situation we're in right now with how many picks we have. So it fits our roster but it also fits kind of like what we just talked about -- the current status of this draft and then moving forward what next year looks like as well.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gene_chamberlain@si.com", "name": "Gene Chamberlain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Polish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Poles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Poles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Piccolo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Piccolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Turner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laiatu_Latu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laiatu Latu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Verse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jared Verse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Byron Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_Seminoles_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida State Seminoles football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_853,h_479,x_0,y_0/v1713896386/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/si-temp/01hw62yvahh2bkvqmzjr.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

That started with tearing down the roster -- getting rid of of expensive veterans and stockpiling capital to build through the draft.\n\nIn his second year as GM, Poles pulled off arguably one of the greatest trades in NFL history. He sent the first overall pick to the Carolina Panthers in exchange for a package that turned into wide receivers DJ Moore and Keenan Allen, right tackle Darnell Wright, cornerback Tyrique Stevenson, this year's No. 1 pick and there's still a 2025 second-round pick on the way.\n\nPoles has also made big trades to acquire stars like Allen and edge rusher Montez Sweat. Not to mention, he's about to land the team's hopeful franchise quarterback in Caleb Williams at No. 1.\n\nSpeaking to Chicago reporters ahead of a franchise-defining 2024 NFL draft, Poles praised how far the roster has come in his short time with the organization -- and there are still new players yet to join the roster over the next few days.\n\n\"We're proud of where we've come from,\" Poles told reporters Tuesday. \"... It's going to be hard to make this team now.\"\n\nWhen examining the roster, there are few holes compared to when Poles took over and went to work tearing down and rebuilding the roster in his vision. On offense, there are questions along the interior offensive line but the tackles are solid with Darnell Wright and Braxton Jones. On defense, there are two starting jobs up for grabs at edge rusher and three-technique. Outside of that, this is a strong roster.\n\nPoles said the job is never done, but looking at how this roster has been built certainly puts a \"smile on your face.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alyssa_barbieri@sports.yahoo.com", "name": "Alyssa Barbieri", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Poles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Poles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Polish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Pace", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Pace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darnell_Wright", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darnell Wright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montez_Sweat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montez Sweat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenan_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keenan Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Scenario", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Scenario", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Pole_Vault", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Pole Vault", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mKxfbgzHVYnvLswoeoSFGQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/chicago_bears_wire_usa_today_sports_articles_533/3884a4e53f6206462596ba599a69bf6e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

The Washington Commanders, New England Patriots and Los Angeles Chargers have first-year GMs and Cardinals GM Monti Ossenfort is in his second season. They have the luxury of time with their respective rebuilds.\n\nPoles doesn't have that luxury heading into his third season. He needs to make sure Williams is the real deal and that Williams has the surroundings to succeed.\n\nOverall, however, Poles doesn't have the most pressure to deliver in the next three days. Here are the four GMs with the most pressure to produce a franchise-changing draft.\n\n4. Bills GM Brandon Beane\n\nWith the Buffalo Bills parting with many veterans, the pressure is on Beane to deliver a draft class with at least three to four rookies who could be immediate contributors as starters and develop into cornerstone pieces. Beane doesn't have the benefit of time with a rebuild because the Bills are in win-now mode with star quarterback Josh Allen.\n\nBeane has received plenty of criticism for his subpar draft classes in recent years, but he got it right with selecting tight end Dalton Kincaid last year and running back James Cook and wide receiver Khalil Shakir in 2022. Beane made up for not hitting on many draft picks with savvy signings and trades. But he no longer has cap space flexibility and needs to produce a new core group for Allen.\n\n3. Bears GM Ryan Poles\n\nPoles deserves credit for trading last year's No. 1 pick to the Carolina Panthers in return for wide receiver DJ Moore and extra picks, including this year's No. 1 pick. The gamble paid off, but the pressure remains high because the Bears are technically one of two teams, along with the Panthers, to pass on C.J. Stroud, the reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year.\n\nAll signs point to the Bears taking Williams. He'll need to have a rookie season that compares to Stroud or at least one that makes it clear that the Bears have finally found their franchise quarterback. Poles and coach Matt Eberflus can't afford a situation in which the team has doubts about Williams heading into his second season. They waited for Justin Fields to become the face of the franchise for three seasons, and in the end, he was too inconsistent and traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers for a conditional sixth-round pick.\n\nPoles hasn't won many games the past two seasons as Chicago's top decision maker. He'll need to produce a winning season and/or have a clear star quarterback in Williams to remove the pressure. There's plenty to like about what Poles has done, including the trade for Keenan Allen, but Chicago has been waiting decades for a bonafide star signal-caller.\n\n2. Broncos GM George Paton\n\nIt's tough to understand why Paton remains the GM of the Broncos after the Russell Wilson debacle that set the franchise back years. To make matters worse, Denver has had poor draft classes the past two years. Outside of selecting Patrick Surtain II, Paton hasn't gotten much right since the Broncos hired him in 2021.\n\nBut for whatever reason, Paton continues to work alongside coach Sean Payton, who likely has plenty of say for the draft picks. Perhaps the Broncos are giving Paton time to turn it around because he didn't have a first-round pick the past two years because of the Wilson trade. The Broncos are slated to pick 12th in Thursday's opening round, and the team has a giant hole at quarterback -- unless they view Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson as bridge quarterbacks for 2024.\n\nPaton and Payton are in a tough dilemma because they don't have a second-round pick and likely will miss on the top four quarterbacks once they're on the clock for the first round. If the Broncos panic again at quarterback and reach for Michael Penix Jr. or Bo Nix at No. 12, that might not bode well for Paton in Denver. Taking the best available player could be the best path for a team that has gotten burned for aggressive moves.\n\n1. Jets GM Joe Douglas\n\nPossibly no NFL GM has as much pressure to win now as Dougles does. The New York Jets are all about 2024 with Aaron Rodgers, especially after how poorly it went last year with the injured Rodgers.\n\nFor Douglas to gain job security, he's going to need a franchise-changing draft class, one that resembles the 2022 class with wideout Garrett Wilson and cornerback Sauce Gardner. The Jets need a handful of rookies to make an immediate impact to help Rodgers on the field and end the franchise's postseason drought that goes back to 2010.\n\nWith coach Robert Saleh having a star-studded defense, Douglas might favor the offensive side with his early picks -- the Jets own the No. 10 overall pick. Perhaps Gang Green selects tight end Brock Bowers or wide receiver Rome Odunze to join pass catchers Wilson and Mike Williams. But Douglas, the team's GM since 2019, shouldn't overlook offensive tackle, even with free-agent additions Tyron Smith and Morgan Moses -- two 33-year-old tackles with injury concerns.\n\nIt might be wise to select an offensive tackle who could help in 2024 and for years to come. The pressure-filled Jets need to keep Rodgers upright at all cost.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri":

That decision should be made fairly quickly, however, as the Bears are widely expected to take quarterback Caleb Williams with the pick they acquired from the Carolina Panthers last year. Williams has been the talk of the town for the last month and a half, but there is still the No. 9 selection that the team holds in the first round, and those options are a bit more intriguing.\n\nDepending on how the board falls, the Bears should have their choice at either one of the top three wide receivers, the top offensive tackle, or the best defensive lineman. It's a position where they can find another blue-chip player to go along with Williams and kick open their competitive window beginning next season. Who will the Bears choose, though?\n\nThe draft can be a fickle beast, with some picks coming out of nowhere that can throw off the entire board. But no matter how things shake out, the Bears will likely walk away with an impact player. Here are 10 players who could be available when Chicago picks again in the first round that make sense for them to select.\n\n1. WR Rome Odunze\n\nNov 11, 2023; Seattle, Washington, USA; Washington Huskies wide receiver Rome Odunze (1) celebrates scoring a touchdown against the Utah Utes during the second half at Alaska Airlines Field at Husky Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Steven Bisig-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIf you poll a group of Bears fans, the majority of them will probably vote for wide receiver Rome Odunze as their top choice at No. 9 overall. Odunze is considered the third-best receiver in this draft behind Marvin Harrison Jr. and Malik Nabers, but he would be the best at his position in almost any other year. The Washington standout helped propel the Huskies to the College Football National Championship last season with 92 receptions for 1,640 yards and 13 touchdowns. He and Williams are fans of one another, and the two could develop a special connection in Chicago.\n\n2. DT Byron Murphy\n\nNov 18, 2023; Ames, Iowa, USA; Texas Longhorns defensive lineman Byron Murphy II (90) celebrates sacking the Iowa State Cyclones quarterback during the game at Jack Trice Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Aaron E. Martinez-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIf the Bears opt for defense, then Byron Murphy could be the top target. The talented defensive tackle out of Texas has shot up the draft boards in recent weeks but should still be on the board when the Bears are up to pick. Murphy had 29 total tackles (8.5 for a loss) and five sacks in 2023. He's a disruptive three-technique who plays until the echo of the whistle. He's an idea player for head coach Matt Eberflus and embodies the HITS principle. Murphy could be the missing piece that turns the Bears defense into a top-five unit.\n\n3. OT Olumuyiwa Fashanu\n\nNov 4, 2023; College Park, Maryland, USA; Penn State Nittany Lions offensive lineman Olumuyiwa Fashanu (74) stands on the sidelines during the first half against the Maryland Terrapins at SECU Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWide receiver and defensive line appear to be the top positions of need for the Bears, but what if they chose to focus on offensive tackle? This draft is rich with talent at the top, and Penn State's Olu Fashanu fits the bill for what they want. He has the measurables and could easily start at left tackle, plus he knows Williams from their days as high school teammates. There's talk that teams may covet the top tackles inside the top 10, and NFL Network's Daniel Jeremiah has the Bears taking Fashanu in his final mock draft. Maybe it comes to fruition.\n\n4. DE Jared Verse\n\nOct 14, 2023; Tallahassee, Florida, USA; Florida State Seminoles defensive end Jared Verse (5) against the Syracuse Orange during the first half at Doak S. Campbell Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Melina Myers-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Bears have a stud edge rusher in Montez Sweat, but they could use someone on the opposite side of him. This year's edge rushers don't have the same upside as previous draft classes, though the Bears could still find someone who can produce. Jared Verse is, in some ways, a mini Sweat who can play the run well and effectively rush the passer. Verse produced 18 sacks and 29.5 tackles for loss during his two seasons at Florida State. He's a bit older, and his ceiling may be capped, however.\n\n5. TE Brock Bowers\n\nGeorgia tight end Brock Bowers (19) scores a touchdown during the second half of a NCAA college football game against Ole Miss in Athens, Ga., on Saturday, Nov. 11, 2023. Georgia won 52-17.\n\nBrock Bowers could be the biggest offensive wild card of the first round. The game-changing tight end out of Georgia is expected to be selected within the first 15 picks of the draft, and some have argued the Bears should be in on him. He was a matchup nightmare in college, totaling 714 yards and six touchdowns in just 10 games. Bowers would give offensive coordinator Shane Waldron a fancy new toy to work with alongside Cole Kmet and Gerald Everett. First-round tight ends haven't been the luckiest in recent years, but Bowers would enter a favorable situation with the Bears if he were to be selected.\n\n6. WR Malik Nabers\n\nMalik Nabers 8 as the LSU Tigers take on Texas A&M in Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, November 25, 2023.\n\nWe're getting into the territory of players who probably won't be available at No. 9 overall, but there is still a chance. Wide receiver Malik Nabers is ahead of Odunze on most big boards and is considered the top player at his position, according to some analysts. He shined in 2023 for LSU, exploding for 1,569 yards and 13 touchdowns as he helped quarterback Jayden Daniels win the Heisman Trophy. Nabers can do it all from anywhere on the field and projects as a stud WR1 at the next level. If he falls to the Bears, there should be no hesitation in selecting him.\n\n7. DE Laiatu Latu\n\nSep 9, 2023; San Diego, California, USA; UCLA Bruins defensive lineman Laiatu Latu (15) battles against San Diego State Aztecs tight end Mark Redman (81) during the first half at Snapdragon Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Orlando Ramirez-USA TODAY Sports\n\nUCLA's Laiatu Latu is arguably the biggest boom-or-bust prospect in the draft. The edge rusher missed two seasons in college due to a neck injury and was told he wouldn't be able to play anymore. That wasn't the case as Latu put on a clinic in 2022 and 2023, totaling 23.5 sacks and 34 tackles for loss during his two years at UCLA. He's met with the Bears and they have his medical records. It's doubtful they would pick him at No. 9 overall, but stranger things have happened. Can Poles afford to take a gamble like this, though?\n\n8. OT JC Latham\n\nSep 4, 2021; Atlanta, Georgia, USA; Alabama Crimson Tide offensive lineman JC Latham (65) blocks against the Miami Hurricanes at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Dale Zanine-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAnother offensive tackle that the Bears have done their homework on is JC Latham out of Alabama. Latham is still very young, at just 21 years old, but has two years of experience starting for the Crimson Tide. Chicago brought him in for a top-30 visit and may see him as a suitable option at either left or right tackle. He's only played on the right side, but perhaps offensive line coach Chris Morgan sees potential in what he can do at either position.\n\n9. DE Dallas Turner\n\nDec 2, 2023; Atlanta, GA, USA; Alabama Crimson Tide linebacker Dallas Turner (15) celebrates after a sack in the second quarter against the Georgia Bulldogs in the SEC Championship at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Mandatory Credit: John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFrom one Alabama standout to another, defensive end Dallas Turner is the consensus top player at his position. Turner finished the 2023 season with 10 sacks and 14.5 tackles for loss and was a force coming off the edge. He's a smaller player, though, and may not have the build that Eberflus and Poles covet. He's an intriguing option, though, and if he somehow falls to No. 9, the Bears might have a tough decision to make.\n\n10. OT Joe Alt\n\nNov 27, 2021; Stanford, California, USA; Notre Dame Fighting Irish offensive lineman Joe Alt (76) blocks Stanford Cardinal linebacker Jordan Fox (10) during the fourth quarter at Stanford Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Darren Yamashita-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThere's no way Joe Alt manages to drop to No. 9, right? Someone always seems to fall further than expected in the draft, and depending on how the quarterback craze gets resolved, Alt could find himself right in the Bears' sights. The Notre Dame offensive tackle is widely considered the top offensive lineman in the draft and has been projected to go between 5 and 6. It only takes one team to throw a wrench into things, and that could result in Alt's fall. It's unlikely, but the Bears could upgrade their line in a big way if they were to land him.", "source": {"uri": "bearswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bears Wire"}, "authors":

And it was perfect.\n\n\"Have we gotten the quarterback situation completely right? No,\" Phillips said after an 8-8 season in 2020. \"Have we won enough games? No. Everything else is there.\"\n\nThat about it sums it up, doesn't it?\n\nFor decades, Chicago's quarterback issues have led to a lot of losing seasons for the Bears. Starting in 1966 (the first year of the Super Bowl era), the Bears have had 32 losing campaigns compared to 19 winning ones.\n\nThe list of starting quarterbacks over that time would make a Cleveland Browns fan blush. On Thursday, USC's Caleb Williams will add his name to the organization's tortured history and, like those who have come before him, promises to be different. But he is different. He's going to be a No. 1 overall pick. He was the consensus top QB in college football. He can be The One instead of another one.\n\nGiven the outside attention that is on the franchise, it's a good time to revisit it.\n\nWe wrote about Sid Luckman and Johnny Lujack and how in 1948, two years after his fourth NFL title of the 1940s, George Halas had a quarterback room to envy with those two and future Hall of Famer Bobby Layne. Four years later, they were all gone. Sid's son Bob, who still lives in the Chicago area, gets a kick out of when his old man is mentioned on national broadcasts. How many other World War II-era QBs still get air time in the 21st century?\n\nIt was the trip down memory lane that no one asked for.\n\nWhen longtime Bears fans (those who predate the Mike Ditka years) speak of the old days, they bring up Ed Brown and Rudy Bukich, Jack Concannon and Bob Avellini with a nostalgic sense of derision.\n\nAs for me, a Steelers fan sentenced to cover the Bears for some unknown sin, I'll never forget watching an aged Todd Collins try to win a game in Carolina or Mike Glennon attempt to convince us (and maybe himself) that he would start an entire season over the rookie Trubisky. I was there when a press box chuckled at Jonathan Quinn and when a Bears executive rifled a stat sheet against a wall after a Cutler interception. I've tried to make sense of it all.\n\nOne could argue the organization's \"QB or Bust\" era began in 2009 when GM Jerry Angelo traded for Cutler. In the 15 seasons that followed, the Bears have had three would-be franchise quarterbacks, three winning seasons and three playoff appearances. Their record in that span is 107-136, which equates to a .440 winning percentage.\n\nCutler, Trubisky, Fields. Each had so much potential. Each had their moments. Cutler owns most Bears passing records. Trubisky showed early promise. Fields captured our imaginations. Their intertwined legacies will be the arguments they inspired as they are the Bears quarterbacks of the Twitter age.\n\nAnd now here comes Williams, a new contender to be the orange-and-blue savior of the founding franchise.\n\nWhile it was a no-brainer for GM Ryan Poles to trade Fields to pave the way to draft Williams, there are concerns. Right or wrong, unnamed NFL coaches and trying-to-make-their-name football analysts have volleyed questions about Williams' makeup, his personality and, more importantly, how his improvisational style will fare in a league that regularly provides a reality check to high-flying collegiate stars.\n\nAnd it's not just the quarterbacks who have failed the Bears. The Bears have failed them. Bad coaching, organizational dysfunction, ill-suited timelines, poor rosters. It takes a village to ruin a quarterback. With that in mind, are the Bears set up to succeed with Williams? As The Athletic's Bruce Feldman and Kevin Fishbain wrote, there are questions.\n\nOver the last 15 years, the team's never-ending quarterback quandaries have dominated Bears conversations. And the tone of those discussions has ranged from delusional to unpleasant. The cycle of hope, reality, despair and change remains unbeaten.\n\nBut maybe Williams is the guy to change it. There are signs. Though the Bears traded draft picks to get Cutler, Trubisky and Fields, weakening the roster, this time, Poles is drafting Williams with a pick he received from a savvy trade. Maybe it's an omen.\n\nI never got the sense that any of the three were truly comfortable in their position. Beyond their unique personalities, I believe that reticence stemmed from their lack of success. Cutler had two just two winning seasons (his coach, Lovie Smith, was fired after the second one), Trubisky had one, Fields ... not even close.\n\nBeing the Bears QB is not for the sensitive or the thin-skinned. It carries with it the weight of expectations and the burden of this team's long, unhappy history.\n\nWilliams seemingly has the personality to take on the challenge, along with the physical skills to succeed in it. But it's just talk right now. It won't feel real until we see it.\n\nFor the Bears to start winning again, they need Williams to be the guy they've been dreaming about since the days of Luckman, Lujack and Layne. Quarterbacks and winning. It's what the NFL is all about.

Williams has been the odds-on favorite to land in Chicago since the beginning of the process. General manager Ryan Poles makes it official on Thursday evening.\n\nRound 1, Pick 9 - WR Rome Odunze, Washington\n\nAs a physical playmaker with a high IQ and positional flexibility, Odunze is a perfect complement to veteran studs DJ Moore and Keenan Allen in the receiving corps. Caleb Williams has quite the arsenal to work with.\n\nESPN\n\nDec 2, 2023; Atlanta, GA, USA; Alabama Crimson Tide linebacker Dallas Turner (15) celebrates after a sack in the second quarter against the Georgia Bulldogs in the SEC Championship at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Mandatory Credit: John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFrom ESPN's Jordan Reid:\n\nRound 1, Pick 1 (from CAR) - QB Caleb Williams, USC\n\nThe presumed No. 1 pick, Williams would enter a favorable situation for a rookie QB. Chicago has a solid pass-catching trio in DJ Moore, Cole Kmet and Keenan Allen, and the offensive line has two reliable tackles in Darnell Wright and Braxton Jones. Williams displays all the traits you want in a franchise quarterback, and he truly excels outside of structure -- he had a 31-to-4 touchdown-to-interception ratio outside the pocket over three years in college. Easy pick.\n\nRound 1, Pick 9 - EDGE Dallas Turner, Alabama\n\nConsidering the Bears have four total picks, trading back for more draft capital is certainly a possibility. However, defensive end hasn't really been addressed by GM Ryan Poles, outside of last season's trade for Montez Sweat, and Chicago had 30 sacks in 2023, second fewest in the NFL. Turner is explosive in getting to the QB. After a 10-sack final season at Alabama, he'd join Sweat to form a really good edge rush.\n\nUSA Today\n\nFrom USA Today's Nate Davis:\n\nRound 1, Pick 1 (from CAR) - QB Caleb Williams, USC\n\nAny slim notion that the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner might be available to other teams evaporated with Justin Fields' trade to Pittsburgh. Williams has drawn (unfair) comparisons to Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers and peak Russell Wilson - which certainly means he'll be expected to settle a position that's usually been in flux in the Windy City for the past century. A multi-threat weapon who can make throws with the highest level of difficulty, Williams should essentially complete Chicago's rebuild.\n\nRound 1, Pick 9 - WR Rome Odunze, Washington\n\nTrading down could be temping for Chicago, which has a draft-low four selections, as well. Yet the Bears, who have been busily building a proper supporting cast for Williams, are also dangerously thin at wideout behind DJ Moore and Keenan Allen, who will be 32 by Week 1 and is only under contract for this season. Spectacular as Harrison and Nabers are, plenty of proponents for Odunze, an All-American last year and All-Pac-12 member the past two. The 6-3, 212-pounder has a sterling off-field reputation plus the ball skills and production (92 catches, for 1,640 yards, 13 TDs in 2023) to be a co-WR1 with Moore in 2025 and beyond.\n\nFOX Sports\n\nSep 9, 2023; Raleigh, North Carolina, USA; Notre Dame Fighting Irish tackle Joe Alt (76) during the first half at Carter-Finley Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Rob Kinnan-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFrom FOX Sports' Rob Rang:\n\nRound 1, Pick 1 (from CAR) - QB Caleb Williams, USC\n\nNo surprise at the top with the Bears selecting Williams, the most gifted quarterback of the class. The 2022 Heisman Trophy winner's unique combination of improvisational ability and accuracy to all levels should make the Bears an immediate playoff contender.\n\nRound 1, Pick 9 - OT Joe Alt, Notre Dame\n\nIf Caleb Williams is really going to take the NFL by storm, he'll need greater protection up front than Chicago provided Justin Fields. Pairing the pro-ready Alt with last year's top pick Darnell Wright would give the Bears the size and physicality up front that they haven't had in decades.\n\nPro Football Focus\n\nBrian Thomas Jr 11 runs the ball as the LSU Tigers take on Texas A&M in Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, November 25, 2023.\n\nFrom Pro Football Focus:\n\nRound 1, Pick 1 (from CAR) - QB Caleb Williams, USC\n\nThe first pick in the 2024 NFL Draft is a no-brainer. Chicago needs a new signal-caller, and Williams is one of the cleanest prospects in recent memory. With 72 passing touchdowns and 59 big-time throws since 2022, Williams brings the necessary passing skill set to revitalize the Bears' offense.\n\nRound 1, Pick 13 (from LV) - WR Brian Thomas Jr., LSU\n\nMock Trade: Bears receive Pick Nos. 13 and 44; Raiders receive Pick No. 9 and a 2025 third-round pick\n\nWith the Bears having only four draft picks, and the top three receivers gone by the ninth pick, accumulating draft capital via a trade-down makes sense. Brian Thomas Jr. steps into a situation where he doesn't have to be the team's top receiver immediately. He can develop his route running while still aiding Caleb Williams' transition to the NFL.\n\nCBS Sports\n\nTUSCALOOSA, ALABAMA - NOVEMBER 20: Dallas Turner #15 of the Alabama Crimson Tide reacts after a sack against the Arkansas Razorbacks during the second half at Bryant-Denny Stadium on November 20, 2021 in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

The question really will come down to how the Bears want to use the rest of their draft. I'm fascinated to see if they use the No. 9 pick to add more weapons to their offense, trade down for more picks, or bank on Williams and their offseason additions to be enough for their offense.\n\nRound 1, Pick 15 (from IND) - EDGE Dallas Turner, Alabama\n\nChicago may stay put and take Byron Murphy II or Turner at 9, but being able to trade down, grab more future assets, and being able to pair Montez Sweat with Turner can give the Bears a strong pass rush for the future.\n\nSports Illustrated\n\nDec 2, 2023; Charlotte, NC, USA; Florida State Seminoles defensive lineman Jared Verse (5) reacts during the fourth quarter against the Louisville Cardinals at Bank of America Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Jim Dedmon-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFrom Sports Illustrated's Conor Orr:\n\nRound 1, Pick 1 (from CAR) - QB Caleb Williams, USC\n\nThe only real decision since Day 1. My only issue with this selection? By not bringing in Williams with a new regime, the Bears are putting a lot of institutional pressure on Williams and a win-or-go-home coaching staff that has already experienced the rigors of the hot seat.\n\nRound 1, Pick 16 (from IND) - EDGE Jared Verse, Florida State\n\nThe board breaks for Chicago, and the Bears get the No. 1 quarterback and pass rusher available in the draft. Verse had 30 tackles for loss and 18 sacks over two seasons with the Seminoles, and gives head coach Matt Eberflus the ammunition he needs to create hell up front for opposing teams. A Bears defense that played well defensively down the stretch last year gets much better.\n\nYahoo!

Williams took only one top-30 visit and it was with the Bears. Congratulations, Bears fans. You might actually have the quarterback you've always wanted -- Williams is that promising.\n\nRound 1, Pick 7 (from TEN) - WR Rome Odunze, Washington\n\nChicago jumps the Falcons to get their hands on Odunze, who has the potential to be a true No. 1 receiver in the NFL. Wide receiver is not an immediate need for the Bears with DJ Moore and Keenan Allen on the roster, but Allen won't be around forever and Odunze is one of the premier players in this draft. Moore, Allen and Odunze would be a fantastic trio for Caleb Williams to work with and he would have Moore and Odunze for the long term.\n\nESPN\n\nSep 24, 2022; Seattle, Washington, USA; Washington Huskies wide receiver Rome Odunze (1) signals for a first down after catching a pass against the Stanford Cardinal during the first quarter at Alaska Airlines Field at Husky Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFrom ESPN's Courtney Cronin:\n\nRound 1, Pick 1 (from CAR) - QB Caleb Williams, USC\n\nDrafting Williams with the No. 1 overall pick has felt like a foregone conclusion since Chicago traded quarterback Justin Fields to Pittsburgh last month. The Bears are the only NFL franchise to never have a quarterback throw for 4,000 yards or 30 touchdowns in a season and will rely on Williams, the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner, to put an end to their decades-long QB futility. Williams joins a roster flush with Pro Bowl talent.\n\nRound 1, Pick 9 - WR Rome Odunze, Washington\n\nBears general manager Ryan Poles continues to add to the offense with Odunze, a receiver who might have been the first off the board in drafts that didn't feature so much talent at wideout. Adding the big-bodied receiver to a position group that already boasts DJ Moore and Keenan Allen gives the Bears an unquestioned top-five trio for Williams' rookie season.\n\n33rd Team\n\nNov 18, 2023; Los Angeles, California, USA; USC Trojans quarterback Caleb Williams (13) scrambles during the second quarter against the UCLA Bruins at United Airlines Field at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

The Chicago Bears have never had a quarterback throw for 4,000 yards or 30 touchdowns in a season. The Bears hope Caleb Williams does that and a lot more for the city of Chicago, which has been desperately waiting for a franchise quarterback.\n\nRound 1, Pick 9 - WR Rome Odunze, Washington\n\nOnce the Bears come back on the clock at No. 9 they will only have three picks remaining in this draft, so they're another team that would make sense to trade down. Ryan Poles has already traded down seven times in his short tenure as general manager.\n\nIf they stick, it's difficult to see them passing on Rome Odunze, who would join DJ Moore and Keenan Allen. That would be pretty good company for Caleb Williams.\n\nThe Ringer\n\nTexas Longhorns defensive lineman Byron Murphy II (90) celebrates after a sack against TCU Horned Frogs quarterback Josh Hoover (10) in the second quarter of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, November. 11, 2023, at Amon G. Carter Stadium in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nFrom The Ringer's Danny Kelly:\n\nRound 1, Pick 1 (from CAR) - QB Caleb Williams, USC\n\nWe don't say this enough of the obvious selections, so here's a reminder: This is the best pick of the first round. Williams is the sort of quarterback prospect who comes around only once every few drafts, and he lands in a great environment in Chicago. I expect a long and prolific career.\n\nRound 1, Pick 9 - DT Byron Murphy II, Texas\n\nThe Bears double-dipped at defensive tackle last season with Gervon Dexter in the second round and Zacch Pickens in the third -- so why Murphy? Well, Justin Jones and his 720 snaps went out the door in free agency, and head coach Matt Eberflus has made it clear he would like to add to the team's pass rush from any alignment: outside, opposite Montez Sweat, or on the interior. Murphy was named as a dark horse to go in the top 10 earlier this week by NFL Network's Daniel Jeremiah, and I think that'll gain even more steam over the next few days.\n\nSporting News\n\nSep 9, 2023; San Diego, California, USA; UCLA Bruins defensive lineman Laiatu Latu (15) battles against San Diego State Aztecs tight end Mark Redman (81) during the first half at Snapdragon Stadium.

The extending of plays to deliver big passes and improv also should remind offensive coordinator Shane Waldron of his one-time Seahawks QB, Russell Wilson.\n\nRound 1, Pick 9 - EDGE Laiatu Latu, UCLA\n\nThe Bears should think about following up Williams with another key defensive cornerstone for Matt Eberflus. They don't really need to go far for a comparison. They acquired a similar-sized smooth pass rusher in Montez Sweat (6-6, 262 pounds) last season, so they should love the thought of them being bookends.\n\nSep 30, 2022; Pasadena, California, USA; Washington Huskies wide receiver Rome Odunze (1) celebrates after a touchdown in the first quarter against the UCLA Bruins at the Rose Bowl. Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFrom Chicago Tribune's Brad Biggs:\n\nRound 1, Pick 1 (from CAR) - QB Caleb Williams, USC\n\nThe Bears have a better roster for a quarterback set to go No. 1 than there has been in a mighty long time. Wide receivers DJ Moore and Keenan Allen, tight ends Cole Kmet and Gerald Everett and an offensive line that should be improved will put Williams in position to avoid some of the bumps in the road encountered by many rookie quarterbacks -- including some in the recent Bears past.\n\nRound 1, Pick 9 - WR Rome Odunze, Washington\n\nThis feels like a spot where the Bears will either grab Odunze, who had a super-productive career at Washington, or select Murphy. One of them likely will be available if Poles passes on a trade-down scenario. Odunze could quickly emerge as a future star with Caleb Williams and essentially replace Keenan Allen in the future.\n\nSB Nation\n\nMalik Nabers 8 as the LSU Tigers take on Texas A&M in Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, November 25, 2023.\n\nFrom SB Nation's Joseph Acosta:\n\nRound 1, Pick 1 (from CAR) - QB Caleb Williams, USC\n\nYou can put this one in stone at this point. Williams probably already has an apartment picked out on Lakeshore Drive by now.\n\nRound 1, Pick 9 - WR Malik Nabers, LSU\n\nThis pick also could be one that gets traded back, as the Bears still need help along both lines. However, when you get the chance to add a walking big play in Malik Nabers, you got to. Nabers is a little similar to DJ Moore, yes, but that explosiveness will play well with new QB Caleb Williams.\n\nTouchdown Wire\n\nDec 2, 2023; Atlanta, GA, USA; Alabama Crimson Tide linebacker Dallas Turner (15) celebrates after a sack in the second quarter against the Georgia Bulldogs in the SEC Championship at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Mandatory Credit: John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFrom Touchdown Wire's Alyssa Barbieri:\n\nRound 1, Pick 1 (from CAR) - QB Caleb Williams, USC\n\nThere's little doubt what the Bears will do at No. 1 as Caleb Williams has been the pick for weeks now. It's all a matter of making it official on draft night. Chicago has made no secret of their intentions with Williams, who will be tasked with breaking the QB curse that's haunted this franchise for decades. Luckily, Williams is coming into arguably the best situation ever for a No. 1 quarterback. Not only does he have a slew of weapons, including DJ Moore and Keenan Allen, and a solid offensive line, but he also has the backing of a potential top-five defense and a quarterback-friendly offensive coordinator in Shane Waldron. Not to mention, Williams has been hailed by some as the best QB prospect since Andrew Luck. He's got the arm talent, mobility and creativity that make him an enticing quarterback prospect. Now, it's about developing him.\n\nRound 1, Pick 9 - EDGE Dallas Turner, Alabama\n\nThe Bears will have several options at No. 9, depending how the board falls. They can stay and make the selection, trade back, trade up, who knows. But in this scenario, the top three receivers were off the board and Chicago went with arguably the top edge rusher in Dallas Turner. When looking at this roster, edge rusher is the glaring need heading into the 2024 season, and it could be the difference between a top-10 and top-five defense. The Bears already have a stud in Montez Sweat. Adding Turner, who has length, athleticism and explosiveness, to play opposite him would give them a dynamic 1-2 punch to elevate this defensive front.", "source": {"uri": "bearswire.usatoday.com",

It was perfect.\n\n\"Have we got the quarterback situation right? No,\" Phillips said after an 8-8 season in 2020. \"Have we won enough games? No. Everything else has.\n\nThat about sums it up, right?\n\nOver the decades, Chicago's quarterback issues have led to a lot of losing seasons for the Bears. Since 1966 (the first year of the Super Bowl era), the Bears have had 32 losing campaigns compared to 19 winning campaigns.\n\nThe list of starting quarterbacks during that time would make Cleveland Browns fans blush. On Thursday, USC's Caleb Williams will add his name to the organization's tortured history and, like those before him, promises to be different. But he is different. He's going No. 1 overall. He was the consensus top QB in college football. He can be one instead of another.\n\nChicago asked before.\n\nIn the early days of 2021, between the departure of Mitch Trubisky and the arrival of Justin Fields, Athletic Quarterbacks ran a series about the team's long, strange history.\n\nGiven the external focus on the franchise, now is a good time to revisit it.\n\nSid Luckman and Johnny Lujack, and in 1948, after his fourth NFL title of the 1940s, George Halas had a quarterback room to envy with those two and future Hall of Famer Bobby Laine. Four years later, they were all gone. Sid's son Bob, who still lives in the Chicago area, gets a kick out when his old man is mentioned on a national broadcast. How many World War II-era QBs are still getting air time in the 21st century?\n\nIn our series, we wrote about Bill Wade, who won that 1963 championship, and Bobby Douglas, who could have been special. We covered Vince Evans, the team's first black starting quarterback, and his replacement, Bears' first punky QB Jim McMahon.\n\nWe analyzed the Rick Mirror trade and what Jay Cutler's backups think of him. We've compiled all of the best games from Bears QBs and a condensed account of the worst. We asked former center Olin Grudge to name all the quarterbacks he's sacked.\n\nIt was a trip down memory lane that no one asked for.\n\nWhen longtime Bears fans (predating the Mike Ditka years) talk about the old days, they bring up Ed Brown and Rudy Bukich, Jack Concannon and Bob Avelini with nostalgia.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, I'll never forget a Steelers fan being punished for covering the Bears for an unknown sin, an old Todd Collins trying to win a game in Carolina, or Mike Glennon trying to convince us he was going to start. A whole season of new Trubisky. I was there when a press box laughed at Jonathan Quinn and when a Bears executive fired a stat sheet against the wall after a Cutler interception. I tried to understand everything.\n\nOne could argue that the company's \"QB or Bust\" era began in 2009 when GM Jerry Angelo traded for Cutler. In the 15 seasons that followed, the Bears had three franchise quarterbacks, three winning seasons and three playoff appearances. Their record over that span is 107-136, which equates to a .440 winning percentage.\n\nCutler, Trubisky, Fields. Everyone had so much energy. Everyone had their moments. Cutler holds the record for most passes by the Bears. Trubisky showed early promise. Fields captured our imaginations. Their intertwined legacies will be the arguments they incite as the Bears quarterbacks of the Twitter age.\n\nNow here comes Williams, the new contender to be the Orange and Blue savior of the founding franchise.\n\nWhile trading Fields is a no-brainer for GM Ryan Poles, who will make way to develop Williams, there are concerns. Rightly or wrongly, unnamed NFL coaches and football analysts trying to make a name for themselves raised questions about Williams' makeup, his personality and, most importantly, how his improvisational style would look in a league. High-flying college stars.\n\nAnd it wasn't just the quarterbacks that the Bears failed. The bears missed them. Poor training, organizational dysfunction, inappropriate deadlines, poor lists. It takes a village to destroy a quarterback. With that in mind, are the Bears set up to succeed with Williams? as AthleticWritten by Bruce Feldman and Kevin Fishbein, there are questions.\n\nOver the past 15 years, the group's endless quandaries have dominated peer conversations. The tone of those discussions ranged from delusional to unpleasant. The cycle of hope, truth, despair and change remains unbroken.\n\nBut maybe Williams is the guy to change that. There are signs. Although the Bears traded draft picks to acquire Cutler, Trubisky and Fields, weakening the roster, this time, Boles is drafting Williams with the pick he gained from a savvy trade. Maybe it was an omen.\n\nI don't feel any of the three are truly comfortable in their position. Beyond their individual characteristics, I believe the complacency was due to their lack of success. Cutler had two winning seasons (his coach, Lovie Smith, was fired after the second), Trubisky had one, and Fields ... not even close.\n\nBeing the Bears QB is not for the sensitive or thin-skinned. It carries the weight of expectations and the burden of this team's long, unhappy history.\n\nWilliams seemingly has the personality to rise to the challenge and the physical skills to succeed. But that's just talk now. It doesn't feel real until we see it.\n\nFor the Bears to win again, Williams will need to be the guy they've been dreaming of since the Luckman, Lujack and Laine eras. quarter-final and victory. It's about the NFL.

While there's no question what they'll do with the first overall pick (hello, Caleb Williams), they have a big decision to make with the ninth overall selection.\n\nWill they take a player to add depth on defense or will they give Williams more help?\n\nThe Athletic's Dane Brugler shared his thoughts on what he believes could happen at No. 9. Assuming the top three wide receivers -- Marvin Harrison Jr., Malik Nabers and Rome Odunze -- are off the board, he thinks Chicago could target Texas defensive tackle Byron Murphy II.\n\nBrugler noted that Murphy would fit in well with Matt Eberflus's scheme, giving them the disruptive three-tech they're missing.\n\nThis could be a great move for the Bears if it happened. They already traded for Montez Sweat last year and it turned their play on defense around. If they added someone like Murphy, they would solidify their pass rush in a big way.\n\nDuring his pre-draft press conference, general manager Ryan Poles said an interior pass rusher, like Murphy, is \"probably a preference when you have an outside guy.\" And we know the Bears already have that guy in Sweat.\n\nThis is a very big draft for Poles.

A look at Chicago's all-time first-round quarterbacks", "body": "Courtney Cronin joined ESPN in 2017, originally covering the Minnesota Vikings before switching to the Chicago Bears in 2022. Courtney is a frequent panelist on Around the Horn and host of Best Week Ever on ESPN Radio. She also co-hosts The Chicago Bears Podcast on ESPN 1000. She previously worked at the San Jose Mercury News as a multimedia sports journalist.\n\nThe Chicago Bears have selected a quarterback in the first round six times in the common draft era (since 1967) with lackluster results that have kept the franchise in a perennial search for a long-term answer.\n\nThose six quarterbacks combined for zero selections to the All-Pro teams (first or second team) and only two Pro Bowls while in Chicago. The Bears are the only NFL franchise that has not had a quarterback throw for 4,000 yards or 30 touchdowns in a season. Chicago hopes its luck will change on Thursday when the team is expected to select USC's Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick. Before Williams officially makes his way to Chicago, here's a look at how other first-round Bears quarterbacks have fared during their time in the Windy City.\n\nThe Bears moved up nine spots in the 2021 draft to select the former Ohio State standout with the 11th pick. Fields' NFL career began as the third party in a quarterback competition with veterans Nick Foles and Andy Dalton. He eventually won the starting job in Week 3 of his rookie season and was sacked nine times by Cleveland in his debut.\n\nFields' dynamic skills were the backbone of Chicago's top-ranked rushing offense for two seasons as he put his stamp on NFL history by running for 178 yards against Miami in 2022, the second most by a quarterback in a regular-season game. Fields worked with two offensive coordinators -- Bill Lazor and Luke Getsy -- in three seasons. While he showed promise in his third season, the 25-year-old ranked in the bottom third in nearly every passing category in 2023, from EPA per dropback (minus-0.05) to completion percentage (61.4).\n\nRecord: 29-21 Length of tenure: Four seasons (2017 to 2020)\n\nChicago traded up to No. 2 to draft Trubisky in 2017 over eventual three-time Super Bowl champion quarterback Patrick Mahomes and three-time Pro Bowler Deshaun Watson. After initially being named the backup to Mike Glennon, Trubisky earned the starting job in Week 5 of his rookie season, a role he held consistently for three years before getting benched four games into the 2020 season.\n\nBacked by their No. 1 ranked defense, the Bears won the NFC North in 2018 and made the playoffs as a wild-card team twice during Trubisky's tenure. Trubisky had two postseason starts (2018 vs. Philadelphia, 2020 vs. New Orleans), and the Bears offense failed to score more than a touchdown in each loss. The Bears did not exercise Trubisky's fifth-year option in 2021, which led the quarterback to sign as a free agent with the Buffalo. Trubisky remains the Bears career leader in completion percentage (64.0) and passer rating (87.2).\n\nRex Grossman\n\nRecord: 19-12 Length of tenure: Six seasons (2003 to 2008)\n\nGrossman was drafted 22nd in 2003 and did not become the Bears starting quarterback until the 2006 season. Injuries and inconsistent play marred Grossman's time in Chicago despite the Bears going 13-3 and making it to Super Bowl XLI during his lone season as the full-time starter.\n\nHe threw more interceptions (35) than touchdowns (33) in 31 starts with the Bears. Grossman had one of the worst performances by a starting quarterback in a Super Bowl when he threw for 165 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions and had two fumbles in Chicago's 29-17 loss to Indianapolis. Grossman lost his starting job three games into the 2007 season and was a backup over the final four years of his career between Chicago, Houston and Washington.\n\nMonths after finishing third in Heisman Trophy voting, McNown was drafted by Chicago with the No. 12 pick in 1999. The former UCLA quarterback set rookie franchise records with 27 completions, 301 passing yards and four touchdowns in a win over Detroit, one of the lone highlights from a career that spanned just 15 starts. McNown quickly outwore his welcome in Chicago due to poor play and comments directed at teammates and fans and was traded to Miami ahead of his third NFL season, where he competed as the Dolphins' third-string quarterback but never saw the field.\n\nThe Bears drafted Harbaugh with the No. 26 pick in 1987 after he was named Big Ten MVP during his senior season at Michigan. His breakout season came in 1991, when he threw for a career-high 3,121 yards and led the Bears to back-to-back 11-5 finishes, which included an NFC Central title in 1990. Harbaugh missed the final two regular-season games and playoffs that year with a shoulder injury.\n\nHis lone postseason appearance as the Bears starting quarterback resulted in a 17-13 loss to Dallas in the wild-card round in 1991.\n\nJim McMahon\n\nRecord: 46-15 Length of tenure: Seven seasons (1982 to 1988)\n\nMcMahon was selected fifth overall in 1982 and led the Bears to their lone Super Bowl victory during the 1985 season, one year removed from sustaining a lacerated kidney that sidelined him for the final six games in 1984. He threw for 256 yards and rushed for two touchdowns in the Bears' 46-10 win over the Patriots in Super Bowl XX and led Chicago to five straight NFC Central titles from 1984-88.\n\nInjuries limited the quarterback throughout his seven seasons in Chicago (McMahon played a career-high 14 games just once in 1983). He was traded to the Los Angeles Chargers in 1989 after a \"falling out\" with Bears president Michael McCaskey and coach Mike Ditka.", "source": {"uri": "africa.espn.com", "dataType": "news",

Mandatory Credit: Jessica Alcheh-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWith the 2024 NFL a few hours away, Caleb Williams will soon become the first player to hug and shake hands with Roger Goodell. And when the announcer utters those magical words that every Chicago fan and Williams himself has been waiting to hear, it'll all be worth the wait. But once the journey starts, it'll be an uphill battle to win against the most talented sides in American Football. For a tough battle, you need trustworthy people around you. Protection is key.\n\nAnd a good offensive line becomes of peak importance when you draft a young rookie QB. If Chicago doesn't end up trading their 9th overall pick, they are likely to get their hands on an Offensive Tackle, to protect their star shot-caller. The Bears have plenty of options to choose from, but it seems their new incoming QB Williams knows the perfect man for the job, someone he believes will put his life on the line to save him. That guy is Penn State star tackle Olu Fashanu.\n\nFashanu, already predicted to be picked in the top 15 of the Draft as per Peter Schrager, shares a bond with Caleb, playing at the same Gonzaga College High School. Looks like the 2022 Heisman winner is already giving instructions to the Bears on whom to pick, someone with whom he is already acquainted.\n\nWhile many drafts see Chicago pick a wideout or trade away their pick, it seems drafting an OT in the first round won't be such a bad thing. The percentage of success that first round offensive linemen have shown surpasses any success quarterbacks or even receivers have shown. Thus, seasoned coaches and front offices tend to go with safer picks towards the top of the draft. And thus, Bears have a peculiar position to play from.\n\nWhile the 1st pick feels like a lock, their 2nd pick or the 9th overall pick, Gives them a dilemma whether to choose a Tackle or a receiver or trade away. If the Bears are keen on drafting an OT, there are plenty of 1st round options such as Joe Alt, Olu Fashanu, Taliese Fuaga, JC Latham, Troy Fautanu, Tyler Guyton, Amirus Mims, Graham Barton, and Zach Frazier.\n\nIf they choose to draft another weapon for Caleb Williams, they could very well draft Malik Nabers, Brian Thomas Jr., Xavier Worthy, Adonai Mitchell, and Ladd McConkey. It is unlikely that Chicago will trade up for a prospect. Given they only have four picks in the draft, trading down seems like the best option to acquire more draft capital.\n\nIf they trade away the 9th pick and move down to somewhere above 20, they could very well get a 2nd-round pick alongside the 1st. Trading down would allow them to still draft an OT and with the 2nd or even a 3rd pick they receive via trade, they could still land a receiver for Williams.\n\nThings seem optimistic for the Bears for the first time in over a decade. They could finally get a franchise QB, and they are doing everything in their power to make his first season a success. No Bears QB has ever thrown for over 4000 yards. While they made the playoffs only 4 seasons ago, the teams has not tasted victory in the postseason since 2011. That's a long drought for one of the oldest franchises in the NFL.

(Photo by Quinn Harris/Getty Images)\n\nQuarterback: Right now, it's the biggest hole on the roster. But that's not expected to last long when the first round of the NFL draft kicks off, as Chicago will select Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick. Tyson Bagent and Brett Rypien are the only quarterbacks currently on the roster, and it wouldn't be a surprise to see the Bears add another veteran this summer.\n\nPass rusher: Addressing the pass rush could certainly be a focal point in this draft, as it's the last thing holding this team back from being a top-five unit. They're strong in every other area -- linebacker and secondary. Having Montez Sweat certainly helps, but the Bears are in need of a complement for him -- be it off the edge or adding an interior pass rusher to take this defensive line to the next level.\n\nWide receiver: Yes, the Bears currently have a dynamic 1-2 punch at wide receiver with DJ Moore and new addition Keenan Allen. But there's a dip after those two. Tyler Scott is currently slotted in at that WR3 spot, but he didn't have much impact as a rookie. Depending on how the board falls, one of the \"big three\" could be available at No. 9 -- most likely Rome Odunze, who's been among the most mocked players to Chicago -- and the Bears shouldn't hesitate on landing another weapon for Williams, if possible.\n\nBears Wire Staff predicts Chicago's first-round picks\n\nNo. 1 overall\n\nAlyssa Barbieri: QB Caleb Williams, USC Brendan Sugrue: QB Caleb Williams, USC Lucas Hunt: QB Caleb Williams, USC Ryan Fedrau: QB Caleb Williams, USC Nate Atkins: QB Caleb Williams, USC Vinnie Parise: QB Caleb Williams, USC\n\nNo. 9 overall\n\nAlyssa Barbieri: WR Rome Odunze, Washington Brendan Sugrue: DT Byron Murphy II, Texas Lucas Hunt: EDGE Dallas Turner, Alabama Ryan Fedrau: WR Malik Nabers, LSU Nate Atkins: OT Olu Fashanu, Penn State Vinnie Parise: WR Rome Odunze, Washington Final mock drafts\n\nAlyssa Barbieri shares the NFL Wire's one-round mock draft.

But they also have their own No. 9 selection, which presents more intrigue given there should be different options -- depending on how the board falls.\n\nIt's certainly possible that the Bears trade back from ninth overall. And it's something that would make sense considering they have just four picks (and if a quarterback were to fall to No. 9) -- even though general manager Ryan Poles said he's comfortable with four selections.\n\nBut, for the sake of this exercise, we assume that Chicago stays put at No. 9 and makes a selection. With that in mind, here are the positions most likely to be the pick at ninth overall.\n\n5. Tight end\n\nGeorgia tight end Brock Bowers (19) scores a touchdown during the second half of a NCAA college football game against Ole Miss in Athens, Ga., on Saturday, Nov. 11, 2023. Georgia won 52-17.\n\nTight end isn't exactly a pressing need considering the Bears have Cole Kmet and free-agent addition Gerald Everett on the roster. But that doesn't necessarily mean Brock Bowers isn't in play for Chicago at No. 9, especially considering he's a huge weapon in the passing game. New offensive coordinator Shane Waldron utilizes two- and three-tight end sets, so adding Bowers to a tight end group already featuring playmakers like Kmet and Everett would only be good for incoming rookie quarterback Caleb Williams.\n\n4. Offensive tackle\n\nSep 9, 2023; Raleigh, North Carolina, USA; Notre Dame Fighting Irish tackle Joe Alt (76) during the first half at Carter-Finley Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Rob Kinnan-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Bears have two quality starting offensive tackles in Braxton Jones and Darnell Wright, but it wouldn't be a complete surprise to see them upgrade at left tackle, if the opportunity presents itself. Jones, a former fifth-round pick, has been a two-year starter (on track to be three years), but Poles has made it clear in the past he wouldn't hesitate to upgrade or bring in competition. While there are other positions that are the favorites to be the pick at No. 9, if someone like Joe Alt were to fall to them (which is unlikely), it would be hard to imagine Chicago passing on him.\n\n3. Edge rusher\n\nDec 2, 2023; Atlanta, GA, USA; Alabama Crimson Tide linebacker Dallas Turner (15) celebrates after a sack in the second quarter against the Georgia Bulldogs in the SEC Championship at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Mandatory Credit: John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports\n\nChicago has a glaring hole at edge rusher opposite star Montez Sweat, and it's certainly a top position of consideration for the Bears at No. 9. Depending on how the board falls, Chicago could very well have their choice of edge rusher between Dallas Turner, Jared Verse and Laiatu Latu. And if the Bears opted to trade back from ninth overall, they'd likely be in a position to still land one of them. Shoring up the pass rush is important to helping elevate this defense from a top-10 unit to a possible top-five group. But edge rusher might not be the top defensive choice for Chicago.\n\n2. Defensive tackle\n\nTexas Longhorns defensive lineman Byron Murphy II (90) celebrates after a sack against TCU Horned Frogs quarterback Josh Hoover (10) in the second quarter of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, November. 11, 2023, at Amon G. Carter Stadium in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nDefensive tackle gets the nod ahead of edge rusher here following Poles' comments during his pre-draft press conference, where he indicated an interior pass rusher is \"probably a preference when you have an outside guy.\" There's been plenty of buzz building about Chicago targeting Texas defensive tackle Byron Murphy II, much like buzz about Darnell Wright kicked into gear last year. Murphy would give Matt Eberflus the disruptive three-technique he's been missing on his defense (and fill the void left by Justin Jones). At this point, it feels pretty likely that Murphy could be the pick at No. 9 -- if the next position is off the table.\n\n1. Wide receiver\n\nNov 11, 2023; Seattle, Washington, USA; Washington Huskies wide receiver Rome Odunze (1) celebrates scoring a touchdown against the Utah Utes during the second half at Alaska Airlines Field at Husky Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Steven Bisig-USA TODAY Sports\n\nYes, the Bears currently have a dynamic 1-2 punch at wide receiver with DJ Moore and new addition Keenan Allen. But that doesn't mean they should pass on the chance to take a top wideout in this draft. Depending on how the board falls, one of the \"big three\" could be available at No. 9 -- most likely Rome Odunze, who's been among the most mocked players to Chicago. Interestingly enough, Odunze recently worked out with Caleb Williams -- along with potential future teammates Moore and Allen. Is it fate? We'll see, but there's definitely a chance that all three wideouts are off the board come No. 9.", "source": {"uri": "bearswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bears Wire"}, "authors":

How do the Bears operate with contrasting opinions?\n\n\"I think the big thing is you kind of talk about whatever process you're in --- if it's the draft --- kind of what your standards are, how you want to operate, what you're looking to accomplish,\" Poles said Tuesday during the Bears' pre-draft press conference. \"And you lay that out --- it's a conversation --- but in some kind of outline. Often times there are situations that start to push you outside of what you said you wanted to accomplish; what we all agreed as a coaching staff and as a front office, what we want to accomplish. And there are things that happen that start to push you outside those lines.\n\n\"With all of those things happening, sometimes as a leader, you do get distracted. There are things that pull you outside. Maybe we shouldn't do this, maybe we need to shift gears. And you need people like Ian [Cunningham], like Flus [Matt Eberflus], like Kevin [Warren] to say 'Hey man, we want to accomplish this. We want to stay in these lines. We want to do it this way.' And once they kind of see that you're getting off that track [they] nudge you back into where you should be.\n\n\"I think I've been fortunate and blessed enough to have the skill set to take in that information, not to take it personal and to say 'Well, I'm running the show. It's all about what I want to do.' It's listening to people that you trust so that you stay in the lines of doing things that how you want to do it and how you want to accomplish your goals.\"\n\nAhead of the 2024 NFL Draft, those situations have likely come up often. Think about it. They traded Justin Fields, re-signed Jaylon Johnson, signed Kevin Byard, traded for Keenan Allen. Those moves don't happen without Poles seeking out his cohort for a co-sign.\n\nNot everyone is going to agree with Poles', or Cunningham's or Eberflus' ideas for how to shape the roster. But that's OK. Would you want to make decisions of that gravity without the co-sign of your peers?\n\n\"Collaboration\" was a significant buzzword with the former regime of Ryan Pace and Matt Nagy; it's ironic, seeing as they struggled to do that precisely.\n\nIf you recall, Ryan Pace and Matt Nagy weren't on the same page about Mitch Trubisky. When the Bears drafted him, Nagy was with the Chiefs, where he offered a helping hand in drafting Patrick Mahomes.\n\nBut Nagy was never really on board with Trubisky when he got to Chicago, according to a prior report from The Athletic.\n\n\"After the 2019 season concluded, Trubisky prepared to meet with Nagy. They needed to have a conversation. How were they going to make this work? The quarterback prepared notes for the meeting. Nagy, though, didn't make it -- 'He no-showed him,' a source said. Trubisky left his notes behind.\"\n\nThat type of dysfunction is what implodes a team, leaving them unlikely chances of success before they step out onto the field. But that behavior doesn't seem present with the current regime.\n\nThe staff the Bears currently employ appears to be one solified group. Poles calls the shots. But he inhales advice of Cunningham --- his 'best friend,' according to the latter --- Eberflus, who Poles opted to retain as head coach after a disappointing second season with the team, and Warren, who Poles greatly respects as the team's CEO/President.\n\nIt's a collaborative effort. And that's why the Bears have been able to churn out an exciting roster heading into the 2024 season, even before the draft.\n\n\"The job's never done but we have had those conversations and it does put a smile on your face in terms of the work that we've done,\" Poles said. \"I feel like we've done a good job getting the roster where it is. It makes me feel really fortunate about some of the things that happened to allow us build a roster maybe a little bit more efficiently. It's something to be proud of but at the same time the job's not done.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Poles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Poles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Polish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Nagy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matt Nagy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Eberflus", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matt Eberflus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Waldron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shane Waldron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Pace", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Pace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenan_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keenan Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Trubisky", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Trubisky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3aNhGhSWdajGI7E5CKBZEw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnchicago.com/69cc7c5914f4912d4bd1e222e67ca637", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

While unlikely, could Notre Dame offensive tackle Joe Alt fall to Chicago?\n\nKeeping Williams upright is one of the biggest keys for the Bears as they try to turn the franchise around. While Braxton Jones has been solid in two years, Alt could be the long-term answer at left tackle.\n\nDarnell Wright is already one of the best right tackles in the NFL, and it might be wise to keep him there. With Teven Jenkins and a few others able to move around a little bit, the addition of Alt would be amazing.\n\nIf the Bears were able to add a left tackle like Alt, they could be building an offensive line that they have together for about a decade or more. That could be a key to this team finally developing a quarterback and winning a Super Bowl. It's an exciting idea.\n\nAlt is a big boy (6'9'', 321 lbs) who will be a force in the NFL. Drafting a lineman with that type of size and skill is important in this league, and one team is going to be very happy with him.\n\nThe only problem with Alt is that there is very little chance that the Bears can get him. It would be stunning if he fell to No. 9 in the draft. They are using the No. 1 pick on Williams and Alt going 2-8 is very likely.

There are many players with excellent skillsets at various positions of need. Debating which players would help the team the most often comes down to splitting hairs. But affixing that \"Grizzly\" label helps the team make their decisions. If two guys each have excellent tape, and they each play a premium position, the guy who's a \"Grizzly\" will get the nod over the other.\n\nPoles shared a bit of what goes into a prospect earning the special designation.\n\nWatch Ryan Poles' full press conference here.\n\n\"They've got to impact the football team from a skillset standpoint, but we always are gonna look at some key things when we talk about passion for the game, coach-ability, dependability, resilience.\"\n\nThe team wants to pick a Grizzly whenever they can, especially with premium picks. So the tag could play a big role in the team's decision with the No. 9 overall pick. If they've got one Grizzly left with a first-round grade when they're on the clock, they probably stand pat and draft him. If all the Grizzlies are gone however, they could consider sliding back a few spots to recoup some extra draft capital to add a couple of Day Two Grizzlies.\n\n\"We had a good conversation with a Hall of Famer that (assistant GM) Ian (Cunningham) knows and he says you want the guys in that first round to be the cover of your album.

She previously worked at the San Jose Mercury News as a multimedia sports journalist.\n\nThe Chicago Bears have selected a quarterback in the first round six times in the common draft era (since 1967) with lackluster results that have kept the franchise in a perennial search for a long-term answer.\n\nThose six quarterbacks combined for zero selections to the All-Pro teams (first or second team) and only two Pro Bowls while in Chicago. The Bears are the only NFL franchise that has not had a quarterback throw for 4,000 yards or 30 touchdowns in a season. Chicago hopes its luck will change on Thursday when the team is expected to select USC's Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick. Before Williams officially makes his way to Chicago, here's a look at how other first-round Bears quarterbacks have fared during their time in the Windy City.\n\nRecord: 10-28 Length of tenure: Three seasons (2021 to 2023)\n\nThe Bears moved up nine spots in the 2021 draft to select the former Ohio State standout with the 11th pick. Fields' NFL career began as the third party in a quarterback competition with veterans Nick Foles and Andy Dalton. He eventually won the starting job in Week 3 of his rookie season and was sacked nine times by Cleveland in his debut.\n\nFields' dynamic skills were the backbone of Chicago's top-ranked rushing offense for two seasons as he put his stamp on NFL history by running for 178 yards against Miami in 2022, the second most by a quarterback in a regular-season game. Fields worked with two offensive coordinators -- Bill Lazor and Luke Getsy -- in three seasons. While he showed promise in his third season, the 25-year-old ranked in the bottom third in nearly every passing category in 2023, from EPA per dropback (minus-0.05) to completion percentage (61.4).\n\nFields was traded to Pittsburgh for a conditional sixth-round pick in 2025 on March 16.\n\nRecord: 29-21 Length of tenure: Four seasons (2017 to 2020)\n\nChicago traded up to No. 2 to draft Trubisky in 2017 over eventual three-time Super Bowl champion quarterback Patrick Mahomes and three-time Pro Bowler Deshaun Watson. After initially being named the backup to Mike Glennon, Trubisky earned the starting job in Week 5 of his rookie season, a role he held consistently for three years before getting benched four games into the 2020 season.\n\nBacked by their No. 1 ranked defense, the Bears won the NFC North in 2018 and made the playoffs as a wild-card team twice during Trubisky's tenure. Trubisky had two postseason starts (2018 vs. Philadelphia, 2020 vs. New Orleans), and the Bears offense failed to score more than a touchdown in each loss. The Bears did not exercise Trubisky's fifth-year option in 2021, which led the quarterback to sign as a free agent with the Buffalo. Trubisky remains the Bears career leader in completion percentage (64.0) and passer rating (87.2).\n\nRecord: 19-12 Length of tenure: Six seasons (2003 to 2008)\n\nGrossman was drafted 22nd in 2003 and did not become the Bears starting quarterback until the 2006 season. Injuries and inconsistent play marred Grossman's time in Chicago despite the Bears going 13-3 and making it to Super Bowl XLI during his lone season as the full-time starter.\n\nHe threw more interceptions (35) than touchdowns (33) in 31 starts with the Bears. Grossman had one of the worst performances by a starting quarterback in a Super Bowl when he threw for 165 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions and had two fumbles in Chicago's 29-17 loss to Indianapolis. Grossman lost his starting job three games into the 2007 season and was a backup over the final four years of his career between Chicago, Houston and Washington.\n\nRecord: 3-12 Length of tenure: Two seasons (1999-2000)\n\nMonths after finishing third in Heisman Trophy voting, McNown was drafted by Chicago with the No. 12 pick in 1999. The former UCLA quarterback set rookie franchise records with 27 completions, 301 passing yards and four touchdowns in a win over Detroit, one of the lone highlights from a career that spanned just 15 starts. McNown quickly outwore his welcome in Chicago due to poor play and comments directed at teammates and fans and was traded to Miami ahead of his third NFL season, where he competed as the Dolphins' third-string quarterback but never saw the field.\n\nRecord: 35-30 Length of tenure: Seven seasons (1987 to 1993)\n\nThe Bears drafted Harbaugh with the No. 26 pick in 1987 after he was named Big Ten MVP during his senior season at Michigan. His breakout season came in 1991, when he threw for a career-high 3,121 yards and led the Bears to back-to-back 11-5 finishes, which included an NFC Central title in 1990. Harbaugh missed the final two regular-season games and playoffs that year with a shoulder injury.\n\nHis lone postseason appearance as the Bears starting quarterback resulted in a 17-13 loss to Dallas in the wild-card round in 1991.\n\nRecord: 46-15 Length of tenure: Seven seasons (1982 to 1988)\n\nMcMahon was selected fifth overall in 1982 and led the Bears to their lone Super Bowl victory during the 1985 season, one year removed from sustaining a lacerated kidney that sidelined him for the final six games in 1984. He threw for 256 yards and rushed for two touchdowns in the Bears' 46-10 win over the Patriots in Super Bowl XX and led Chicago to five straight NFC Central titles from 1984-88.\n\nInjuries limited the quarterback throughout his seven seasons in Chicago (McMahon played a career-high 14 games just once in 1983). He was traded to the Los Angeles Chargers in 1989 after a \"falling out\" with Bears president Michael McCaskey and coach Mike Ditka.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Williams almost certainly is heading for the Chicago Bears. And the chilly breeze on an overcast April day in Detroit is nothing compared to the historical headwinds of playing quarterback in Chicago -- and the icy blowback if things don't go as planned.\n\n\"The fans here in town are gun-shy when it comes to quarterbacks because we've been wandering in the quarterback desert for centuries, or let's say decades,\" said Tom Waddle, the former Bears receiver turned ESPN radio host in Chicago. \"There's a certain percentage of folks who believe they're still going to screw this up.\"\n\nWaddle has high hopes for Williams, and his enthusiasm isn't dampened by USC losing five of their final six games last season -- much of that blame goes to a porous defense -- or the quarterback sobbing into the shoulder of his mom after an especially painful defeat.\n\n\"I'm not guaranteeing that Caleb's going to be a Hall of Famer and take this team back to the promised land,\" Waddle said. \"I feel very good about what he can bring to this team, and I think he's walking into a really good situation where the infrastructure is very good for a guy that's being picked first overall.\"\n\nThe Bears have gone 17 years without consecutive winning seasons. They used first-round picks on quarterbacks Justin Fields (2021) and Mitch Trubisky (2017), and traded a package of picks to Denver -- including two first-rounders -- for Jay Cutler. None of those players proved to be the answer.\n\n\"That's the thing about Chicago, they've run two quarterbacks out of town who were first-round picks and highly touted,\" said former Bears quarterback Jim Miller, referring to Fields and Trubisky. \"So I think there's some trepidation from Bears fans that, hey, this can't happen again. This has to be the guy.\"\n\nMiller, now a host for Sirius XM NFL Radio, left open the remote possibility that the Bears could shock the NFL world and take Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy instead.\n\n\"J.J. McCarthy has shot up these boards so much because of how disciplined he is in his play,\" Miller said. \"So I would not rule out him, either. I think everybody assumes it's Caleb Williams. I think he's probably the most talented guy. But I wouldn't rule out McCarthy, because Caleb has had his issues with turnovers.\"\n\nThere's actually a cluster of quarterbacks likely to hear their names early Thursday night, including Louisiana State's Jayden Daniels and North Carolina's Drake Maye.\n\n\"It's a great class,\" Williams said. \"It's one of the best classes, I would say, that's come out. High-talented class. ... I'm excited for everyone else's future.\"\n\nWilliams is unapologetic about his unconventional style, which included posing in a dress for a GQ photo shoot.\n\n\"I feel comfy in my own skin,\" he said. \"I think that's the biggest thing. I feel comfy in who I am, how hard I work, what I do in my daily life, how I act, how I treat people with respect.\"\n\nHe flashed his pinkies to reveal silver nail polish.\n\n\"You go to a nail salon and it's peaceful,\" he said. \"It's something that not many people are doing. But I go there and I just sit down, I throw on my [headphones], I turn on a movie. I'm chilling, not bothered by anything other than what I want to be bothered by.\"\n\nWilliams likes being unconventional. With his attire Wednesday, he turned an annual NFL event into a different kind of blue-gray game.

They'll be on the clock at 7 p.m.\n\n\"Bears fans should get very excited because there's gonna be a lot, a lot, a lot of time dedicated to the Bears at the top of the draft,\" said Charlie Yook, executive producer of NFL Media and a Bears fan himself, having grown up in Glenview.\n\nBoth networks will spread their coverage over several platforms. ESPN's broadcast on ABC will take a human-interest tack, telling the players' personal stories. The network also will air \"The Pat McAfee Show Draft Spectacular\" for the first round on its digital channels (YouTube, TikTok, ESPN app, ESPN+). NFL Network will air an alternative broadcast on the NFL Channel, its free ad-supported streamer.\n\nAll of them figure to have a Bears bent early, but the traditional shows will lean into the team expected to take USC quarterback Caleb Williams, the top-ranked player on most analysts' draft board, with the first pick.\n\n\"The benefit for the team with the No. 1 pick is we'll have a lot of time pre-pick to really get into the storylines,\" said Drew Gallagher, coordinating producer at ESPN who oversees the traditional broadcast. \"As soon as commissioner [Roger] Goodell puts the Bears on the clock, we use that time to talk about the potential fit with the Bears. It's a franchise-altering moment, and it's our job to document it.\"\n\nSaid Yook: \"Having the No. 1 pick, that team typically gets a lot of love off the top because we put the team on the clock and we talk about that team ad nauseum until they make the selection. This is something we're going to dive into from a historical perspective, but also it's very important to see, if it is Caleb, how does he fit into a [offensive coordinator] Shane Waldron offense.\"\n\nThe networks won't tip any picks, a rule they've followed for years. After Goodell announces the selection and gives his ceremonial bro hug, Williams would be interviewed on stage by ESPN's Molly McGrath and NFL Network's Kaylee Hartung. Both networks also will have reporters stationed at Halas Hall for draft-room reaction: Courtney Cronin of ESPN and Stacey Dales of NFL Network.\n\nBut the fun is only beginning because the Bears are set to be on the clock again within 90 minutes.\n\n\"Bears fans, don't click away because things are going to be happening there,\" Gallagher said. \"This is all part of the intrigue that gets us so excited. I'm sort of getting chills right now just talking about it. The best part about the draft is it's so unpredictable, the excitement that takes over the [production] truck when we hear over the NFL pick line, 'There's been a trade.' It's the best.\"\n\nThis draft has the potential to be one of, if not the, best-viewed ever. Star power drives the draft, and this one is loaded with it, particularly at quarterback, the highest-profile position in sports. But Yook, as a TV executive would, sees another angle.\n\n\"Look at the markets that pick 1-2-3,\" he said. \"Last year, you had Carolina-Houston-Houston. Wonderful franchises, wonderful towns. But you're talking Chicago, D.C. and Boston. Pinnacle sports towns, and not only that, football towns, and that's the differentiating factor.\n\n\"And, oh, by the way, it just so happens they all need QBs. You can't paint a better picture for a draft. It's so top heavy, we have no idea when we're taking a commercial. We're burning the first one at the top, and then once the draft starts, we don't know.\"\n\nESPN made two additions to its draft coverage, former Alabama coach Nick Saban and former Patriots coach Bill Belichick. Saban will appear on ABC's broadcast and Belichick on Pat McAfee's show. ESPN also will have a camera at the Bears' draft party at Soldier Field.\n\nBoth networks understand the significance of the occasion for a franchise with, to say the least, a poor history of developing quarterbacks.\n\n\"They could walk out of Thursday night and the entire picture for the franchise looks completely different for the next 10 years,\" Gallagher said.\n\nHere's a look at local radio and TV coverage plans for the draft:\n\nESPN 1000, the Bears' radio home, will broadcast from the team's draft party at Soldier Field, beginning with the \"Waddle & Silvy\" show. Bears play-by-play voice Jeff Joniak and analyst Tom Thayer will join and then lead coverage through the night.\n\nABC: Rece Davis, Kirk Herbstreit, Desmond Howard, Nick Saban, Field Yates, Laura

The star signal-caller out of USC has some unique aspects to his game that may not be replicated by a lot of individuals in the league. However, a certain pundit posits that his style of play might be similar to Kyler Murray's. This is why it might not be a surprise that he gets the same treatment as the Arizona Cardinals quarterback.\n\nA lot of the reason why Caleb Williams has to be treated like Kyler Murray in the Bears system is because he is coming into the league with the mentorship of Lincoln Riley. While the great coach has produced a lot of players who were top picks in the NFL Draft, the way in which his mentees integrate into the league isn't the smoothest. Even a league coordinator for Caleb Williams outlined this concern, via Dan Graziano and Jeremy Fowler of ESPN.\n\n\"The transition scares me for some of these guys where it's just, set, hike, find the open man. You've seen guys like Kyler Murray and Baker Mayfield struggle with the transition at times,\" they said.\n\nSo, what's the proposed solution such that the Bears get the most out of Caleb Williams? It's to get him accustomed to Matt Eberflus' run-first progression system as soon as he gets to the facility. He then pointed out how much the Cardinals have tapped into Kyler Murray's potential while going run-first. Now, it looks like he is doing well with the play-action sets and other types of offensive schemes that are being run.\n\n\"That's a good blueprint for Caleb to learn from early,\" the coordinator added.\n\nThe in-depth knowledge of Xs and Os can't be adapted too fast. This is especially to a guy coming out fresh from the NFL Draft. But, this is a good way for the Bears to start developing their quarterback of the future.\n\nWhat are the Bears getting?\n\nIt's very easy to say that Ryan Poles, Matt Eberflus, and the front office are getting the first overall pick. The title alone is very prestigious and has a good history in the NFL Draft. But, it should not come without any explanation. The Bears have a quarterback conundrum at the moment and it will only get solved if they pick the star out of USC or any other signal-caller. The era of Justin Fields has officially come to a close. This means that they have a new long-term project to work on.\n\nHis accolades speak for himself a lot of the time. Williams is the 2022 Heisman Trophy Winner, was voted the Pac-12's Offensive Player of the Year in the same year, and got one All-American nod at USC. A lot of his strengths come off passing. Throughout his college career, he notched 10,082 passing yards on 1,099 attempts. To add more context, that is a 66.9% completion rate.\n\nThe most impressive part was that he only threw 14 interceptions despite leading his team to 93 touchdowns. A player like this comes once in a generation. He might get compared to the Cardinals quarterback now but he might just reach taller heights.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_postrado@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jay Postrado", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyler_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyler Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Eberflus", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matt Eberflus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lincoln Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Color commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Mayfield", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baker Mayfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference_football_individual_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference football individual awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_All-America_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College Football All-America Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Gay_Men", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Gay Men", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Bearings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Bearings", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft_Toys", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft Toys", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Stuffed_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Stuffed Animals", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/The-Kyler-Murray-blueprint-Caleb-Williams-must-learn-from.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505181", "eventUri": "eng-9505181", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Washington Commanders: QB - Jayden Daniels, LSU\n\nCopy and paste for the Commanders, as they replicate what the Chicago Bears did a pick earlier by drafting their own Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback. Daniels is a true dual-threat quarterback posting video game numbers last season at LSU. He completed 72 percent of his passes for 3812 yards and 40 aerial scores, along with 1134 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns.\n\n3. New England Patriots: QB - Drake Maye, North Carolina\n\nIt's possible the Patriots entertain the idea of drafting wideout Marvin Harrison Jr. with the third overall pick. Unfortunately, New England doesn't currently employ a highly-regarded quarterback to throw to him. So, the Patriots may decide pragmatically to select Maye, an athletic six-foot-four, 223-pound passer with elite talent.\n\nLearn more about Drake Maye here: Players that Bear watching: North Carolina QB Drake Maye\n\n4. Arizona Cardinals: WR - Marvin Harrison Jr., Ohio State\n\nArizona will probably field many trade scenarios for the fourth draft slot, but it's likely the Cardinals eschew all offers for arguably the best prospect from this draft class. Harrison is a true generational talent (father is a Hall-of-Fame wideout) whose pedigree matched his production. The six-foot-three, 209-pound wideout posted back-to-back 1200-plus receiving yards and exactly 14 touchdown catches in each of the past two seasons.\n\nLearn more about Marvin Harrison Jr. here: Players that Bear watching: Ohio State WR Marvin Harrison Jr.\n\nThe Vikings' maneuverings pre-draft possibly position them to move up into the top five to select their quarterback of the future. McCarthy is an accurate short to intermediate passer with above-average athleticism and exceptional leadership traits. He led Michigan to an undefeated National Championship while personally completing a college career with a 27-1 record as a starter.\n\n6. New York Giants: WR - Malik Nabers, LSU\n\nThe need for a primary receiver to emerge as a focal point for New York's offense may inspire the drafting of Nabers. Nabers offers inside/outside versatility and an elite route-running element any NFL team could utilize. He is arguably the most efficient route-runner in this extremely deep and talented draft class.\n\n7. Tennessee Titans: OT - Joe Alt, Notre Dame\n\nAlt is another son of a former NFL standout (John Alt - Kansas City Chiefs), playing and excelling at the same position his father manned during his pro career. According to PFF, the massive Alt (6-8, 322 lbs) earned a pass-blocking grade of 90.7, and an overall blocking metric of 91.2 by the end of the 2023 campaign.\n\n8. Atlanta Falcons: Edge - Dallas Turner, Alabama\n\nIn lieu of recent chatter revolving around the Falcons' \"alleged\" tampering in the signing of former free agent quarterback Kirk Cousins, Atlanta should retain its eight overall slots. The league has yet to administer a judgment against the Falcons and may not do so until next year's draft. If Atlanta maintains its eighth pick, then Turner may become the first defensive player taken in 2024. A balanced pass-rushing talent, Turner is effective at blitzing the passer, setting the edge against perimeter runs, and dropping into underneath coverage zones.\n\n9. Chicago Bears: WR - Rome Odunze, Washington\n\nBears general manager Ryan Poles believes in acquiring \"blue-chip\" players, and Odunze is a premium talent with intangibles that may exceed his elite physical attributes. If good karma exists, then a plane ride with presumptive number one pick, Caleb Williams and Odunze, sharing the same fight might be the portentous omen Chicago needs to make the former Husky the ninth overall pick.\n\nLearn more about Rome Odunze here: Players that Bear watching: Washington WR Rome Odunze\n\n10. New York Jets: OL - Taliese Fuaga, Oregon State\n\nFuaga's elite blend of size, mobility, strength, and physicality make him, in many scouts and pundits' eyes, the best offensive lineman in this draft class. The Jets are in serious need of talented blockers, especially with 40-year-old, future Hall-of-Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers returning from an Achilles injury.\n\n11. Los Angeles Chargers (via Minnesota): TE - Brock Bowers, Georgia\n\nTrade: LA Chargers received Minnesota's #11(R1), #23(R1), 2025 (Rnd 4) in exchange for #5(R1)\n\nThe receiving talent in this class is about three rounds deep, so new head coach Jim Harbaugh might lean towards taking the highest-rated tight end off the board. Historically, the Chargers have drafted and developed some of the best tight ends over the last half century (Kellen Winslow - HOF, Antonio Gates team's all-time leading receiver) Bowers is a matchup conundrum who athletically can also align anywhere on the field.\n\nEagles general manager Howie Roseman traditionally maneuvers throughout the various rounds in any given draft. He has never moved up to select a defensive back in the first round, so expect this potential trade to target an edge rusher. Entering the 2024 season, both of Philadelphia's starting edge rushers will be in the final year of their contracts. Drafting a consistently productive pass rusher like Verse (18 sacks in 25 games) could ease the loss of either veteran should the Eagles decide to move on for financial reasons.\n\n13. Las Vegas Raiders: QB - Michael Pennix Jr., Washington\n\nSimply put, Pennix can spin the football with style, consistency and productivity. During his tenure at Washington, the former Husky completed 65 percent of his passes for 67 touchdowns and a National Championship appearance this past season.\n\n14. New Orleans Saints: OT - Olu Fashanu, Penn State\n\nAt the start of the 2023 college football season, Fashanu was considered a certifiable top-ten selection with the possibility of ascending even higher. Taking Fashanu might hint at a \"drafting the best player available\" strategy instead of addressing one specific area of need. His athleticism, easy knee bend, and consistent footwork create enough flexibility to play either on the interior or exterior of the offensive line.\n\nLearn more about Olu Fashanu here: Players that Bear watching: Penn State OT Olumuyiwa \"Olu\" Fashanu\n\n15. Indianapolis Colts: CB - Terrion Arnold, Alabama\n\nArnold logged a productive season, registering 61 tackles with 11 passes defended and five interceptions for the Crimson Tide. Having learned under Nick Saban, arguably the best college coach of all time and defensive specialist, Arnold is NFL-ready and a potential day-one starter.\n\n16. Seattle Seahawks: OL - Troy Fautanu, Washington\n\nSeattle's new offensive coordinator, Ryan Grubb, served in the same capacity the past two seasons at the University of Washington. If anyone knows how to employ the skills and alignment versatility Fautanu possesses, it will probably be the prospect's former college coach. Fautanu's rugged physicality and relentless motor make him ideal in most pro schemes.\n\n17. Jacksonville Jaguars: WR - Brain Thomas Jr., LSU\n\nBased on Thomas' exemplary 2023 season (68 receptions / 1177 receiving yards / 17 touchdowns), he is an amazing talent with unlimited upside. The Jaguars need a deep threat option with the speed to command defensive coordinators' attention and secondary defenders' respect.\n\n18. Cincinnati Bengals: CB - Quinyon Mitchell, Toledo\n\nToledo's all-time leader in pass breakups (46), Mitchell excelled in obscurity on a national level even though he once recorded four interceptions in a single game (2022 vs NIU). Mitchell thrives in zone coverages where his anticipatory skills complement his knack for making plays downfield.\n\n19. Los Angeles Rams: Edge - Laiatu Latu, UCLA\n\nAn inspirational player who admittedly plays every snap like it's his last, the 2023 Pac-12 Defensive player of the Year could stay in LA for his pro career. More quick than fast, Latu creatively sheds blocks and possesses an innate ability to efficiently maneuver between offensive linemen, invariably creating havoc behind the line of scrimmage.\n\nLearn more about Laiatu Latu here: Players that Bear watching: UCLA Edge Laiatu Latu\n\n20. Pittsburgh Steelers: OT - J.C. Latham, Alabama\n\nLatham allowed only two sacks and nine hurries this season and performed at an above-average rate (81.9) according to PFF. He is a limber 326-pound pass protector whose knee-bending flexibility allows him to stay leveraged behind his pad level. An experienced lineman having already logged over 1,500 snaps, his astute awareness could help improve Pittsburgh's anemic 186.1 passing yards per game totals from last season.\n\n21. Miami Dolphins: DL - Byron Murphy, Texas\n\nA stout, compact athlete with first-step quickness, Murphy competes with efficiency and decisiveness when attacking blockers at the line of scrimmage. His ability to quickly disrupt plays makes him a better run defender than most suspect and an effective interior pass rusher on any down.\n\n22. Denver Broncos [via - Philadelphia): QB - Bo Nix, Oregon\n\nTrade: Broncos received Philadelphia's #22(R1), #53(R1) and 2025(Rnd3) in exchange for #12(R1)\n\nDenver could benefit from trading down to acquire a second-round pick and some additional draft capital. Between playing at Auburn and Oregon, Nix competed in over 60 games in college. While at Oregon, he completed 74.9 percent of his passes for over 8,000 yards and scored 74 aerial points. Broncos head coach Sean Payton may see a taller, bigger and more athletic Drew Brees in Nix.\n\n23. Los Angeles Chargers (via Cleveland (via Minnesota)): OT - Amarius Mims, Georgia\n\nTrade: LA Chargers received Minnesota's #11(R1), #23(R1) and 2025 (Rnd4) in exchange for #5(R1)\n\nNew head coach Jim Harbaugh believes in building dominant offensive lines, and Mims is a massive six-foot-eight, 340-pound behemoth of a man whose physical traits are attention-getting. He plays to his size, showcasing an unapologetic mean streak backed with powerful arms and a balanced base.\n\n24. Dallas Cowboys: C - Jackson Powers-Johnson, Oregon\n\nThe Cowboys, under Jerry Jones' ownership, have a long history of drafting offensive linemen in the first round. Powers-Johnson might provide the Cowboys needed physicality and leadership the recently departed free agent center Tyler Biadez supplied during his tenure in Dallas. A frame-filling size of six-foot-three and 320 pounds, his ability to leverage interior defensive linemen repeatedly to the ground is impressive.\n\n25. Green Bay Packers: DB - Cooper DeJean, Iowa\n\nExtremely versatile and skilled, DeJean is an athletic defensive back who could literally play any secondary position and be a difference-maker (7 career interceptions). Green Bay's skill and depth in its secondary, especially the cornerback position, needs an upgrade to seriously compete against the improving receiving talent in the NFC.\n\n26. Tampa Bay Buccaneers: OL - Graham Barton, Duke\n\nOver the past couple of seasons, the interior blocking for Tampa has been inconsistent and ineffective in both the run and passing game. Barton is a flexible, well-balanced drive blocker with solid spatial awareness and above-average lateral quickness. He would be an immediate upgrade within the interior of the offensive line for the Bucs.\n\n27. Arizona Cardinals (via Houston): CB - Nate Wiggins, Clemson\n\nWiggins excels in disrupting a receiver's route tempo and negatively affecting the rhythm of any team's passing attack. The Cardinals played hard defensively yet were ineffective when forcing interceptions (11 picks in 17 games) and struggled to make impact plays. Both of Wiggins' career interceptions resulted in defensive returns for scores. His length, sinewy strength, and football IQ make him a viable target for Arizona's future defensive designs.\n\n28. Buffalo Bills: WR - Adonai Mitchell, Texas\n\nMitchell is basically the same size as former Bills receiver Gabriel Davis but discernibly more explosive, displaying an ability to maintain top speed for longer distances. He ran one of the fastest top five 40 times (4.34) at the combine and broad-jumped over 11 feet. An incredible athlete with the ability to beat press coverage may intrigue Bills' scouts and pass-game coordinators.\n\n29. Detroit Lions: CB - Kool-Aid McKinstry, Alabama\n\nDetroit's front office executives have made bold and unconventional selections in the recent past. So, taking a chance on an injured (Jones Fracture - foot) but highly rated first-round prospect like McKinstry seems like something the Lions might strongly consider.\n\n30. Baltimore Ravens: WR - Ladd McConkey, Georgia\n\nMcConkey possesses sub-4.40 speed and is an excellent route-runner who has a knack for creating organic separation from pass defenders. His ability to accelerate and de-accelerate fuels his elite change-of-pace maneuvers. An elusive pass catcher with elite hand-eye coordination, McConkey is zooming up draft boards into strong first-round consideration.\n\n31. San Francisco 49ers: Edge/DL - Darius Robinson, Missouri\n\nA disruptive element along the line of scrimmage, Robinson's alignment versatility is a key factor in his ascension up draft boards. Robinson is surprisingly elusive for a six-foot-five, 285-pound defensive lineman, displaying a flexible bendability when rushing the passer. In addition, his girth helps anchor him against the run when situated within the defensive interior.\n\n32. Kansas City Chiefs: OT - Jordan Morgan, Arizona\n\nDespite standout receiver Rashee Rice's legal issues and potential league suspension, the Chiefs may still focus on improving pass protection for All-Pro quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Morgan incurred a torn ACL injury in 2022 but regained the flexibility, fluidity, and bendability that set him apart from many of his peers. A solid technician, his blocking style could seamlessly complement the offensive schemes Kansas City employed on a weekly basis.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportschicago.com", "dataType": "news",

Chicago has four draft selections, including two inside the top 10.\n\nGeneral manager Ryan Poles mades some moves during free agency, but his work is far from done. There are still some roster holes that need to be filled heading into the NFL draft, including along the defensive line and quarterback (which should be resolved immediately).\n\nFollowing free agency and the first wave of the offseason program -- from signings to cuts to trades -- the roster looks different. Here's a look at where the Bears roster stands ahead of the 2024 NFL draft.\n\nQuarterback (2)\n\nOct 29, 2023; Inglewood, California, USA; Chicago Bears quarterback Tyson Bagent (17) gestures against the Los Angeles Chargers in the first half at SoFi Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nTyson Bagent Brett Rypien\n\nThe Bears traded Justin Fields to the Steelers this offseason to clear the way for incoming rookie Caleb Williams. Tyson Bagent returns for his second season, and Brett Rypien was signed to a one-year deal in free agency. Will Chicago add an established veteran to work with Williams?\n\nRunning back (4)\n\nMar 14, 2024; Lake Forest, IL, USA; Chicago Bears running back D'Andre Swift speaks during a press conference at Halas Hall. Mandatory Credit: Kamil Krzaczynski-USA TODAY Sports\n\nD'Andre Swift Khalil Herbert Roschon Johnson Travis Homer\n\nChicago added a dynamic running back in D'Andre Swift in free agency, giving them a true receiving threat out of the backfield. Swift joins a group that also features Khalil Herbert and last year's rookie Roschon Johnson. Travis Homer, who played exclusively on special teams, also returns.\n\nWide receiver (7)\n\nOct 16, 2023; Inglewood, California, USA; Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Keenan Allen (13) celebrates after scoring on a 1-yard touchdown reception against the Dallas Cowboys in the first half at SoFi Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDJ Moore Keenan Allen Tyler Scott Dante Pettis Velus Jones Jr. Collin Johnson Nsimba Webster\n\nThe Bears made a splash trading for Pro Bowl wide receiver Keenan Allen in exchange for a fourth-round pick. Allen joins star DJ Moore, and both are coming off 1,000-yard seasons. Williams will have one of the league's best receiver duos in his rookie season. Chicago also returns Tyler Scott, and they re-signed Dante Pettis, who brings special teams value. But it wouldn't be a big surprise to see the Bears make a run at a receiver in the NFL draft.\n\nTight end (3)\n\nNov 27, 2022; Glendale, Arizona, USA; Los Angeles Chargers tight end Gerald Everett (7) against the Arizona Cardinals at State Farm Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nCole Kmet Gerald Everett Stephen Carlson\n\nChicago has a solid 1-2 punch at tight end with Cole Kmet and Gerald Everett. Kmet, who signed a contract extension before the start of last season, is coming off a career year. Meanwhile, Everett gives the Bears a true move tight end to pair with stud Kmet.\n\nOffensive line (14)\n\nJan 7, 2024; Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA; Chicago Bears offensive tackle Darnell Wright (58) during the game against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field.

While DeMarcus Walker is a solid rotational piece, the Bears need to add to stud complement to Sweat to really elevate the pass rush. That didn't happen in free agency, so all eyes are on Chicago and what they do in the NFL draft.\n\nDefensive tackle (5)\n\nOct 15, 2023; Chicago, Illinois, USA; Chicago Bears defensive lineman Gervon Dexter Sr. (99) lines up on defense against the Minnesota Vikings at Soldier Field.

Right now, Gervon Dexter, who showed promise as a rookie, looks to be the favorite to win the job. Chicago also returns veteran Andrew Billings, who signed a two-year extension last season and played a key role in the Bears resurgent run defense. Zacch Pickens is entering his third season, where he should see additional reps behind Dexter.\n\nLinebacker (6)\n\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS - SEPTEMBER 10: Luke Musgrave #88 of the Green Bay Packers is tackled by Tremaine Edmunds #49 and T.J.

The Bears also return Jack Sanborn, who's been a key contributor at SAM linebacker when the Bears are in their base defense, and Noah Sewell, who played sparingly as a rookie and served primarily on special teams. Following Dylan Cole's departure, Chicago added special teams ace Amen Ogbongbemiga in free agency.\n\nCornerback (7)\n\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS - OCTOBER 22: Tyrique Stevenson #29 and Jaylon Johnson #33 of the Chicago Bears celebrate a third down stop against the Las Vegas Raiders at Soldier Field on October 22, 2023 in Chicago, Illinois.

Williams, the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner, was just selected by Chicago after all, ahead of other elite prospects at his position in this draft. North Carolina quarterback Drake Maye and Louisiana State quarterback Jayden Daniels are the other top quarterbacks this year, and both seem destined to come off the board soon, too.\n\nElsewhere in the draft, talents like Michigan's J.J. McCarthy, Oregon's Bo Nix, and Washington's Michael Penix Jr. still pack plenty of upside.\n\nBut Williams was always seemingly destined to be the headliner of the draft. The 6-foot-1, 215-pound junior is viewed as an elite passer who can also bust out of the pocket and run when needed. During his Heisman season, he passed for a whopping 4,537 yards and 42 touchdowns, while also rushing for 382 yards and 10 touchdowns.\n\nHe powered the Trojans to an 11-3 record that year. USC ultimately fell, 46-45, in the Cotton Bowl Classic against Tulane.\n\nIn addition to the Heisman, Williams won the Maxwell Award and the Walter Camp Award, while also being named a unanimous All-American, the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year, the Associated Press College Football Player of the Year, and the Sporting News College Football Player of the Year.\n\nWilliams' output regressed in 2023. Across 12 contests, he posted a 7-5 record (he sat out USC's bowl game, a 42-28 Holiday Bowl victory over the Louisville Cardinals) while passing for 3,333 yards, completing 266-of-388 pass attempts, and notching 30 passing touchdowns. He also rushed for 142 yards and 11 touchdowns. He did post his best rating yet during his final NCAA season, however, notching a 170.1 rating.\n\nThe Bears now add probably their most talented quarterback since Sid Luckman (who played his final game in 1950). Over the course of its storied history, Chicago has often prioritized team-building on the other side of the field, while frequently relying on talented running backs or wideouts to save sloppy, injury-prone quarterback play. That's not to say the team hasn't been trying to find its next generational talent at the position, after losing talented-but-flawed Pro Bowler Jay Cutler after the 2016 season.\n\nThe Bears drafted Mitchell Trubisky out of North Carolina with the No. 2 overall pick in 2017. Though he did make a Pro Bowl team and help guide the team to the playoffs, Trubisky eventually settled in as a journeyman backup. Chicago whiffed on picking future Kansas City Chiefs superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who was selected at No. 10 that year. Mahomes has won three Super Bowls and has emerged as one of the greatest players of all time.\n\nMore recently, Chicago drafted Fields with the No. 11 pick out of Ohio State in 2021. Although he had some promising moments as a running quarterback, Fields struggled with timely decision-making throughout his Bears tenure. Now, he'll compete with veteran Russell Wilson for the starting gig in Pittsburgh.\n\nBears fans should rejoice, knowing the team finally secured its can't-miss QB1 talent of the future. After so many years in the passing wilderness, the Monsters of the Midway have landed a top talent at the game's most important position.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news",

He'll become part of the Chicago scene while in Detroit, just after 7 p.m.\n\nSomething seems different about this attempt.\n\nAs Chicagooans have become more and more familiar with Williams throughout this lengthy run up to the draft, it has become apparent very little fazes him. This is how a quarterback should be, must be, in Chicago.\n\nHe has fought his way through tougher times than some draft analysts give him credit for, and emerged with a Heisman and at the top with a lightning release and an ability to improvise.\n\nDon't mistake the laid-back demeanor he exhibits with a dislike for competition. He loved the intensity of the Texas-Oklahoma rivalry.\n\nNow he's going to enjoy the NFC North. It seems only Green Bay is lacking a former teammate for him to beat up on.\n\n\"If I was to go to the Bears and they was to select me I would be able to go against one of my old teammates Jordan (Addison) and kick his tail,\" Williams told reporters. \"I would love to have bragging rights over that.\n\n\"And then I get to go against Amon-Ra (St. Brown) which is one my good friends, also, and kick his tail. I just kicked his tail in bowling the other day. He hasn't talked to me since. But yeah it should be fun to play anywhere but to be able to play some of those guys and be able to talk trash to them or whatever, it would be fun for me.\"\n\nThe big concern some had over his competitive nature coming into the draft centered around how he paints his nails. What kind a tough competitor has his nails painted? It's a relaxing thing, he said, to just \"chill\" in the nail salon.\n\n\"I'm comfortable in my own skin and I know what I am and who I like and what I like and how I go about that,\" he said.\n\nJoe Namath once wore a mink coat and also panty hose. He could compete. The invincible Baltimore Colts learned this.\n\nWilliams seems to speak his mind in a manner reminiscent of Namath. He's not predicting SuperBowls, but seems entirely frank about his feelings. He exhibited this during The Pivot podcast last week.\n\nWhile Williams doesn't mind speaking what's on his mind, he seems savy to the off-field or in-locker room responsibilities of the NFL QB. He understands the limits of being candid.\n\nIt didn't bother him one bit Wednesday in Detroit to let reporters know who he thinks the team should draft ninth in Round 1. Most players at Halas Hall will tell you they don't pay that much attention to the draft, even if they all do because their next job comeptitor is coming from it.\n\nWilliams' choice for No. 9 wasn't his new wide receiver friend and airplane companion Rome Odunze. This might be his second choice, or one of them.\n\n\"If I was able to choose and if I was picked No. 1 with the Bears, I would probably go Olu Fashanu because I know he would put his life on the line for me, protecting me and then, geez, I would probably go one of the top three wide receivers, whoever's there at nine,\" he told reporters in Detroit.\n\nOf course Williams would say Fashanu. The Penn State tackle and projected first-round pick was his high school teammate.\n\nSo besides understanding that a quarterback needs pass blocking first to make his game work, Williams is also a diplomat. He could have easily said one of the receivers, but his guy needs his support.\n\nThere's no telling what Braxton Jones, the current Bears left tackle, would think of such a pick.\n\nYou get the sense Williams would thread his way through that somewhat sticky situation. He just comes across as the type who can.\n\nWilliams says he can't wait to get this all over with and get to the locker room setting, even if he seems perfectly at ease in the spotlight talking about everything from how he likes deep dish pizza to the blue suit he'll wear on the stage Thursdya night..\n\nCalling the entire first pick situation \"surreal,\" he said he's \"really ready\" for the competitive part after being away from football since November.\n\nChicago is ready for him, too.\n\nAnd it's been a lot longer than since November since they've seen a quarterback who can do what everyone suggests Williams can.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gene_chamberlain@si.com", "name": "Gene Chamberlain", "type":

If a player exhibits all the traits they want, regardless of whether that player has a first-round grade or a seventh-round grade, the team puts a little Bears head icon on their tag.\n\n\"We call them the Grizzly,\" GM Ryan Poles said. \"The top Bear.\"\n\nWhen evaluating talent, especially near the top of the draft, it can be difficult to organize a big board of rankings. There are many players with excellent skillsets at various positions of need. Debating which players would help the team the most often comes down to splitting hairs. But affixing that \"Grizzly\" label helps the team make their decisions. If two guys each have excellent tape, and they each play a premium position, the guy who's a \"Grizzly\" will get the nod over the other.\n\nPoles shared a bit of what goes into a prospect earning the special designation.\n\n\"They've got to impact the football team from a skillset standpoint, but we always are gonna look at some key things when we talk about passion for the game, coach-ability, dependability, resilience.\"\n\nThe team wants to pick a Grizzly whenever they can, especially with premium picks. So the tag could play a big role in the team's decision with the No. 9 overall pick. If they've got one Grizzly left with a first-round grade when they're on the clock, they probably stand pat and draft him. If all the Grizzlies are gone however, they could consider sliding back a few spots to recoup some extra draft capital to add a couple of Day Two Grizzlies.\n\n\"We had a good conversation with a Hall of Famer that (assistant GM) Ian (Cunningham) knows and he says you want the guys in that first round to be the cover of your album. You want those to be where everyone can look to that player and be like, 'Alright, what he's made of is what we want to be a part of.' So, that's important to us.\"\n\nThe first round of the NFL draft begins Apr. 25 at 7 p.m. The Bears are practically assured to draft Caleb Williams with the No. 1 overall pick.

Despite brutal choices of offensive and defensive lineman through the years, they were selected too low to be considered among the biggest busts.\n\nAnd going back many decades, the Bears selected Tom Harmon with the No. 1 overall pick in 1941, but his career was derailed by his service as a pilot during World War II. Similarly, Bob Williams was picked No. 2 overall in 1951 but was drafted into the Navy.\n\nThey understandably get a pass, and our gratitude for their service.\n\n5. Kevin White, No. 7 in 2015\n\nHighly touted out of West Virginia, White was the second receiver taken in 2015 after Amari Cooper was picked fourth overall.\n\nFrom the moment he started training camp, White was stricken by injuries. He missed his entire rookie season, played four games in 2016 and suffered a season-ending shoulder injury in the 2017 opener.\n\nWhite caught only 25 passes with the Bears and didn't do much better while trying to catch on with San Francisco and New Orleans.\n\n4. Cedric Benson, No. 4 in 2005\n\nAlthough the star running back out of Texas was a member of the Bears during their run to Super Bowl XLI, Benson's career with the team was a major disappointment.\n\nBenson held out for a month at the start of his rookie season, immediately putting him on the wrong foot. In three seasons with the Bears, he never rushed for more than 700 yards while coach Lovie Smith sought better options with Thomas Jones and others.\n\nBenson revived his career behind three straight 1,000-yard seasons with the Bengals, and played his final season with the Packers in 2012.\n\nLike Benson, Enis held out at the start of his rookie year. Like White, he was hounded by injury trouble in his three NFL seasons after a nice college career at Penn State.\n\nAfter Enis rushed for 916 yards and 3 touchdowns in his second season in 1999, James Allen replaced Enis, who moved to fullback. A degenerative condition in his knee force Enis to retire after managing only 36 carries in 2000.\n\n2. Bob Fenimore, No. 1 in 1947\n\nWe're going in the way back machine for this one, but Fenimore stands out because he was a rare No. 1 overall pick for the Bears.\n\nAfter finishing third in the Heisman Award voting, Fenimore's final season at Oklahoma A&M (Oklahoma State) was ruined by injuries. Despite the risk, George Halas and the Bears picked him first.\n\nFenimore played 10 games as a rookie with the Bears, his only NFL season, rushing for 189 yards and a touchdown on 53 carries.\n\n1. Mitch Trubisky, No. 2 in 2017\n\nCall it recency bias, but Ryan Pace's selection of Trubisky earns the top spot for multiple reasons.\n\nNot only was the pick a huge setback for the franchise, but Ryan Pace actually traded up one spot to nab the North Carolina quarterback. In addition to swapping first-rounders with San Francisco, the Bears surrendered two third-round picks and a fourth-rounder.\n\nConsidering Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes was the second quarterback selected eight spots later, the pick of Trubisky will haunt the Bears until they find their own franchise quarterback.\n\nThe Bears let Trubisky go after the 2020 season, and he spent the last three years as a backup in Buffalo and Pittsburgh. Last month, he re-signed with the Bills.", "source": {"uri": "dailyherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_schmit@dailyherald.com", "name": "Kevin

We rank 7", "body": "We know who needs a quarterback. We've dedicated six months to figuring out which teams might draft one during the 2024 NFL Draft, and which prospects they might covet.\n\nLet's look beyond that. It's one thing to read a quarterback's name off a draft card, but how prepared are you to help him lead your franchise?\n\nOn the eve of the draft, we decided to take a look at the seven teams in this year's draft with the biggest quarterback need -- and how favorable their situation looks for the rookie they might decide to draft.\n\nNo one with a need at quarterback has done a better job of creating a favorable environment than Minnesota. Now, they just have to find a way to get one.\n\nThe obvious talking point is the receivers. Justin Jefferson has a strong case as the best receiver in football, and he'll soon be paid like it. With Jefferson missing a chunk of 2023 with a hamstring injury, rookie Jordan Addison broke out in a big way with 911 yards and an eye-popping 10 touchdowns in his debut season. Wherever you want to rank them, the Vikings are on the shortlist for boasting the best receiver duo in the league.\n\nAnd while tight end T.J. Hockenson is still recovering from a tear of his ACL and MCL on Christmas Eve, his eventual return provides a quality third option in the passing attack.\n\nThe front office also pulled a classic Vikings maneuver this offseason, signing Packers Pro Bowler Aaron Jones after his release in Green Bay. Jones might not be as spry as he once was, but his final five games of 2023 seemed to show he's got some gas in the tank. At any rate, he's an obvious improvement over the Vikings' running back situation from last year.\n\nUp front, the pair of Christian Darrisaw and Brian O'Neill is one of the best tackle duos in football. The Vikings could stand to upgrade their interior, but it's still a nice starting point.\n\nRound it out with a head coach and offensive playcaller in Kevin O'Connell with a track record of success, not to mention a background playing young quarterback.\n\nIt all looks pretty good, and it's why Minnesota looks like the most appealing destination for any rookie in this draft class.\n\n2. Chicago Bears\n\nFirst 2024 selection: No. 1 overall\n\nThat's not to say the Bears have done a bad job paving the way for Caleb Williams.\n\nThe foundation was laid with D.J. Moore and Darnell Wright, the star additions from 2023, living up to the hype. The Bears have built on that by trading for an eternally underrated star receiver in Keenan Allen and signing a 1,000-yard back in D'Andre Swift. Once Williams is selected No. 1 overall Thursday night, the Bears will also have the No. 9 overall pick to use as they see fit to continue building.\n\nThere's no question this is the best situation a No. 1 overall pick at quarterback has stepped into in recent memory.\n\nIf we're examining them for this year, though, there are still a few issues that give pause.\n\nFor starters, hopefully the Bears add a few more pieces on offense. Whether they trade that No. 9 pick or use it, it looks awfully tempting to throw another blue-chip talent at that offensive line. If not that, it'd be fun to add another pass-catcher to the mix. The Bears' offense is in a nice place, but it could stand to improve.\n\nMore importantly are the coaching questions. Offensive coordinator Shane Waldron has a solid enough r\u00e9sum\u00e9. He had that job for three years in Seattle, and he comes from the beloved Sean McVay/Kyle Shanahan coaching tree. Still, there will be enormous pressure on Waldron to deliver a functional, efficient offense with such a highly touted quarterback under his watch.\n\nThe other wrinkle to consider is that Matt Eberflus kept his job as head coach after some consternation about his 10-24 record. Eberflus is also a defensive-focused head coach, meaning his influence on Williams and the offense will likely be lessened.\n\nThis is not to say things will go south in Chicago -- but if they do, Williams could find himself faced with massive turnover after his rookie year. That's not ideal for a young quarterback's development.\n\nBut here in April, where everyone is undefeated, there's no doubt things look promising for Williams and the future of the Bears' offense.\n\n3. Washington Commanders\n\nFirst 2024 selection: No. 2 overall\n\nFeels strange to rank Washington as a favorable destination for a rookie quarterback, given this organization's recent history. But it's a new era in the DMV.\n\nThe Commanders didn't do anything special in free agency, but that felt like the point. Rather than make splashes for the sake of it, new general manager Adam Peters spent sensible money at a lot of positions.\n\nIt's not that anyone should get overly excited about Tyler Biadasz and Nick Allegretti, but these are smaller signings that can stabilize the offensive line. It's not that Austin Ekeler and Zach Ertz are as good as they were a few years ago, but these are still useful vets who can make a young quarterback's life easier.\n\nPlus, there were some exciting players already on board. Terry McLaurin and Jahan Dotson form a fun receiver tandem. Brian Robinson Jr. has been steady Eddy during his two years in the backfield.\n\nAnd, for all his flaws, offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury at least has experience with a ton of talented young quarterbacks -- and those with vastly different skill sets. Kingsbury has coached Baker Mayfield, Patrick Mahomes, Kyler Murray and Caleb Williams at either the college or pro level within the past decade, so you'd like to think he can tailor an offense to whichever prospect the Commanders select. (It bears mentioning, however, that Kingsbury's pairing with Murray in Arizona was hit-and-miss.)\n\nThe Commanders also have as much ammo as anyone with which to continue improving. After they pick their signal-caller at No. 2 overall, Washington holds five more picks in the top 100 this weekend. That's ample opportunity to put more talent around their new face of the franchise -- preferably with a big pick addressing left tackle.\n\nIt all adds up to Washington looking like a favorable place for a rookie QB to land. And even if the Commanders are not first on this list, that's a heck of an improvement from what they've been in the past.\n\n4. New York Giants\n\nFirst 2024 selection: No. 6 overall\n\nI'm expecting some pushback for this since the Giants clearly have some work to do at the skill positions.\n\nBut, if they are going to draft a quarterback in 2024, they have already made some serious upgrades to their mess of an offensive line. Last year's struggles clearly bothered general manager Joe Schoen, as we went out and handed out roughly $25 million in guarantees to Jon Runyan and Jermaine Eluemunor to address those issues. Those two, combined with a hopefully healthy Andrew Thomas, change the math for this offensive line a bit.\n\nThe challenge for the Giants on Day 1 of the draft will be whether a QB they want is still available to them with the No. 6 pick, or what they might have to give up to grab one earlier.\n\nThe Giants already traded their second-round pick, No. 39 overall, to Carolina for Brian Burns. No shade intended, it was an excellent trade, but it still leaves them light on ammo. Will they be willing to pay the price to move up Thursday? And if they do, what will they have left to use on receivers? Their current group of Jalin Hyatt, Darius Slayton and Wan'Dale Robinson could certainly use a boost.\n\nOf course, the Giants will be hoping their coaches can offset some personnel issues. Brian Daboll is widely recognized for helping to develop Josh Allen into an All-Pro talent. He oversaw Daniel Jones' best season to date, and he helped coax three wins out of Tommy DeVito last season. He's assisted by offensive coordinator Mike Kafka, who worked extensively with Patrick Mahomes in addition to his successes in New York.\n\nThe Giants also have the luxury of not throwing a rookie quarterback to the wolves. Jones will be in New York for at least one more season and can start once healthy, and Drew Lock is in the fold, as well. This could be a fitting situation for a redshirt year.\n\nIt might not look great on paper, but if you squint just right you can see the vision.\n\n5. Las Vegas Raiders\n\nFirst 2024 selection: No. 13 overall\n\nThe Raiders have a similar problem as New York, only the opposite.\n\nIt feels wrong to rank Vegas this low because they do have an All-Pro receiver in Davante Adams, and Jakobi Meyers makes for a solid No. 2. Zamir White is a fun, young piece at running back, and perhaps Michael Mayer makes a leap in his second season.\n\nBut is it worth getting excited about the skill players if you struggle to protect your new asset at quarterback?\n\nThe Raiders have a quality left tackle in Kolton Miller, who graded 13th among all tackles last season, per PFF. Andre James is a quality center, and Dylan Parham is a solid guard. That still leaves two spots open. Right tackle Jermaine Eluemunor is off to New York, and there's another guard spot to fill.\n\nMaybe that won't stop first-year brain trust Antonio Pierce and Tom Telesco from going after their guy at quarterback. But would that happen in a trade up, or would it come at pick No. 13? There are a lot of dots connecting Pierce and Jayden Daniels, but perhaps the Raiders would be content to draft Michael Penix Jr. without giving up extra draft capital.\n\nMuch like the Giants, the Raiders also have covered themselves from having to play a rookie immediately. Gardner Minshew brought the Colts within a whisker of the playoffs last season and can begin the year as the starter.\n\nEven still, that offensive line is cause for concern until further notice.\n\n6. Denver Broncos\n\nFirst 2024 selection: No. 12 overall\n\nIt just feels like the Broncos need a little bit of help everywhere -- without a lot of resources to do it.\n\nYou can see the roster effects of swinging a major, failed swap for a quarterback and trading to acquire Sean Payton from New Orleans. The Broncos only made five draft picks last spring, and they didn't have a first-round pick in 2023 or 2022. This year represents a chance to refurbish the depth chart.\n\nThe good news is, the Broncos did some spending on the offensive line last year. They recently lost Lloyd Cushenberry to free agency, but the trio of Garrett Bolles, Ben Powers and Mike McGlinchey is a nice starting point.\n\nThat's probably why there's been talk about the skill positions. The Broncos have been heavily linked to tight end Brock Bowers due to a glaring need at tight end. The receiving corps in Denver is solid, but with this being hailed as a deep receiver draft, it wouldn't hurt to add some talent there.\n\nThe Broncos also don't have the benefit of a strong quarterback room. Zach Wilson has technically started a ton of games, but anyone with an Internet connection knows how his time with the New York Jets went. Jarrett Stidham and Ben DiNucci have combined to start five NFL games. There's not a lot here protecting a rookie quarterback from getting thrown into the fire quickly.\n\nUltimately, there's a solid infrastructure here -- especially with a longtime offensive-minded guru like Sean Payton pulling the strings. But the Broncos have few pieces that get you truly excited, which puts them below most -- but not all -- of the teams on this list.\n\nPerhaps if the Patriots had a boatload of big-time draft picks, like the Washington Commanders, you could talk yourself into them bringing in a wave of exciting, young talent. But the reality is, if New England sits tight and picks a quarterback at No. 3 overall, they'll have just two more picks to use in the top 100 of this year's draft.\n\nThat's a problem when you look at the rest of the offense. There's currently no left tackle in New England, nor is there a bona fide star at receiver. Guys like Hunter Henry, K.J. Osborn and Kendrick Bourne are fine complementary pieces, but that's essentially the Patriots' entire offense.\n\nBetween that and the holes on the offensive line, there aren't enough resources to fix it all this weekend.\n\nThankfully, the Pats did bring back Jacoby Brissett, and he could be a placeholder until things markedly improve -- though that hardly seems fair to Brissett. But given the way things look here, that's probably a better course than throwing a rookie into such a barren situation.\n\nDavid Helman covers the Dallas Cowboys for FOX Sports and hosts the NFL on FOX podcast.

{"id": 231297970, "title": "Darren Kennedy: Life\u2019s a beach when you add some understated Hamptons glamour into your home", "text": "The Hamptons style is characterised by its casual, relaxed, yet sophisticated beach vibe and has long been a coveted look for homeowners. While Barrymore\u2019s home is undeniably luxurious, achieving a similar level of comfort and style in your own home is more attainable than you might think. For starters, use a base of neutral tones. Think whites, beiges and light greys, to create a bright and airy space. Barrymore\u2019s home features a pastel-pink study, which adds a playful yet sophisticated touch. Aim to incorporate natural materials like wood, stone and terracotta into your decor to create a warm and inviting atmosphere. Terracotta is having a moment, with the clay-based material proving very popular in flooring. These stone accents add texture and an earthy character. Ultimately, this style is all about balance. Combine rustic elements such as hardwood floors and (if you\u2019re lucky enough to have them) exposed beams with refined details such as elegant light fixtures and plush textiles. The quaint charm of the old is complemented by modern touches and chic decor elements. For instance, a rustic wooden table paired with sleek, modern chairs creates a beautiful juxtaposition. Display antique accessories alongside contemporary art to add depth and interest to your decor. Maximise natural light by using sheer curtains or, if you can get away with it, no window treatments at all. This will not only brighten up your room but also create a seamless connection between indoors and outdoors. Use mirrors strategically to reflect light and create an illusion of more space. Designate areas in your home for gatherings, and spaces that encourage relaxation and chill time, whether it\u2019s a reading nook with a plush armchair and a stack of books or a window seat with a view of the outdoors. Add soft throws, cushions and rugs to make these spaces feel warm and inviting.", "summary": "<p>Actor and TV host Drew Barrymore is offloading her Hamptons retreat. The farmhouse-style home boasts a modest (by Hollywood standards!) six bedrooms and five bathrooms. What caught my eye, however, is its finely tuned design, with rustic hardwood floors, high exposed-beam ceilings, brick fireplace and a terracotta-tiled kitchen with butcher-block countertops.

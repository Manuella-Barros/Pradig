It was made of equal parts relief and delight. The curse was broken and Charles Leclerc was finally a Monaco Grand Prix winner. He punched the air twice before diving into the army of Ferrari mechanics who had gathered to pay tribute to their driver. It turned out Leclerc needed more time to gather his emotions before his interview on the start-finish straight. The 26-year-old fought back tears as he said: \"It's the race that made me dream of becoming a Formula 1 driver one day. \"It was a difficult race emotionally. Already 15 laps before the end I was just hoping that nothing would happen.\" Leclerc also paid tribute to his father, Herve, who died in 2017 after a long illness and never got to see his son race in F1. He added: \"I was thinking of my dad a lot more than I thought while driving. He gave everything for me to be here. It was a dream of ours to race here and to win, so it's unbelievable.\" Leclerc had been on pole position twice before at his home race. He never managed to start in 2021 after a mechanical problem on the reconnaissance lap, while a year later Ferrari botched their pit stop strategy and he had to settle for fourth place. He said after his third Monaco pole on Saturday that he believed the team is in a better position to capitalise this time. And that proved to be the case as he avoided first-lap chaos to lead from start to finish and looked comfortable throughout. After the 78-lap procession, he said: \"At first, I thought we would have quite a lot of margin but we knew there were 78 laps to do on the same tyres which was very very difficult. But we did a great management of the tyres and there was a big part of the race where we had to manage the gap to George [Russell]. \"In the last 10 laps I could push a bit more and the car felt amazing. I just want to thank the team for doing such incredible work over the past few months and for giving me the opportunity to finally win this race. This is a very special feeling.\" Oscar Piastri kept the Monegasque honest but had to settle for second place while Carlos Sainz secured a double podium for Ferrari. Lando Norris was comfortably ahead of fellow Briton George Russell who managed to hold off Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton on the tight track.", "summary": "Charles Leclerc won his home race at the Monaco Grand Prix for the first time on Sunday and could barely contain his emotions as he processed what he had just achieved", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/leclerc-father-monaco-gp-ferrari-32897081", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32897126.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_F1-Grand-Prix-of-Monaco.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:15:39", "author": "Daniel Moxon,Daniel-moxon", "authors": ["Daniel Moxon", "Daniel-moxon"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.248}

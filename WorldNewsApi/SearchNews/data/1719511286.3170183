Addressing a press conference here, he said during its 25 years of rule, the BJD government had set up 24 Commissions but unfortunately, it has not made public the reports of a single commission so far. The government has had spent crores of rupees on the Commission, but suppressed its reports without taking the Cabinet or the state Assembly into confidence, he claimed. The BJP leader expressed that after the end of the third phase of elections, media reports and the mood of voters indicated that BJP would form the government with a two-thirds majority in Odisha. The BJP has attained the magic number to form the government even though one more phase of the election is still pending, he claimed. He said the BJP government will also probe the Mining scam and take action against the guilty. The new BJP government would ensure that the victims of chit-fund scam get back their money, he said. The BJP would also inquire where the Rs 300 crore Corpus fund, set up by the BJD government to return the money of the chit fund investors, has gone and would take steps to return money to beneficiaries, he said. In addition to it, probe will also be ordered into various other scams like Awas yojana, water and other issues, and steps would be taken to solve various problems of the people, Deo added.

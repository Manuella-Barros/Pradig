{"id": 243360030, "title": "This \u00a317 Amazon hair growth serum gives 'visible results' in 2 weeks, say shoppers", "text": "Beauty buffs are heaping praise on a 'miracle' natural hair growth that promotes longer, thicker and stronger hair, with some claiming it works within as little as one application, in some instances. The Batana Scalp and Hair Oil by Wealthskin is suitable for all hair types, curly or straight, and not only works to prevent hair loss but promote regrowth and the strengthening of damaged hair. The Batana Scalp and Hair Oil is currently on sale for \u00a316.99 down from \u00a329.99, a saving of over 40% or \u00a313 on Amazon, for a limited time. Batana oil is known for its nourishing and healing properties for skin and hair, without excessive oiliness. Batana, unlike other products, can regenerate dryness at the scalp, which builds strength, prevents breakage, adds volume, and improves the overall health of your hair. That's because the nutrient-rich formula is loaded with fatty acids to stimulate hair growth, as well as phytosterols and carotenoids to promote collagen and elasticity.

One shopper said: \"I love the smell and the texture is light and not too heavy on my hair. My hair is curly and has been dry recently and the ends are in bad condition, after one application I can already see the difference. Would definitely recommend.\" A second wrote: \"I read about how amazing batana oil is on Facebook and was amazed to see a product that contains 100% batana oil. I bought this product and I never regretted, I can boldly say my hair is much better as it improves the overall health of my hair. It is a product to have in your beauty collections.\" A third penned: \"I absolutely love this oil. I was a little dubious at first but I literally saw results within two weeks. My hair is thicker, longer and feels so much healthier. I have afro hair and I\u2019ve noticed that when I wash my hair and then apply this oil I don\u2019t have to actually blowdry my hair. How? I love it. Recommending to everyone.\" \"I love it,\" mentioned another. \"I have used rosemary oil for the past few months however I found that I was using around half a bottle every time because of my hair being long and thick. I saw someone say about batana oil and I thought why not give it a try and I just say it\u2019s amazing, it uses less product than rosemary oil meaning the tub is going to last me months and it\u2019s made my hair shine and feel softer than ever.\" However, one beauty buff gave the Batana Scalp and Hair Oil a three-star review because 'it smells like coffee'. They wrote: \"Honestly I can\u2019t say if it works or not as I just purchased and used once. Reviewing now to warn about the smell. It has a strong brewed coffee smell so depending on how you feel about coffee smell will depend on if this is a product for you. I tried just wearing it has a daily conditioner but couldn\u2019t take the consistent smell\u2026. I will try using it as a rinse out mask since I can\u2019t take the smell long term. I\u2019ll update this review later on for hair progress.\" But another loved their latest Amazon purchase, adding: \"I noticed a substantial change in my hair from day one of using this product. I'm now on day four and the change is massive. I have regrowth and the greys on my hair are reducing already. I can only imagine what happens after a month. This is absolutely the best natural hair product out there bar none. I would definitely recommend it and would be using it for keeps.\" Also popular on Amazon is the Nature Spell Rosemary Oil, which is currently on sale for \u00a37.98 down from \u00a39.98. Rosemary oil has been clinically proven to aid in hair regrowth and almost 5,000 shoppers who have given the oil a five-star review can attest to its hair benefits.", "summary": "The nutrient-rich formula is loaded with fatty acids to stimulate hair growth, as well as phytosterols and carotenoids to promote collagen and elasticity", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/17-amazon-hair-growth-serum-29419401", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29419504.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Amazon-hair-oil.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:36:40", "author": "Shawna Healey", "authors": ["Shawna Healey"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.278}

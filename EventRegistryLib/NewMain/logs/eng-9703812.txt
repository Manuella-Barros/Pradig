As we enter the second half of the year, we set a new goal for the end of the year.\n\nLee believes S&P earnings could even beat expectations. \"Now that we're in the middle of the year, 2025 earnings are looking much stronger than we thought at the beginning of the year. We thought maybe 260. Probably closer to 275, maybe 280, even closer to 285,\" he said.\n\nGiven the Fed's growing reasons to be dovish and the potentially softening employment picture, Lee suggests price/earnings multiples could be higher next year. \"So I'd say U.S. stocks should be higher between now and the end of the year. We've already had a strong first half, and the second half won't be as strong as the first half, but we need to build on those gains,\" he added.\n\nLee also touched on the issue of Bitcoin. Although BTC dropped below 60,000, it is now almost back to 63,000. The analyst said the following about Bitcoin:\n\n\"Bitcoin will probably hit Mt.

Gox repayments test and German BTC sell-off: Bitcoin still bullish?", "body": "Bitcoin has experienced a stark correction in the last 24 hours, sparking fear in the market. Could the possible short-squeeze scenario reignite the bullish flames?\n\nIn June 2024, the defunct Bitcoin (BTC) exchange Mt. Gox announced a major move that could shake the crypto world. This once-dominant platform, infamous for losing 850,000 BTC in a 2014 hack, is set to distribute the recovered assets to its creditors.\n\nAccording to Nobuaki Kobayashi, the Rehabilitation Trustee, repayments will commence in early July. The plan involves distributing 142,000 BTC and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), worth about $8.22 billion at current prices.\n\nThis announcement, while providing long-awaited relief to the victims, has also introduced a wave of uncertainty and potential volatility to the Bitcoin market.\n\nIn preparation for the repayments, Mt. Gox conducted several test transactions on July 4. These tests included moving small amounts of Bitcoin, totaling around $25, across different wallets to ensure the system's readiness.\n\nCompounding the situation is the large activity from the German government. Over the past few weeks, the German government has been on a constant BTC selling spree. Notably, on July 4, 2024, they moved millions in BTC.\n\nThis includes $75 million transferred to major crypto exchanges like Kraken, Coinbase, and Bitstamp, adding to the market's anxiety, as large transfers to exchanges often signal potential sell-offs, which can drive prices down.\n\nAs of this writing, the German government holds over 40,350 BTC worth over $2.3 billion, representing a 20% decline from their holdings of over 50,000 BTC on June 19.\n\nAmid all this drama, on July 4, Bitcoin hit a low of $57,000, a sharp decline triggered by the news of the impending Mt. Gox repayments and the German government's actions.\n\nDespite a slight rebound to around $57,800, Bitcoin has declined by nearly 4% in the last 24 hours, dropping below its 200-day moving average for the first time since October 2023, further exacerbating concerns among investors.\n\nLet's delve deeper into this saga, exploring what it means for Bitcoin prices and where things could go from here.\n\nMt. Gox, once the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, was founded in 2010 and quickly became the go-to platform for Bitcoin trading, handling around 70% of all Bitcoin transactions by its peak. However, Mt. Gox's prominence came crashing down due to a series of devastating hacks.\n\nThe first major hack occurred in 2011, when hackers stole 25,000 Bitcoins, valued at around $400,000 at the time. This was just the beginning of Mt. Gox's troubles.\n\nIn 2014, a catastrophic security breach led to the loss of nearly 650,000 Bitcoins belonging to customers and about 100,000 of the exchange's own. This amounted to approximately 7% of all Bitcoins in circulation, valued at around $473 million, with Bitcoin priced at roughly $600 each.\n\nFollowing the 2014 hack, Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy, leaving creditors owed 45 billion yen (around $414 million). Since then, creditors have been waiting for the repayment of their lost holdings, and it looks like their patience might finally be rewarded this month.\n\nWith the announcement of the redistribution of 142,000 BTC, the market is bracing for potential turbulence. Such a large influx of Bitcoin into the market could create enormous selling pressure, driving prices down.\n\nTo further illustrate, let's break down the potential impact of an $8.22 billion injection into the Bitcoin market. The current daily trading volume of Bitcoin is approximately $30 billion. Introducing $8.22 billion worth of Bitcoin into the market represents about 27% of the daily trading volume.\n\nIf this amount is sold rapidly then it could potentially decrease Bitcoin prices by a high margin, considering that sell-offs of even 10-15% of daily volume have previously led to 10-20% price drops.\n\nIf sold gradually over several months, then the market might experience 2-3% price corrections periodically, which would be less destabilizing but could still influence the overall market sentiment and lead to a bearish trend.\n\nBitcoin's recent price movements have left investors on edge, wondering where the market might head next.\n\nPeter Schiff, a well-known Bitcoin critic and chairman of Schiff Gold, a precious metal dealer, has added to the market's anxiety by mentioning Bitcoin's current critical support level.\n\nHe warns that if Bitcoin falls below this support, it could lead to a large drop. Schiff's comments often emerge during market downturns, intensifying panic and uncertainty among investors. Hence, one should always take them with a grain of salt.\n\nContrasting Schiff's pessimism, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, a notable crypto analyst, argues that the crypto cycle has not yet peaked. He believes that many claims about the end of the crypto boom are exaggerated.\n\nVan de Poppe believes that there is still potential for growth and that the market might see new highs before entering a downturn.\n\nMeanwhile, another crypto analyst notes that Bitcoin is still trading within a specific range. They suggest that while morale is down, the structural integrity of Bitcoin's market position remains intact.\n\nAli, a well-regarded crypto analyst, mentioned a critical short-term trading pattern. He notes that many Bitcoin traders have recently decided to short Bitcoin, creating large short positions around the $59,600 level.\n\nThis setup has formed a \"liquidation wall,\" which means that if the price of Bitcoin starts to rise, these short positions could be forced to buy back Bitcoin to cover their losses, potentially driving the price up rapidly.\n\nThe possible short squeeze scenario could lead to sudden and high price spikes, adding to the near-term volatility, indicating possible volatility ahead.\n\nAs always, you should stay informed and be prepared for both potential downturns and opportunities for growth.

After reaching an all-time high above $70,000, the value of BTC has declined to below $60,000. This bearish trend has sparked concerns among investors, and raised questions about the fate of their portfolios. Swan, crypto analysts, asserts that it is important to understand factors behind this volatility. Let's delve deeper into what is causing the recent Bitcoin price drops, and how it might impact your investment strategy.\n\nLong-term holders selling to take profits is a major reason for the recent market decline. Information obtained from the Bitcoin blockchain indicates a drop in the proportion of Bitcoin that has not been transferred in a year, from 70% to 65%, and in two years, from 57% to 54%.\n\nThis indicates that numerous investors who kept their Bitcoin during the last market surge are currently selling to secure their profits. This behavior is frequently seen in consolidation phases, when the market settles down before possibly continuing its upward trend.\n\nBitcoin miners are also contributing to the present price fluctuations. The most recent Bitcoin halving results in lower block rewards, causing miners to earn less revenue. Due to the decreasing hash price and increasing electricity costs, numerous miners are offloading their Bitcoin stocks to pay for operational costs.\n\nThis increase in selling activity, shown through record-breaking over-the-counter (OTC) transactions and moving $4.5 billion in Bitcoin to exchanges, contributes to the volatility in the market.\n\nThe impending release of 142,000 Bitcoin held by Mt. Gox creditors is another key factor. These coins, dormant for nearly a decade, are expected to enter the market soon.\n\nAlthough concerns about a potential sudden influx of Bitcoin exist, many creditors are long-term holders who may choose to sell gradually or explore other payout options. This gradual selling, combined with institutional ownership and tax considerations, suggests that any market impact may be spread over time.\n\nGovernments have also played a role in the decline of BTC prices. For example, Germany has recently disposed of 3,000 Bitcoin seized assets worth more than $800 million. Likewise, the U.S. government moved 4,000 Bitcoin from its large supply to Coinbase, probably for trading.\n\nThese actions, in addition to increasing selling pressure, also highlight the growing acceptance and large holdings of Bitcoin by institutional entities.\n\nEven with the recent drop, Bitcoin has demonstrated impressive resilience, maintaining a value above $60,000, just 15% below its highest point. This level of resilience indicates that the market is developing and might provide opportunities for strategic buying.\n\nLong-term investors may see periods of price decline as an opportunity to acquire assets at a reduced price, potentially leading to future profit.\n\nThe present volatility emphasizes the significance of spreading out your investments and handling risks in your portfolio. Despite BTC being recognized as an important role in the crypto market, the importance of diversifying your investments cannot be stressed enough.\n\nInvesting in traditional assets, digital assets, and other various alternatives, can protect your portfolio from the impact of such price fluctuations.\n\nInvestors who prioritize long-term rewards over short-term gains, known as having a 'low-time preference', are expected to profit the most from Bitcoin's present volatility. Historical patterns indicate that declines frequently set the stage for growth in future.\n\nAvoiding panic selling and focusing on long-term rather than short term will position you to take advantage of potential Bitcoin price increases in future.\n\nIt is crucial to stay updated on market trends and the influences on Bitcoin's price. Frequently analyzing market data, understanding the influences of macroeconomic events, and staying up-to-date on industry news can assist you in making educated choices.\n\nThis approach also helps in adapting your investment strategy when necessary.\n\nBitcoin price has dropped 4% over the day and 5.46% in the past seven days, to trade at $57,783.43. BTC has also seen a slight decreased market cap reaching $1.14 trillion. However, the coin is experienced heightened market activity, showing an increase of 46.7% in trading volume, to record $37.5 billion, over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe recent Bitcoin price drop was caused by profit-taking, pressure from mining revenue, and the collapse of Mt. Gox. The launch of Gox Bitcoin and government auctions have led to a tumultuous time for investors.

BTC Falls Below $60k Amid Mt Gox & Cycle Peak Fears", "body": "Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, has experienced a significant price drop in recent weeks, falling below $60,000 for the first time since early May. This decline has raised questions about whether the current market cycle has reached its peak.\n\nAs of the latest reports, Bitcoin's price stands at around $59,000, which is about 16% below its all-time high of $73,835 reached on March 14. Over the past 30 days, Bitcoin has fallen by 9.2%, with June showing a particularly steep decline of 11%.\n\nSeveral factors are contributing to this downward trend. One major concern is the anticipated sale of Bitcoin by creditors of Mt. Gox, a defunct cryptocurrency exchange. Mt. Gox's liquidators have announced they will begin returning Bitcoin stolen during a 2014 hack to clients starting in early July.\n\nThis could potentially flood the market with a large amount of Bitcoin, creating significant selling pressure.\n\nCharles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, has pointed out several on-chain metrics that suggest Bitcoin may be struggling to achieve new highs.\n\nOne key metric is the Bitcoin long-term holder (LTH) inflation rate, which has been rising steadily over the past two years. Currently, this rate stands at 1.9, just below the 2.0 threshold that typically signals a high likelihood of a market cycle top.\n\nAnother important indicator, the Bitcoin Dormancy Flow, has also been increasing over the past three months. This metric measures the number of coins being spent relative to the overall trend. Historically, peaks in this metric have preceded cycle tops by about three months.\n\nAdding to the selling pressure, there are reports of the German government selling hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. This, combined with the Mt. Gox situation, has made many traders cautious.\n\nThe recent downturn isn't limited to Bitcoin. Other cryptocurrencies, including Ether, Binance Coin, and Solana, have also experienced significant price drops. This broader decline in the crypto market suggests a general shift in sentiment among investors.\n\nDespite these recent losses, it's important to note that Bitcoin's price is still up 42% year-to-date. Much of this gain came earlier in the year, driven by excitement over the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January.\n\nThese ETFs were seen as a crucial step for Bitcoin entering the mainstream market, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin through traditional investment vehicles.\n\nHowever, the current market mood seems to have shifted. As Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra noted, \"After months of Bitcoin ETF euphoria, the market suddenly feels bearish.\"\n\nThis change in sentiment is reflected in recent trading activity, with Bitcoin withdrawals at crypto exchanges outnumbering deposits by $522 million over a recent five-day period.\n\nLooking ahead, the market will be closely watching several factors. The potential impact of the Mt. Gox Bitcoin distribution remains a significant concern. Broader economic indicators, such as upcoming U.S. labor market data, could influence investor sentiment towards risk assets like cryptocurrencies.", "source": {"uri": "blockonomi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blockonomi"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_dale@blockonomi.com", "name": "Oliver Dale", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mt.

This surge in inflows coincides with Bitcoin hovering near the $63,000 mark, a level that has caught the attention of both retail and institutional investors. According to data, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the two largest spot Bitcoin ETFs by net asset value, experienced no flows on Monday. However, the overall market sentiment remains bullish.\n\nThe hike in Bitcoin ETF inflows is considered bullish for the market and indicates that investors are willing to take advantage of a likely rally in Bitcoin. Traders are closely observing the inflows as they see this as an indication of a positive trend, while Bitcoin trades at $63k.\n\nBitcoin's recent price action has captivated the market's attention, hovering near the $63,000 mark. This critical price level has attracted individual investors and institutional interest, as evidenced by the Bitcoin ETF inflows. The arrival of funds in Bitcoin ETFs suggests growing faith in its long-term potential.\n\nPresently, Bitcoin's performance is completely different from that of its earlier volatility. Notably, the stability around $63k has been encouraging for those who feared cryptocurrency price swing. This newfound stability, coupled with increased Bitcoin ETF inflows, paints a promising picture for Bitcoin's future.\n\nExperts believe that the increased Bitcoin ETF inflows are a testament to the positive investor sentiment surrounding Bitcoin. This optimism is not unfounded, as Bitcoin's fundamentals continue to improve. Factors such as increasing adoption, technological advancements, and favourable regulatory developments contribute to the bullish outlook.\n\nThe impact of major financial institutions behind this occurrence cannot be emphasized enough when considering how certain conditions drive up shares representing Bitcoins through institutions such as BlackRock and Grayscale. Their involvement provides a level of credibility that attracts a broader range of investors. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust are prime examples of how institutional interest can influence market dynamics.\n\nAccording to reports, the surge in Bitcoin ETF inflows is indicative of a broader acceptance of Bitcoin as a viable investment. Institutional investors increasingly view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a store of value.\" This perspective highlights the evolving narrative around Bitcoin and its growing appeal among traditional investors.\n\nWider crypto market gets hit significantly by Bitcoin ETF inflows, making it an important event in the sector. The fact that investors pour money into Bitcoin ETF shows that they are confident about it, prompting others to buy more of it as well, resulting in a domino effect which can create a demand, causing a price rise for BTC.\n\nImportantly, it should be noted that despite their positive indications, Bitcoin's price isn't solely determined by its ETF inflows. Participants must consider various factors, including, but not limited to, macroeconomic trends, regulatory issues, and technological developments. However, certainly, increasing flows towards Bitcoin ETFs are bullish.\n\nHowever, even though sentiments continue to be positive for cryptocurrencies, there are challenges ahead. Regulatory uncertainties remain among digital assets' major obstacles, with different governments struggling to understand how to approach them. Such unfriendly regulatory developments may temper enthusiasm regarding inflows into Bitcoin EFTs, if any occur.\n\nThere is also the ever-present peril of market volatility. Although Bitcoin has exhibited impressive stability at about $63,000, it may still be affected by quick price changes. Investors must be ready for possible fluctuations and control their risks properly.\n\nIn summary, the recent surge in Bitcoin ETF inflows highlights the growing confidence in Bitcoin as it hovers near $63,000. The involvement of major financial institutions like BlackRock and Grayscale has been pivotal in attracting new investors.

This spike marks a significant price turning point, fueling excitement and speculation all around the cryptocurrency market. According to several analysts, more increases are on the way. As it continues to amaze, Bitcoin's remarkable performance has dominated the latest crypto news.\n\nThe BIT Journal, according to news sources, reports that some variables support the Bitcoin price increase. These include favourable trends in global liquidity and a positive market mood. As Bitcoin hits $63K, it's not only BTC that stands to gain. Other big coins, including Ethereum (ETH), have also seen substantial rises, energizing the entire cryptocurrency market. Investors have long kept a careful eye on the BTC ETH connection, and the current increase has only made them more vigilant. The crypto update from multiple sources indicates that the forces propelling Bitcoin's present surge in value are intricate and multi-dimensional.\n\nFollowing a time of stabilization and flat trade, which had some worried about a possible market cooling, Bitcoin's value has surged. Analyst Rekt Capital said that \"Bitcoin has resumed its uptrend.\" As Bitcoin hits $63K, it becomes evident that it still has ample space for further rise. The Bitcoin price, according to analysts, might rise another 40%. Several key factors have contributed to Bitcoin's recent price surge and the end of the downtrend observed in June. The latest crypto news indicates that institutional adoption is a part of this. Some large banks and companies have begun to include Bitcoin in their balance sheets.\n\nSome are offering crypto-related services to their customers, demonstrating their continued interest in the cryptocurrency. These institutional backings boost the credibility and demand for Bitcoin. Additionally, regulatory agencies and national governments are laying down more specific rules for the industry. More people will be willing to adopt BTC with less doubt in the market. Constant upgrades to the Bitcoin network make it more useful and attractive to institutional and individual users. According to sources, low interest rates, growing inflation fears, and worldwide economic instability are additional factors to consider. Therefore, many people are looking for new ways to hold their money, like Bitcoin.\n\nThe conclusion of June's downward trend may indicate a change in market dynamics, as numerous experts anticipate continued growth. Daan Crypto Trades focused on US dollar liquidity. The Bitcoin report noted that these are critical for the crypto market's performance, with optimism rising. As mentioned earlier, the upward trend as Bitcoin hits $63K isn't exclusive to Bitcoin. The entire ecosystem is affected by this growth. Ethereum (ETH) has also gained, following Bitcoin's rise. Since the two biggest cryptocurrencies generally move in tandem, it is not surprising that BTC and ETH values correlate.\n\nBitcoin hits $63K, maintaining its positive trajectory. The Bitcoin price recovery boosts the crypto ecosystem's reputation. The crypto update reveals that this further solidifies its status as the dominant cryptocurrency. Bitcoin might hit new heights, maybe even surpassing a $90K milestone, if the predicted 40% price spike comes to fruition.\n\nAs the latest crypto news reveals, other cryptocurrencies may feel the effects of this upward price trend in Bitcoin. Investors may take a second look at cryptocurrency investments such as BTC ETH, and altcoins continue to rise in value. The fact that Bitcoin is no longer seen as an ancillary investment is also becoming more apparent as Bitcoin hits $63K. More widespread use and a stronger foundation may result from the increasing legitimacy of Bitcoin and other digital assets in the financial sector. According to available data, it could lead to more favourable regulatory climates globally.", "source": {"uri": "thebitjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Bit Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regulatory agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://thebitjournal.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/kanchanara-Lta5b8mPytw-unsplash-1-1024x681.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703812", "eventUri": "eng-9703812", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Beyond writing, Zafar enjoys trading and exploring the latest trends in the crypto market.\n\nBitcoin is down by 23% from its all time high, which might be a fear signal for newcomers. However, believers see this as a necessary correction. For some, this is a time to be fearful, but for others, it's a chance to wait for the right time & opportunity to fill their bags. More than Btc price, a large number of people look for its value.\n\nDon't just take the Bitcoin maximalists' word when they say it's time for \"diamond hands.\" Let's look at the data because numbers never lie. No matter what time frame you open, if you see the bigger picture, you'll notice a continuous upward trend since Bitcoin's inception. Historically, whenever Btc price rode the 200 DMA, it led to a significant price increase.\n\nBitcoin wallet inflow and outflow data show that people are beginning to understand its value. Instead of trading, many are accumulating it. Over time, a large volume of Bitcoin has moved from exchanges to private wallets.\n\nYes, crypto is highly volatile, but Bitcoin's volatility history shows it's growing stronger. This bolsters the confidence of Bitcoin believers. Bitcoin still holds more market dominance than all other cryptos combined, no matter how famous they become.\n\nFamous entrepreneur and Bitcoin investor Lark Davis predicts Bitcoin will soon reach $150k. When this happens, Ether will likely hit $15k and Solana $1,000. His reasons align with the data we discussed. Bitcoin ETFs are already thriving, and an ETH ETF is expected soon, with a Solana ETF also on the horizon.\n\nData from BitInfoCharts shows a constant rise in the number of active Bitcoin addresses over the year.\n\nThis means more people are understanding and adopting Bitcoin every day. The Rainbow price chart illustrates how, over the years, Bitcoin has become a powerful asset, increasing in both price and value.\n\nAll the data has always been showing a great future for Bitcoin and people who believe in it.

As of mid-2024, Lee highlighted that earnings for 2025 are looking stronger than anticipated, with estimates rising from an initial $260 to potentially $275, $280, or even $285. He believes this improved earnings outlook is coupled with a potentially dovish Federal Reserve and a softening employment picture, which could lead to higher price-to-earnings (PE) multiples.\n\nLee emphasized that if the S&P 500 achieves earnings of $285 and applies a PE multiple of 20, the index could reach 5,800 by year-end. This projection implies a continued but more moderate growth compared to the first half of the year. He noted that such a scenario would result in a total return of a little over 20%, a significant figure given the market's performance over the past two years.\n\nImpact of Cash Holdings\n\nLee addressed the large cash reserves held by investors, amounting to $6 trillion. He suggested that this substantial liquidity, which has been sitting in cash earning 5%, might soon face a \"Day of Reckoning\" as investors realize they have missed out on significant market gains. This realization, he says, could drive more investment into equities, further supporting market growth.\n\nSources of Liquidity\n\nWhen questioned about the origins of this liquidity, Lee acknowledged that it is a mix of earned income and stimulus measures. He pointed out that while the fiscal deficit remains high, much of the cash comes from earned income on assets, which historically would have been reinvested into the economy or equities.\n\nBitcoin Thesis\n\nTom Lee also discussed his bullish stance on Bitcoin, reiterating his target of $150,000. Despite previous volatility and skepticism, Lee remains confident in his projection. He attributed the recent struggles of Bitcoin to the overhang of the Mt. Gox distributions, which have been a concern for years. However, with these distributions expected to start in July, Lee anticipates a sharp rebound in the second half of the year.\n\nLee reminded viewers that Bitcoin's gains are often concentrated in just a few days each year. Specifically, he noted that if the 10 best days are excluded, Bitcoin would have negative returns annually.", "source": {"uri": "cryptoglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoGlobe"}, "authors": [{"uri": "siamak_masnavi@cryptoglobe.com", "name": "Siamak Masnavi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squawk_on_the_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Squawk on the Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polyethylene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_(accounting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reserve (accounting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price\u2013earnings_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price\u2013earnings ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stimulus (economics)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Market_Research", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Market Research", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Associations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://media.cryptoglobe.com/2022/09/bitcoin-g495957f50_1920-768x508.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703812", "eventUri": "eng-9703812", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 53, "textEnd": 59}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Grayscale's ETF accounted for the majority, or $27 million worth of outflows, according to Farside Investors data.\n\nHowever, panic selling of ETFs could still occur after investors return from the Fourth of July holiday, which is Independence Day in the United States, the world's largest economy.\n\nThe incoming Mt. Gox repayments, expected in early July, could add additional selling pressure for Bitcoin. The Mt. Gox creditor repayments will distribute over $9.4 billion worth of Bitcoin to 127,000 creditors who have been waiting for over 10 years to recover their funds.\n\nThis means that a potential breakout will be further delayed, until BTC breaks the downtrend that started in early June, according to popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital, who wrote in a July 3 X post:\n\n\"Breakout postponed due to a failed retest of the June Downtrend as new support.

Gox creditor repayments and continued German government sell-offs contribute to the current market volatility and bearish sentiment.\n\nBitcoin's value has recently experienced a sharp downturn, surprising many investors and igniting debates within the cryptocurrency community. This selloff appears to be driven by multiple factors, selloff by speculative investors amidst Bitcoin ETFs and the recent halving event, liquidation of overleveraged positions, and unexpected sell-offs such as the German government's liquidation of seized Bitcoin assets.\n\nThe potential impact of Mt. Gox creditor repayments and a cascade of short liquidations have further amplified market volatility. The combination of these factors has led to significant price drops, leaving market participants uncertain about Bitcoin's next moves in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nRecent on-chain data reveals interesting patterns in Bitcoin movement, with approximately $2.4 billion worth of Bitcoin aged 3-6 months moving during the price drop. This suggests selling pressure from entities that bought Bitcoin at the beginning of the year, possibly speculators who entered the market due to ETF and halving expectations.\n\nWhile these sellers might be classified as \"long-term\" holders, their behavior resembles that of short-term investors. In contrast, entities holding Bitcoin for over a year haven't shown significant spending patterns, indicating that true long-term holders are maintaining their positions despite market turbulence. This divergence in behavior between newer and established holders provides valuable insights into the current market dynamics.\n\nThe crypto markets have suffered heavy losses due to multiple sell-offs, with Bitcoin falling to $57,000 and Ethereum to $3,100. Options market data shows that Bitcoin's major short-term implied volatilities are up 10%, with the DVol (realized volatility) up 3%. Ethereum-related parameters have increased slightly less than Bitcoin's, and skew indicators are clearly tilted in a bearish direction.\n\nBitcoin block put volume is noticeably rising, with a more complex distribution of transactions. The July 12 $58,000 put option stands out as the largest. Interestingly, options data suggests that whales are not overly concerned about potential downside risk at the moment. They appear to be primarily focused on adjusting their positions following last week's quarterly delivery, especially for Ethereum, where whales are exhibiting low volatility expectations.\n\nThe German government has been actively liquidating its seized Bitcoin assets, sending over $300 million worth of Bitcoin to centralized exchanges and unidentified addresses. They still retain approximately $2.32 billion in Bitcoin.\n\nThe government's selling pattern has been consistent since June 19th, with regular transfers to exchanges like Bitstamp, Kraken, and Coinbase, as well as to market makers like Flow Traders. The largest single transfer occurred on July 4th, with 1,300 BTC sent to exchanges. This persistent selling pressure has contributed to market volatility.\n\nIn response to these actions, Justin Sun has expressed willingness to negotiate with the German government to acquire all of their Bitcoin holdings off-market, aiming to minimize market disruptions and prevent substantial price volatility in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAlso Read: PEPE Meme Coin Wallet Counts Surges; What It Means For Its Price\n\nRecent activity in Mt. Gox wallets has raised concerns about the impending repayment of $9 billion worth of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash to creditors. Arkham Intelligence flagged transactions in three wallets associated with the now-defunct exchange. This event, dubbed the Mt. Gox \"Doomsday,\" is approaching this month and could potentially lead to a heightened Bitcoin price crash.\n\nThe market is already on edge, with Bitcoin extending its decline to $57,000. The uncertainty surrounding these repayments and their potential impact on market liquidity and price action is contributing to the overall bearish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe crypto market appears to be swinging back into bear territory, with the global crypto market cap dropping 20% to a low of $2.13 trillion. Over the last 24 hours alone, the market cap tumbled more than 4.20%. The open interest of bitcoin has declined by 4.89% with a current valuation of $17.6 Billion.\n\nBitcoin's price hit a 24-hour low of $57,800, falling back to a key support level and risking a potential collapse to $52,000. Interestingly, Bitcoin has taken out nearly all the available liquidity on the downside, with only about $7 billion in short liquidations remaining at the $72,000 level.\n\nAs of the latest data, Bitcoin is trading at $57,428.64, with a 24-hour trading volume of $35.1 billion. The coin has declined 4.74% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading between $60,449.99 and $56,843.13. Bitcoin's live market cap stands at $1.1 trillion, reflecting the significant market volatility and uncertainty.", "source": {"uri": "coingape.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coingape"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mt.

More than that, he sees the Bitcoin ledger as the real value of BTC - and this is still massively undervalued.\n\nHe also says Bitcoin's current price drop is \"artificial\" and that this is another opportunity to buy.\n\nBitcoin dropped to around $56,700 earlier today, but has seen a slight rebound to currently change hands near $58,200. The reason for the drop? Miner capitulation, German government sell-off and Mt. Gox.\n\nFeinstein commented on Bitcoin amid latest Mt. Gox news.\n\n\"Today the Mt. Gox Bitcoin is being sold and Bitcoin has \"crashed\" from mid $60,000 range to the mid $50,000 range,\" Feinstein said in a post on X. \"If you are new to this space and have not had to witness complete chaos for the first 8+ years of Bitcoin, this drop seems meaningful. It is not.\"\n\nThe Core Scientific founder says he entered crypto in 2012, and sent his first Bitcoin to Mt. Gox on April 17, 2013.\n\nFeinstein notes that most people did not take Bitcoin seriously in the early days, but it's a different story altogether today.\n\nThe market has Bitcoin ETFs, governments are hodling BTC and billionaires and presidents support it. Amid this, the understanding is that Bitcoin is here to stay.\n\nSince Bitcoin's launch on January 3, 2009, there are very few days on which the price of BTC has been at or anywhere near where it is today. Just as well, global support \"has never been more significant.\"\n\n\"And what is still massively undervalued about Bitcoin is that the immutable ledger that [it] runs on is infinitely more valuable than the Bitcoin itself, the ledger blockspace is still not priced in.

And then, just a few weeks ago, Donald Trump came out in support for Bitcoin, claiming that the US should lead the world in mining the remaining Bitcoins. No-one predicted that one coming so soon.\n\nWhen ETF's from Blackrock, Fidelity and from eight other investment managers were approved in January, the media started writing more thoughtful pieces on the topic. Specifically, the narrative has changed to one in which Bitcoin can legitimately become part of a core holding as a long-term store of value.\n\nIn Bulgaria, we can all have a taste of the future. Are you feeling hungry? You can use Bitcoin and Bitcoin lightning as a payment method for your takeaway on order.bg. So far, Zavedenia.bg lists 13 popular Sofia restaurants that accept Bitcoin for in-house dining. With plenty of food variety with Indian, Hawaiian poke, Lebanese, Mediterranean and pizza venues, you'll also see some beer and speciality coffee places listed. The momentum is such that, in Sofia, the use of Bitcoin to pay is going up by 50 per cent every month since the accepting restaurants were introduced in February this year.\n\nAs the Euro Football Championships draw to close, we ponder how long it will be before we see Bulgaria's Botev Plovdiv football team, winners of the Bulgarian Cup 23/24 to play in high-level European tournaments.\n\nTheir team gear sports the Bitcoin B on their official kit. Their objective is to extend their supporter base to both Bitcoin and football enthusiasts worldwide, not just locally. So far, the club has started accepting Bitcoin in its fanshops and online store, it has partnered with leading Bitcoin companies, and is now working on developing its Bitcoin corporate treasury strategy in El Salvador - world's first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, as mentioned below.\n\nThis makes Botev ever more popular among the growing number of affluent Bitcoin holders who are already visiting Bulgaria and Plovdiv to see first hand the club's Bitcoin adoption journey.\n\nWith thousands of bitcoin initiatives around the world we're seeing the focus on earning, spending and replacing that spent bitcoin. And not just holding. Bitcoin's role as a medium of exchange is firmly in sight.\n\nHigh inflation has been an issue for many countries. That, combined with limited access to banking, has led to more Bitcoin adoption in Turkey, Peru, Cuba, Nigeria and South Africa. As yet, only El Salvador has made Bitcoin legal tender, but Argentinia's President, Javier Milei, has announced that there will be free competition of all currencies, including Bitcoin.\n\nThe adoption of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange has, predictably, lagged its use as a store of value. But more than 15 years since its introduction, it looks as if the time is approaching for much more mainstream merchant acceptance. With that process, we'll see more Bitcoin use as well as ownership.\n\nIf you're curious to find all businesses that accept bitcoin in Bulgaria, and worldwide, they can be discovered using

He aims to minimize the impact on the market.\n\nJustin's exact words were, \"I am willing to negotiate with the German government to purchase all BTC off-market in order to minimize the impact on the market.\"\n\nThe German government has been busy transferring its Bitcoin reserves to exchanges. On July 4th, the German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) moved around $75 million worth of Bitcoin in multiple transactions. These funds were distributed across exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp.\n\nSince mid-June, Germany has shifted approximately $315 million in Bitcoin to various platforms. In under a month, Germany has offloaded over $390 million in Bitcoin.\n\nThis activity follows the BKA's 2013 seizure of nearly 50,000 Bitcoin linked to the former operator of the film piracy website Movie2K. This stash is estimated to be worth $2.3 billion at today's prices.\n\nThe steady flow of Bitcoin to exchanges signals Germany's potential plans to liquidate parts of its reserves. This has sparked fears of a negative impact on Bitcoin's market price, which dipped below $58,000 this week.\n\nHowever, the amounts transferred so far make up a relatively small share of the BKA's massive Bitcoin trove. After the latest movements, Germany still holds around 40,000 Bitcoin.\n\nThe sales are similar to recent transfers by the U.S. government. America also holds Bitcoin confiscated from criminal cases, leading to concerns it may be selling reserves.\n\nThe timing of these sales is critical, as creditor repayments from Mt. Gox's 2014 collapse are set to begin in July, threatening to compound selling pressure on Bitcoin.\n\nQCP Capital's analysis provides insight into the current market situation. On July 4th, they reported another day of heavy selling pressure, causing Bitcoin to fall below the $60,000 support level, reaching lows of $57,875.\n\nThey also noted that Bitcoin miners are showing signs of capitulation. Historically, this has been associated with a bottom in prices, with the last comparable hash rate drawdown occurring in 2022 when Bitcoin traded at $17,000.\n\nDespite the sell-off in crypto, the options market remains optimistic. Interest is heavily skewed towards Ethereum calls for September and December expiries. There are several factors that could cause prices to break this downtrend.\n\nFirst, liquidation clusters on Bitcoin and Ethereum are heavily skewed to the topside, opening up potential short squeezes. Second, with S-1 Form approvals around the corner, an approval may result in a hard bounce in Ethereum.\n\nThey propose an Ethereum KIKO (Knock-In, Knock-Out) strategy. The expiry is set for September 27, 2024. The idea is to sell a 3,000 put (Knock-in: 2,500) and buy a 3,600 call (Knock-out: 5,500) at zero cost.\n\nThe maximum payout is 271.96% per annum or $1,900 USD per ETH if the spot expires just below 5,500. The downside is that at expiry, if the spot is below 2,500, you buy ETH at 3,000 (Spot reference: 3,210).", "source": {"uri": "cryptorank.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoRank"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Criminal_Police_Office_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Sun", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kraken (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinbase", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coinbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstamp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bitstamp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mt.

This shift among private and publicly traded companies has led to discussions among industry experts. The BIT Journal, through available data, provides an overview of the long-term potential of this crypto update.\n\nA notable name in this sector is MicroStrategy. The company has allegedly accumulated over 1% of the Bitcoin supply. According to reports, MicroStrategy has 226,331 BTC at the moment and has become a key stakeholder. Even though MicroStrategy stands so high, other companies with smaller Bitcoin holdings exert influence in the industry. Some of the companies listed by Nasdaq are said to include crypto exchange platforms like CoinBase and miners like CleanSpark. Non-crypto companies like Tesla, Semler Scientific, Mercado Livre, and Meitu also hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. These companies have about 3.87% of Bitcoin's total supply.\n\nAccording to data, the U.S. Federal Reserve aims to manage inflation at 2% annually. Digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum (BTC ETH) have policies that contrast with traditional policies.\n\nBitcoin has shown a low correlation with other assets like Ethereum and other altcoins. In the latest crypto news, a Binance spokesperson mentioned that \"Given Bitcoin's low correlation to the performance of traditional asset classes, such as equities and bonds, Bitcoin may look attractive to institutional investors as an addition to their investment portfolio and hedge against traditional market volatility, thereby spreading risks while potentially enhancing portfolio performance.\" According to the spokesperson, stable regulatory laws will lead to growth, innovation, and long-term trust from investors.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has much potential, but investors are concerned about its volatility. The price swings can be sporadic, which is common among crypto assets. In a crypto update from The BIT Journal, Arina Dudko, head of corporate payment solutions at Cex.io, stated: \"Just looking at Bitcoin's price chart reveals a series of peaks and valleys that illustrate its erratic trading value in a rollercoaster that is well-known to crypto enthusiasts, but could startle business investors who measure success a quarter at a time.\" This can be troubling for investors.\n\nA certain level of stability is required for assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum (BTC ETH). According to BitPay Zielke, companies are adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset risk short-term loss and accounting complexities. Zielke also pointed out the setbacks of Bitcoin (BTC), referencing the Mt. Gox and FTX collapse; he noted that Bitcoin \"rallied back every time\" and that the \"financial rewards are clear and obvious.\"\n\nZielke also mentioned that companies adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset are \"positioning themselves as titans of the future,\" Dudko advises these companies to do adequate research before allocating resources to Bitcoin. Quoting Dudko, \"To avoid falling into dire financial straits, it could be wise for companies to consider how they would fare if BTC gained or lost double-digit valuations given its proven volatility.\"\n\nSchlaufman from DeFI Technologies pointed out that DeFI manages the risks of holding a volatile asset like Bitcoin as a treasuring asset. He said they maintain such an asset by creating a diversified balance sheet for U.S.D, BTC ETH, and venture investments. Schlaufman mentioned that DeFi will \"continue to purchase Bitcoin as we are able to,\" hoping it will be profitable in the long run.\n\nRecords suggest that there has been a massive adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Experts say this will alter Bitcoin and lead to nuances in the financial industry. However, analysts are still unsure how this will influence the culture in the cryptocurrency world. The strong commitment by these companies reflects their belief in the potential of Bitcoin. Due to unpredictability and volatility, companies are adding BTC to their balance sheets. The uncertainty of the digital asset is the most pressing challenge; however, investors seem not to be worried about this, casting their hope in its long-term potential. Analysis shows that more companies are set to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset once it is more stable.", "source": {"uri": "thebitjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Bit Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroStrategy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MicroStrategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_classes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asset classes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hedge (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Institutional investor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portfolio (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decentralized finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitPay", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BitPay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mt.

This stint inspired him to view the future of journalism through the lens of next generation technologies. Now, he covers the crypto scene for Coinpedia, uncovering a vibrant new world where technology and journalism converge.\n\nAt a time when the crashing of the price of Bitcoin is creating shocking headlines, a crypto analyst has come up with a positive observation about the future of Bitcoin. The observation is sending a feeling of hope to Bitcoin traders and investors.\n\nLet's see what a crypto expert has to say about the future prospects of Bitcoin. Do we really need to worry about the fall of the price of Bitcoin to around $58,000?\n\nAt the time of writing this news story, the price of Bitcoin stands at $58,857. The daily chart of Bitcoin shows three consecutive red candlesticks, indicating increasing selling pressure. In the last seven days, the BTC price has seen a fall of around 3.6%. On June 28, the price was around $60,315. Over 14.7% dip has been witnessed in the last 30-days. On June 5, the price was as high as $71,095, which was the peak of that month. In the last 24 hours alone, a fall of 4.5% has been observed. Last day's closing price was nearly $60,135. Will the price go below the $58,000 mark is the big question now.\n\nA crypto expert, identified as Captain Faibik, in a post in X, suggests that if the present support level of $58,000 holds, the price of Bitcoin could bounce back soon. His post indicates that the crypto expert is optimistic about the future of Bitcoin. It concludes with a prediction that the Bitcoin price would reach $70,000 by the end of July.\n\nIn the same month previous year, what we saw was a sideways market. The price was oscillating between $31,470 and $29,150. The one day chart of Bitcoin for the month of July, 2023, shows very small red and green candlesticks, indicating close competition between sellers and buyers.\n\nIn short, the observation of the crypto expert about the future of the price of Bitcoin has enough indications that a Bictoin trader will benefit, if he stay patient, showing confidence in the potential recovery of the market.", "source": {"uri": "coinpedia.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coinpedia - Fintech & Cryptocurreny News Media| Crypto Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vignesh_s_g@coinpedia.org", "name": "Vignesh S G", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockchain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(United_States_O-6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (United States O-6)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 68}], "image": "http://image.coinpedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/27133550/Bitcoin-Price-Forecast-What-to-Expect-in-the-Coming-Months.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703812", "eventUri": "eng-9703812", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 1215, "textEnd": 1222}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 1312, "textEnd": 1318}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Marathon Digital decided to hang onto all of its Bitcoin even though Bitcoin BTC has been on a downward trend for over a month.\n\nBased on its operations report released on July 3, the corporation has 18,536 BTC valued overall as of June, more than $1.1 billion.\n\nThrough open market BTC purchases and investment in \"other opportunities to increase its Bitcoin yield,\" the Bitcoin miner declared it seeks to keep strengthening its Bitcoin holdings. Still, it also mentioned that it might sell some of its BTC going forward:\n\n\"MARA opted not to sell any bitcoin in June. The Company still intends to sell some of its bitcoin holdings in future periods to support monthly operations, manage its treasury, and for general corporate purposes.\"\n\nParticularly since the 2024 Bitcoin halved may be causing miners to sell more BTC due to the block rewards being cut in halves, the selling patterns of big holders, such as mining companies, can have a major impact on the price of Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, Marathon's Bitcoin production in June 2024 saw a 40% year-over-year decrease. This decline is primarily due to the halving event that occurred in the Bitcoin network last April. The halving event reduces the block reward for miners by 50%, impacting overall production across the industry.\n\nThe Bitcoin production and miner operation update report also highlights the increasing role of transaction fees in Marathon's production. Transaction fees contributed nearly 7% of the total Bitcoin mined in June, with one individual transaction fee reaching a significant 0.85 BTC. This suggests that rising transaction fees on the Bitcoin network could play a more prominent role in miner profitability going forward.\n\nWith a value of more than $6.25 billion, Marathon is the biggest Bitcoin mining company worldwide, exceeding CleanSpark, the second-largest company, by 62%. CompaniesMarketCap records show CleanSpark's market capitalization to be $3.85 billion.\n\nMarathon Digital's move to retain all its mined Bitcoin in June has significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency industry. As the largest Bitcoin miner, Marathon's actions are closely watched and often influence market sentiment. Their decision to hold rather than sell may encourage other miners to adopt a similar strategy, potentially affecting Bitcoin's supply dynamics and market price.\n\nFurthermore, Marathon's strategy of increasing Bitcoin holdings through open-market acquisitions suggests a bullish outlook on the cryptocurrency's future value. This approach aligns with the growing trend among major institutional players who view Bitcoin as a strategic long-term investment.\n\nIn addition to its financial strategies, Marathon Digital has proactively addressed environmental concerns associated with Bitcoin mining. The company has significantly invested in renewable energy sources to power its mining operations. This commitment to sustainability helps mitigate the environmental impact of mining and enhances Marathon's reputation and appeal to environmentally-conscious investors.\n\nMarathon Digital's decision not to sell any Bitcoin in June 2024 highlights the company's strategy regarding its Bitcoin holdings. As the largest Bitcoin miner, the industry closely monitors Marathon's actions and strategies, potentially influencing market trends and operational practices. The company's focus on increasing its Bitcoin holdings and commitment to sustainable mining practices are notable aspects of its approach to cryptocurrency mining.", "source": {"uri": "thebitjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Bit Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_degradation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmental degradation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmentalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Mineral_Exploration_and_Extraction", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Mineral Exploration and Extraction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Road_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Road Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://thebitjournal.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/kanchanara-9pCV2MB65y8-unsplash-1024x683.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703812", "eventUri": "eng-9703812", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 306, "textEnd": 312}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Almost everyone I see in my timeline and chats, who are only momentarily bearish, thinks in terms of a few points when it comes to lower levels. They don't even want to think about Bitcoin reaching $40,000 again. This is shortsightedness for obvious reasons.\n\nIn addition to these analysts, well-known market analyst Benjamin Cowen released a new video, stating that Bitcoin could experience a further downward movement in the context of the 10-year yield (US10Y) ratio's historical correlation.\n\nOne of the reasons you often see Bitcoin declining is that the long yield curve starts to rise... but if you look at the 10-year yield, what you'll notice is that when the 10-year yield really rises as it is here, Bitcoin really starts to decline from July [2023] and October [2023]. And if you look at the previous year [2022], when it rose until October, Bitcoin was declining then. So if the 10-year yield starts to rise again towards October, this could correspond to Bitcoin showing some of its seasonal weakness.\n\nYou can follow our news on Telegram, Facebook, Twitter & Coinmarketcap Disclaimer: The information contained in this article does not constitute investment advice.

With so many choices out there, how do you know which ones to give your money? When we talk about cryptocurrencies, the decision typically boils down to whether or not you should be investing in Bitcoin or something else. But which one makes more sense?\n\nIn this article, we'll help you understand everything you need to know about Bitcoin and altcoins. Our aim is to equip you with knowledge so you can make an informed decision on where to put your money.\n\nIn 2009, Bitcoin was unveiled as the first digital currency. It broke new ground by using a system that doesn't rely on a central authority. This was revolutionary, paving the way for what we now know as cryptocurrency.\n\nWith its block chain technology, each and every transaction is registered publicly. While everyone can see the transactions - which are kept secure - they are inaccessible to anyone else via Trojans or destructive software.\n\nBitcoin itself placed a limit on the total cap: 21 million BTC is all there will ever be. Making it something similar to gold and diamonds, things low in supply but high demand! The market value of bitcoin has passed $1 trillion.\n\nIn order to ensure that all transactions are valid and not rigged, Bitcoin uses something called Proof of Work (PoW). This method signifies Bitcoin is not only a pioneer in cryptocurrency, but also one of its biggest advocates.\n\nAltcoins are in essence an alternative to Bitcoin. They include a myriad of tokens such as Litecoin, Binance Smart Chain and Ripple. These digital assets are all designed differently and their blockchains are built using various technologies\n\nFor example, Ethereum is famous because the smart contracts platform can also serve special needs.\n\nMany altcoins are either utility tokens or security tokens. Ether (ETH), the token of Ethereum, can be used to pay for a network's transactions. Altcoins also have various ways of agreeing on transactions -- some use Proof of Stake or Proof of Authority instead of the method used by Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin shines as the pioneer digital currency, with a market cap soaring beyond $1 trillion. It captures attention by running on a decentralized blockchain without any central control and caps its supply at 21 million BTC.\n\nIts scarcity is something that separates it from the other currencies mentioned above.\n\nAltcoins stretch the boundaries of blockchain technology with their innovation and experimentation. They're not just one type; they split into various forms like stablecoins or utility tokens, offering specific uses beyond what Bitcoin was made for.\n\nWhile Bitcoin follows the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to confirm transactions, altcoins are trying something new. These alternate algorithms claim to be able to do a better job both quickly and cheaply than the old ruler, which points up entirely distinct ability and function between successors of Bitcoin and their formidable parent.\n\nBitcoin has become popular in many countries around the world. Many big companies accept Bitcoin payment now, and even more will do so in the near future. Its ground-breaking characteristic is that it is not owned by one person or one government.\n\nBut this comes with its own issues. The value of Bitcoin can change very quickly, making it hard to predict its worth from one day to the next. It's not cheap either, with mining Bitcoin taking a lot of energy that many worry has a bigger impact than help for our environment.\n\nSafety is another major concern with bitcoins. Past events such as Mt. Gox's crash and associated problems with The Silk Road portray what a risky game they are. Although transactions are made without names attached, everyone can still see them on the peer-to-peer network. This leaves some privacy worries hanging in the air.\n\nAltcoins present a different side of the crypto market. They stand out by improving on some issues that Bitcoin faces. For starters, they bring better scalability and quicker transaction speeds to the table -- not to mention, they cut down on fees too.\n\nSuch perks make them appealing, especially for real-time transactions.\n\nYet, it's not all smooth sailing with Altcoins. Their lower market caps contribute to less liquidity, making trades a bit harder than with Bitcoin. Plus, choosing from thousands of options can be overwhelming and risky since it's tough figuring out which ones will survive in the long run.\n\nAnd let's not forget their smaller following compared to Bitcoin's massive popularity; this lesser-known status leaves many struggling for attention in a crowded market space.\n\nChoosing to put your money in Bitcoins or Altcoins needs careful thought. Look at the different factors and weigh the risks against possible rewards.\n\nBefore putting money into Bitcoin or Altcoins, think about how the market feels and what investors are doing. It's like understanding a big crowd. Sometimes, everyone rushes in one direction because they're all excited or scared by the same thing.\n\nThis can cause big ups and downs in prices, known as speculative bubbles. Also, pay attention to how easy it is to buy or sell your crypto (liquidity) and whether prices seem fair (market efficiency).\n\nYou should also look at the time of year since crypto markets can go up or down in certain seasons. Knowing about finance helps you make smarter choices. Watching for news on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and media stories is wise too because they often change how people feel about investing.\n\nFor more insight into Bitcoin and popular altcoins, check out Crypto Pie for their detailed market analysis. This valuable information could influence your decision on where to put your money.\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin and altcoins comes with its share of risks and possible rewards. The market for cryptocurrencies is known for its price volatility, meaning the value can go up or down very quickly.\n\nFor example, Bitcoin's market cap has gone over $1 trillion, showing how much it can grow. Yet, no one fully understands how Bitcoin prices are set. This unpredictability adds to the investment risk but also creates chances for high gains.\n\nAltcoins bring new opportunities for innovation but come with lower valuations compared to Bitcoin. Their market sees less activity from investors which could mean both less competition and more risk due to smaller markets.\n\nWith extreme price changes common in cryptocurrency investments, both Bitcoin and Altcoins offer a mix of potential risks and rewards that investors should weigh carefully before diving in.\n\nBitcoin started it all, showing us the power of digital money.

With its daily 200-day moving average breached and RSI plummeting, many are questioning whether digital gold can withstand the upcoming storm. Adding fuel to the fire, the long-anticipated Mt. Gox repayments are set to begin in July, potentially releasing $8.5 billion worth of Bitcoin into an already volatile market. Will Bitcoin find its footing or tumble to new lows? Let's dive into the data and see.\n\nBitcoin currently shows bearish signals, having crossed below its daily 200-day moving average (MA). The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 29.79 also moved below its moving average. The scenario presents a lucrative time to invest, especially considering the historical performance of Bitcoin rebounding from such lows. Despite this, the current market conditions suggest a potential for further decline.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin has crossed below its 200-day MA multiple times in recent history. The last instance was in June 2022, where it stayed below until March 2023, setting a low in November and then starting to move upward. Another instance occurred in August 2023, remaining below until October 2023. These patterns suggest that Bitcoin tends to stay below the 200-day MA during summer and autumn. While not a definitive indicator, this historical context can help create a strategic plan supported by other data points.\n\nIn July, Mt. Gox will start distributing around $8.5 billion worth of Bitcoin to creditors. Although CoinShares suggests this may not have a significant impact on Bitcoin's price, the market may already be feeling some effects. In an aggressive scenario, a potential drop of 19.2% seems plausible. This aligns with our in-house analysis, indicating that Bitcoin's price could drop to a support range between $50,856 and $51,985. This area is a confluence of multiple Fibonacci retracements and represents a macro golden pocket, indicating strong potential support. On a weekly timeframe, the 50-day moving average also aligns with that area.\n\nAnother aspect to consider is that there are no potential support levels until this golden pocket, reinforcing the likelihood that Bitcoin could indeed drop to these levels. However, more data supports this outlook.\n\nFor instance, Glassnode's Sell-Side Risk Ratio provides additional insights into potential volatility. This metric measures realized profit and loss relative to the asset size, indicating market equilibrium or the need for re-equilibration. High values suggest significant profits or losses, often followed by high volatility, while low values suggest market stability. Currently, the Sell-Side Risk Ratio is at historic lows, indicating an equilibrium and hinting at potential volatility ahead.\n\nVolatility expectations are also heightened. The model assessing the 30-day change in realized volatility across various timeframes shows a marked decline, suggesting compression and future heightened volatility.\n\nMoreover, the URPD metric highlights supply concentrations around specific cost-basis clusters. The current spot price is near the lower bound of a significant supply node between $60,000 and the all-time high (ATH), where 2.63 million BTC (13.4% of the circulating supply) is located. This concentration indicates that many investors may be sensitive to price drops below $60,000.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin has fallen below the On-Chain Trader Realized Price, reinforcing the bearish outlook.\n\nDespite significant interest in Bitcoin from big players in the financial industry, including Michael Saylor, and strong demand to invest in Bitcoin at these prices, recent data from CoinGlass shows that Bitcoin ETF inflows have been declining, and outflows have started. This shift indicates that despite the demand, there is an increasing bearish sentiment in the market, even from institutional investors.\n\nConsidering all the factors, it is possible that Bitcoin will remain at lower levels for some time, potentially until September or October.\n\nGiven this outlook, the strategy involves two scenarios. If one finds these prices appealing, the first approach is to dollar-cost average into Bitcoin now and continue to do so if it drops further. Alternatively, one could wait for a potential drop to the $50,000 - $52,000 range to enter a long position. Historically, investing in Bitcoin while it is below the 200-day MA has proven to be a strong long-term decision.", "source": {"uri": "crypto.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "crypto.news"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anna_akopian@crypto.news", "name": "Anna Akopian", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "toghrul_aliyev@crypto.news", "name": "Toghrul Aliyev", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_strength_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Relative strength index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moving average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mt.

At the Bitcoin Prague event in June, Saylor predicted that Bitcoin could eventually hit a value of $8 million per coin.\n\nGiven Bitcoin's current price of roughly $60,000, that would imply a more than 13,000% return on investment. That's equivalent to Bitcoin skyrocketing in price from $450 to $60,000 -- a process that took nearly a decade. As a result, it might be tempting to dismiss this bold $8 million prediction. But there are two very good reasons why Saylor might just be right.\n\nGiven that Bitcoin is a digital currency created by an algorithm, it has some very specific properties that distinguish it from traditional money. For one, it has a finite supply. You can't just print more Bitcoin, the way a cash-strapped government can print dollars. Only 21 million coins can ever exist, and the Bitcoin algorithm carefully controls the overall circulating supply. Moreover, Bitcoin is a completely decentralized currency, meaning that no sovereign power or government can control it.\n\nIt's these properties, says Saylor, that help to make Bitcoin \"perfect money.\" It is anti-inflationary, making it a potential hedge against inflation. It is a superior long-term store of value, making it an alternative to physical gold. And it is resistant to government seizure, making it a potential safe haven asset if you live in a country with an overreaching central authority.\n\nOver time, Saylor suggests that the differences between Bitcoin and traditional currencies will become even starker, and that will lead to capital flowing into assets denominated in Bitcoin rather than dollars. It might also lead to Bitcoin revolutionizing the global financial system, as the world moves to a new Bitcoin standard.\n\nAdmittedly, if you're new to Bitcoin, all of this might sound incredibly optimistic. Indeed, Saylor -- who is arguably the highest-profile Bitcoin bull in the world right now -- is often so relentlessly bullish about the future of Bitcoin that some of his predictions ring hollow.\n\nYet, it's hard to deny that the U.S. government is running unsustainable deficits. By some estimates, the U.S. is adding $1 trillion in new debt every 100 days. At some point, people are going to stop buying U.S. government debt, and that's when the \"Bitcoin is perfect money\" scenario might start to play out.\n\nSaylor is also at the forefront of suggesting that companies add Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury asset. That's the approach pioneered by MicroStrategy, which started an aggressive Bitcoin buying strategy in 2020. Since that time, MicroStrategy has bought so much Bitcoin that it is now the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world -- and it's not a close race. MicroStrategy now holds over 1% of all Bitcoin, worth approximately $15 billion.\n\nAccording to Saylor, holding Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet creates the potential for \"corporate immortality.\" Since the value of Bitcoin will increase in perpetuity, so will the value of a company.\n\nTo illustrate this point, Saylor points to the last 100 years of U.S. economic history. How many companies still exist from 100 years ago? A handful at best. In contrast, the final sliver of the last Bitcoin will be mined in the year 2140, so companies that hold significant amounts of Bitcoin today theoretically have the potential to live for at least 100 years.\n\nOver time, as more companies buy Bitcoin, the higher its price will go, as a result of this new buying pressure. Just keep in mind that, at a certain point, you may have to suspend belief for this scenario to play out. During the last Bitcoin bull market rally, for example, companies like Tesla were lining up to buy Bitcoin. However, that strategy hasn't exactly worked out the way they thought it would, due to Bitcoin's enormous volatility.\n\nObviously, at this point, you've probably realized that Saylor's $8 million price prediction is based more on a macro narrative about where the world is headed, rather than a numbers-driven, analytical model. So it's perfectly plausible that you might decide to pass on Bitcoin as an investment opportunity. Fair enough.\n\nBut, as Saylor warns, \"Everybody gets Bitcoin at the price they deserve.\" Saylor says he first thought about buying Bitcoin in December 2013, when it was trading at $892. But the Bitcoin story just seemed too good to be true. So he waited and waited, and finally bought Bitcoin when it was trading at $9,500. That was the price he deserved.\n\nWhile I remain unconvinced that Bitcoin is about to hit a price of $8 million anytime soon, I am convinced that there appears to be a paradigm shift taking place in the global economic order. For that reason, I'm growing increasingly bullish on Bitcoin's ability to rise in value over the long term.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dominic_basulto@fool.com", "name": "Dominic Basulto", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroStrategy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MicroStrategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decentralization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_of_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Store of value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_financial_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Global financial system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hedge (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/782286/bitcoin-symbol-in-dramatic-lighting.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703812", "eventUri": "eng-9703812", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2013-12-", "textStart": 4403, "textEnd": 4416}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

In case of a breakdown, his chart suggests that the digital gold may lose up to 60% of its value.\n\nRight now, the price of Bitcoin is slightly below the 200 EMA. This level has always been a reliable stopgap for a long-term trend, which makes it significant. Breaking below this mark could signal a more serious bearish trend and significant price drops. The bearish outlook has been reinforced by resistance at the 50 EMA, which is located at $63,634, and the 100 EMA, which is located at $63,315.\n\nWhile the overall trend remains weak, the RSI at 31 indicates that Bitcoin is approaching oversold territory, suggesting a possible short-term recovery. Peter Schiff's analysis of Bitcoin often leans heavily toward bearish extremes despite the fact that it is based on traditional market skepticism.\n\nIf Bitcoin breaks its current support, a prediction of, say, 60% of the value could be considered alarmist. A 60% decline would suggest a drop to roughly $23,000, which might not be consistent with previous price patterns even though further drops are still possible. Despite those drops, Bitcoin has been exhibiting some resilience - but obviously not enough.\n\nAs a result of adoption trends and optimistic investor sentiment, Bitcoin has previously recovered from similar drops. Despite recent drops, institutional interest in Bitcoin has not diminished.\n\nInstitutions continue to support Bitcoin by investing in and developing products linked to the cryptocurrency, indicating their confidence in its long-term potential.

Kennedy, Jr., and Senator Cynthia Lummis, support integrating Bitcoin into national financial strategies.\n\nAmid the massive Bitcoin support extended by former President Donald Trump, there have been talks in Satoshi Street about the chances of making Bitcoin a reserve asset under Trump's Presidency. Bitcoin maxi Max Keiser stated that if this happens, there would be a 'Global Hash Rate' with top economies competing to get a pie of the Bitcoin hash power.\n\nDonald Trump's recent support of Bitcoin highlights the asset class's geopolitical significance while warning that policies against it can benefit China and Russia. Currently, the United States is the largest nation-state holder of Bitcoin giving it an edge over the others. Former President Trump understands this and seeks to capitalize on it.\n\nThese discussions are gaining traction thanks to Bitcoin-friendly leaders. Former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy has been advising Trump on bitcoin since January and proposed backing the dollar with commodities, including bitcoin. Similarly, Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. suggested backing US Treasury bills with assets like gold, silver, platinum, or bitcoin to curb inflation.\n\nAlso Read: Democrat Ro Khanna Seeks to Prevent the Trump Takeover of $2 Trillion Crypto Industry\n\nThe \"Crypto queen\" of Congress, Senator Cynthia Lummis has extended her support for Bitcoin for national finances. After Trump's post, Lummis affirmed her support, calling Bitcoin an \"incredible store of value\" and advocating for diversifying the nation's investments with it.\n\nAlex Thorn, the head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital said that Bitcoin can have an extensive impact on the global financial system. Thus, he sees merit in having Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset for the country. Speaking to Forbes, Thorn said:\n\n\"As a global decentralized commodity money with sound properties, Bitcoin will undoubtedly play a growing role in geopolitics and international trade\".\n\nOver the last decade, the US has built its Bitcoin stack from illicit crossover across the globe. It also has the lion's share in the Bitcoin hash rate, boasts the most network nodes, and also the Bitcoin mindshare of any country in the world. He would probably be the first pro-Bitcoin President if he wins the upcoming US elections.\n\nMax Keiser, a prominent Bitcoin advocate, said that he had already predicted the arrival of the 'Global Hash War' back in 2019 and we could see that becoming a reality very soon. This would be a massive shift from nation-states looking to ban Bitcoin, to actually adopting the asset class.\n\nAs Alex Thorn explained, \"Simple game theory dictates that adoption by one nation necessitates that other nations consider the same, whether friend or foe.\"", "source": {"uri": "coingape.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coingape"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bhushan_akolkar@coingape.com", "name": "Bhushan Akolkar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Ramaswamy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vivek Ramaswamy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Since February 2024, a wallet associated with the German government has held 50,000 BTC and has significantly reduced its holdings in recent months.\n\nGovernments worldwide, including Germany, have confiscated Bitcoin and other digital assets linked to criminal activities and periodically sell these holdings through auctions.

The German government currently holds approximately 40,359 BTC, worth an estimated $2.32 billion.\n\nThe Bitcoin market has also been influenced by other factors, including the recent activity of wallets belonging to the defunct crypto exchange Mt.

For example, analysts at Bernstein, one of America's largest asset managers, projected that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2033. Meanwhile, Bernstein's near-term projection is for Bitcoin to hit $200,000 by 2025.\n\nCardano Price if Bitcoin Hits $500,000 and $1M\n\nNotably, Bitcoin at $500K implies a market cap of at least $9.86 trillion, while $1 million suggests a valuation of about $19.71 trillion. Bitcoin typically controls half the broader market, implying the altcoin market would have a valuation of about $20.\n\nCardano ranks among the top ten assets by market cap. As a result, ADA is expected to be among the top beneficiaries of Bitcoin's $1 million price surge. Moreover, data from the intelligence platform IntoTheBlock suggests that Cardano has an 82% correlation with Bitcoin's price movement.\n\nWith Bitcoin's current market value at $57,216, a surge to $500,000 would represent a 774% increase. Applying a similar growth rate to Cardano would imply a value of $3.28 for ADA, which is close to its 2021 all-time high.\n\nIn other words, while Bitcoin reaching $500,000 would mark unprecedented growth, ADA would merely reclaim its past peak. Meanwhile, ADA could set a new ATH alongside Bitcoin when it advances by 1,647% to $1 million. In particular, a similar growth rate puts ADA's price at $6.56.\n\nWhen consulted, OpenAI's ChatGPT agreed with these price outlooks of Cardano in relation to Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, bullish sentiment within the crypto community suggests that Cardano could be worth more than even $10 by next year, a notably ambitious estimate compared to the projection of only $6.56 by 2033, when Bitcoin is expected to reach $1 million.\n\nIt is worth noting that altcoins like Cardano have a history of outperforming Bitcoin in bull runs. Essentially, Cardano could be worth a lot more by the time Bitcoin attains $500K and $1 million.", "source": {"uri": "thecryptobasic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Crypto Basic - Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, DeFi Topics And News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardano_(blockchain_platform)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cardano (blockchain platform)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asset management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Correlation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Micromarketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Micromarketing", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/By_Ethnic_or_Cultural_Focus", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/By Ethnic or Cultural Focus", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Rankings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Rankings", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://thecryptobasic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Cardano-ADA-New111New111New101.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703812", "eventUri": "eng-9703812", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Gox", "body": "(Bloomberg) -- A third-straight daily slide in Bitcoin took the digital asset close to levels last seen in February amid challenges including US political drama and the potential for disposals by creditors of the failed Mt. Gox exchange.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency fell as much as 2.7% on Thursday before paring some of the drop to trade 1% lower at $58,880 as of 1:30 p.m. in Singapore. Smaller tokens such as Solana and meme-crowd favorite Dogecoin also sank.\n\nInvestors across global markets are gaming out scenarios in case 81-year-old President Joe Biden succumbs to calls to scrap his US reelection bid. One possibility is that a stronger Democratic contender emerges to make life tougher for Republican Donald Trump, whose agenda favors the crypto industry.\n\nMt. Gox's administrators, meanwhile, are returning more than 137,000 Bitcoin to creditors in stages. Traders are uncertain about how much of the $8 billion haul will end up being sold and separately weighing the risk of disposals of seized Bitcoin by the US and German governments.\n\n\"The likelihood of a stronger Democratic candidate replacing Biden who might not be pro-crypto is a factor,\" said Richard Galvin, co-founder of hedge fund Digital Asset Capital Management. \"A bigger reason in the short term for the Bitcoin weakness is the overhang from Mt. Gox, and government selling.\"\n\nStruggling Miners\n\nThe operators of the power-hungry computers that underpin the Bitcoin blockchain are continuing to absorb the financial hit of April's so-called halving, which curbed the new tokens they receive for the work they do. One response from these Bitcoin miners is to sell some of their inventory of tokens.\n\n\"Bitcoin continues to battle with selling pressure from miners,\" wrote Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter.\n\nSentiment can turn quickly in crypto, for instance if weaker US economic data spur bets on looser Federal Reserve monetary policy. Pending approvals for US exchange-traded funds investing in No. 2 token Ether could lift the mood too.\n\nThe interpretation of US political developments may also shift. Bitwise Asset Management Inc. Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan argued that potential turnover at the top of the Democratic ticket is \"more likely than not to settle out in an improved place for crypto.\" He said Washington's attitude to digital assets has improved overall in the past year.\n\nSpeculators are now scouring Bitcoin charts to see if closely-watched technical levels hold or subside. The cryptocurrency just closed below an approximation of its six-month moving average price. Such breaches presage more losses if history is any guide, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\n--With assistance from Mark Cudmore and Sidhartha Shukla.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

A hint at potential financial independence that could be brought by the world's flagship digital currency in the future is also meant in the tweet, it seems.\n\nThe tweet contains a picture of an American flag and a Bitcoin symbol painted on it. Despite the massive Bitcoin sell-off that is taking place this week, MicroStrategy executive chairman Saylor remains optimistic as he continues to apply long-term holding plans to Bitcoin at his company.\n\nMicroStrategy continues to buy BTC quite regularly now, and in June, as reported by U.Today, the company made another move on the market, scooping up 11,931 BTC, paying roughly $786 million for it. The crypto was purchased at an average price of $65,883. The hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars used for this massive Bitcoin acquisition came from the proceeds from the convertible notes sold to investors in June and excess cash, according to Saylor.\n\nSince this week started, the largest cryptocurrency BTC has lost almost 10% of its price, plunging from the $63,630 area to $57,300, where it is changing hands as of this writing. Today's Bitcoin decline alone constitutes more than 5%, and it started with a big red candle on an hourly chart.\n\nMassive sell-off across the cryptocurrency market are taking place as Bitcoin miners are dumping their BTC reserves and freshly mined coins, along with long-term BTC holders, according to data provided by analyst Charles Edwards, founder of the Capriole Investments fund. Edwards stated that it is these sales in particular that continue pushing the Bitcoin price downward.\n\nHowever, Bitcoiner Samson Mow believes that the crypto market will absorb all of these staggering Bitcoin sales.

This comprehensive guide delves into the key factors to consider when choosing a platform for buying and selling Bitcoin, empowering you to make an informed decision.\n\nWhile finding the best Bitcoin exchange with the lowest fees is certainly important, cost is just one piece of the puzzle. Several other factors contribute to a platform's overall quality and suitability for your needs:\n\nNow that you're equipped with a framework for evaluating Bitcoin exchanges, let's explore some of the top contenders vying for the title:\n\nFor investors seeking complete control over their Bitcoin and potentially lower fees, Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) offer a compelling alternative. Unlike centralized exchanges, DEXs operate on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis, eliminating the need for a central authority to hold user funds or facilitate transactions. This translates to greater control for users and potentially lower fees, as there's no intermediary taking a cut. However, DEXs can be more complex to use compared to centralized exchanges. Additionally, they may have lower liquidity, meaning it can be challenging to buy or sell large quantities of Bitcoin at your desired price.\n\nThe best Bitcoin exchange ultimately depends on your individual needs and priorities. Here's a quick breakdown to help you decide:\n\nRemember: Diversification is key! Don't limit yourself to just one platform. Explore multiple exchanges and leverage their unique strengths to optimize your overall Bitcoin trading experience.

He has shared his positive take, continuing his recent narrative about diamond hands adding BTC to their long-term holdings.\n\nNow that Bitcoin continues its aggressive decline and is enclosing on the $57,000 level, Bitcoin maximalist Mow believes that all those who are selling BTC now are just letting cryptocurrency whales buy it.\n\nIn particular, Mow believes, whales from Bitfinex are buying up all the dips at the moment. Today, the world's flagship cryptocurrency extended its plunge, losing 4.46% and falling from roughly $60,380 to $57,650, where it is changing hands as of this writing. Over the weekend, Mow tweeted that he expects the cryptocurrency market to absorb all the current Bitcoin sales, no matter how much BTC will get dumped by \"paper hands.\"\n\nOverall, since Monday, Bitcoin has crashed by 9.52%, declining from the $63,640 zone to the price mark it is currently sitting on (see above).\n\nThis week, the US jobless report came out which was more negative than expected and that contributed to the current Bitcoin price heavy decline since people's purchasing ability has turned out to be pretty low as well. Besides, this week, the German and American governments have been selling large stashes of Bitcoin and Ethereum, sending them to Coinbase, Binance and Bitstamp.\n\nAs the Bitcoin bloodbath continues, Whale Alert has noted an immense amount of BTC exchanging hands between anonymous wallets. Five consecutive transfers, which carried 13,474, 9,445, 9,952, 10,486, and 3,000 Bitcoins. Together these transactions are the equivalent of $2.7 billion in fiat.\n\nEarlier today, Billy Markus, who co-created the largest meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin in 2013, took to his X handle to also make a public statement regarding the current heavy Bitcoin decline.\n\nHe summarized what is going on laconically in just two words. \"Bitcoin dammit,\" Markus wrote in his tweet.\n\nMarkus often shares his opinions on various hot public issues, including crypto in an ironic or playful manner with his 2.1 million followers on the X platform.

On Tuesday, July 2, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell conveyed cautious optimism about recent inflation data but reiterated the need for sustained improvement before considering rate cuts.\n\nThe recent readings suggest the market is back on a disinflationary path, Powell stated, but it needs to see sustained progress towards the 2% target.\n\nThe Fed's primary inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, has shown a decline, rising by 2.6% over the past year, down from about 4% a year ago. However, policymakers believe that inflation will not reach the Fed's 2% target until 2026. This stance signals that interest rates may remain elevated for a prolonged period, potentially reducing liquidity in financial markets.\n\nThis environment is challenging for riskier assets like Bitcoin, which tend to thrive on ample liquidity and investor enthusiasm. With tighter monetary conditions, investors are more likely to favor safer assets such as government bonds, leaving the top coin with less support. The impact of these macroeconomic factors on Bitcoin is profound, as reduced liquidity generally leads to lower demand for high-risk investments.\n\nBitcoin miners are facing increased pressure as operational costs rise. These miners, responsible for verifying transactions and maintaining the blockchain, have been offloading their holdings to cover expenses. This trend of selling has been putting additional downward pressure on BTC prices. As prices drop, more miners are compelled to sell their Bitcoin to maintain profitability, creating a cycle of selling pressure.\n\nInstitutional interest in Bitcoin seemed to have cooled, with inflows into Bitcoin ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) slowing significantly. The initial excitement around these investment vehicles, which allow institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset, has waned. This reflects a more cautious stance from large investors who are wary of the current market conditions.\n\nThe near-term outlook for Bitcoin remains uncertain. Analysts suggest that the price could experience sideways movement, known as \"going nowhere fast,\" or even decline to the $54,000 mark. Investors are closely monitoring the Federal Reserve's actions, hoping for signs of a shift in monetary policy that could provide some relief to the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAt present, investors are focused on defending the $60,000 support level. However, continued selling pressure from miners and other market participants could push Bitcoin's price down further. The market is on edge, waiting to see how these various factors play out and whether Bitcoin can maintain its current levels or face further declines.", "source": {"uri": "bitcoinist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bitcoinist.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blockchain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_bond", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investment fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/a_f3d062.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703812", "eventUri": "eng-9703812", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-02", "textStart": 135, "textEnd": 141}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

This follows the flagship crypto's recent decline below $60,000.\n\nVan de Poppe revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin's CME gap has closed and added that it is time for the crypto token to enjoy a relief bounce from its current price level. From the chart he shared, Bitcoin will reclaim $60,000 as support before moving further to the upside.\n\nRelated Reading: Shiba Inu Starts July On A High Note: Burn Rate Surges 16,854%, Trading Volume Rises 170%\n\nCrypto analyst Mkybull Crypto also confirmed that the CME gap has been filled. Like Van de Poppe's prediction, the analyst expects Bitcoin to reclaim the $60,000 range and possibly continue its upward trend. Mikybull Crypto revealed that Bitcoin has completed its inverse head-and-shoulder pattern on the daily chart. He predicted that the flagship crypto could reach a minimum breakout target of $70,000 when it successfully breaks out above $62,000.\n\nMikybull Crypto also mentioned that the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicator indicates that a bullish cross is imminent for Bitcoin. He noted that this indicates strength for the flagship crypto and that its price is poised to rise. The crypto analyst is also undeterred by Bitcoin's recent underperformance as he is confident that a parabolic rally will soon enough.\n\nContrary to what some might think, he claimed that the cycle top isn't in yet and that this is simply a \"final shakeout\" before the market top is in. Based on the chart he shared, he predicts that Bitcoin will still climb above $100,000 and possibly reach $130,000. The analyst had previously mentioned between $138,000 and $150,000 as \"optimal targets for Bitcoin in this bull run.\"\n\nWith Bitcoin failing to hold above $60,000, the bearish calls are becoming louder in the crypto community. Some predict that the flagship crypto could drop to the $40,000 range soon enough. Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto claimed that \"there is still a lot that must be done\" for Bitcoin to drop that range, suggesting that it is unlikely to happen anytime soon.\n\nHe also provided insights into what will likely happen to Bitcoin at its current price level. According to CrediBULL Crypto, there is a chance that Bitcoin will wick the $58,000 low, hold a higher low above the $56,000 low, and then reverse from there. He further raised the possibility of Bitcoin dropping into the $53,000 demand area if the $56,000 lows are breached.\n\nAdditionally, the crypto analyst mentioned that $40,000 could become possible if Bitcoin fails to hold above $53,000. However, he believes this scenario of Bitcoin dropping to $40,000 is \"the least likely to actually play out.\" He remarked that this isn't something anyone should be placing \"heavy weight on at this time.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsbtc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBTC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_matherson@newsbtc.com", "name": "Scott Matherson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_level", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Price level"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiba_Inu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shiba Inu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading,_Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reading, Berkshire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_divergence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetic divergence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parabola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bull"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bitcoin-gap.jpeg?fit=1792%2C1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703812", "eventUri": "eng-9703812", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Lummis believes Bitcoin is an excellent store of value and advocates for the government to diversify its investments to include the cryptocurrency.\n\nThese days, Cynthia is planning to appear at a major Bitcoin-focused event to share her thoughts on the future of Bitcoin adoption in the US under the new crypto bill.", "source": {"uri": "bitcoinik.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bitcoinik"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Lummis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cynthia Lummis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bitcoinik.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Donald-Trump-1-1.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703812", "eventUri": "eng-9703812", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Bitcoin's value is displaying bearish momentum. Meanwhile, the altcoin market saw a surge in selling, resulting in price corrections of 4-10% among the top ten altcoins. Will Bitcoin's price crash to $50,000? Let's dive into this July 2024 Bitcoin price prediction article for more insights.\n\nAs of today, Bitcoin is priced at $58,504, with a 24-hour trading volume of $110.82 billion and a market cap of $1.15 trillion, commanding a market dominance of 53.02%. The BTC price has fallen by 4.12% in the last 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin hit its peak on March 14, 2024, trading at an all-time high of $73,628. Its lowest price was recorded on July 17, 2010, at just $0.05. Since its all-time high, the lowest it has dropped to is $56,721, while the highest since that cycle low was $71,968. Currently, market sentiment around Bitcoin is bearish, with the Fear & Greed Index reading at 44, indicating fear.\n\nThe circulating supply of Bitcoin stands at 19.70 million BTC out of a maximum supply of 21.00 million BTC. The annual supply inflation rate is currently 1.49%, with 288,478 BTC generated over the past year.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor is set to disclose the most recent unemployment claims, serving as a critical barometer of the country's economic condition. Additionally, the Federal Reserve will publish the FOMC meeting minutes, anticipated to offer valuable insights into the economic projection.\n\nIn light of the forthcoming U.S. general election, the Fed is expected to maintain a dovish position and potentially implement interest rate cuts.\n\nRecently, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced significant volatility in cash flows. After five consecutive days of positive inflows, these ETFs saw a cash outflow of approximately $14 million on Tuesday.\n\nThe impending Mt. Gox distribution and increased sales from the German government have dampened investor enthusiasm, contributing to the decreased demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs and negatively impacting bullish sentiment.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has seen substantial volatility, particularly in Bitcoin's spot ETFs, which recently experienced a $14 million outflow following a streak of positive inflows. Factors such as the impending Mt. Gox distribution and significant sales from the German government have weighed heavily on bullish sentiment, causing fluctuations in demand.\n\nDespite this, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable performance over the past year. Its price has surged by 90%, outperforming 62% of the top 100 crypto assets and even surpassing Ethereum. Additionally, Bitcoin is currently trading above its 200-day simple moving average, indicating a generally upward trend in the long term.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has only seen 14 green days in the last 30 (47%), it is currently trading near its cycle low and is considered oversold, suggesting a potential price rebound. High liquidity, bolstered by a market cap of $1.15 trillion, further supports the argument against a drastic price drop. The yearly inflation rate of 1.49% is relatively modest, with a current circulating supply of 19.70 million BTC out of a maximum of 21.00 million BTC.\n\nGiven the current market conditions and Bitcoin's historical performance, a crash to $50,000 appears unlikely. The cryptocurrency's resilience, evidenced by its substantial yearly gains and outperforming other major assets, combined with its position above the 200-day moving average, suggests stability rather than a severe decline.\n\nHowever, the bearish sentiment reflected in recent cash outflows and the broader economic uncertainty, including potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, could contribute to short-term volatility.", "source": {"uri": "cryptorank.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoRank"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volume (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mt.

In a recent YouTube video, Rover dissected the recent price action, highlighting both bearish indicators and potential bullish triggers that could send Bitcoin soaring.\n\nThe immediate future of Bitcoin appears to hinge on its ability to hold key support levels. Rover pinpointed the $58,000 to $60K mark as a critical zone, with a breach potentially leading to further price decline. However, the analyst isn't throwing in the towel just yet.\n\nHe revealed setting buy orders between $56,000 and $57,000, suggesting a belief in a potential price rebound. This strategy highlights Rover's short-term bullishness, betting on a buying spree should Bitcoin experience a temporary dip.\n\nThe current market sentiment surrounding Bitcoin paints a complex picture. While price action leans bearish, funding rates, which gauge market sentiment towards leveraged positions, remain neutral.\n\nThis lack of strong conviction from bears could be interpreted as a positive sign. However, the situation is further muddied by fluctuations in Bitcoin ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) inflows and outflows. This volatility creates uncertainty, reflecting a cautious market mentality.\n\nAdding another layer to the complexity, current Bitcoin price predictions forecast a significant rise by August 3rd, 2024, with some estimates reaching $80,781. This bullish prediction contradicts the overall bearish sentiment highlighted by the Fear & Greed Index currently at \"Fear\" (44).\n\nMeanwhile, cryptocurrency expert Mikybull said on X that the price of Bitcoin has most likely peaked for this cycle. Conversely, the altcoin market has bottomed out, opening the door for a big altcoin boom.\n\nDespite the mixed signals, Rover identified a potential catalyst for a bullish surge: a short squeeze. This scenario occurs when a large number of short-sellers, who are betting on the price of Bitcoin to fall, are forced to buy back their positions to cover losses if the price starts to rise unexpectedly.\n\nThe analyst believes the current high liquidity in the market, meaning there are ample buyers and sellers readily available, could fuel such a squeeze, propelling Bitcoin significantly higher.\n\nThe coming days and weeks will be crucial for Bitcoin. A break below the key support levels could trigger a wave of selling, while a decisive break above resistance could signal a return to bullish territory.\n\nCrypto Rover's analysis underscores the importance of close observation as July's trading activity unfolds. With a mix of bearish and bullish factors at play, the future direction of Bitcoin remains uncertain, keeping both traders and investors guessing the next development.", "source": {"uri": "newsbtc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBTC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christian_encila@newsbtc.com", "name": "Christian Encila", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_squeeze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Short squeeze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Short (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/a_001911.jpg?fit=929%2C523", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703812", "eventUri": "eng-9703812", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Today, Bitcoin hit a low of $56,770, causing...\n\nWhile growing by 774% to $500K will mark a new history for Bitcoin, Cardano may just be reclaiming its previous peak value if it replicates a similar surge.\n\nToday, Bitcoin hit a low of $56,770, causing significant pressure on major altcoins like Cardano (ADA), which has dropped to $0.3757. Despite this decline, Bitcoin's long-term outlook remains bullish, with industry experts projecting it could reach between $500,000 and $1 million in the coming years.\n\nConsequently, this analysis explores potential valuations for Cardano if Bitcoin achieves these targets.\n\nA December report from Bloomberg cited predictions from industry experts that Bitcoin could surpass $530,000. This projection came as Bitcoin initially reclaimed the $42,000 price point, igniting widespread enthusiasm in the crypto community and marking the onset of this bull market cycle.\n\nMore recently, analysts have set even higher targets for Bitcoin. For example, analysts at Bernstein, one of America's largest asset managers, projected that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2033. Meanwhile, Bernstein's near-term projection is for Bitcoin to hit $200,000 by 2025.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin at $500K implies a market cap of at least $9.86 trillion, while $1 million suggests a valuation of about $19.71 trillion. Bitcoin typically controls half the broader market, implying the altcoin market would have a valuation of about $20.\n\nCardano ranks among the top ten assets by market cap. As a result, ADA is expected to be among the top beneficiaries of Bitcoin's $1 million price surge. Moreover, data from the intelligence platform IntoTheBlock suggests that Cardano has an 82% correlation with Bitcoin's price movement.\n\nWith Bitcoin's current market value at $57,216, a surge to $500,000 would represent a 774% increase. Applying a similar growth rate to Cardano would imply a value of $3.28 for ADA, which is close to its 2021 all-time high.\n\nIn other words, while Bitcoin reaching $500,000 would mark unprecedented growth, ADA would merely reclaim its past peak. Meanwhile, ADA could set a new ATH alongside Bitcoin when it advances by 1,647% to $1 million.

Other altcoins that plummeted included Solana and Dogecoin, the meme-crowd favorite.\n\nSelling pressure intensified as Mt. Gox gradually returned more than 137,000 Bitcoin to creditors. Investors are unsure how much of the $8 billion haul will be sold, and they are also assessing the possibility that the US and other authorities may dispose of Bitcoin that has been seized.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, 100,565 traders were liquidated, with a total liquidation value of $261.98 million. The largest liquidation order, valued at $4 million, was placed on OKX - ETH-USD-SWAP. The value of the worldwide cryptocurrency market has dropped by 3.62% over the past day to $2.17 trillion.\n\nGlobal investors also speculate about potential outcomes if 81-year-old President Joe Biden gives in to pressure to withdraw his candidacy for US reelection.\n\nBitcoin miners show symptoms of capitulation following a poor week for the largest cryptocurrency in the world, typically indicative of a market bottom.\n\nBitcoin is trying to maintain its current $58.8K price. It has been climbing gradually since it hit this level and is now back above the $60,000 mark.\n\nData provider CryptoQuant believes that given the numerous signs suggesting capitulation following a period of intense sell pressure, this will likely occur again shortly.\n\nBoth hash rate and mining revenue by hash (hash price) have significantly decreased this month; the hash rate has decreased by 7.7% since the halving, at a time when the hash price was practically at an all-time low. These decreases are a sign of miner capitulation.\n\nConsequently, the so-called halving that occurred in April, which reduced the number of new tokens that operators receive in exchange for their labor, is still having a negative financial impact on the owners of the power-hungry computers that support the Bitcoin blockchain. Selling some of their token stock is one way that these Bitcoin miners are responding.\n\nAccording to Standard Chartered's forecast, Bitcoin may reach $100,000 by the time of the U.S. presidential election in November and set a record in August. The bank maintains year-end and 2025 predictions of $150,000 and $200,000, respectively, but predicts a Trump victory will drive up the price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe market believes that President Joe Biden's continued participation in the presidential race will increase the likelihood that former President Donald Trump will be elected to a second term, which is the basis for the analyst's forecast. It's conceivable that Bitcoin will reach a new peak in August and reach $100,000 by the day of the US election.\n\nThis is good news for Bitcoin since a Trump victory could result in legislation that benefits the cryptocurrency industry. The British bank thinks that a Trump victory would result in a regulatory framework that encourages the expansion of digital assets.\n\nAdditionally, Standard Chartered released forecasts for other outcomes, such as different presidential elections. According to the bank, the \"least likely\" possibility is for Biden to withdraw from the race before the end of July, in which case Bitcoin might fall to $50,000-$55,000.", "source": {"uri": "nairametrics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nairametrics"}, "authors": [{"uri": "olumide_adesina@nairametrics.com", "name": "Olumide Adesina", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hash function"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solana_(blockchain_platform)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solana (blockchain platform)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogecoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dogecoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mt.

In case of a breakdown, his chart suggests that the digital gold may lose up to 60% of its value.\n\nRight now, the price of Bitcoin is slightly below the 200 EMA. This level has always been a reliable stopgap for a long-term trend, which makes it significant. Breaking below this mark could signal a more serious bearish trend and significant price drops. The bearish outlook has been reinforced by resistance at the 50 EMA, which is located at $63,634, and the 100 EMA, which is located at $63,315.\n\nWhile the overall trend remains weak, the RSI at 31 indicates that Bitcoin is approaching oversold territory, suggesting a possible short-term recovery. Peter Schiff's analysis of Bitcoin often leans heavily toward bearish extremes despite the fact that it is based on traditional market skepticism.\n\nIf Bitcoin breaks its current support, a prediction of, say, 60% of the value could be considered alarmist. A 60% decline would suggest a drop to roughly $23,000, which might not be consistent with previous price patterns even though further drops are still possible. Despite those drops, Bitcoin has been exhibiting some resilience - but obviously not enough.\n\nAs a result of adoption trends and optimistic investor sentiment, Bitcoin has previously recovered from similar drops. Despite recent drops, institutional interest in Bitcoin has not diminished.\n\nInstitutions continue to support Bitcoin by investing in and developing products linked to the cryptocurrency, indicating their confidence in its long-term potential.

This slump is starkly contrasted by the soaring stock market, where indices are hitting all-time highs. What's causing Bitcoin to falter while traditional assets flourish?\n\nSome of the sagging market sentiment was sparked by nearly $9 billion worth of crypto unlocks stemming from infamous crypto exchange Mt. Gox. The exchange's bankruptcy has resulted in significant Bitcoin distributions to creditors. Although these disbursements are executed in batches, the looming threat of large sell-offs creates market anxiety.\n\nThinking Crypto Host Tony Edward emphasized that while this situation adds to the current bearish sentiment, it's crucial to consider broader market dynamics.\n\n\"When in doubt, zoom out,\" he said in a new interview with Coinage. \"If you look at previous cycles, this kind of pullback is not unusual. Bitcoin had an unprecedented run-up before the last halving, driven by massive demand and ETF inflows. A cooldown was inevitable.\"\n\nThe strength of the US dollar is another key factor. A strong dollar typically weighs on Bitcoin, a trend evident in the current market. Tony pointed out that Bitcoin's recent performance aligns with macroeconomic trends.\n\n\"We're on track. This is a healthy consolidation phase, albeit longer than expected. Bitcoin couldn't sustain its previous highs without this pullback,\" he said.\n\nIt's a bit counterintuitive that the 13% retreat over the last month is coming now, when positive news seems abundant: stocks are at all-time highs, the Federal Reserve is adopting a dovish stance on inflation. This typically bullish environment for Bitcoin, paired with potential rate cuts, should theoretically support higher prices.\n\nHowever, Edward explains this contradiction with the lagging effect of macroeconomic changes. \"There's always a delay between positive macroeconomic news and its impact on Bitcoin. The ETF inflows and bullish sentiments will take time to materialize in price movements.\" Over the short-term, he's watching Bitcoin's support level around $58,000, which matches a level flagged by a Glassnode report that note's it's also where short-term holder losses would substantially rise.\n\n\"If Bitcoin breaks below $58,000, it would invalidate many bullish setups and signal a deeper correction.

It has also moved into a technical bear market as it dropped by 20% from its highest level this week.\n\nPeter Schiff, a well-known player in the financial industry and Bitcoin bear continued to warn about Bitcoin. In an X post, he warned that the coin would drop sharply if it lost a crucial support level.\n\nPeter Schiff is one of the most high-profile bears in the market. Over the years, he has recommended investing in gold, which he sees as the best alternative to the US dollar.\n\nBitcoin price chart\n\nThis view is in line with what was reported on Wednesdaywhen the charts identified $56,534 as an important support level. That price is the neckline of the quadruple top pattern at $71,780 and also the 200-day moving average level. Therefore, if this support is broken, there is a likelihood that it will drop to the psychological level at $50,000 followed by $44,000.\n\nBitcoin's sell-off accelerated after on-chain data showed that the German government continues to sell its Bitcoin holdings.\n\nIt transferred 3,000 coins to Bitstamp, Coinbase, and Kraken.

It now holds 40,359 coins valued at over $2.3 billion, which it will likely liquidate.\n\nGermany is not the only entity that is selling its Bitcoins. There are signs that Bitcoin miners have started to capitulate by selling their holdings. Julio Moreno, of CryptoQuant noted that these companies would start to capitulate if Bitcoin faces strong resistance.\n\nThere are also signs that the US government will start selling Bitcoins worth over $9 billion.

Understand the factors driving its price fluctuations\n\nNow we have gone through Bitcoin's fourth halving event, which was followed by Bitcoin's recent and significant rally to a new all-time high, we can analyse, to some extent, some of the patterns and factors contributing to these price movements and assess how the reduction in supply influences market behaviour, investor sentiment and long-term price trends.\n\nPerhaps such rallies could be attributed to some positive regulatory developments in various countries, providing a more favourable environment for cryptocurrency trading and usage. The anticipation of potential approval for spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States has generated excitement among investors, as such approval would likely bring a greater degree of mainstream acceptance and liquidity to the market.\n\nHowever, there are many concerns regarding regulatory scrutiny, market manipulation and the volatility inherent in cryptocurrencies that might affect the approval process and the subsequent performance of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nUnlike equities, which are supported by institutional investments and cushioned against severe volatility, or gold, which is anchored in tangible value and historical stability, Bitcoin's market is more fragmented, and largely driven by retail investors. This makes Bitcoin particularly susceptible to economic stress, as its liquidity is insufficient to manage large, panic-induced flows without causing significant price disruptions.\n\nZachary Michaelson, Snr. Director Digital Assets & Emerging Technology Lead for digital transformation company Publicis Sapient says: \"Bitcoin operates under a cloud of regulatory and legal uncertainty. Any global economic shift hinting at tighter crypto regulations, or legal actions such as criminal enforcement or bankruptcies of major players, can provoke sharp, disproportionate volatility.\n\n\"Traditional assets like gold and stocks, on the other hand, are regulated within well-established frameworks that typically shield them more from uncertainty and exposure to individual bad actors. Economic variables such as inflation or interest rate adjustments influence asset classes differently. Bitcoin's reactions are more erratic, swayed heavily by investor sentiment and speculative trading.\"\n\nStructural breaks in market dynamics, occurring around major global events, lead to shifts in trading behaviours and market perceptions, further influencing Bitcoin's price fluctuations.\n\nThe perceived role of Bitcoin as a diversification tool during market stress affects its volatility, as it attracts attention from fund managers and investors looking to mitigate risks associated with conventional assets.\n\nBehavioural factors, such as the nominal price illusion, also play an important role in the cryptocurrency market. This means that low-priced cryptocurrencies are often more volatile than their high-priced counterparts. Thus, the price level per se also plays a key role in its volatility, pointing to the presence of irrational behaviour in the crypto market.\n\nUntil 2021, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies at large were considered uncorrelated with traditional assets like stocks and bonds.\n\n\"Many research articles were dedicated to the role of Bitcoin as a hedge or a safe haven from a portfolio perspective. Given the absence of correlation, Bitcoin could be valuably used as a diversifier. However, in 2022, the successive interest rate hikes by many central banks and the fall of FTX led to a fall in both the financial markets and cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's sharp decrease (-70%) was comparable to the decrease of the NASDAQ index,\" says Finance Professor Nathalie Janson, NEOMA Business School.\n\nKate Leaman, Chief Market Analyst at AvaTrade, adds: \"Unlike traditional assets, Bitcoin responds to global economic events with a unique sensitivity.\n\n\"For example, when traditional markets face uncertainty, investors might turn to gold as a 'safe haven,' which usually stabilises its price. However, Bitcoin, perceived by some as digital gold, often experiences sharp price movements under the same conditions due to its speculative nature and the diverse sentiments of its global investor base.\"\n\nThe relationship between gold and Bitcoin is also significant since gold is considered a store of value and a safe haven, showing a low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds. Bitcoin and gold have often been compared, with Bitcoin being dubbed \"Gold 2.0.\" The analogy comes from the limited supply in both cases and the fact that they are both costly to produce/extract as they require energy.\n\n\"Regulatory changes affect Bitcoin's volatility significantly,\" says Nathalie. \"For instance, when China decided to forbid any Bitcoin-related activities, including mining, in April 2021, it led to a major drop in Bitcoin price from approximately US$64,000 to US$48,000.\n\n\"This decision was not only negatively affecting the crypto business but also the crypto mining sector and came as a surprise. Conversely, the anticipation of the SEC decision to authorise a spot Bitcoin ETF had a positive impact on Bitcoin price. It started to rise again in October 2023 in the hope of approval and kept increasing until March 2024.\"\n\nJames Sullivan, Group General Counsel and UK General Manager of Bitstamp, adds: \"Regulators play a vital role in investor Bitcoin perception. Crypto is not regulated but regulatory oversight of the sector and market participants positively influences Bitcoin's price by fostering mainstream acceptance and investor confidence.\n\n\"By providing a clear legal framework, regulation that aligns more closely with traditional finance can instil greater confidence in both retail and institutional investors. Regulatory certainty often catalyses greater participation in the market, leading to increased demand and, consequently, upward pressure on prices.\"\n\nWithout the institutional safeguards that traditional securities have, Bitcoin is especially vulnerable to regulatory changes. Recent law changes allowed for the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, leading some to believe that this would result in significant institutional investments. However, it seems that this anticipated institutional demand did not materialise, and the price surge following the launch of Bitcoin ETFs has since diminished.\n\nWhales exert a disproportionate influence on Bitcoin's price due to the concentration of substantial holdings among a few individuals. Their capacity to conduct large trades can cause significant price swings because of the market's relatively low liquidity.\n\nWhether buying or selling, these transactions can set off chain reactions across the market, either driving prices up with large purchases or causing steep drops with significant sell-offs.\n\nTraders closely monitor whale wallet activities for signs of impending large-scale transactions.\n\nThis anticipation or reaction can heighten volatility, as even rumours or perceptions of a whale's potential market moves can lead to notable price fluctuations.\n\nJonathon Hughes, Head of Emerging Tech at MDRx, adds: \"Historically, Bitcoin whales have demonstrated an ability to impact Bitcoin prices. Their network of wallets are constantly tracked, meaning that a movement in any direction can trigger wider participation.\n\n\"Whales are aware of this and influence the market to match their trading strategy, such as short selling, pump & dump, and stop loss hunting. Many big whales are aligned with the core principle of the technology and aid in defending the market position of the asset.\"\n\nDevelopments like the Lightning Network, which facilitates faster and cheaper transactions, aim to improve Bitcoin's functionality for trade. However, while this scalability may enhance its general utility, it does not directly address the core volatility that undermines its utility beyond speculation.\n\nIntroducing smart contract capabilities to Bitcoin could theoretically expand its use cases beyond trading, mirroring efforts seen on platforms like Ethereum.\n\nHowever, increasing Bitcoin's utility through these means would not necessarily quell its price volatility and could even introduce new avenues for speculative behaviour.\n\nZachary Michaelson comments: \"Advances in cryptographic security and wallet technologies can bolster investor confidence and might mitigate the chances of certain types of panic-driven sell-offs. Nevertheless, these measures primarily enhance security rather than directly moderating the wild price swings beyond certain very specific scenarios.\"\n\nWhile there's a trickle of serious institutional capital into Bitcoin, broader institutional engagement remains tepid. The critical factor here isn't just participation but the nature of it -- whether institutions invest for long-term holdings or short-term speculative gains.\n\nInstitutional involvement could either mitigate or exacerbate volatility, depending on the nature of the participation, and right now it seems tilted toward exacerbating volatility, not stabilising the market.\n\nProfessor Samuel Ouzan says: \"The degree of connectedness among cryptocurrencies changes over time and is higher during periods of market uncertainty.\n\n\"Increased connectedness leads to greater volatility spillovers, implying that during turbulent times, the interplay between cryptocurrencies becomes more pronounced, impacting Bitcoin's volatility more significantly. Bitcoin's role as a leader or follower in the cryptocurrency market also affects its volatility.\n\n\"The evolving dynamics of Bitcoin mining also play a crucial role. As block rewards diminish and operational costs escalate, miners might be compelled to sell their holdings to cover expenses, particularly around halving events.\n\n\"This necessity can introduce additional volatility, affecting supply dynamics on exchanges. The decreasing incentive to mine could lead to shifts in the miner population, further impacting Bitcoin's price stability.\"\n\nIf global interest rates remain high and ultimately result in a broad deleveraging event, this evaporation of speculative capital and demand for liquidity could be disastrous to Bitcoin's price and volatility.\n\nUltimately, it is unlikely that Bitcoin will become a \"mature asset\" with moderated volatility and an investment-grade risk profile in the near future. Its speculative nature, driven by investor sentiment and market dynamics, suggests that volatility will remain a core characteristic of Bitcoin for the foreseeable future.\n\nKapil Dhiman, Co-founder & CEO, Quranium says: \"Overall, while Bitcoin will likely remain volatile in the short term, these combined efforts in enhancing regulatory clarity, technological security, and institutional engagement could lead to a more stabilised market in the long run.\n\n\"However, the exact trajectory of Bitcoin's volatility remains uncertain, making continuous monitoring and adaptation essential for stakeholders in the cryptocurrency space.\"", "source": {"uri": "fintechmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "fintechmagazine.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Correlation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_manipulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market manipulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_classes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asset classes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicis", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Publicis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstamp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitstamp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/f8074cd62c7a8c47fe81152c8a540097:de6d7806d3df23cb02f958ea1a499b18/copy-of-bitstamp-james-sullivan2.jpg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703812", "eventUri": "eng-9703812", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

This movement is not just about embracing new technology; it's about reshaping the financial landscape of an entire continent.\n\nFor decades, Africa has faced numerous financial challenges, including limited access to banking services, high remittance fees, and volatile national currencies. However, the rise of Bitcoin offers a beacon of hope. With its decentralized nature, Bitcoin provides an alternative to traditional banking, empowering individuals to take control of their financial destiny.\n\nOver 100 companies across Africa are now building on the Bitcoin network, leveraging its decentralized nature to create innovative solutions tailored to the continent's unique challenges. These companies are harnessing the power of Bitcoin to provide financial services to the unbanked, streamline remittance processes, and foster economic growth.\n\nThe story of Bitcoin in Africa is one of resilience and innovation. Pioneers like Alakanani Itireleng, the founder of the Satoshi Centre in Botswana, and Lorien Gamaroff, the founder of Usizo, are leading the charge. They are not only advocating for the use of Bitcoin but are also educating communities about its potential benefits.\n\nThe rise of Bitcoin in Africa can be attributed to several factors. High mobile phone penetration rates, coupled with the limitations of traditional banking infrastructure, have paved the way for a more inclusive financial system through digital currencies. Moreover, Bitcoin's borderless nature makes it an ideal tool for remittances, which are a vital part of many African economies.\n\nDocumentaries like \"Banking on Africa - The Bitcoin Revolution\" highlight the journeys of African Bitcoin pioneers and their vision for how cryptocurrency can improve the lives of millions. The narrative is clear: Africa is not just participating in the global cryptocurrency movement; it is leading the way with innovation and determination.\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of Bitcoin for Africa is the potential to streamline remittances. With a large diaspora, remittances play a vital role in the continent's economy. Bitcoin can reduce transaction costs and increase the speed of money transfers, making it easier for Africans abroad to support their families back home.\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin is fostering a new wave of financial inclusion. Mobile phone penetration is soaring across the continent, and with it, the opportunity for mobile-based Bitcoin wallets to reach millions of unbanked individuals. This could revolutionize how people save, spend, and invest their money.\n\nThe implications of this revolution are profound. By leveraging cryptocurrency, Africa has the chance to leapfrog traditional economic structures and establish a more equitable financial system. This is not just about technology; it's about providing a pathway to prosperity for millions of people.\n\nAs we look to the future, the Bitcoin revolution in Africa holds the promise of a more inclusive and stable financial ecosystem. It's a testament to the ingenuity and determination of a continent that is ready to embrace change and harness it for the betterment of its people.\n\nThe journey is just beginning, and the world is watching. Africa's Bitcoin revolution could very well be the blueprint for a global shift towards a more decentralized and democratic financial system. The potential is limitless, and the time for Africa to lead the way is now.", "source": {"uri": "tekedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tekedia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_ugbede_godwin@tekedia.com", "name": "Paul Ugbede Godwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remittance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Remittance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Decentralization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockchain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_cost", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transaction cost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_funds_transfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronic funds transfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_wallet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency wallet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://tkcdn.tekedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26141935/coin-BTC-7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703812", "eventUri": "eng-9703812", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Gox Bitcoin Repayments Less Daunting Than Feared, Says CoinShares", "body": "However, the report points out that Bitcoin Cash may suffer for two reasons.\n\nThe infamous Japanese crypto exchange, Mt. Gox is officially set to reward creditors with repayment after suffering a brutal hack in 2011 and collapsing into bankruptcy. However, market insiders declare their concerns as fear of impact on the Bitcoin price escalates.\n\nDigital asset management firm CoinShares has released a comprehensive report investigating the potential impact on the already dwindling broad market price.\n\nAccording to the report, the Japanese trustee acting on behalf of the exchange, Nobuaki Kobayashi, holds around 142,000 Bitcoin (BTC) and the same amount in Bitcoin Cash (BCH). According to records, this amount of Bitcoin was worth $75 million when Mt. Gox was shutting down. Currently, the value has skyrocketed to $8.85 billion, with Bitcoin Cash also valued at $55,250,000.\n\nAt the time of the repayment announcement, creditors were given the option to select between a full cash repayment and full repayment in kind. The latter suggests that creditors get back Bitcoins instead of cash plus cash. In the CoinShares report, most creditors received the rest of their assets in Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash. Also, all creditors have or will receive some amounts in cash.\n\nAs reported by Crypto News Flash earlier, the in-kind repayment was scheduled to begin this month (July). Fascinatingly, the potential impact on the Bitcoin price has forced sellers to exit their positions or liquidate their assets. This is evident in the ongoing broad market bloodbath, which has seen BTC fall by 15% in the last 30 days to trade at $58k.\n\nAccording to the CoinShares report, plenty of data suggests that the Mt. Gox overhang may not be as brutal as expected. The reason indicated stems from the fact that only 75% of creditors took a deal to take an early lump sum of around 90% of the owed amount (in kind). The rest agreed to wait till the end of the civil litigation, which could take a long time to resolve. This implies that the supply to be distributed this month has dropped to 95,000 Bitcoin. It is also known that 20% of the claims are owed to Bitcoinica and MtGox Investment Funds (\"MGIF\"), which also agreed to a 10% discount on their claims. Specifically, 10,000 BTC is owed to Bitcoinica, and 20,000 BTC is owed to MGIF.\n\nAccording to the report, MGIF has publicly stated that it has no plans to sell its BTC holdings. This implies that the 95,000 Bitcoins have been reduced to 75,000 BTC. Exempting Botanica, 65,000 BTC are reportedly owed to individuals.\n\nInterestingly, the distribution would occur on different exchanges at different dates within the month, reducing the possibility of a large concurrent selling. The average daily exchange inflow is 32,000 Bitcoin with records that 100,000 Bitcoin have been sent to exchanges on multiple occasions. On the day of the spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) launch on January 11, just under 150,000 Bitcoin daily inflow was recorded.\n\nAccording to CoinShares, the number of large inflows recorded in the past implies that the market could easily cope with the large volumes if all of these assets were sold in a day. Per the report, liquidations from Grayscale ETF this year have already tested this.", "source": {"uri": "crypto-news-flash.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crypto News Flash"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_kumi@crypto-news-flash.com", "name": "John Kumi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_Cash", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin Cash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mt.

Analyst Josh from Crypto World noted that there's a reversal signal appearing on Bitcoin's chart. He explained that Bitcoin's price is now testing an important support level after facing resistance.\n\nDiscussing the daily Bitcoin chart, Josh shared some good news and highlighted a significant recent change: a pullback and possible bearish trend reversal in the DXY. This shift could signal a bullish trend reversal for Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin was recently testing key support levels between $60,000 and $61,000 after being rejected from resistance around $63,000 to $64,000. Currently, the price has dipped below $60,000.\n\nIn the midst of a short-term bearish trend, the analyst expects Bitcoin to move sideways within the current support and resistance range. He noted that if the price breaks below $60,000, it could further decline towards the next support zone between $56,000 and $58,000. If his predictions hold true, Bitcoin might next revisit the $56,000 level.\n\nTo shift from the current bearish outlook, the analyst emphasized the need for Bitcoin to confirm a breakout above resistance levels. This would require daily candle closes above key thresholds and supporting signals in the DXY. He referenced his previous analysis from about a month ago, which identified a warning signal in the DXY that preceded a potential bearish trend for Bitcoin.\n\nThe analyst also discussed Bitcoin's recent price volatility, noting that it has been particularly pronounced during weekdays, unlike the historically lower volatility seen over weekends.

Also, some other spot Bitcoin ETF issuers were not left out of the outflows. Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF also lost 74 BTC, leaving it with 6804 BTC.

The latest statistics point out that the chief crypto token has seen a decline in terms of the Fear & Greed Index which indicates fear at 44. The price of Bitcoin has reportedly dropped below the $58,500 mark on Coinbase raising several concerns among the crypto community. As per the reports, the wider geopolitical factors including the upcoming elections contribute to the respective scenario.\n\nIn this respect, a well-known crypto analyst on X has offered insights into the present market situation surrounding Bitcoin. Ali pointed out that the prominent cryptocurrency's recent price movement has expressed severity. In this respect, the price of Bitcoin has slumped to a great extent. Nonetheless, the short and long positions' liquidation has not shown any relatively noteworthy change.\n\nHence, shorts and longs have witnessed just $25.4 million as well as $25.4 in liquidations respectively. This is very interesting as the top crypto coin has formerly been going through huge liquidation episodes. The statistics reveal that the liquidations of Bitcoin have exceeded $1 billion in the past. Keeping in view the respective disparity, there are a couple of scenarios, as the analyst proposes.\n\nTrending Now: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Begin July with $129M Inflows\n\nOne situation signifies that the present decline in the price of Bitcoin has not yet been completed, suggesting a further downside. The 2 scenario says that the shorts will go through a decisive liquidation, resulting in a likely short squeeze. The comparatively restricted liquidation operation specifies that the market has not reached the formerly witnessed capitulation and panic levels. This leaves an open possibility concerning additional price action in either direction.\n\nThe crypto experts also speculate about the further requirements concerning Bitcoin. Matthew Dixon, the chief executive officer of Evai (a crypto rating mechanism), has also commented on the current status of BTC. The executive noted that the corrective phase of Bitcoin has not yet finished. The analyst added that a more downward wave is inevitable to fulfill the correction.

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has been trapped in a bloodbath in the past three days led by Bitcoin (BTC), which is attempting to retest the support level of around $56,500. The total crypto market cap slipped around 5 percent in the last 24 hours to hover about $2.25 trillion on Thursday during the early New York session.\n\nAs a result, around $300 million was liquidated from the leveraged crypto trading space, with the majority involving long traders.\n\nAccording to on-chain data analysis provided by Arkham Intelligence, the German government has been on a Bitcoin-selling spree since June 18. Notably, the German government has sent nearly 10k Bitcoins to different exchanges in the past few weeks.\n\nOn Thursday, the German government sent around 3k Bitcoins, worth around $175 million, to different crypto exchanges. As of this report, the German government holds about 40.35k Bitcoins, worth about $2.34 billion, thus qualifying as a whale holder.\n\nBitcoin price has faced immense selling pressure from whale traders attempting to take profits. With more than 16 percent of Bitcoin holders in losses, the selling pressure could continue amid low bullish pessimism.\n\nMoreover, the $9 billion Mt.Gox's Bitcoin distribution that is set to take place beginning this month has increased midterm bearish sentiment.\n\nAs Bitcoin price approaches the crucial support level around $56,500, most analysts believe a general market rebound could occur.

The analyst suggested that things are about to get interesting for the flagship crypto, predicting it could rise to as high as $4.5 million.\n\nWhile highlighting the significance of Bitcoin's fourth halving, Quinten claimed that the \"fireworks\" were just about to begin for Bitcoin. The crypto analyst remarked that BTC was currently at the bottom of the range of a growth pattern, which it could enjoy if this fourth halving were to follow the same growth rate as the previous market cycles.\n\nIf that were to happen, Quinten claims that Bitcoin could be worth between $140,000 and $4.5 million going forward. He noted that this potential move for BTC is starting at the range bottom at $63,000, so he remarked that the fireworks are just about to start for the flagship crypto.\n\nFrom the chart Quinten shared, Bitcoin's impressive growth to $4.5 million isn't expected to happen in this bull run. He predicts that Bitcoin could peak at around $1 million if it were to mirror Bitcoin's trajectory after the first halving. Meanwhile, Bitcoin could eventually rise to $4.5 million in 2028 if it continues to mirror the price action following the first halving.\n\nAdditionally, BTC'S fourth halving mirroring the second or third halving will bring lower price moves for the flagship crypto. Quinten predicts that Bitcoin will rise to as high as $400,000 or $280,000 if it follows the second or third halving, respectively. Meanwhile, based on the second and third halving trajectory, Bitcoin could rise to as high as $1 million or $800,000 by 2028.\n\nBased on recent analyses by different crypto analysts, Bitcoin could resume its upward trend soon enough. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez mentioned that retail investors are returning to the Bitcoin ecosystem, with new Bitcoin addresses hitting a four-month high of 432,026. This could put the flagship crypto in price discovery and lead to a rally as these investors accumulate Bitcoin.\n\nCrypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also recently predicted that BTC is set to rise higher. He claimed that the flagship crypto had completed its inverse head-and-shoulder pattern on the daily and noted that Bitcoin's Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicator suggests an imminent bullish cross, which indicates strength for the flagship crypto.\n\nMeanwhile, Mikybull Crypto revealed that Bitcoin's CME gap has been filled. This is significant as crypto expert Michael van de Poppe predicted that Bitcoin could witness a bounce from its current price levels once the CME gap has been closed.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $60,600, down over 3% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.", "source": {"uri": "newsbtc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBTC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_matherson@newsbtc.com", "name": "Scott Matherson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price discovery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MACD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MACD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bitcoin-fireworks.jpeg?fit=1792%2C1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703812", "eventUri": "eng-9703812", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Smaller tokens such as Solana and meme-crowd favourite Dogecoin also sank.\n\nInvestors across global markets are gaming out scenarios in case 81-year-old President Joe Biden succumbs to calls to scrap his US re-election bid. One possibility is that a stronger Democratic contender emerges to make life tougher for Republican Donald Trump, whose agenda favours the crypto industry.\n\nMt Gox's administrators, meanwhile, are returning more than 137,000 Bitcoin to creditors in stages. Traders are uncertain about how much of the US$8 billion haul will end up being sold and separately weighing the risk of disposals of seized Bitcoin by the US and German governments.\n\n\"The likelihood of a stronger Democratic candidate replacing Biden who might not be pro-crypto is a factor,\" said Richard Galvin, co-founder of hedge fund Digital Asset Capital Management. \"A bigger reason in the short term for the Bitcoin weakness is the overhang from Mt Gox and government selling.\"\n\nThe operators of the power-hungry computers that underpin the Bitcoin blockchain are continuing to absorb the financial hit of April's so-called halving, which curbed the new tokens they receive for the work they do. One response from these Bitcoin miners is to sell some of their inventory of tokens.\n\n\"Bitcoin continues to battle with selling pressure from miners,\" wrote Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter.\n\nSentiment can turn quickly in crypto, for instance, if weaker US economic data spur bets on looser Federal Reserve monetary policy. Pending approvals for US exchange-traded funds investing in No 2 token Ether could lift the mood too.\n\nThe interpretation of US political developments may also shift. Bitwise Asset Management chief investment officer Matt Hougan argued that potential turnover at the top of the Democratic ticket is \"more likely than not to settle out in an improved place for crypto\". He said Washington's attitude to digital assets has improved overall in the past year.\n\nSpeculators are now scouring Bitcoin charts to see if closely-watched technical levels hold or subside.

The stash is estimated to be worth $2.3 billion at today's prices.\n\nThe steady flow of bitcoin to exchanges signals Germany's potential plans to liquidate portions of its reserves. This has sparked fears of impacts on Bitcoin's market price, which dipped below $58,000 this week.\n\nHowever, the amounts transferred so far make up a relatively small share of the BKA's massive Bitcoin trove. After the latest movements, Germany still holds around 40,000 Bitcoin.\n\nThe sales mirror similar transfers by the U.S. government in recent weeks. America also holds Bitcoin confiscated from criminal cases, prompting concerns it may be selling reserves.\n\nThe liquidations come as creditor repayments from Mt. Gox's 2014 collapse appear set to begin in July. The timing threatens to compound selling pressure on Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, proponents argue the amounts equate to a tiny fraction of daily Bitcoin trading volumes.", "source": {"uri": "bitcoinmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bitcoin Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vivek_sen@bitcoinmagazine.com", "name": "Vivek Sen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Criminal_Police_Office_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockchain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kraken (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinbase", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coinbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstamp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitstamp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copyright infringement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mt.

Despite my overall bias for Bitcoin, this prompted my short position to go up. We might have failed breakout levels, but it is too early to conclude.\n\nIt is important to base our trading decisions on charts, patterns, and numbers, not on manipulated interpretations and feelings. Traders must react to the market, acknowledging predictions are wrong because the market is always right.\n\nWe have two major support levels to watch ($57,000 - $58,000). If selling pressure continues and Bitcoin breaks the last line of defense, the next support levels will be significantly lower.\n\nThere's also a suggestion of a bearish flag formation, with the potential outcome matching the size of the pole, aligning with the following support levels at $50,000 - $52,000.\n\nIf Bitcoin breaks through this last defense, be prepared for a significant drop. If this happens, I plan to buy more at these lower levels.

I expect some more consolidation between $60,000 and $70,000 before a fresh rally. It's therefore a good time to look at some of the best crypto stocks to buy.\n\nIt's worth noting that the fed is likely to cut interest rates multiple times in the next 12 to 18 months. Expansionary policies would imply easy money and that's the first catalyst for Bitcoin trending higher. Of course, with limited supply, the blue-chip crypto will trend higher on wider adoption of digital assets.\n\nFurther, the current bull market for cryptocurrencies is far from being over. Peter Brandt is a well-known technical analyst and believes that Bitcoin's ongoing bull market will peak at $200,000. This is likely to translate into multi-bagger returns for some of the best crypto stocks.\n\nLet's therefore discuss three crypto stocks to buy that can surge by 100% in the next 12 months.\n\nThe trend in Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) stock for year-to-date is similar to that of Bitcoin. The crypto trading platform stock has remained sideways in the recent past as Bitcoin consolidates. I see this as a good accumulation opportunity and a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 31x is attractive.\n\nIn the last bull market, the peak euphoria was associated with a surge in trading and speculative activity. That's still to come and will benefit Coinbase, which is among the largest centralized exchanges in the world.\n\nA key difference between the last bull market and now is the company's geographical presence. Earlier, Coinbase was exclusively focused on the U.S. markets. However, with aggressive international expansion, the crypto exchange is present in 38 countries. Therefore, the revenue potential is significantly higher coupled with a bright free cash flow outlook.\n\nI must add here that Coinbase Prime, the company's institutional trading platform, hit all-time highs in trading volume and the number of active clients in Q1 2024. This is another segment that's likely to drive growth as the bull market rages in the coming quarters.\n\nAmong Bitcoin mining stocks, Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) seems massively undervalued. After a correction of 25% in the last 12 months, RIOT stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 13.4x. Considering the growth outlook, the valuation gap is significant.\n\nThe first point to note is that Riot has strong fundamentals. The Bitcoin miner has a zero-debt balance sheet. Further, as of Q1 2024, the company reported a cash buffer (including Bitcoin holdings) of $1.3 billion. This positions Riot to pursue aggressive expansion.\n\nA big expansion is already underway. Riot reported a hash rate capacity of 12.5EH/s as of Q1 2024. The company is targeting to increase capacity to 31.5EH/s by the end of the year. As a low-cost Bitcoin miner, this expansion is likely to translate into robust revenue and EBITDA upside.\n\nFurther, Riot has plans to increase capacity to 100EH/s by 2027. If the execution is good, RIOT stock will likely deliver multi-bagger returns from current levels. For now, I expect a sharp rally as new capacity boosts growth.\n\nAmong fintech stocks to buy, Block (NYSE:SQ) looks attractive. After a big correction, SQ stock has remained sideways in the last 12 months. I believe that a breakout on the upside is impending after this phase of consolidation. My view is underscored by the point that SQ stock trades at an attractive forward P/E ratio of 19x.\n\nOne reason for investors ignoring Block is the impression that the company is significantly focused on Bitcoin and crypto. In the recent shareholder letter, Block clarified that only \"3% of company resources are dedicated to bitcoin-related projects.\" As the adoption of Bitcoin increases and as blockchain technology is used across industries, it's likely that Block will scale up investments towards crypto projects.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Block has been investing 10% of the gross profit from Bitcoin products each month into buying the cryptocurrency. As the value of Bitcoin increases, Block will benefit in the form of higher financial flexibility.\n\nThe company's Cash App has been a success with over 21 million active users buying, selling, or holding Bitcoin. As crypto is increasingly accepted as a payment method, the use of Cash App for Bitcoin transactions will increase and create value.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

While Davis is optimistic, he tempers expectations, highlighting the challenges such a significant move entails. He points out the market turbulence from factors like the U.S. and German governments and Mt. Gox Bitcoin distributions, which could disrupt Bitcoin's price stability.\n\nMarket Sentiment and Predictions\n\nDavis also references Tom Lee from Fundstrat, who predicts Bitcoin could hit $150,000 by the end of 2024. While Davis finds this optimistic, he acknowledges that substantial price movements are possible but reminds viewers of the importance of market inflows, particularly from Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBitcoin ETF Inflows and Market Dynamics\n\nBitcoin ETFs have seen significant inflows, with $130 million recently reported, marking the largest inflow in three weeks. Davis emphasizes the volatility of these products, noting that while they attract both retail and institutional investors, the market's reaction can be unpredictable. He also mentions that the overall inflows into Bitcoin ETFs are around $145 billion, showcasing strong interest despite market fluctuations.\n\nEllthereum and Its Prospects\n\nEthereum is another focus, with Davis discussing its potential to outperform Bitcoin. With the upcoming launch of the first U.S.-listed spot Ethereum ETF, significant institutional demand is anticipated. Davis holds a bullish position on Ethereum, with a personal target sell price of $4,800, based on his analysis of market conditions and Ethereum's broader utility in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nThe Rise of Memecoins\n\nDavis provides an interesting take on the memecoin phenomenon, particularly those based on the Solana network, which have outperformed Ethereum-based memecoins by eight times in the first half of 2024. He discusses the popularity of memecoins and the speculative nature that drives their value, while also warning of the risks involved, including scams and significant price drops.\n\nRegulatory and Market News\n\nIn regulatory news, Davis says a U.S. federal court dismissed several SEC claims against Binance, ruling that crypto tokens are not securities, a win for the broader crypto industry. This decision, Davis thinks, could have positive implications for other crypto projects facing similar regulatory scrutiny.\n\nAdvice for Crypto Investors\n\nDavis shares insights on portfolio management, advising viewers to consider the volatility and risk of holding meme coins and other high-risk assets.

Allied Market Research in a study published on October 24.\n\nAccording to the document, the operational demand for efficiency and transparency in payment systems, together with the growth of data security services and the increase in the demand for remittances in emerging economies are some of the main factors that support the growth of the sector in the coming years.

The Asia-Pacific region is projected to continue to dominate the market through 2031, although the fastest growth is expected to come from North America, with a CAGR of 18.6% over the period.\n\nReferring to the obstacles and challenges in this space, the report acknowledges that high implementation costs and low global awareness of Bitcoin use may hamper the progress of the sector.

I expect some more consolidation between $60,000 and $70,000 before a fresh rally. It's therefore a good time to look at some of the best crypto stocks to buy.\n\nIt's worth noting that the fed is likely to cut interest rates multiple times in the next 12 to 18 months. Expansionary policies would imply easy money and that's the first catalyst for Bitcoin trending higher. Of course, with limited supply, the blue-chip crypto will trend higher on wider adoption of digital assets.\n\nFurther, the current bull market for cryptocurrencies is far from being over. Peter Brandt is a well-known technical analyst and believes that Bitcoin's ongoing bull market will peak at $200,000. This is likely to translate into multi-bagger returns for some of the best crypto stocks.\n\nLet's therefore discuss three crypto stocks to buy that can surge by 100% in the next 12 months.\n\nThe trend in Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) stock for year-to-date is similar to that of Bitcoin. The crypto trading platform stock has remained sideways in the recent past as Bitcoin consolidates. I see this as a good accumulation opportunity and a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 31x is attractive.\n\nIn the last bull market, the peak euphoria was associated with a surge in trading and speculative activity. That's still to come and will benefit Coinbase, which is among the largest centralized exchanges in the world.\n\nA key difference between the last bull market and now is the company's geographical presence. Earlier, Coinbase was exclusively focused on the U.S. markets. However, with aggressive international expansion, the crypto exchange is present in 38 countries. Therefore, the revenue potential is significantly higher coupled with a bright free cash flow outlook.\n\nI must add here that Coinbase Prime, the company's institutional trading platform, hit all-time highs in trading volume and the number of active clients in Q1 2024. This is another segment that's likely to drive growth as the bull market rages in the coming quarters.\n\nAmong Bitcoin mining stocks, Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) seems massively undervalued. After a correction of 25% in the last 12 months, RIOT stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 13.4x. Considering the growth outlook, the valuation gap is significant.\n\nThe first point to note is that Riot has strong fundamentals. The Bitcoin miner has a zero-debt balance sheet. Further, as of Q1 2024, the company reported a cash buffer (including Bitcoin holdings) of $1.3 billion. This positions Riot to pursue aggressive expansion.\n\nA big expansion is already underway. Riot reported a hash rate capacity of 12.5EH/s as of Q1 2024. The company is targeting to increase capacity to 31.5EH/s by the end of the year. As a low-cost Bitcoin miner, this expansion is likely to translate into robust revenue and EBITDA upside.\n\nFurther, Riot has plans to increase capacity to 100EH/s by 2027. If the execution is good, RIOT stock will likely deliver multi-bagger returns from current levels. For now, I expect a sharp rally as new capacity boosts growth.\n\nAmong fintech stocks to buy, Block (NYSE:SQ) looks attractive. After a big correction, SQ stock has remained sideways in the last 12 months. I believe that a breakout on the upside is impending after this phase of consolidation. My view is underscored by the point that SQ stock trades at an attractive forward P/E ratio of 19x.\n\nOne reason for investors ignoring Block is the impression that the company is significantly focused on Bitcoin and crypto. In the recent shareholder letter, Block clarified that only \"3% of company resources are dedicated to bitcoin-related projects.\" As the adoption of Bitcoin increases and as blockchain technology is used across industries, it's likely that Block will scale up investments towards crypto projects.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Block has been investing 10% of the gross profit from Bitcoin products each month into buying the cryptocurrency. As the value of Bitcoin increases, Block will benefit in the form of higher financial flexibility.\n\nThe company's Cash App has been a success with over 21 million active users buying, selling, or holding Bitcoin. As crypto is increasingly accepted as a payment method, the use of Cash App for Bitcoin transactions will increase and create value.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.\n\nJason Lowery, the author of \"SoftWar: A Novel Theory on Power Projection and the National Strategic Significance of Bitcoin,\" revealed at the start of June that members of Donald Trump's campaign administration have contacted him regarding his expertise on Bitcoin.\n\n\"I can confirm that I have been reached out to by folks from Trump's campaign administration about you-know-what. I told them I'm ready and willing to move to DC if called upon.\"\n\nIn his communications, Lowery stressed the importance of Bitcoin for national security and its strategic significance for the US military, particularly in defending and securing cyberspace. He suggested the formation of a \"US Hash Force\" and discussed the potential establishment of a new government agency to oversee Bitcoin-related initiatives.\n\nLowery proposed that agencies such as the Department of Energy (DoE) and the Department of Defense (DoD) would be involved. Specifically, he recommended that either the US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) or the US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) establish a Combined Hash Force Component Command (CHFCC).\n\n\"In my thesis I recommend that either USCYBERCOM or USSTRATCOM should have a Combined Hash Force Component Command (CHFCC) involving FVEYE & NATO countries.\"\n\nThis command would collaborate with FVEYE and NATO countries to counteract similar efforts by Russia and China in the evolving digital warfare landscape, which he terms the \"#Softwar.\"\n\nA few days later, Lowery cryptically announced, \"Let the #softwar begin \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83e\udd8c\n\n\ud83e\udee1\ud83e\udd2b\ud83d\udc4b\" and subsequently declared he would be \"going dark,\" implying a period of reduced public communication or increased secrecy.\n\nLowery emphasized his political neutrality, asserting that he supports any Commander-in-Chief and does not endorse any political party. He clarified that only the Trump campaign had reached out to him.\n\nMore recently, in reply to Dylan LeClair sharing a Forbes article highlighting Trump's discussions on Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, Lowery responded with a suggestive wink emoji, indicating his awareness and possible involvement in these high-level strategic conversations about Bitcoin's future role in national security and economic policy.\n\nIn the article, Sam Lyman, the public policy director at Riot Platforms, discusses the emerging political discourse surrounding Bitcoin as a potential strategic reserve asset. This conversation has been notably propelled by former President Donald Trump's vocal support for Bitcoin on his campaign trail. Trump's comments highlight the geopolitical implications of Bitcoin, suggesting that policies limiting its use would inadvertently benefit adversaries like China and Russia.\n\nLyman comments that Trump is not alone in this stance. Figures such as former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy and Senator Cynthia Lummis have also advocated for the strategic integration of Bitcoin into the US financial system. Ramaswamy has proposed backing the dollar with a basket of commodities, including Bitcoin, to combat inflation, an idea that mirrors a similar proposal by Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nThe article also features insights from Alex Thorn of Galaxy Digital, who highlights the potential for Bitcoin to play a significant role in global finance. Thorn argues that as Bitcoin becomes more integrated into institutional portfolios and corporate balance sheets, it could similarly be adopted by nation-states.\n\nLyman shared commentary from Lummis stating that the United States, currently the largest holder of Bitcoin among nation-states, could further leverage this position by officially recognizing Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Lummis believes that this move could spark a global race among countries to secure Bitcoin, amplifying its role in international trade and geopolitics.\n\nLyman highlights the potential benefits of such a strategy through the success stories of MicroStrategy, a company that revitalized its fortunes by investing heavily in Bitcoin, and El Salvador, which has seen significant returns on its Bitcoin investments since making it legal tender.\n\nUltimately, Lowery's comments that he went \"dark\" a month ago and his recent cryptic response to one post about Bitcoin being considered a reserve asset raise questions about whether Lowery has indeed been in DC discussing Bitcoin with political parties. Further, Lowery had previously deleted any posts related to Bitcoin from his X account within 48 hours. However, these recent posts have remained since June 8.\n\nAccording to Lowery, Bitcoin could reach $1 million per coin as the next step in the SoftWar if and when the US accepts it as a weapons system rather than simply a peer-to-peer currency.", "source": {"uri": "cryptoslate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoSlate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_akiba_wright@cryptoslate.com", "name": "Liam Akiba Wright", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Cyber_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Cyber Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Strategic_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Strategic Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyberspace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neutral country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Lummis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cynthia Lummis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commander-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Ramaswamy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vivek Ramaswamy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_tender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal tender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Bitcoin Core is the software that Bitcoin node operators download to access the Bitcoin blockchain network, validate transactions, and create blocks. It plays a crucial role in securing over $1.1 trillion locked in the Bitcoin network.\n\nContentsWhat Is Happening in the Bitcoin Ecosystem?Details on the Subject What Is Happening in the Bitcoin Ecosystem?\n\nPoinsot said the new policy would allow better communication about the risks of running older versions of Bitcoin Core and provide a standardized disclosure process to incentivize researchers to find and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities: Access NEWSLINKER to get the latest technology news.\n\n\"Presenting security bugs to a broader group of participants can help prevent future bugs.\"\n\nThe new disclosure policy will classify vulnerabilities into four severity levels. The first category, low, includes hard-to-exploit and low-impact bugs like a wallet bug requiring access to the victim's machine. The second category, medium, includes bugs with limited impact, such as local network remote crashes. The last two categories include high-severity bugs with significant impact, while critical severity threatens the integrity of the entire network.\n\nDetails on the Subject\n\nAn example of a critical bug is manipulating Bitcoin Core to inflate Bitcoin's fixed supply limit or commit asset theft. Disclosures of low, medium, and high bugs are targeted for two weeks after the fixed release, while disclosures of critical bugs will be determined case by case.\n\nPoinsot added that the policy would be gradually adopted in the coming months and noted that all vulnerabilities fixed in Bitcoin Core 0.21.0 and earlier versions were disclosed as of July 3, with disclosures for versions 0.22.0 and 0.23.0 to be made later this month and in August. Bitcoin Core version 27.1 is the latest adopted version, and the new policy has received praise from Bitcoin Core developer Eric Voskuil:\n\n\"Many other projects have suffered from this misconception and actually caused material harm to the community.

A proud alumnus of IIJNM, Bengaluru, he spent six years as a Sub-Editor for a leading business magazine, published from Kerala. His interest in futuristic technologies took him to a US-based software company specialising in Web3, Blockchain and AI. This stint inspired him to view the future of journalism through the lens of next generation technologies. Now, he covers the crypto scene for Coinpedia, uncovering a vibrant new world where technology and journalism converge.\n\nThe current price of Bitcoin is $58,854. This means that the largest crypto by market cap has dropped to its lowest point in two months. This is a very serious development when it comes to the crypto market. Let's analyse whether what we see in the Bitcoin market is an isolated incident or a pattern visible in the entire crypto market.\n\nIn the last 30-days, Bitcoin has seen a decline of over 14.7%. Over 3.6% fall has been witnessed in the last 7-days, and nearly 3.6% drop has been noticed in the last 24-hours. In the beginning of the month of July, 2024, the price of BTC was around 62,814. Since then, the price of Bitcoin has been consistently weakening, showing three consecutive red candlesticks. The previous month's peak was nearly $71,100 and the bottom was nearly $60,100. On the last day of June, the Bitcoin market experienced a strong buying pressure, taking the price to a weakly peak of $62,694. The small body of the candlestick representing July 1 indicated the emergence of a strong selling pressure Though that day BTC managed to close in a positive note for buyers, in the subsequent days sellers took control of the market. At present, the price remains at a crucial point - the lowest in the last two months.\n\nIt is important to know whether it is an isolated incident. The best way to understand it is to analyse other prominent cryptocurrencies. Let's consider the case of Etherem and Solana. In the last 30-days, Ethereum has seen a fall of over 14.3%. In the last 7-days, the price has witnessed a drop of 4.7%. Over 4.7% drop has been observed in the last 24-hours. Similarly, Solana has reported a serious drop of over 18.0%. Over 0.6% drop has been recorded in the last 7-days and as high as 9.7% drop has been registered in the last 24-hours. The things are not different in BNB and XRP.\n\nAs per a post published in X by Santiment, many crypto traders bought Bitcoin when it was close to $60,000. Their hope was that the price would go up. Currently, there traders are selling off their coins because the price of BTC is falling.\n\nThere is an assumption that this development may increase the current selling pressure in the Bitcoin market.

It is attributed to the upcoming payment to Gox's creditors.\n\nCreditors are expected to receive 142,000 BTC worth approximately $9 billion starting in July. Lucas explained that the significant retracement in Bitcoin will add \"significant selling pressure\" to the market as it absorbs additional supply. What is the Mt.Gox Incident?\n\nJapanese Cryptocurrency Exchange Mt.Gox, which requested bankruptcy after hackers stole 850 thousand Bitcoins in 2014, could not pay the money of many investors after announcing its bankruptcy.\n\nAs a result of the lawsuits that lasted for about 8 years, it was determined that there was a wallet belonging to the bankrupt exchange, with 200,000 Bitcoins forgotten in it. Now these Bitcoins will be paid back to the victims.\n\nRecently, the German Government has sent the seized Bitcoins to the exchanges to be sold, creating a serious selling pressure in the market.\n\nInvestor uncertainty regarding US inflation and interest rates continues to put pressure on crypto prices.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently stated that although he acknowledged some progress, more work still needs to be done to control inflation.\n\nWhile investors expect two or more interest rate cuts this year, the Fed has signaled there may be only one cut in borrowing costs for the rest of the year. \"This has contributed to risk aversion among investors,\" Lucas added.\n\nAnalysts at QCP Capital and Coinbase have previously stated that Bitcoin could rebound in July, citing the positive seasonality the cryptocurrency has historically experienced.

This sharp contrast with the inflows seen in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has left many investors and analysts pondering the underlying causes and implications.\n\nAccording to data, Ether investment products saw substantial outflows in recent months, marking the highest withdrawal levels since 2022. This trend is particularly noteworthy given the simultaneous inflows into Bitcoin and other digital assets.\n\nJames Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, commented on this trend: \"The outflows from Ether investment products are quite remarkable. While Bitcoin has been attracting significant institutional interest, Ether seems to be losing its appeal among investors for the time being.\"\n\nWhile Ether investment products are seeing large outflows, Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies are experiencing substantial inflows. Analysts attribute this divergence to several factors, including the recent approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the growing institutional interest in BTC.\n\nThe recent Bitcoin halving, which reduced the reward for mining new blocks from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, has also helped boost Bitcoin's attractiveness. As Butterfill noted, \"The halving event has historically led to increased Bitcoin prices, as it reduces the rate of new supply. This, combined with the growing acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs, has made BTC more appealing to institutional investors.\"\n\nThe outflows from Ether (ETH) investment products can be attributed to several factors. One of the primary reasons for this is the increasing regulatory scrutiny faced by Ethereum. As governments and regulatory bodies around the world tighten their grip on cryptocurrencies, Ethereum's unique features, such as its smart contracts and decentralised applications (dApps), have come under greater scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum's ongoing transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, known as Ethereum 2.0, has created uncertainty among investors. While Ethereum 2.0 promises to enhance scalability and reduce energy consumption, the transition period has been marked by delays and technical challenges, causing some investors to lose confidence.\n\nThe contrasting movements in Bitcoin and Ether investment products highlight the divergent narratives surrounding these two leading cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a digital gold and a hedge against inflation, drawing in institutional investors seeking a store of value. The recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs has further legitimised BTC as a mainstream investment asset.\n\nOn the other hand, while still the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, Ether faces a more complex landscape. The regulatory challenges and the transition to Ethereum 2.0 have introduced a level of uncertainty that is not as prevalent with Bitcoin.\n\nDan Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capital, highlighted this dichotomy: \"Bitcoin's simplicity as a store of value and its established market position make it a more straightforward investment for many institutions. Ether, with its broader range of use cases and ongoing evolution, presents both opportunities and risks that investors are currently weighing.\"\n\nDespite the recent outflows, many analysts remain optimistic about Ether's long-term potential. The successful implementation of Ethereum 2.0 is expected to address many of the network's scalability and energy consumption issues. Once these challenges are overcome, Ether could see a resurgence in investor interest.\n\nMoreover, the broader adoption of decentralised finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) continues to drive demand for Ethereum's network capabilities. As these markets mature, Ether's fundamental value proposition may become more compelling to investors.\n\nThe recent outflows from Ether investment products serve as a reminder of the dynamic and evolving nature of the cryptocurrency market. While Bitcoin continues to attract institutional inflows, Ether is navigating a period of regulatory scrutiny and technological transition.\n\nAs the market matures, both BTC and ETH will likely play crucial roles in the future of digital finance.

Top Analyst Weighs In", "body": "Mustafa has been writing about Blockchain and crypto since many years. He has previous trading experience and has been working in the Fintech industry since 2017.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market continues to face turbulence as Bitcoin's price drops by 3.65% intraday and 14.65% over the past month, reaching $58,830 on July 4. Amidst this ongoing decline, prominent crypto analyst Crypto Patel has forecasted an even steeper drop, citing several bearish indicators that suggest Bitcoin could fall as low as $55,000 soon.\n\nIn a recent tweet, renowned crypto analyst Crypto Patel shared his bearish outlook on Bitcoin (BTC). According to Patel, Bitcoin has hit a Break of Structure (BOS) and made a new low, perfectly rejecting the Bearish Order Block (OB). This pattern suggests a potential drop to $55,000 soon.\n\nPatel noted that Bitcoin is currently forming a new OB in the $61,000-$62,000 range. He predicts this could lead to a short-lived pump before the next significant leg down.\n\nHowever, this forecast is based on a technical analysis of Bitcoin's price movement and market structure. Looking at the chart analysis, it seems that Bitcoin could see a drop further ahead to $55,000, potentially even falling to around $53,700.\n\nAdding to the bearish sentiment, Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, has predicted that Bitcoin could decline toward $50,000. Thielen's analysis points to the potential realization of a double-top pattern, where the price reaches two similar peaks with a slight dip in between.\n\nIf the price breaks below the neckline of this pattern, it could fall by an amount equal to the distance between the peaks and the neckline.\n\nOn-chain data provider Santiment reported heavy sell-offs in Bitcoin and altcoins, hitting nearly two-month low levels. Despite the scheduled arrival of spot Ethereum ETFs by July 15, Ethereum prices dropped below $3,200.\n\nSantiment noted that the crypto community sees this situation as a potential buy-the-dip opportunity. However, the firm suggests that investors should wait for the initial wave of enthusiasm to settle before making any new purchases.\n\nAccording to Santiment, the ideal time to buy would be when traders become skeptical and impatient. The recent BTC price drop has led to aggressive liquidations, as many traders had bought the dip when BTC was trading around $60,000.", "source": {"uri": "coinpedia.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coinpedia - Fintech & Cryptocurreny News Media| Crypto Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mustafa_mulla@coinpedia.org", "name": "Mustafa Mulla", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fintech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fintech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockchain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_trading", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Day trading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Technical analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "http://image.coinpedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/27133550/Bitcoin-Price-Forecast-What-to-Expect-in-the-Coming-Months.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703812", "eventUri": "eng-9703812", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 314, "textEnd": 320}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 1830, "textEnd": 1837}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

These included a transfer of 0.0001 BTC to a Bitbank hot wallet and two additional transfers of 0.0001862 BTC and 0.0001 BTC to unmarked addresses.\n\nThese transactions come just as Mt. Gox is preparing to start distributing assets stolen from clients in a 2014 hack later this month.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market reacted with Bitcoin plunging under $58,000, a nearly 5% loss in 24 hours. This price drop pushed BTC to levels not seen since early May.\n\nThe timing of these test transactions adds an intriguing layer to the market's current volatility. Wallets tracked by Arkham revealed that these test transactions totaled approximately $27 worth of BTC.\n\nAfter numerous delays, the repayments will be made in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). This move could potentially increase selling pressure on both markets.\n\nAs Cryptopolitan previously reported, entities holding large amounts of tokens often move small amounts between wallets before executing larger transfers.\n\nBitcoin is currently trading at $57,410.00. The 50-period moving average is positioned below the 200-period moving average, creating a bearish crossover.\n\nThis means that the short-term trend is weaker compared to the long-term trend, a classic sign of continued bearish market.\n\nThe Ichimoku Cloud, a versatile indicator, shows that Bitcoin is trading well below the cloud. This positioning confirms a bearish trend.\n\nAdditionally, the leading span lines (Senkou Span A and Senkou Span B) are declining, providing further resistance above the current price level.\n\nThis suggests that any attempts to move upwards might face huge resistance, keeping the bearish sentiment intact. The double top pattern observed in the recent price action is a strong bearish signal.\n\nThe pattern shows us that Bitcoin has reached a peak twice in succession with a moderate decline between the two peaks. The RVI is currently at 50.85, slightly above the neutral 50 level. This could indicate a minor bullish correction in the very short term.\n\nGiven the combination of bearish indicators, including the bearish crossover of moving averages, the position below the Ichimoku Cloud, the double top pattern, and the overbought Stochastic RSI, Bitcoin is likely to continue its downward trajectory in the short term.", "source": {"uri": "cryptorank.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoRank"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mt.

The first category, low, includes hard-to-exploit and low-impact bugs, such as a wallet bug requiring access to the victim's machine. The second category, medium, includes bugs with limited impact, such as local network remote crashes. The last two categories include high-severity bugs that could have significant impacts, while critical severity threatens the integrity of the entire network.\n\nDetails on the Subject\n\nAn example of a critical bug could be manipulating Bitcoin Core to inflate Bitcoin's fixed supply limit or commit asset theft. Low, medium, and high bugs aim to be disclosed two weeks after the release of a fixed version, while disclosures of critical bugs will be determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\nPoinsot added that the policy would be gradually adopted in the coming months and noted that all vulnerabilities fixed in Bitcoin Core 0.21.0 and earlier versions were disclosed as of July 3, with disclosures for versions 0.22.0 and 0.23.0 expected later this month and in August.

Today that would be the equivalent of $60 to $82 million. Those are super expensive pizzas, right? At the time, however, no one was sure that the price of Bitcoin would grow so large and so fast.\n\nConsidering the price of Bitcoin today, it's clear that the millionaires out there are spending their money on more than just pizza. The question is what?\n\nWell, that's exactly what we're going to explore. What are some of the most popular purchases or investments for crypto millionaires? What do they desire? What else are they doing with the money?\n\nBelieve it or not, some of the crypto-rich are using their digital funds to bankroll their higher-education careers. The price of university -- and even community college -- courses has skyrocketed over the past decade, and that's before including the average cost of supplies, textbooks and more.\n\nIt makes a lot of sense to invest in education, especially since those doing so are really just investing in themselves and their future. There are risks involved, as with most things, but it's important to know that the opportunity is available.\n\nWho can blame anyone for doing this? Graduating with a degree or certification while remaining free from crippling debt is always a plus and gives you a leg up in the modern world. It's definitely a good way to use digital funds.\n\nA running gag in the crypto world is that everyone rich is looking to spend their digital fortunes on \"lambos,\" simply because they're lavish and expensive cars -- also they look fantastic. But joke or not, it's also a reality as many have either paid or plan to pay off expensive vehicles.\n\n35-year old Peter Saddington bought a 2015 Lamborghini Huracan with just 45 Bitcoins. And he's not the only one, because Lambos have become a status symbol for the crypto-rich providing a way for them to show off their fortune in a more tangible form.\n\nEddy Zillan -- hailed as the \"Wolf of Crypto Wall Street\" -- has also purchased numerous expensive vehicles using his digital fortune. Many like him will continue to do so in the near future.\n\nNaturally, one of the first things most people do when they come into money is to pay off their existing home or property or upgrade to a new one. It shouldn't be a surprise then that a lot of crypto millionaires have decided to treat themselves to a wonderful home or piece of land.\n\nIn October 2017, for example, a mansion in Notting Hill was listed for \u00a317 million in Bitcoin, which is about $22 million in USD. The owners said they would only accept the digital currency as payment.\n\nWhile the currency is not as openly used in the real estate market, more and more opportunities are coming available. It's entirely possible we'll see a whole new market powered by digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Ether and more.\n\nWhat better way to invest hard-earned money than into another business that will net you, well, more money? That's exactly the idea behind a lot of investors plans, who aim to increase their fortunes simply by investing in other lucrative businesses and opportunities.\n\nIt makes sense, and nearly every other type of investing incorporates new businesses and startups as a proper revenue stream.\n\nIn Dubai, several apartment buildings have been listed for sale in Bitcoin serving as a lucrative investment. Interestingly, all of the apartment buildings have been sold, meaning an incredible number of Bitcoin holders have already invested in the project.\n\nIt may be difficult to fathom, but cryptocurrency is, after all, just another form of money. While it may not be widely used like fiat currencies, there are still plenty of opportunities to spend and invest it.\n\nFrom vehicles and homes, all the way to groceries and utility bills, there are plenty of ways for crypto-millionaires to spend their digital fortunes.\n\nMore importantly, the number of opportunities continue to grow as the technology and currency become more accepted.", "source": {"uri": "usethebitcoin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UseTheBitcoin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Millionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_college", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Community college"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lamborghini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiat money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mansion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apartment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notting_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Notting Hill"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Notting Hill"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://usethebitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bitcoin-usd-bg-e1543853209569.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703812", "eventUri": "eng-9703812", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-10-", "textStart": 2600, "textEnd": 2612}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Analyst Josh of Crypto World said that at this moment, there's a reversal signal appearing on the Bitcoin chart. Bitcoin's price is currently retesting a critical support level after encountering resistance, he said.\n\nDiscussing the daily Bitcoin chart, he gave a good news and opened up about a significant recent change: a pullback and potential bearish trend reversal in the DXY, which could signal a bullish trend reversal for Bitcoin.\n\nCritical Support Retest: Bitcoin was recently retesting crucial support levels between $60,000 and $61,000 after a recent rejection from resistance around $63,000 to $64,000. However, as of now, the price has dipped below $60k\n\nShort-Term Outlook: Amidst a short-term bearish trend, the analyst anticipated a potential sideways movement within the current support-resistance range. He said that a break below $60,000 could signal further downside towards the next support zone from $56,000 to $58,000.\n\nConfirmation Requirements: To shift from this bearish outlook, the analyst explained the necessity of confirming a breakout above resistance levels through daily candle closes above key thresholds, coupled with corroborating signals in the DXY. He then referenced his earlier analysis from about a month ago, noting a warning signal in DXY that preceded potential bearish trend confirmation for Bitcoin.\n\nHe also discussed recent volatility in Bitcoin's price, particularly during weekdays, contrasting with historically lower volatility over weekends.

Amid this drop, DOGE co-founder Billy Markus has shown frustration with Bitcoin's price plunge.\n\nIn a tweet that caught the attention of crypto enthusiasts and investors alike, Billy Markus, co-founder of the popular meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin, expressed his frustration with Bitcoin.\n\nThe brief message, \"Dammit Bitcoin,\" suggests a level of frustration with the leading cryptocurrency's recent performance and market dynamics.\n\nIt was found that a lot of traders began to buy the dip when the leading bitcoin was approaching the $60,000 level with a large number of long positions being liquidated aggressively as of late. However, the same is happening with Ethereum and Solana.\n\nMarkus's tweet reflects the sentiments of many investors who have been disheartened by Bitcoin's inability to maintain its bullish momentum. The crypto community's reactions to Markus's tweet have been varied.\n\nSome users echoed his frustration, sharing their own experiences of the recent market downturns. Others saw it as a call to remain hopeful and resilient, believing that Bitcoin's long-term potential remains strong despite short-term challenges\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, the chances of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates are decreasing. This is likely one of the reasons behind Bitcoin's sharp drop today. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has warned that we are in a \"critical period\" for the Fed and that current deficit levels are \"unsustainable.\"\n\nThis warning highlights the increasing financial instability impacting the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn addition to Bitcoin's price decline, spot Bitcoin ETFs have shown weakness.

Earlier today, blockchain analyst Lookonchain identified a whale that sold 3,500 BTC for $206 million in five hours through the Binance exchange.\n\nMarkus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, noted that buying activity has dwindled as selling pressures increase. He noted that Bitcoin broke crucial technical and psychological levels at $60,000, a key point for miners and Spot ETF buyers. Notably, this marks the bottom of its three-month trading range.\n\nThielen added:\n\n\"Price declines could accelerate as support gets broken and sellers scramble to find liquidity. Only ill-informed traders are willing to buy here. Breaking this support could cause a sharp decline to the low $50,000s.\"\n\nSome observers attribute the price drop to low market liquidity and concerns over the impending Mt. Gox BTC payout, which will distribute about $9 billion worth of Bitcoin to creditors. Further, crypto exchange BloFin also issued a research note warning of high downside risk for Bitcoin, mainly if an unexpected event occurs.\n\nBitcoin's decline has led to substantial losses for crypto traders speculating on market movements.\n\nAccording to Coinglass data, over 110,000 traders lost about $310 million in the last 24 hours, most of which stemmed from long traders.\n\nBitcoin traders bore the brunt, incurring $94 million in losses -- $82 million from long trades and $12 million from short trades.

This whale has deposited 12,374 ETH to Compound and borrowed $31.4 million in stablecoins. If Ethereum's price drops to $2,984, the whale's long positions will be liquidated.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is trading at $3,124, down from the $3,500 zone earlier this week. This 10.42% decline since Monday has intensified concerns about the whale's potential liquidation. The situation worsened today with a 3.03% drop, followed by a marginal rise and another 3.09% decline.\n\nThe crypto market is seeing significant activity among large holders amid this price downturn. Another whale recently acquired 9,425 ETH worth over $30 million from Binance. This fresh wallet also purchased a variety of other cryptocurrencies, totaling $120 million in altcoins.\n\nThis large acquisition includes BNB, MATIC, LINK, AVAX, and top meme coins like Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, Pepe Coin, and Floki. The ETH purchase was the largest among these transactions. These moves are drawing attention as they occur during substantial market volatility.\n\nEthereum's price drop is closely following Bitcoin's recent decline. Bitcoin has been falling sharply since Monday, driven by sales from major players and miners. Analyst Charles Edwards noted that long-term Bitcoin holders are actively selling their BTC.\n\nGlassnode data shared by Edwards indicates a 374,000 Bitcoin negative flow. This translates to approximately $24 billion worth of Bitcoin being dumped on the market. Additionally, the U.S. and German governments have recently sold significant amounts of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso Read: Dogecoin Whale Bags 90M Tokens Amid Market Crash, What's Next For DOGE?\n\nThe potential liquidation of a giant Ethereum whale could have broader market implications. If Ethereum's price falls to the critical $2,984 level, it may trigger further sell-offs. This could exacerbate the current downtrend and lead to more liquidations.\n\nThe ongoing selling pressure from Bitcoin is also affecting the overall market sentiment. As major holders and governments offload their assets, it creates additional downward pressure. Investors are closely watching these developments to gauge the market's next moves.\n\nMarket analysts are providing varied perspectives on the situation. Some believe the whale's liquidation risk underscores the fragility of highly leveraged positions. They argue that such scenarios highlight the importance of risk management in volatile markets.\n\nOthers are focusing on the broader market dynamics at play. They point to the influence of Bitcoin's performance on Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.

Analyst Predicts $90,000 After $58K Drop", "body": "The recent dip in Bitcoin (BTC) might be a temporary hiccup, according to Lark Davis, a popular crypto analyst. Davis is calling for a significant upswing in Bitcoin's value in the coming weeks, with a target of $90,000 by year's end. This optimistic outlook comes amidst a wave of optimism surrounding institutional investment and the potential arrival of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nDavis believes a surge of institutional money is poised to enter the crypto market, acting as a major catalyst for the predicted rally. He points to Standard Chartered Bank's projection of Bitcoin reaching a staggering $100,000 by August as a sign of growing institutional confidence. While he offers a slightly more conservative prediction of $90,000, his focus lies on the long-term impact of this institutional influx.\n\nThe arrival of Bitcoin ETFs is another factor fueling Davis's bullish sentiment. These investment vehicles would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of directly acquiring and storing the cryptocurrency. Davis argues that the ease of access offered by ETFs could attract a significant amount of new capital, further propelling Bitcoin's price upwards.\n\nDavis's bullish outlook extends beyond Bitcoin, encompassing a significant portion of the altcoin market. He anticipates a substantial influx of capital into Ethereum (ETH) on the heels of upcoming spot ETFs. Solana (SOL) is another coin on Davis's radar, with its position as a leader in blockchain development and market momentum making it a strong contender for growth.\n\nWhile Davis's predictions paint a rosy picture, technical indicators suggest there might be some resistance to overcome before the party starts. The recent price rejection at the $63,956 level and bearish signals from technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggest there could be some short-term headwinds.\n\nHowever, Davis remains optimistic. If Bitcoin can overcome the $72,000 resistance level, a Q4 bull run could be triggered, potentially sending shockwaves through the entire crypto market.\n\nMeanwhile, NewsBTC's analysis of Glassnode's data reveals an increase in BTC's new addresses, potentially indicating a rise in user interest. For the bulls to charge forward, a daily close above the $63,950 resistance level is crucial.

This notable offer is in line with the confiscation of $2.3 billion in BTC from the movie pirate platform Movie2k.to by the German police.\n\nSeized as part of a more general crackdown on unlawful streaming platforms, the Bitcoin in issue was many times connected to different kinds of cybercrime.

A large volume of Bitcoin sold on the open market can cause notable price fluctuations and a possible disturbance of the market.\n\nSun wants to absorb these assets by making a private purchase, therefore avoiding a rapid drop in the market value of Bitcoin. This approach shows a great grasp of market dynamics and the possible consequences of extensive Bitcoin liquidations.\n\nGiven Sun's knowledgeable and forward-looking attitude, blockchain researcher Collin Brown has complimented his action.\n\nMeanwhile, data from CoinMarketCap shows that Bitcoin's price at the time of writing is over $57,336.64. Over the past seven days, BTC has shown a bearish trend, with a drop of 4.93% over the last 24 hours. This recent volatility emphasizes the need of prudent market methods, such Sun's offer, to prevent aggravating price variations.\n\nJustin Sun is not new to the crypto scene in terms of headlines.

This could be related to the cautious optimism that the FOMC minutes released this week showed to the market, signaling a wait-and-see approach from the Fed. Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, added that the NFP numbers coming out tomorrow could lead BTC to stabilize or go for a deeper correction in the worst-case scenario.\n\n\"The cautious tone of the Fed minutes, indicating a wait for more definitive economic data before rate cuts, could help to bring stability to Bitcoin prices or at worst result in a slight decline,\" shared Kooner with Crypto Briefing. \"Investors may also perceive the lack of immediate rate cuts as a sign of sustained economic uncertainty, potentially dampening risk appetite for volatile assets like bitcoin.\"\n\nNotably, the minutes acknowledged that the US economy is slowing and that \"price pressures were diminishing,\" which supports a narrative of moderating inflation. This maintains the Fed's approach of optimism towards a downward trajectory in inflation but without recognizing this as sufficient to justify immediate rate reductions, highlighted Kooner.\n\nFurthermore, the Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) numbers are coming out tomorrow, and the market expects a decline in job growth from 272,000 in May to 200,000 in June. The unemployment rate will stay at 4% if those numbers come true.\n\n\"In terms of labor market health, a reduction in job growth suggests a cooling labor market, aligning with the Fed's observations of slowing economic activity. However, a steady unemployment rate indicates that while job creation is slowing, the overall employment situation remains stable.\"\n\nTherefore, the NFP report leaves the door open for two scenarios. The first is the one where job growth comes weaker than expected, it could increase expectations for future rate cuts, which might bolster Bitcoin prices as investors seek alternative assets in anticipation of a looser monetary policy. Conversely, the second scenario consists of Bitcoin suffering downward pressure if the job market appears more resilient, explained Kooner.\n\n\"In terms of wage growth, with the Fed noting slowing wage growth in the minutes, the NFP report's wage data will be scrutinized. The consensus forecast is for hourly wages to slow down to 0.3 percent in June from 0.4 percent in May. Any significant uptick could put upward pressure on inflation and negatively influence the market's inflation outlook and the Fed's future policy decisions,\" he added.\n\nConsequently, this affects the net flows of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These crypto products might see an uptick if market participants believe that economic uncertainty will drive the Fed towards eventual rate cuts, enhancing the appeal of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge.", "source": {"uri": "cryptobriefing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crypto Briefing"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gino_matos@cryptobriefing.com", "name": "Gino Matos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Frontier_Party_(Japan)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Frontier Party (Japan)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_level", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Price level"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hedge (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/04121934/img-oCJVd3h6Z8vhAl5Wzr6sPadx-800x457.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703812", "eventUri": "eng-9703812", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

This consolidation pattern is part of a distribution phase.\n\n\u2796 Once Bitcoin hits a new low/support, there can be a new consolidation pattern and this pattern becomes part of an accumulation phase.\n\nThe difference between distribution and accumulation is the direction the market takes after the phase is over.\n\nOn this chart we can see a clear breakdown of a long-term consolidation pattern and this confirms the distribution phase. For us there wasn't any doubt we were in distribution due to the new All-Time High.\n\nNow, doubt is doubt and those who want to doubt will always continue to doubt. So even after almost 4 months of Bitcoin peaking and moving lower, some people still think that we are moving toward 100K. Bitcoin is moving lower within a bearish wave. This is a fact.\n\nHow far down Bitcoin goes is yet to be seen.\n\nWe can only make predictions based on the data coming from the chart but the market whales who own the bots and trading algorithms adapt live to everything we do and say. So the bottom is uncertain.\n\nThe good news is that there will be plenty of time and plenty of signals coming from the chart confirming when the low/bottom is in.\n\nThere is an scenario where the bottom/low is only available for a few hours... And that's ok, because if we get this scenario we will still have a \"higher low retest\" and the next wave is going beyond 150,000, likely toward 186,000 or even beyond 200K if money printing gets out of hand.\n\nIt is still too early to consider prices going up... We have to wait for the crash before any bullish growth.\n\nIt is still early... Patience is key.\n\nNamaste.", "source": {"uri": "tradingview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TradingView"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algorithmic trading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet bot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s3.tradingview.com/l/LMAmKrqs_big.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703812", "eventUri": "eng-9703812", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 6, "textEnd": 17}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1}

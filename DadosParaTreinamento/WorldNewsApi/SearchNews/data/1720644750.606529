Taylor, who even hailed our country as the inspiration for some of her music, performed to a crowd of 73,000 people on June 8 - with two more concerts in the capital lined up before heading to Liverpool next week. As the name would suggest, the concert is split up into different 'Eras' with each one representing one of her chart-topping albums. And with each section comes a new costume and stage set-up, making it a real treat for the eyes as well as the ears. So if you missed out on tickets, or you simply want to relive the magic, we've put together some of the best pictures of Taylor and her fans from the Eras Tour night one in Edinburgh. We've also got all the key timings and entrance info you need to know here, and some advice from ScotRail to know if you're planning on getting the train to Murrayfield this weekend.", "summary": "As the Love Story hitmaker prepares to take to the stage at Murrayfield for the second time, here are some snaps from the much-anticipated concert last night.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/gallery/taylor-swift-edinburgh-night-one-32988622", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32988833.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Taylor-Swift-The-Eras-Tour-Edinburgh-Scotland.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:00:15", "author": "Nicola Roy", "authors": ["Nicola Roy"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.872}

The shocking clip \u2014 which does not show the lead-up to the altercation \u2014 captures the man charging toward the 74-year-old, wearing a yarmulke, on Amsterdam Avenue near West 86th Street. The Jewish man tells the aggressor to \u201cget the hell away from me\u201d as a bystander puts his arm out between the pair and tells him to walk away, according to the footage posted on X. But the man, who has a cast on his right hand, walks around the bystander and spits at the older man, the video shows. He continues spitting in the direction of the victim while stepping backward as several witnesses yell at him \u2014 calling the attacker disgusting. The group of New Yorkers surround the alleged antisemite and shout at him to leave while one man places his hand on the victim\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re a loser. Get out of here,\u201d one bystander yells. \u201cGo away. Leave.\u201d \u201cGet out of this neighborhood,\u201d a man shouts. \u201cF\u2013k off,\u201d a woman tells the bigot. \u201cGet out. No one wants you here,\u201d another woman says while walking towards the man. One of the witnesses warns the spitter that he was going to call the police. \u201cFree Palestine,\u201d the attacker responds. \u201cHow [are] you free[ing] Palestine right now? All you\u2019re doing is harassing people,\u201d one of the bystanders replied. The alleged antisemite eventually walks off down Amsterdam Avenue, the video shows. The group \u201cStop Antisemitism,\u201d which shared the video on X, alleged that the man was tearing down posters of kidnapped Israelis before the confrontation. Cops did not confirm that allegation. The NYPD said it received a report for harassment on Monday, stating that the unidentified bigot spit on the 74-year-old at around 4 p.m. Sunday at the Upper West Side intersection. No injuries were reported and no arrests have been made, police added.", "summary": "New Yorkers stepped in to protect the elderly man and shouted down the alleged antisemite.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/17/us-news/bigot-spits-on-jewish-man-in-nyc-shouts-free-palestine-video/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/video-84004599.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/vt2SjrxL-RyIcpnTz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-18 01:04:34", "author": "Allie Griffin", "authors": ["Allie Griffin"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.428}

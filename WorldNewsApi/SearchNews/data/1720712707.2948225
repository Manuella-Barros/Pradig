{"id": 232082960, "title": "AI in Focus: Hot seat", "text": "Hello, fellow humans! This is our last monthly AI-focused special edition of the Daily Brief. We hope you\u2019ve enjoyed them! We\u2019ll see you again on Monday with your regularly scheduled Quartz news. Here\u2019s what you need to know Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday with a special event at its headquarters. Apple is expected to finally give some insight into its guarded AI strategy\u2026 \u2026 which could include ChatGPT in iPhones. Bloomberg reported that Apple is working with OpenAI to bake the chatbot into its operating system. If you can\u2019t beat \u2018em\u2026 But let\u2019s just hope OpenAI has some fixes for recent ChatGPT outages. The chatbot was down for thousands of users multiple times last week. Not down: AI stocks. They boomed last week, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rode the wave. Nvidia and Apple briefly joined the $3 trillion club in market cap, and the indexes reached record highs on Wednesday \u2014 all before Nvidia\u2019s big stock split on Friday. Saudi Arabia is getting into semiconductors. But the kingdom isn\u2019t trying to be Nvidia (yet). It\u2019s focused on attracting firms that can make humble, simple chips. AI takes the antitrust hot seat \u2014 but is that a good thing? The exclusive AI party that OpenAI, Nvidia, and Microsoft have been throwing may be forced to expand its guest list. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have reportedly reached a deal to investigate the three over potentially anti-competitive behavior in the AI space. Experts aren\u2019t entirely convinced that federal regulators have ground to stand on, and if the investigations were to lead to lawsuits, any outcome wouldn\u2019t be a clear cut victory. If the top guns have to divert money to compliance that they would have used to create new AI products, that could open the door to incomers, drive up competition, and drive down prices \u2014 a win for consumers. But if scrutiny is increased across the board, it could hinder startups and innovation. There\u2019s a lot to take in when it comes to AI and antitrust.

I mean, putting five or six world champions together is very dangerous anyway.\u201d \u2014 Nigel Mansell, the 1992 Formula 1 world champion, in an interview with Quartz about the sport\u2019s \u201cfirst-ever real vs. virtual race\u201d in May made possible with AI. Current Williams Racing driver Logan Sargeant raced six AI-generated avatars with the help of a fancy racing helmet that was fitted with an augmented reality visor. We wouldn\u2019t recommend putting six real Formula 1 world champions on a single race track either \u2014 but AI in racing is about so much more than virtual champion races. Other AI reads ?

Ask an AI If you\u2019ve been a steadfast Quartz reader, you\u2019ll know that we value a good haiku. We asked ChatGPT to help us sign off our AI in Focus newsletter in our favorite poetic format. Here\u2019s what it generated: Tech whispers fade out, AI journeys yet to come, Farewell, stay curious. Well first off \u2014 that\u2019s an unforgivable sixth syllable in the final line. But if you can somehow look past that, the sentiment is there. Aw, thanks ChatGPT. Now our turn. We asked former editor and current reader Susan Howson to contribute one final time.

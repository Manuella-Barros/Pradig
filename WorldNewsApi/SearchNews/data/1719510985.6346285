{"id": 223717422, "title": "Harvard graduation ceremony witnesses emphasis on Gaza", "text": "Shruthi Kumar, a graduate of Harvard University, expressed her deep disappointment at the attitude of the university administration, which denied diplomas to some students who showed solidarity with Gaza. Speaking at the university\u2019s graduation ceremony, Kumar went beyond the text she was given and criticized the university administration\u2019s stance on Gaza, Anadolu Agency reports. Kumar, who is of South Asian origin, noted that their messages of freedom of expression and solidarity with Gaza were penalized shortly before graduation, saying: \u201cI am deeply disappointed by the intolerance for freedom of speech and the right to civil disobedience on campus. \u201cThe students had spoken. The faculty had spoken.\u201d \u201cHarvard, do you hear us?\u201d she further said, receiving a standing ovation. In her original speech, which was titled \u201cThe Power of Not Knowing,\u201d Kumar said: \u201cNow, we are in a moment of intense division and disagreement in our community over the events in Gaza. I see pain, uncertainty, and unrest across campus. It\u2019s now, in a moment like this, that the power of \u2018not knowing\u2019 becomes critical.\u201d \u201cMaybe we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be ethnically targeted. Maybe we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to come face to face with violence and death. But, we don\u2019t have to know,\u201d she added. READ: Pro-Palestine students at Harvard say they have reached agreement with Uni administration \u201cSolidarity is not dependent on what we know, because \u2018not knowing\u2019 is an ethical stance. It creates space for empathy, solidarity, and a willingness to listen,\u201d she said. Harvard was among the many universities that witnessed pro-Palestine demonstrations. Pro-Palestinian students who set up a camp on the campus of Harvard University in the US state of Massachusetts in response to Israel\u2019s attacks continued their solidarity camp with Gaza for more than three weeks. At least 20 students who supported the Gaza solidarity camp were suspended by the Harvard administration and more than 60 students were disciplined. The Harvard administration announced that it would not give diplomas to 13 students who took part in pro-Palestine demonstrations. Over 35,900 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, the vast majority being women and children, and over 80,600 others injured since October following an attack by Hamas. More than seven months into the conflict, vast swathes of Gaza lay in ruins amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water and medicine. Israel is accused of \u201cgenocide\u201d at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which in its latest ruling has ordered Tel Aviv to immediately halt its operation in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza where more than a million displaced Palestinians had sought refuge.

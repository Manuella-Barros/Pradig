{"id": 225044234, "title": "How votes of fed-up Tories are set to win election for Starmer", "text": "If Labour wins most votes on 4 July, nearly half of its winning margin will come from people who agree with the Tories but are backing Sir Keir Starmer because they have \u201cgiven up\u201d on Rishi Sunak. That is the finding of a \u201cRed Votes, Blue Values\u201d survey which appears to reveal a new election trend. According to the JL Partners survey for The Independent, 40 per cent of Labour\u2019s current substantial lead in the polls is from people with small \u2018c\u2019 conservative views. The poll shows a huge chunk of the electorate is instinctively in tune with traditional Tory thinking on a wide range of key policies and topics from immigration, law and order, public spending and tax to being pro-business, \u201canti-woke\u201d and patriotic. But in spite of this, they are switching to Labour because they have \u201clost faith\u201d in Mr Sunak. The dramatic findings reflect a mirror image of the so called \u201dRed Wall\u201d effect in the last election. On that occasion, the Tories were swept to power aided by voters in working-class seats in the North who abandoned Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s left-wing Labour Party. This time it appears the opposite is happening: traditional Conservative supporters are abandoning the party of Sunak, Johnson and Truss in favour of Starmer, who has ditched Labour\u2019s left-wing baggage. Callum Hunter, of JL Partners, says: \u201cKeir Starmer\u2019s road to Downing Street hinges on \u2018Blue Labour\u2019 voters. \u201cThe public are closer to the Conservatives in attitudes towards policy than Labour, but they are backing Starmer anyway \u2013 Labour is ahead by converting voters of what is still a fundamentally conservative Britain. The Tories face an electorate that \u2018agrees with them but has given up on them\u2019.\u201d According to the poll, the average Briton tends to lean to the right socially and economically. Mr Hunter said: \u201cIt puts them closer to what they perceive as the Conservative Party on 11 of 19 key issues, from Rwanda to the economy to crime. \u201cWhilst the general voter is closer to the Conservatives on the policies themselves, they have lost faith in Rishi Sunak\u2019s leadership and the Tories\u2019 ability to handle these issues. \u201cForty per cent of Labour\u2019s lead comes from voters who take a more economically and socially conservative view. They tend to think that political correctness has gone too far, are supportive of the Rwanda plan, want a tougher stance on crime and are proud of the UK. \u201cThe electorate is still quite conservative, with a small \u2018c\u2019, but they have abandoned the Conservative Party in their droves. The Tories are facing an electorate that agrees with them, but has given up on them.\u201d However, Mr Hunter said there could be a sting in the tail for Starmer from his army of small \u201cc\u201d conservative recruits if the Tory Party revives after the election. \u201cGoing into this election, and beyond, he needs to worry more about these voters than any other group. \u201cA post-election Conservative Party resurgence could see this group fall away. Right now, Starmer leads on leadership attributes, and the salient issues like the NHS are ones that Labour own, but there are fundamental policy disagreements between Labour and the electorate. It will be tough to reconcile these two positions if they get into government.\u201d JL Partners interviewed 2,001 adults online from 2-4 May", "summary": "<p><strong>Exclusive: </strong>Small \u2018c\u2019 conservative voters are switching to Labour in huge numbers according to a new survey for The Independent</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/general-election-polls-sunak-starmer-tory-b2553257.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/29/10/8d93aaa0f403d041039288c9d1c4c6fcY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE3MDYxNTg3-2.74955114.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/yzxgDrC2-4VHSaSK0.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:03:08", "author": "Simon Walters", "authors": ["Simon Walters"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.083}

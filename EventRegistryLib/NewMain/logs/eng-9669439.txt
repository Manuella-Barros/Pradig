The State is requesting all parts of Individual Assistance, including Housing Assistance, Disaster Case Management, Transitional Sheltering Assistance, Serious Needs Assistance, Crisis Counseling, and Displacement Assistance. Additionally, the State is requesting Hazard Mitigation statewide.

Serious drought and windy conditions continue to make fire response challenging and the fires are threatening multiple populated areas. Fourteen shelters are currently supporting evacuees and there have been two confirmed fatalities since the disaster began. Federal assistance is of utmost urgency.\n\nDue to the life and death nature of this crisis, we urge you to act without delay and approve the State of New Mexico's request for a major disaster declaration.

{"id": 225023272, "title": "Anna Haugh: 'When I started, I was told, 'women can't cook''", "text": "Not many people walk into an empty pub kitchen and think, \u201cI belong here.\u201d But not many people are like Anna Haugh. \u201cThere was no reason for it to feel right, but it just did. It felt like a real Eureka moment,\u201d she says, of the moment she first realised she wanted to cook. Twenty-five years on and a few miles across the Irish Sea, we\u2019re sitting in the MasterChef judge and Saturday Kitchen regular\u2019s Chelsea-based restaurant, Myrtle, on the publication day of her debut cookbook, Cooking With Anna. Today, though, her mind is on a life in restaurants \u2014 and its highs and lows, particularly as a woman. Owning her own modern Irish establishment is a far cry from what Haugh had envisioned for herself when working at fine dining establishments like Phil Howard\u2019s the Square and Shane Osborn\u2019s version of Pied \u00e0 Terre. \u201cI never even imagined being a head chef, I just couldn\u2019t,\u201d she says, as staff reset tables after a busy lunch service. \u201cI was always afraid to imagine anything too big [for myself] because I had to be realistic. There aren\u2019t as many success stories of women, I wasn\u2019t seeing myself reflected.\u201d Haugh\u2019s insecurity wasn\u2019t ingrained, however. It was learnt, despite being surrounded by women early on in her career at L\u2019Ecrivain, one of Dublin\u2019s best restaurants. \u201cWhen I was hired to work in the kitchen \u2014 which was a big deal, because back then it wasn\u2019t like everybody was screaming out for chefs \u2014 I was very excited because there were so many women, it was really amazing. You had men and women of all ranks, so there was never, ever a question about gender.\u201d Young and naive to the broader industry, Haugh says she \u201cthought that was what the workplace looked like. I was still quite young. I thought, \u2018This is what it is to be working in a kitchen.\u2019\u201d Sadly, that was not so. Moving to London for a role at Pied \u00e0 Terre in the early Noughties changed her perspective in an instant. While Haugh says \u201cmy gender wasn\u2019t an issue,\u201d with Osborn, her relationship \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 with other, less senior members of the brigade was different. \u201cI was like a dancing monkey because there were no other women and I kept trying to fit in. They were like, \u2018Women can\u2019t cook,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018I think you\u2019ll find if you go to Ireland, there\u2019s a kitchen full of them!\u2019\u201dshe laughs. \u201cIt was a bit of a culture shock and it was sad because I was very sociable. I think that was the hardest part, missing feeling like you\u2019re a part of the gang, the camaraderie.\u201d Slowly she won the men around: \u201cAs time went on, you break them down and they see the human side of you.\u201d But sexism wasn\u2019t the only issue. For everyone, she says, \u201cthe environments were extremely stressful\u201d. Back then, she says, the industry wasn\u2019t necessarily recruiting those who had chosen the kitchen as a dedicated career. \u201c[People] didn\u2019t really have anything else to do with themselves. They burned a lot of bridges and they were like, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll go into this job.\u2019 There were a lot of old-fashioned concepts and ideas. The internet was still quite new, and the pressure that was on the chefs was unnecessary. Kitchens were full of superstitions, and there were many bad decisions made.\u201d What kind of thing? \u201cThere weren\u2019t a lot of boundaries set for the senior chef.\u201d In an attempt to juggle the many facets of a restaurant \u2014 from finances to press, plating and customers \u2014 if the smallest thing went awry, it was likely the kitchen\u2019s leader would lose their temper and \u201close control\u201d, Haugh continues. \u201cIn my opinion, that\u2019s losing yourself and losing respect.\u201d Now that she\u2019s a mother, this behaviour, she says, reminds her of that of her two-and-a-half-year-old son. \u201cIf he was trying to lick the charger of my partner\u2019s laptop and I said no, he would go bananas. That\u2019s what two-and-a-half-year-olds do because they don\u2019t know how to calibrate themselves and they don\u2019t know how to communicate. \u201cI think that\u2019s what I witnessed in the kitchens \u2014 chefs who needed to calibrate, and chefs who needed to communicate better and understand that mistakes are just part of the journey.\u201d From the most senior members of the teams Haugh worked within, \u201cthere was a lot of this, like, \u2018I rule with an iron fist\u2019 attitude.\u201d Implementing a severe, military-style approach to managing a kitchen was not uncommon. \u201cOne of the sentences I hated the most was \u2018Break them down and build them back up again,\u2019\u201d says Haugh. Such ill-treatment pushed many into dark places, she says. \u201cAs they broke people down, lots of them disappeared. Lots of chefs went missing \u2014 fell into drink and drugs and loneliness and depression. So fine, you build up a handful of the strong ones who are able to go through this type of process. And that always made me so sad. Those guys would always be nice guys, but they were like, \u2018See you later,\u2019 and then they\u2019d never come back. They could leave all of their knives, their clothes, they\u2019d leave their bag. You knew that at the end of their break they\u2019d go, \u2018I just can\u2019t go back there.\u201d\u2019 Haugh says the culture began to change when the odd newcomer would introduce structure to the kitchen. \u201cThings started to improve when you\u2019d get a person coming in who was a bit older, passionate, and had a good bit of skill. They started to introduce the concept of creating boundaries.\u201d Something as simple as over-ordering ingredients could change everything, she says. \u201cThere was one guy that came to Pied, I remember him talking about how we do the orders and how to create a system. He said, \u2018Obviously, if you\u2019ve got extra, there\u2019s a possibility of waste. But if you get the small one, you\u2019re going to run out, and then the chef is going to get angry.\u2019 \u201cIf the chef is in charge of ordering, training, cooking, speaking to customers, and writing the menus, there is this feeling that \u2018nobody else is any good. I am everything.\u2019 But if somebody comes in and goes, \u2018I\u2019ll take that off you. I can make this a little bit easier\u2026\u2019 That\u2019s what started to happen, as opposed to having people [in the kitchen] who are like, \u2018Yes, yes, yes, yes\u2019 all the time.\u201d Regardless, Haugh says her time in those kitchens was invaluable. \u201cOf all the chefs I\u2019ve ever worked for, I\u2019d say Shane is probably the one who shaped me the most \u2014 I learnt so much from his ability to do mise en place, his ability to understand time. He\u2019s a very, very bright person. The kitchen was pretty stressful, but I just thought [working there] was incredible.\u201d Likewise, \u201cthe Square was amazing\u201d. \u201cAt the time when I worked in the Square it was a new concept to cook in season, which seems hilarious now. Really, I was so lucky. It\u2019s a big part of how I understand seasons, because it was done in a way that it emotionally connected with me rather than memorising months and vegetables and fruits. There was a feeling that Philip Howard was trying to teach us about food, which was remarkable. He would talk about the chemical reaction of food cooked at the right time. I was so lucky to work with somebody who wanted to do things so differently.\u201d Still, it was only once she began her 10-year stint working with Gordon Ramsay a decade and a half ago \u2014 opening the late London House and other concepts in LA and Las Vegas \u2014 that Haugh saw bigger things for herself. \u201cWorking with Gordon really made me think I could open up my own restaurant because he believed in me, encouraged me, and complimented me so much. Was he the person the world saw on Hell\u2019s Kitchen? \u201cIf you had a camera on me inside of the kitchen, I think sometimes you might be a bit like, \u2018Where has the nice Anna gone?\u2019 You know, nobody\u2019s perfect. I can\u2019t speak for Gordon about his past or about other experiences. But for me, as an employee, what I witnessed was always very respectful. He would walk in and he would always shake hands with the kitchen porter. I think that people can pretend for a while but a mask slips. Do you know what I mean? He was always consistently respectful. Yes, he was demanding and everything had to be very quick. You had to be ready every time. But what\u2019s wrong with that? He\u2019s busy.\u201d But even with her Ramsay-instilled confidence, opening Myrtle was a struggle. \u201cEverybody was like, \u2018I don\u2019t think this is a good idea.\u2019 They were like, \u2018fine dining Irish?! Give me an example of another one.\u2019 \u201cIt was really hard because my self- esteem and my confidence sits on what I do in the kitchen.\u201d Nevertheless, the restaurant, which opened its doors five years ago with unfinished bathrooms and Ikea plates is a success by anyone\u2019s standards. Despite being situated on a quiet residential street, it\u2019s regularly fully booked \u2014 and it\u2019s her own brand of \u2018fine dining Irish\u2019 that has made it so. \u201cI had no idea how brilliant it would become. It surpassed all of my hopes and dreams, and I feel it\u2019s still at the beginning.\u201d Her focus now? There\u2019s the book, and a wine bar in the works. Otherwise? \u201cTo help people understand that cooking homemade food with homemade ingredients is so wonderful and so satisfying with my book.\u201d And as for being in the professional kitchen? \u201cI want to be a chef until I drop dead.\u201d Myrtle, 1A Langton Street, SW10 0JL, myrtlerestaurant.com", "summary": "<p>MasterChef judge Anna Haugh might be one of London\u2019s leading chefs, but it\u2019s not been an easy ride.

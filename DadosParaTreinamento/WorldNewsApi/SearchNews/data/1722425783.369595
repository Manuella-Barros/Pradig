After nearly a decade of faltering in major tournaments, Germany made a good start in the group stage with two victories over Scotland (5-1) and Hungary (2-0), but in the third they almost lost the top spot in their first group, before they were saved by a goal from the unknown striker Niklas A few years ago. Volkrug in the killer time and gives it a draw point against Switzerland. This was an alarm bell for the Germans dreaming of a fourth continental title, and the first since 1996, breaking up the partnership with Spain. Julian Nagelsmann\u2019s side have a more established history than their northern neighbours, but memories of the 1992 final still linger for many. After obtaining a last-minute invitation card following the exclusion of Yugoslavia, the Danish \u201cDynamite\u201d achieved a resounding surprise, winning the title at the expense of Germany 2-0 in Sweden. The then German coach Berti Vogts admitted in his column in the RB newspaper the day before yesterday that his team had \u201cunderestimated\u201d the Danes, saying: \u201cIn 1992 we lost the final to a big Danish team despite being favourites at the time, just like the German team now.\u201d He continued: \u201cEveryone believed that the title was in our pocket, and unfortunately some players shared this opinion.\u201d Vogts said Denmark\u2019s current form may not be as good as it was in 1992, but the pressure is on the Germans: \u201cDenmark were hungry for success and didn\u2019t feel pressure. They played football and we were surprised by their style, but also because we underestimated them.\u201d It is true that Germany won only three times in 11 matches in 2023, but it has not lost yet in 2024, winning five times and drawing twice, while Nagelsmann intends to stick to his starting lineup. This policy may have given Germany stability, but it cost it the loss of defender Jonathan Tah, who will miss the confrontation due to suspension, and Borussia Dortmund defender, Niko Schlotterbeck, may replace him. Antonio Rudiger is in doubt due to a thigh muscle injury. In contrast, Denmark, led by Christian Eriksen, qualified with three draws and finished second in their group on fair play behind Slovenia. The winner of this match will meet the winner between Spain and Georgia. The last 16 will kick off in the capital, Berlin, with Italy, who qualified with difficulty under coach Spalletti, facing their neighbor Switzerland. The Azzurri needed the eighth minute of stoppage time from the relatively unknown Mattia Zaccanje to equalize Croatia, and finish runner-up in the second group, five points behind Spain. Compared to the last edition, when Italy beat Switzerland 3-0 in the group stage, the scorers of the three goals in that match, Manuel Locatelli and Ciro Immobile, were excluded, in addition to midfielder Marco Verratti. Veteran defenders Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci have retired, while Juventus striker Federico Chiesa is still far from his best. On the other hand, coach Murat Yakin\u2019s squad includes several professionals in the Italian League, including Serie A champion Inter goalkeeper Yann Sommer, and Bologna trio Dan Ndoye, Remo Freuler and Michel Abisher. Switzerland is competing in the knockout rounds for the sixth time in a row in a major tournament, noting that it eliminated France on penalties in the last edition before being eliminated in the same scenario against Spain in the quarter-finals. Italy will be without defender Riccardo Calafiori through suspension, but Zaccagni said he was fit despite suffering a rib injury under a crowd of players celebrating his late goal against Croatia. It remains to be seen what else Spalletti will feature in his squad, with defensive midfielder Jorginho struggling to convince striker Matteo Retegui against Croatia, as was the case with fellow striker Gianluca Scamacca at the start of the tournament. The winner of this match will meet the winner between England and Slovakia.", "summary": "<p>Germany play Denmark in the last 16 of the European Championship today in Dortmund, hoping to learn from their recent draw with Switzerland, who face a tough match against defending champions Italy in Berlin.

And someday, these tests may have important benefits. But before you run to your doctor demanding a blood draw, keep in mind that this test has important limitations.\n\nMuch of the buzz is over new research by Sebastian Palmqvist (paywall) of Lund University in Sweden and co-authors. It was based on a relatively small sample of about 1200 patients in that country. It looked at only one Alzheimer's blood test, called PrecivityAD2, among many possible alternatives. It excluded patients already diagnosed with other forms of cognitive disease. And because it used a small sample in Sweden, it could not show how the tests fared with population subgroups, such as Black or Hispanic patients.\n\nWithin those limitations, the paper found this blood test was highly accurate. Yet, the test may be valuable to real-world patients in only a relatively narrow window of the progression of Alzheimer's. And it may have only limited practical benefit since potential treatments for Alzheimer's remain controversial at best. The paper was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).\n\nA Breakthrough With Limited Practical Benefits\n\nLike all tests for Alzheimer's disease, these blood tests do not show the disease itself. They are not, for example, comparable to an x ray that shows a broken bone. Rather, they identify biomarkers that are linked to Alzheimer's but are not the actual disease or even a proven cause of the condition. These biomarkers, proteins called amyloid beta (AB) and tau, often appear in the brains of people who never will develop symptoms of Alzheimer's.\n\nThe purpose of the blood test is to determine whether diagnosed cognitive impairment is caused by Alzheimer's or one of the many other conditions that result in memory loss and similar symptoms. The idea: Cognitive impairment plus the biomarkers of AB and tau probably means Alzheimer's, rather than some other form of dementia.\n\nMeasuring Accuracy\n\nPalmqvist wanted to measure the accuracy of this blood test against other ways to diagnose Alzheimer's disease, such as PET scans, lumbar punctures (spinal taps) or cognitive testing by primary care doctors or specialists.\n\nHe found this biomarker blood test was about 90 percent accurate in diagnosing Alzheimer's among patients in his study, a better record than the 61% accuracy for primary care and 73% accuracy in specialty care where doctors use standard cognitive tests and clinical exams. Lumbar punctures and especially AB PET scans have their own limitations in diagnosing Alzheimer's. Palmqvist did not study other Alzheimer's blood tests, including home tests.\n\nBlood tests are less invasive than spinal taps and generally less costly than PET scans. However, the new study relied on a highly sophisticated tool for measuring results of the blood test -- one that is not readily available to most clinicians and is more costly than more common methods.\n\nWhat Will It Mean For Patients?\n\nThe authors acknowledge that more needs to be learned about how these biomarkers will influence patient care. But we do know that, given the current state of Alzheimer's treatment, a simple blood test would benefit only a limited number of patients.\n\nAn early diagnosis of Alzheimer's can be a valuable signal to for patients to change their lifestyle and begin to plan for a time when the disease becomes debilitating. On the other hand, it may increase anxiety without providing any clinical benefit.\n\nThe study also found that biomarker testing may be of limited value to those who feel they have experienced increased memory problems but have not received any clinical diagnosis. In general, this phenomenon, known as subjective cognitive decline, should not be ignored. But at that stage, biomarker blood tests may be no better at diagnosing Alzheimer's than other methods.\n\nIn other words, if you occasionally forget where you left your car keys, don't run out and get an Alzheimer's blood test.\n\nAt the same time, these tests are not useful for people whose disease has progressed beyond the ability of current treatments to improve their quality of life.\n\nTesting And New Drugs\n\nThat brings us to the closely related issue of those newly-approved monoclonal antibody drugs, such as Leqembi. These drugs clear those AB and tau proteins from the brain. But they do relatively little to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThese drugs are expensive and have dangerous side effects. And there is no evidence they provide any benefit for those with more advanced disease.\n\nThese all are reasons why a European drug regulator opposed sale of Leqembi for general use and why neurologists are so deeply divided over whether to prescribe them.\n\nLike the new drugs themselves, these new biomarker blood tests are an important advancement for researchers, who are learning more about how Alzheimer's works. But like those drugs, the benefits for real-world patients are much more modest than all the breathless hype suggests.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Biomarker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blood test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_puncture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lumbar puncture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_impairment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cognitive impairment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lund_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lund University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Medical_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Medical Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tau protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Positron emission tomography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venipuncture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cognitive test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primary care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid beta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amnesia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bone fracture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibody", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monoclonal antibody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Digestive_System_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Digestive System Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Pelvic_Exams_and_Pap_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Pelvic Exams and Pap Tests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home Tests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66b0e2de8639f4f034e343df/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792612", "eventUri": "eng-9792612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

They added that rollout of the drugs could \"involve considerable resources\" which \"will be extremely challenging for even the best-funded healthcare systems\".\n\nThe drugs, known as amyloid immunotherapy, work with the immune system to clear amyloid protein build-up from the brains of people with early-stage Alzheimer's. A number of treatments including lecanemab and donanemab are being assessed for approval in the UK by medicine regulators.\n\nWriting in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, the team from Cambridge Public Health said evidence does not make it clear if amyloid immunotherapy \"can ever significantly reduce population-level dementia morbidity at scale\".\n\nThey also claim results from those involved in trials may not generalise to more complex patients.\n\nLead author Dr Sebastian Walsh, National Institute for Health and Care Research doctoral fellow in public health medicine at Cambridge Public Health, said: \"If approved, the drugs are likely to be relevant only for a relatively small cohort of Alzheimer's patients, so potential recipients will need to undergo a range of assessments before being given access to the drugs.\n\n\"Plus, effect sizes seen in the trials are very small and the drugs will need be administered as early in the disease process as possible, when symptoms are mild - and people in these phases of disease can be hard to identify.\"\n\nCo-author Edo Richard, a professor of neurology at Radboud University Medical Centre in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, added: \"If these drugs are approved by regulators in the UK and Europe, and become available, it is understandable that some people with early Alzheimer's will still want to try these drugs, given their despair living with this dreadful disease.\n\n\"But there is a lot of hyperbole around the reporting of these drugs, and significant effort will be needed to provide balanced information to patients to enable informed decisions.\"\n\nThe paper said the short-term effects of the drugs are \"small, adverse events are frequent, treatment regimens are burdensome, and crucially, long-term effects are unknown\".\n\n\"At a population level, there is always likely to be a trade-off between breadth of access and magnitude of benefit for any given individual,\" the team wrote. \"At a health system level, rollout of treatment even for only narrowly defined patient groups will involve considerable resources to identify and treat eligible patients, with profound opportunity costs.\"\n\nUp to 280,000 patients in the UK could be eligible for the new drugs, but patients need to undergo \"gold standard\" diagnostic tests in the early stage of the disease in order to benefit, and at present only 2 per cent of patients get these tests.\n\nIn June, a record 487,000 people had received a formal dementia diagnosis via their GP, up from 466,000 last year. Estimates suggest that there are another 240,000 people in England with dementia who have not had a diagnosis. The NHS has set a target of diagnosing 66.7 per cent of the estimated total; the present figure is 65 per cent.\n\nAccording to the Alzheimer's Society, about 982,000 people in the UK are living with dementia. The figure is expected to rise to 1.4 million by 2040.\n\nJen Keen, head of policy at Alzheimer's Society, said: \"This research highlights potential barriers surrounding new treatments for Alzheimer's disease if approved, and we must be honest about the challenges we face. Confirming eligibility for new treatment requires specific diagnostic tests and, currently, a third of people living with dementia in the UK don't get a diagnosis at all.\n\n\"We need to see investment into diagnostic infrastructure and workforce to ensure that people who are eligible for new treatments can access them when they're most effective, which appears to be in the early stages of Alzheimer's.\n\n\"Meanwhile, regulators will scrutinise the evidence around these treatments and Alzheimer's Society awaits decisions from the MHRA [Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency] and Nice [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence] on both lecanemab and donanemab.\n\n\"These treatments are not a cure and they aren't for everyone living with Alzheimer's disease - they are a part of the puzzle. But improving dementia diagnosis can help us prepare for new treatments whilst also benefiting many more people living with dementia.\n\n\"Despite the issues raised in this research, we remain at an important and exciting moment for dementia. Scientists are learning more all the time about Alzheimer's disease and our ability to slow it down. There are currently 164 active clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease and we expect more treatments to be submitted for regulatory approval in the future.\"\n\nProfessor Carol Brayne, co-director of Cambridge Public Health, said: \"Even in high-income countries, rolling out such types of treatments at scale is highly challenging, but most dementia occurs in low and middle-income countries.\n\n\"Health systems in these countries are highly unlikely to have the resources required to offer these new drugs, even to a very narrow group.\n\n\"Other compelling evidence suggests that attention to inequalities and health experience across people's lives could have greater impact on the rates of dementia in populations. Most dementia is more complicated than a single protein.\n\n\"With an ageing population, we urgently need effective ways to support people living with dementia, but while the current amyloid immunotherapies may show a glint of promise for very selected groups, it's clear these drugs will not address dementia risk at scale.\"\n\nA spokesman for donanemab manufacturer Eli Lilly said: \"Any new treatments are reviewed by the MHRA and would subsequently be considered by Nice to determine clinical and cost-effectiveness and patient eligibility.\n\n\"Access to any new medicine will also depend on the appropriate diagnostic and treatment pathway being available for healthcare professionals and patients. Lilly is committed to partnering with the NHS and regulatory bodies to ensure new innovations can reach the people that need them.\"", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Experts have long believed they could herald a new era of dementia treatment by tackling the cause rather than just alleviating symptoms\n\nA number of amyloid immunotherapy drugs such lecanemab and donanemab are already approved in the US and are currently being assessed for approval in the UK by medicine regulators.\n\nBut a team, led by the University of Cambridge experts, said current evidence doesn't make it clear if amyloid immunotherapy 'can ever significantly reduce population-level dementia morbidity at scale'.\n\nPublishing their assessment in the journal, Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, they also claimed results from those involved in trials may not be applicable to more complex Alzheimer's patients.\n\nLead author Dr Sebastian Walsh, an expert in public health at Cambridge, said: 'If approved, the drugs are likely to be relevant only for a relatively small cohort of Alzheimer's patients.\n\n'So potential recipients will need to undergo a range of assessments before being given access to the drugs.\n\nRead More The 14 factors that could delay or prevent almost half of all dementia cases REVEALED\n\n'Plus, effect sizes seen in the trials are very small and the drugs will need be administered as early in the disease process as possible, when symptoms are mild - and people in these phases of disease can be hard to identify.'\n\nCo-author Professor Edo Richard, a professor of neurology at Radboud University in the Netherlands, added: 'If these drugs are approved by regulators in the UK and Europe, and become available, it is understandable that some people with early Alzheimer's will still want to try these drugs, given their despair living with this dreadful disease.\n\n'But there is a lot of hyperbole around the reporting of these drugs, and significant effort will be needed to provide balanced information to patients to enable informed decisions.'\n\nThe paper highlighted numerous issues with the drugs including the short-term effects are 'small', 'adverse events are frequent, treatment regimens are burdensome, and crucially, long-term effects are unknown'.\n\nThe team added: 'At a population level, there is always likely to be a trade-off between breadth of access and magnitude of benefit for any given individual.'\n\n'At a health system level, rollout of treatment even for only narrowly defined patient groups will involve considerable resources to identify and treat eligible patients, with profound opportunity costs.'\n\nAccording to the Alzheimer's Society, about 982,000 people in the UK are living with dementia.\n\nThe figure is expected to rise to 1.4 million by 2040.\n\nJen Keen, head of policy at Alzheimer's Society, said: 'This research highlights potential barriers surrounding new treatments for Alzheimer's disease if approved, and we must be honest about the challenges we face.\n\nResearchers said there is 'a lot of hyperbole' around medications like lecanemab and donanemab which are said to slow down early stages of Alzheimer's, the leading cause of dementia.\n\n'Confirming eligibility for new treatment requires specific diagnostic tests and, currently, a third of people living with dementia in the UK don't get a diagnosis at all.\n\n'We need to see investment into diagnostic infrastructure and workforce to ensure that people who are eligible for new treatments can access them when they're most effective, which appears to be in the early stages of Alzheimer's.\n\n'Meanwhile, regulators will scrutinise the evidence around these treatments and Alzheimer's Society awaits decisions from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence on both lecanemab and donanemab.\n\n'These treatments are not a cure and they aren't for everyone living with Alzheimer's disease - they are a part of the puzzle.\n\n'But improving dementia diagnosis can help us prepare for new treatments whilst also benefiting many more people living with dementia.\n\nRead More Cutting out breakfast favorite slashes risk of dementia 20%, finds major study\n\n'Despite the issues raised in this research, we remain at an important and exciting moment for dementia.\n\n'Scientists are learning more all the time about Alzheimer's disease and our ability to slow it down.\n\nProfessor Carol Brayne, co-director of University of Cambridge's Cambridge Public Health unit, said: 'Even in high-income countries, rolling out such types of treatments at scale is highly challenging, but most dementia occurs in low and middle-income countries.\n\n'Health systems in these countries are highly unlikely to have the resources required to offer these new drugs, even to a very narrow group.\n\n'Other compelling evidence suggests that attention to inequalities and health experience across people's lives could have greater impact on the rates of dementia in populations.

The disease can cause anxiety, confusion and short-term memory loss\n\n'Lilly is committed to partnering with the NHS and regulatory bodies to ensure new innovations can reach the people that need them.'\n\nLast year, the medical world rejoiced as the first drug to clearly slow the progression of Alzheimer's was approved in the US.\n\nManufacturers said trial results showed lecanemab - also known as Leqembi - slowed cognitive and functional decline in early-stage Alzheimer's patients by 27 per cent over 18 months.\n\nThis is the equivalent of a five-month slowdown in the progression of the disease.\n\nIt was followed by results for donanemab which trails showed slowed progression of Alzheimer's by as much as 35 per cent.\n\nBut experts have warned that people who take the drugs actually lose volume in their brains.\n\nRead More Blood tests for dementia could become the gold standard for diagnosis\n\nThere have also been concerns about brain bleeds among patients taking amyloid immunotherapies.\n\nTrial results for lecanemab show that around 21 per cent of participants who received the drug experienced brain swelling or bleeding, compared to 9 per cent of those who received a placebo.\n\nThe majority of patients had no side effects, or had very mild symptoms, while most who experienced brain swelling or bleeding saw these issues resolve by the end of the trial.\n\nExperts have also previously highlighted how more than 80 per cent of Brits at risk of Alzheimer's could miss out on the new drugs due to a lack testing for the disease.\n\nInstead, scientists from London estimated just 14 per cent of patients referred to clinics were actually likely to benefit from the treatments.\n\nResearchers said there was a 'clear and urgent' need to

But improving dementia diagnosis can help us prepare for new treatments whilst also benefiting many more people living with dementia.\n\n\"Despite the issues raised in this research, we remain at an important and exciting moment for dementia. Scientists are learning more all the time about Alzheimer's disease and our ability to slow it down.\n\n\"There are currently 164 active clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease and we expect more treatments to be submitted for regulatory approval in the future.\"\n\nCompelling evidence suggests that attention to inequalities and health experience across people's lives could have greater impact on the rates of dementia Professor Carol Brayne\n\nProfessor Carol Brayne, co-director of Cambridge Public Health, said: \"Even in high-income countries, rolling out such types of treatments at scale is highly challenging, but most dementia occurs in low and middle-income countries.\n\n\"Health systems in these countries are highly unlikely to have the resources required to offer these new drugs, even to a very narrow group.\n\n\"Other compelling evidence suggests that attention to inequalities and health experience across people's lives could have greater impact on the rates of dementia in populations. Most dementia is more complicated than a single protein.\n\n\"With an ageing population, we urgently need effective ways to support people living with dementia, but while the current amyloid immunotherapies may show a glint of promise for very selected groups, it's clear these drugs will not address dementia risk at scale.\"\n\nA spokesman for donanemab manufacturer Eli Lilly said: \"Any new treatments are reviewed by the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) and would subsequently be considered by Nice (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) to determine clinical and cost-effectiveness and patient eligibility.\n\n\"Access to any new medicine will also depend on the appropriate diagnostic and treatment pathway being available for healthcare professionals and patients.\n\n\"Lilly is committed to partnering with the NHS and regulatory bodies to ensure new innovations can reach the people that need them.\"", "source": {"uri":

One that's a growing public health crisis, according to the Alzheimer's Association, which estimates that 580,000 people 65 years of age and older live with it in the state. That number is expected to increase in the future.\n\nMiami-Dade County leads the nation with the highest rate of Alzheimer's within that age group.\n\nBlood biomarker study\n\nResearchers in Sweden included more than 1,200 patients with cognitive symptoms in their study, testing them for key proteins in the blood known as a biomarker of Alzheimer's disease. One of them is phosphorylated tau217 or pTau217.\n\nThese proteins form into tangles and are one of the defining features of Alzheimer's disease in the brain. Tau tangles in neurons is linked to cognitive decline because they lead brain cell death.\n\nSomeone who has pTau buildup will typically also have abnormal levels of amyloid in the brain.\n\nBeta-amyloid protein clumps form plaques that block cell-to-cell signaling in the brain that would normally take place. As neurons stop working and die, the brain shrinks over time and it loses most of its functions.\n\nThe blood test used in the study is called an amyloid probability score 2 test, or APS2. Between February 2020 and January 2024, researchers found that among 698 patients at memory clinics, the APS2 test was about 90% accurate at identifying Alzheimer's disease. Specialists were 73% accurate.\n\nThen among 515 patients seen in primary care, APS2 was around 90% accurate while primary care physicians were 63% accurate at identifying Alzheimer's.\n\nBlood testing for Alzheimer's doesn't have approval yet from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which doesn't mean clinicians can't use them, but they're expensive.\n\nWhen it gets FDA approval, blood biomarker tests for Alzheimer's will be covered by Florida Medicaid and state insurance plans. A new state law will require Florida Medicaid and state insurance plans to cover biomarker tests, starting Jan. 1.\n\nA biomarker, such as a certain gene or protein, is found in the blood, body fluids or other tissues that indicate a sign of a condition or disease.\n\nAlzheimer's has no cure or reversal, but getting an early diagnosis helps people become eligible for the drugs currently available: lecanemab, sold under the brand name Leqembi, and donanemab, sold as Kisunla, which have been proven effective in slowing cognitive decline down.\n\nTo participate in Alzheimer's clinical trials, one also needs to have an early diagnosis. Once a patient is in the middle stages of this disease, it's too late for treatment or trials.\n\n\"Think of all the colleges that are staffed in Florida -- every individual under that state plan will be able to have their biomarker covered by the state of Florida,\" said Stefanie Wardlow, a senior program manager at the Alzheimer's Association in Florida. \"This is definitely going to be a paradigm shift in terms of how people can get diagnosed. A more accurate and earlier diagnosis for Alzheimer's disease is needed, and blood biomarkers will pave the way for that.\"\n\nAccurate diagnoses remain essential\n\nCurrently, making an Alzheimer's diagnosis could involve various processes -- exams, cognitive testing, basic labs, brain scans and others to rule out depression or a vitamin deficiency that could also impact memory.\n\nTypically, a specialist will get a history from a patient and also speak to a family member, he or she could also have a patient get an MRI, a spinal fluid test or PET scan.\n\n\"Blood tests are always quicker, easier, and cheaper to do, but they still require a knowledgeable specialist to be able to interpret the results and communicate them accurately and sensitively to patients and care partners,\" wrote Dr. Marc Agronin, a geriatric psychiatrist and chief medical officer at the Frank C. and Lynn Scaduto MIND Institute at Miami Jewish Health.\n\n\"Not every positive blood test confirms Alzheimer's disease, and so this very consequential diagnosis must be made in a very careful way. The risk of getting blood tests without understanding the full context is the potential misdiagnosis of the disease, unnecessarily scaring patients.\"\n\nThe U.S. has a shortage of neurologists, so sometimes people face long waits to get an appointment. These blood tests, once FDA approved, may help people get access to treatment sooner if their primary physician will be skilled in interpreting the results of an accurate blood test.\n\n\"If you can make the diagnosis, then you can get people into treatment faster,\" said Dr. James E. Galvin, a professor of neurology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and the founder and director of UM's Comprehensive Center for Brain Health. \"Whereas if you refer a person to the neurologist for the diagnosis, there's a long wait to see a neurologist. I think the blood test is going to quicken the path for a lot of people to be diagnosed and treated.\"\n\nGalvin said biomarker tests will show doctors whether there's some specific pathology changes in the brain, and they need to interpret those changes in the context of the patient's symptoms to make the right diagnosis.", "source": {"uri": "tittlepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "tittlepress.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Biomarker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blood test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neuron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid beta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cell signaling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tau protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phosphorylation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medicaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Schizophrenia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fluid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Body fluid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care_physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primary care physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_M._Miller_School_of_Medicine", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leonard M.

That requires confirming one of the disease's hallmark signs -- buildup of a sticky protein called beta-amyloid -- with a hard-to-get brain scan or uncomfortable spinal tap. Many patients instead are diagnosed based on symptoms and cognitive exams.\n\nLabs have begun offering a variety of tests that can detect certain signs of Alzheimer's in blood. Scientists are excited by their potential but the tests aren't widely used yet because there's little data to guide doctors about which kind to order and when. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration hasn't formally approved any of them and there's little insurance coverage.\n\n\"What tests can we trust?\" asked Dr. Suzanne Schindler, a neurologist at Washington University in St. Louis who's part of a research project examining that. While some are very accurate, \"other tests are not much better than a flip of a coin.\"\n\nRelated Story: FDA Approves Second Drug to Modestly Slow Alzheimer's Disease\n\nMore than 6 million people in the United States and millions more around the world have Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia. Its telltale \"biomarkers\" are brain-clogging amyloid plaques and abnormal tau protein that leads to neuron-killing tangles.\n\nNew drugs, Leqembi and Kisunla, can modestly slow worsening symptoms by removing gunky amyloid from the brain. But they only work in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's and proving patients qualify in time can be difficult. Measuring amyloid in spinal fluid is invasive. A special PET scan to spot plaques is costly and getting an appointment can take months.\n\nEven specialists can struggle to tell if Alzheimer's or something else is to blame for a patient's symptoms.\n\n\"I have patients not infrequently who I am convinced have Alzheimer's disease and I do testing and it's negative,\" Schindler said.\n\nBlood tests so far have been used mostly in carefully controlled research settings. But a new study of about 1,200 patients in Sweden shows they also can work in the real-world bustle of doctors' offices -- especially primary care doctors who see far more people with memory problems than specialists but have fewer tools to evaluate them.\n\nIn the study, patients who visited either a primary care doctor or a specialist for memory complaints got an initial diagnosis using traditional exams, gave blood for testing and were sent for a confirmatory spinal tap or brain scan.\n\nBlood testing was far more accurate, Lund University researchers reported Sunday at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Philadelphia. The primary care doctors' initial diagnosis was 61% accurate and the specialists' 73% -- but the blood test was 91% accurate, according to the findings, which also were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nRelated Story: Alzheimer's Drug Shows Promise in Early Results of Study\n\nThere's almost \"a wild West\" in the variety being offered, said Dr. John Hsiao of the National Institute on Aging. They measure different biomarkers, in different ways.\n\nDoctors and researchers should only use blood tests proven to have a greater than 90% accuracy rate, said Alzheimer's Association chief science officer Maria Carrillo.\n\nToday's tests most likely to meet that benchmark measure what's called p-tau217, Carrillo and Hsiao agreed. Schindler helped lead an unusual direct comparison of several kinds of blood tests, funded by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, that came to the same conclusion.\n\nThat type of test measures a form of tau that correlates with how much plaque buildup someone has, Schindler explained. A high level signals a strong likelihood the person has Alzheimer's while a low level indicates that's probably not the cause of memory loss.\n\nSeveral companies are developing p-tau217 tests including ALZpath Inc., Roche, Eli Lilly and C2N Diagnostics, which supplied the version used in the Swedish study.\n\nRelated Story: A Subset of Alzheimer's May Be Caused by Two Copies of a Single Gene: New ...\n\nOnly doctors can order them from labs. The Alzheimer's Association is working on guidelines and several companies plan to seek FDA approval, which would clarify proper use.\n\nFor now, Carrillo said doctors should use blood testing only in people with memory problems, after checking the accuracy of the type they order.\n\nEspecially for primary care physicians, \"it really has great potential to help them in sorting out who to give a reassuring message and who to send on to memory specialists,\" said Dr. Sebastian Palmqvist of Lund University, who led the Swedish study with Lund's Dr. Oskar Hansson.\n\nThe tests aren't yet for people who don't have symptoms but worry about Alzheimer's in the family -- unless it's part of enrollment in research studies, Schindler stressed.\n\nThat's partly because amyloid buildup can begin two decades before the first sign of memory problems, and so far there are no preventive steps other than basic advice to eat healthy, exercise and get enough sleep. But there are studies underway testing possible therapies for people at high risk of Alzheimer's, and some include blood testing.", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GV Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@gvwire.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blood test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_puncture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lumbar puncture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Neuroimaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amnesia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Primary care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid beta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biomarker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tau protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_University_in_St._Louis", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington University in St. Louis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_plaques", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid plaques"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lund_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lund University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Positron emission tomography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cerebrospinal fluid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Lilly_and_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eli Lilly and Company"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Pelvic_Exams_and_Pap_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Pelvic Exams and Pap Tests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home Tests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://gvwire.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/05112139/AP24208749313220.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792612", "eventUri": "eng-9792612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

By comparison, primary care doctors and specialists had 61% and 73% accuracy rates in diagnosing the disease, the study found.\n\nCurrently, the disease can be definitively diagnosed only by more expensive and invasive tools such as PET scans and spinal taps. The neurodegenerative disease afflicts more than 6 million Americans.\n\nThe blood test in the study and others of its ilk are only available in research trials at the moment,\" said Corinne Pettigrew, an assistant professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study. \"Getting one to the market and available in a primary care physician's office would represent incredible progress.\n\n\"This would allow patients to review options for treatments, learn about what to expect of the disease and plan for the future,\" added Pettigrew, who leads outreach, recruitment and engagement for the Hopkins Alzheimer's Disease Research Center.\n\nShe said the test also would be important for ruling out Alzheimer's as the reason for a patient's cognitive impairment, allowing doctors to seek and treat the actual cause.\n\nThe study involved 1,213 people in Sweden whose average age was 74 and who were being evaluated because of cognitive symptoms. According to the paper, Alzheimer's is often misdiagnosed by primary care physicians and even specialists because of a lack of or limited access to diagnostic tools. That prevents patients from starting treatments for those with early Alzheimer's, which require test results confirming the disease, the study said.\n\n\"The higher diagnostic accuracy of the blood test indicates that it could be suitable for implementation in primary care, but future studies need to examine its effect on clinical care,\" according to the study, which was led by Dr. Sebastian Palmqvist, of Lund University in Sweden. \"In addition to improving diagnostic accuracy, a positive test result could further support the initiation of widely available treatments.\"\n\nIlene Rosenthal, program director at the Greater Maryland chapter of the Alzheimer's Association, called the study findings \"extremely exciting\" for advocates such as her organization who have pushed for more research to understand and treat the devastating disease.\n\n\"When you have 90% accuracy,\" she said, \"that's very impressive.\"\n\nRosenthal envisions a time when a blood test for Alzheimer's will be as common and widely available as those that test for cholesterol.\n\n\"This should become a normal part of a physical or a wellness visit,\" she said.\n\nAlzheimer's still has no cure, but there are treatments that can ease its symptoms and change its progression if started early enough. That makes the development of a test vital, and it will incentivize patients and doctors to use them, Rosenthal said.\n\n\"The real urgency right now is the availability of new treatments.

While new immunotherapies remove toxic amyloid from the brain and do slow disease progression, the treatments come with substantial risks and will be difficult to implement for many reasons as outlined in the article. The good news is scientific research is working and even if they are not perfect, we finally have proof that Alzheimer's disease can be slowed down. These drugs do slow disease progression and future work will no doubt make more effective, safer treatments.\"\n\nJen Keen, Head of Policy at Alzheimer's Society, said:\n\n\"Dementia is the UK's biggest killer and the greatest health and social care challenge that we face in this country.\n\n\"This research highlights potential barriers surrounding new treatments for Alzheimer's disease if approved, and we must be honest about the challenges we face. Confirming eligibility for new treatment requires specific diagnostic tests and, currently, a third of people living with dementia in the UK don't get a diagnosis at all. We need to see investment into diagnostic infrastructure and workforce to ensure that people who are eligible for new treatments can access them when they're most effective, which appears to be in the early stages of Alzheimer's.\n\n\"Meanwhile, regulators will scrutinise the evidence around these treatments and Alzheimer's Society awaits decisions from the MHRA and NICE on both lecanemab and donanemab.\n\n\"These treatments are not a cure and they aren't for everyone living with Alzheimer's disease - they are a part of the puzzle. But improving dementia diagnosis can help us prepare for new treatments whilst also benefiting many more people living with dementia. Early diagnosis gives people access to existing treatments that can improve outcomes and reduce admissions to hospitals and care homes. This has obvious benefits for individuals and for the health and social care system as a whole.\n\n\"Despite the issues raised in this research, we remain at an important and exciting moment for dementia. Scientists are learning more all the time about Alzheimer's disease and our ability to slow it down. There are currently 164 active clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease and we expect more treatments to be submitted for regulatory approval in the future.\n\n\"More people receiving an early and accurate diagnosis is going to be vital in the future both for identifying people who are most likely to benefit from new Alzheimer's treatments, and for getting existing treatment and support to more people.\"\n\nProf Dag Aarsland, Professor of Old Age Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London (KCL), said:\n\n\"Walsh et al provide a thoughtful description of the challenges linked to the possible introduction of the new disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease. While I agree that there are indeed challenges both at the clinical, societal and healthcare levels, we should not forget the opportunities and the breakthrough that after decades of very costly negative trials we finally have unequivocal evidence that it is possible to reduce the disease progression. There are no generally established criteria for what constitutes a \"clinically significant effect\". While the 25-37% reduced rate of decline reported does not fulfil the authors own requirement, it is within criteria stated by others (July 23, 2019 issue 93 (4) e322-e333 https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000007831). The authors ask for long-term data, and to some extent this was addressed by the presentation of open-label extension data presented at the recent AAIC meeting in Philadelphia. I missed a more detailed discussion about the opportunity to identify subgroups with enhanced effect and reduced risks. While clinicians in the US, China, Japan and Israel now have the opportunity to discuss and in some cases prescribe disease-modifying drugs to their patients with AD, this is not possible in Europe. I hope this will soon be possible in the UK.\"\n\nDr Mark Dallas, Associate Professor in Cellular Neuroscience, University of Reading, said:\n\n\"Few in the research community ever believed that the recent amyloid-targeting medicines would be the ultimate solution to Alzheimer's disease. This article highlights the limitations of these recent amyloid therapies, particularly when considering their broader clinical use within the wider dementia community. It underscores the urgent need for alternative strategies to improve the lives of those living with dementia. Ongoing fundamental research is making significant strides, in developing non-amyloid targeting drugs that will diversify the available treatment options for managing Alzheimer's disease. While some individuals may benefit from amyloid-targeting medicines, a broader array of disease-modifying treatments is essential to address the diverse needs of those living with Alzheimer's.\"\n\nProf Sir John Hardy, Professor of Neuroscience and Group Leader at the UK Dementia Research Institute, University College London (UCL), said:\n\n\"I respectfully disagree with the shorthand implication taken from this publication by the Cambridge group that amyloid immunotherapy drugs will not have value in Alzheimer's treatment. Indeed, the article itself is more nuanced. Dr Brayne's long-term campaign, with which I agree, has been for better public health measures to reduce dementia incidence. These anti-amyloid antibodies have beneficial effects in carefully screened patients with early Alzheimer's disease. As the article notes, an effect of the licensing of these agents will be to improve diagnostic and clinical procedures so that earlier and more accurate diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease are made so that the correct dementia patients for Alzheimer's treatment are identified. We do not yet know whether longer-term treatment will continue to cause treated and placebo curves to diverge: no doubt such data is being gathered now, but we now have disease modifying therapy and it would be unfortunate if those in the UK who would benefit from this therapy had to fly to the US to receive it.\"\n\nProf Paresh Malhotra, Professor of Clinical Neurology, Imperial College London, said:\n\n\"This review paper addresses many important issues relating to the recently developed amyloid-clearing drugs for Alzheimer's disease- lecanemab and donanemab. It summarises available evidence and focuses particularly on the relatively small absolute effects of the drugs, their side effects, and the low likelihood that they will have a large effect on Alzheimer's Disease burden at a population level. The authors rightly stress the importance of ensuring that, in the event of these drugs being approved in a particular country, due attention is given to the provision of balanced information as well as shared decision making between patients, families and healthcare practitioners. The authors note that the licensing of these medications is newsworthy and contentious. This applies to the recent European Medicines Agency to refuse marketing authorisation to lecanemab and will no doubt also apply to the upcoming decision of the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the UK, whether authorisation is given or refused. Over twenty years ago, similar arguments took place over the newly developed interferon treatments for Multiple Sclerosis. The authors are absolutely right to stress the importance of minimising hype and undue claims of efficacy, but it is also important to recognise that these drugs are the first to have clinical effects which appear to relate to a key mechanism of disease progression, and their introduction may accelerate treatment development and transform clinical services for Alzheimer's Disease, the most common cause of dementia worldwide.\"\n\nDr Tom Russ, Reader in Old Age Psychiatry and honorary Consultant Psychiatrist, University of Edinburgh, said:\n\n\"I welcome this very sensible appraisal from the team at Cambridge Public Health. They succinctly and accurately summarise the science that - while these drugs do affect the level of amyloid detectable in the brain - they have very little observable effect on the person and are associated with significant risks. I appreciated their use of the word 'hyperbole' which sums up much of the discussion we have seen about these medications. Dementia - including Alzheimer dementia, the most common type - is a terrible condition, but the very modest benefits seen in these medications (even over an extended period as in the data recently presented at AAIC) do not outweigh the risks. This risk-benefit analysis even trumps the huge financial costs associated with treating one person, let alone the costs of service redesign which would be necessary across most of the NHS in order to deliver these medicines.\n\n\"If Lecanemab were to be licensed in the UK - which now seems by no means certain - only a minority of people would be eligible for but and they would have to come to a healthcare setting twice a month to receive it. This would mean they would see a clinical team twice a month and receive - at the very least - informal support from them. We should be providing enhanced support to everyone who has a diagnosis of dementia so that everyone is seen twice a month - otherwise the inequality between people receiving Lecanemab (if it is licensed) and those who aren't would be unacceptable.\n\n\"We also need broad research, focusing on population health and risk reduction, social science and care research, as well as the continued search for a cure. However, all this research should empower people with lived experience of dementia (people with a diagnosis, their family, friends, and supporters) to engage in research on an equal footing with the 'professional' researchers and make truly co-produced research much more common.\n\n\"There needs to be a revolution in dementia research, care, and support, and we remain optimistic that our new government in Westminster will have the clear sight needed to provide the necessary funding and reform.\"\n\n'Considering challenges for the new Alzheimer's drugs: Clinical, population, and health system perspectives' by Sebastian Walsh et al. was published in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association at 12:00 UK time on Tuesday 6 August 2024.\n\nProf Paresh Malhotra: I have received research funding from NIHR, MRC, Dementia Platforms UK, Alzheimer's Research UK, British Heart Foundation, FIFA and Alzheimer's Society.

One characteristic of Alzheimer's is the build-up of clusters of misfolded proteins, one of these being a form of amyloid, leading to plaques in the brain. The cascade hypothesis, a dominant theory in the field, suggests that this triggers a series of processes which together lead to dementia symptoms.\n\nAdvances in developing treatments to reduce symptoms and slow down the progression in the early stages of Alzheimer's has been slow. However, there has been recent excitement surrounding amyloid immunotherapy agents, drugs that harness the immune system to remove amyloid pathology.\n\nTwo completed phase III randomised controlled trials of amyloid immunotherapy reported statistically significant reductions in the rate of cognitive and functional decline compared to the placebo.\n\nBut as the Cambridge team point out, the effect sizes were small - small enough that a doctor would struggle to tell the difference between the average decline of a patient on the drug and another on placebo, after 18 months. The drugs were also associated with significant adverse events, including brain swelling and bleeding; during the phase III trial of one agent, donanemab, there were also three deaths attributed to the treatment.\n\nCrucially, there is little known about the long-term effects of the drugs beyond the 18 month trial periods. Long-term placebo-controlled trials, which would be needed to see if there is any clinically meaningful slowing of decline, are unlikely to be feasible where drugs are already approved.\n\nDespite this, the US Food and Drug Administration has licensed two such drugs. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended rejecting one (lecanemab) predominantly on the grounds that the small effects seen do not outweigh the risk from side effects; it is reviewing the other. The UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is expected to take a decision on both drugs imminently.\n\nEdo Richard, Professor of Neurology at Radboud University Medical Centre in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, and co-author, said: \"If these drugs are approved by regulators in the UK and Europe, and become available, it is understandable that some people with early Alzheimer's will still want to try these drugs, given their despair living with this dreadful disease. But there is a lot of hyperbole around the reporting of these drugs, and significant effort will be needed to provide balanced information to patients to enable informed decisions.\"\n\nPress coverage of the drugs has implied they are suitable for anyone with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's. However, while the trials included those with 'early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease', it excluded those with other conditions that may have been contributing to their symptoms. Evidence suggests that the people in the trials represent less than 8% of those in the community with early Alzheimer's disease. Those in the trials were up to 10 to 15 years younger than those typically presenting to health services with early symptoms.\n\nLead author Dr Sebastian Walsh, NIHR Doctoral Fellow in Public Health Medicine at Cambridge Public Health, University of Cambridge, added: \"If approved, the drugs are likely to be relevant only for a relatively small cohort of Alzheimer's patients, so potential recipients will need to undergo a range of assessments before being given access to the drugs. Plus, effect sizes seen in the trials are very small and the drugs will need be administered as early in the disease process as possible, when symptoms are mild - and people in these phases of disease can be hard to identify.\"\n\nThe resource requirements for rolling out such treatments are likely to be considerable. Even if approved for only a small proportion of Alzheimer's patients, a much broader group of people will need to be assessed for eligibility, requiring rapid specialist clinical assessment and tests. The authors question whether this is the best use of these resources, given the strain health systems are already under. Support would also be required for the large number of Alzheimer's patients (potentially as many as 92%) found to be ineligible. Those found to have insufficient amyloid to be eligible may then require follow-up assessments to determine eligibility in the future, with the further implications for services this would entail.\n\nProfessor Carol Brayne, Co-director of Cambridge Public Health, said: \"Even in high-income countries, rolling out such types of treatments at scale is highly challenging, but most dementia occurs in low- and middle-income countries. Health systems in these countries are highly unlikely to have the resources required to offer these new drugs, even to a very narrow group.\n\n\"Other compelling evidence suggests that attention to inequalities and health experience across people's lives could have greater impact on the rates of dementia in populations. Most dementia is more complicated than a single protein.\"\n\nThe team concludes that based on current evidence, it is far from clear whether amyloid immunotherapy can ever significantly reduce suffering caused by dementia at scale in the community, and we must continue to explore other approaches.\n\nProfessor Brayne added: \"With an ageing population, we urgently need effective ways to support people living with dementia, but while the current amyloid immunotherapies may show a glint of promise for very selected groups, it's clear these drugs will not address dementia risk at scale.\"\n\nReference\n\nWalsh, S et al.

With populations increasingly aging, there is a huge need to find effective treatments for the disease. But the researchers question whether these drugs will have any great impact.\n\n\"Based on current evidence, it is far from clear whether [these types of therapies] can ever significantly reduce population-level dementia morbidity at scale,\" they write.\n\nBoth drugs target a protein called amyloid that builds up to form plaques in the brain. Some scientists hypothesize that these plaques are one of the main causes of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAlzheimer's is the most common form of dementia, accounting for up to 70 percent of the more than 55 million cases worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Dementia is currently the seventh leading cause of death among older people globally.\n\nLate-stage trials of the two drugs showed that they slowed the progression of Alzheimer's disease. For donanemab, developed by Eli Lilly, participants in a Phase 3 trial who received the drug showed a 22 percent to 29 percent slowing in cognitive decline after 76 weeks, compared to those who received a placebo.\n\nFor lecanemab, developed by Japan's Eisai and U.S. biotech Biogen, those who received the drug declined 1.21 points on an 18-point cognition scale, while those who received the placebo declined 1.66 points, the companies the companies reported.\n\nBut the latest analysis, published on Tuesday in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, points out that the absolute effect sizes were small and \"clearly below previously established thresholds of the minimum clinically important difference.\"\n\nAdditionally, the researchers point out that the potential side effects to both drugs are \"concerning\" and \"frequent.\"\n\nAround three in every 10 people using the treatment experienced brain edema and/or hemorrhage, the researchers report: 21.5 percent of those taking lecanemab and 36.8 percent of those using donanemab, compared with 9.5 percent and 14.9 percent for the respective placebo groups. Three participants who received donanemab died during the trial, which researchers at Lilly viewed as likely a result of receiving the drug.\n\nLong-term effects of the drugs beyond the 18-month trial period are also unknown, and there are challenges for health systems, as roll out of treatment will involve \"considerable resources including personnel, with profound opportunity costs.\" That includes multiple tests to identify those who are eligible and frequent hospital visits for infusions and follow-up care.\n\n\"Even in high-income countries, rolling out such types of treatments at scale is highly challenging, but most dementia occurs in low- and middle-income countries,\" said Carol Brayne, co-director of Cambridge Public Health, which conducted the study.\n\nIn addition, only a relatively small cohort of Alzheimer's patients would be eligible for treatment, lead author Sebastian Walsh, NIHR doctoral fellow in public health medicine at the University of Cambridge, said.\n\n\"Diagnosing early Alzheimer's disease can be challenging for many reasons, including a reluctance to discuss symptoms due to fear and stigma, and limited access to effective testing,\" Eisai told POLITICO in a statement. \"For change to happen, health systems and society must adapt to newer models of care that recognize the value of early diagnosis.\"\n\nEisai also said the company is \"dedicated to collecting ongoing and long-term efficacy and safety data for lecanemab.\"\n\nEli Lilly and Biogen could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThese drugs have also divided regulators.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved lecanemab last year and donanemab this year. Last month, however, the European Medicines Agency opposed a license for Leqembi -- the brand name for lecanemab -- arguing that the small benefits of the drug on delaying cognitive decline did not outweigh the risk of serious side effects.\n\nThe U.K.'s drugs regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), is still assessing lecanemab with a decision expected imminently.\n\n\"If these drugs are approved by regulators in the UK and Europe, and become available, it is understandable that some people with early Alzheimer's will still want to try these drugs, given their despair living with this dreadful disease,\" said co-author Edo Richard, a professor of neurology at Radboud University Medical Centre in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. \"But there is a lot of hyperbole around the reporting of these drugs, and significant effort will be needed to provide balanced information to patients to enable informed decisions,\" Richard said.\n\n\"Few in the research community ever believed that the recent amyloid-targeting medicines would be the ultimate solution to Alzheimer's disease,\" Mark Dallas, associate professor in cellular neuroscience at the University of Reading, U.K., said. The Cambridge study highlights the limitations of these therapies and underscores the \"urgent need for alternative strategies to improve the lives of those living with dementia,\" he added.\n\nBut others stress that the drugs still play a significant role in the fight to find a treatment for Alzheimer's.\n\n\"We do not yet know whether longer-term treatment will continue to cause treated and placebo curves to diverge ... but we now have disease modifying therapy and it would be unfortunate if those in the UK who would benefit from this therapy had to fly to the US to receive it,\" John Hardy, professor of neuroscience and group leader at the U.K. Dementia Research Institute at University College London (UCL), said.", "source": {"uri": "politico.eu", "dataType": "news", "title":

But he said Alzheimer's, the most common cause of dementia, can't be diagnosed definitively without a brain biopsy -- which typically only happens after death.\n\nAlmost 120 years after Dr. Alois Alzheimer first identified, via autopsy, the characteristic ways Alzheimer's changes the brain, many aspects of the disease remain a mystery. But Okhravi hopes to find a few more clues in a study of whether a common diabetes drug can help prevent dementia due to Alzheimer's. EVMS recently joined the nationwide research effort, which is recruiting participants in Hampton Roads.\n\nThe study, led by Columbia University and sponsored by the National Institutes on Aging, attempts to determine whether metformin, the most common drug prescribed for diabetes, could help prevent early memory loss. Researchers believe there is a potential link between insulin resistance and neurodegenerative disorders. Metformin lowers glucose, the main blood sugar found in the human body, and increases sensitivity to insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels.\n\nThose effects may help prevent mild cognitive impairment, Okhravi said.\n\n\"MCI is really a stage between normal age-related memory loss you see in people when they get older and the serious decline of dementia,\" he said. \"About 1 to 2 out of 10 people with MCI probably progress to a stage of dementia in a one-year period. But this number actually goes up to 60% five years after developing mild cognitive impairment.\"\n\nMild cognitive impairment can be hard to recognize. In an Alzheimer's Association survey, more than 50% of Americans thought a description of it sounded like \"normal aging.\"\n\nSymptoms include losing things like eyeglasses, keys, cell phones and remote controls, forgetting to go to important appointments and events and having more trouble coming up with names and phrases than other people the same age, Okhravi said. Diagnosis usually requires separate clinical interviews with the patient and with a spouse or close family member and a standardized memory test.\n\n\"Essentially, we can figure out if this is a different trajectory from age-related memory issues,\" Okhravi said.\n\nThe earlier Alzheimer's is caught, the better the chances of delaying the progression of the disease, he said, and in some cases, it can be caught very early -- up to 20 years before any symptoms develop.\n\nThat information comes from a separate research effort in which Okhravi participates, called the Ahead Study, run by a consortium of leading academic Alzheimer's research centers. It has found that a buildup of amyloids, a protein in the brain, may begin up to two decades before people notice symptoms like memory impairment.\n\nThis kind of study is particularly important because although mild cognitive impairment can be determined clinically fairly well, Alzheimer's is very hard to diagnose based on clinical evaluation alone.\n\n\"Even the best people in the field, there is a 36% chance that we may make a mistake or a not accurate diagnosis,\" Okhravi said. \"When we think a person has Alzheimer's, 36% of the time they did not have Alzheimer's.\"\n\nPET scans, imaging used to build 3D images of internal tissue, can accurately diagnose Alzheimer's over 90% of the time, he added.\n\nGiven a potential two-decade window of time to fight progression of the disease, the opportunity to slow it down with metformin -- which is widely available and inexpensive -- could present a major breakthrough.\n\n\"Right now, there aren't many options for preventing Alzheimer's,\" he said. \"This study could lead to new ways to keep people healthy and improve quality of life as they age.\"\n\nLearn more about the study at

Research in animal models of Alzheimer's disease suggests these drugs may have neuroprotective effects, reduce early forms of amyloid, normalize the brain's processing of glucose, and improve memory and learning. Liraglutide (Novo Nordisk) likely works by multiple mechanisms in the brain.\n\nThis new research suggests liraglutide may protect the brains of people with mild Alzheimer's disease and reduce cognitive decline by as much as 18% after one year of treatment compared to placebo by slowing the shrinking of the parts of the brain that are vital for memory, learning, language and decision-making.\n\n\"We are in an era of unprecedented promise, with new treatments in various stages of development that slow or may possibly prevent cognitive decline due to Alzheimer's disease,\" said Maria C. Carrillo, Ph.D., Alzheimer's Association chief science officer and medical affairs lead. \"This research provides hope that more options for changing the course of the disease are on the horizon.\n\n\"Repurposing drugs already approved for other conditions has the advantage of providing data and experience from previous research and practical use -- so we already know a lot about real-world effectiveness in other diseases and side effects,\" Carrillo added.\n\nThe randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial led by Prof. Paul Edison, M.D., Ph.D., professor of science from Imperial College London, included 204 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease at 24 clinics throughout the United Kingdom. Each received a daily subcutaneous injection for one year: half received liraglutide and half received a placebo. Before and after the study, all patients had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate brain structure and volumes, glucose metabolism PET scans and detailed memory testing.\n\nThe study's primary endpoint was change in the cerebral glucose metabolic rate in the cortical regions of the brain (hippocampus, medial temporal lobe and posterior cingulate), which was not met. However, the secondary endpoint of change in scores for clinical and cognitive measures and the exploratory endpoint of brain volume showed statistically significant benefit.\n\n\"The slower loss of brain volume suggests liraglutide protects the brain, much like statins protect the heart,\" said Dr. Edison. \"While further research is needed, liraglutide may work through various mechanisms, such as reducing inflammation in the brain, lowering insulin resistance and the toxic effects of Alzheimer's biomarkers amyloid-beta and tau, and improving how the brain's nerve cells communicate.\"\n\nEdison added that those in the study who received liraglutide had nearly 50% less volume loss in several areas of the brain, including frontal, temporal, parietal and total gray matter, as measured by MRI. These areas are responsible for a variety of critical functions that often are affected by Alzheimer's disease, including memory, language and decision-making.\n\nResearchers conducted cognitive testing in 204 patients -- before treatment and at 24 and 52 weeks. Although the study was not powered to assess cognitive changes, researchers found that patients who received liraglutide had an 18% slower decline in cognitive function in a year compared to those who got the placebo.\n\nThere are 236,200 Ohioans 65 and older living with Alzheimer's disease, according to the Alzheimer's Association 2024 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures.

But the medical community has struggled be able to accurately diagnose the condition, and tests are often invasive. Now, new research has found that Alzheimer's disease may be able to be accurately diagnosed with the help of a simple blood test.\n\nThe study, which was published in JAMA, analyzed data from about 1,200 people who sought care for mild memory problems. About 300 patients were given the blood test, known as amyloid probability score 2, or APS2. Their results were compared with results from spinal taps or PET scans.\n\nThe researchers also asked primary care doctors and memory specialists to determine based on evaluations which patients had Alzheimer's disease. The researchers discovered that the primary care doctors were wrong in their Alzheimer's disease diagnosis 36% of the time. They were also wrong 41% of the time when they thought patients didn't have Alzheimer's disease but actually did.\n\nMemory specialists did a little better: They were wrong 25% of the time in giving patients an Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and 29% of the time in missing a proper diagnosis.\n\nBut the blood test was only wrong 10% of the time.\n\nMeet the experts: Verna Porter, M.D., a neurologist and director of the Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease and Neurocognitive Disorders at Pacific Neuroscience Institute in Santa Monica, CA, Matthew Schrag, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of neurology at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine; Michal Schnaider Beeri, Ph.D., director of the Herbert and Jacqueline Krieger Klein Alzheimer's Research Center at Rutgers University.\n\nSo, how does the APS2 test work and why it is important? Neurologists explain.\n\nWhat is the APS2 blood test for Alzheimer's disease, and how does it work?\n\nThe APS2 blood test for Alzheimer's disease is a blood test that's sold under the name PrecivityAD2. It looks at several ratios for certain blood biomarkers in identifying Alzheimer's disease -- APS2 and p-tau217.\n\n\"By analyzing these biomarkers, the model calculates a score, known as the Amyloid Probability Score 2 (APS2), which ranges from 0 to 100,\" explains Michal Schnaider Beeri, Ph.D., director of the Herbert and Jacqueline Krieger Klein Alzheimer's Research Center at Rutgers University. \"This score indicates the likelihood that a patient has amyloid plaques in their brain, which are the core pathology with Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nThe test is currently available in the U.S., but there aren't clinical guidelines for using it right now. Meaning, it's not considered part of the standard way of diagnosing Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe test is done via a simple blood draw, and the sample is then shipped off to a lab for analysis. From there, doctors will get a positive or negative result that tells whether there is a high or low likelihood that someone has brain amyloids. Brain amyloids are proteins that clump together to form plaques in the brain and are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, per the National Institute on Aging (NIA).\n\nWho should get the APS2 blood test for Alzheimer's disease?\n\nRight now, there are no clear clinical guidelines to spell out how this test should be used. Also worth noting: The blood test wasn't very accurate in the earliest stage of Alzheimer's disease, and was highest when patients had dementia. So, there seems to be a sweet spot in using it.\n\nStill, doctors say interest in the test is understandable. \"This could significantly improve early diagnosis and patient management, ideally, providing earlier access to treatment,\" says Verna Porter, M.D., a neurologist and director of the Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease and Neurocognitive Disorders at Pacific Neuroscience Institute in Santa Monica, CA.\n\nWhat is the most accurate diagnostic test for Alzheimer's disease?\n\nDoctors have a few different options for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease, and that's a big deal. \"Over... 20 years or so, the single biggest success in Alzheimer's disease is in how we diagnose it,\" says Matthew Schrag, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of neurology at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. \"Not long ago, Alzheimer's disease was an autopsy diagnosis, which is not particularly practical.\"\n\nNow, Dr. Scrag says that doctors can get \"excellent diagnostic results\" using certain kinds of PET scans or by measuring cerebrospinal fluid. \"But these types of PET scans are expensive and not available at most sites, and cerebrospinal fluid tests require a lumbar puncture,\" he says. \"Having a reliable blood test on the market would make the diagnostic process much easier.\"\n\nDr. Scrag points out that this isn't the only blood test for Alzheimer's disease out there. \"A number of blood tests are looking promising, and most are based on detecting forms of beta-amyloid and/or tau in the blood -- the test in this paper uses both approaches,\" he explains.\n\nBut while Dr. Scrag calls these study results \"impressive,\" he says people shouldn't assume that it's more reliable than a doctor. Why? \"The results need to be interpreted in the context of patients' symptoms,\" he explains.\n\nDr. Porter says that more research is needed to see how best to use these tests in the future. \"This includes assessing whether early and accurate diagnosis through blood tests leads to timely and appropriate treatment interventions, improved patient prognoses, and better overall healthcare efficiency,\" she says.\n\nThis particular test was used on a sample group in Sweden and Dr. Scrag says it's important to use it on different demographics in the future, along with making sure the findings can be replicated. \"Nevertheless, this is a promising result and hopefully will be thoroughly validated and available in the clinic in the near future,\" he says.\n\nYou Might Also

Lecanemab and donanemab are available in the US after being granted approval by the FDA.\n\nBut scientists are now increasingly claiming that while the headline data indicates a significant effect size, the impact of the drugs is so small it would not be recognisable by a doctor or the patient.\n\nDr Madhav Thambisetty, a senior clinical investigator at the US National Institute on Aging, spoke at one of the largest scientific conferences in the world earlier this year and warned that some participants in the study trials of the drugs lost up to three teaspoons of brain volume.\n\nThere have also been calls for the drug manufacturers to be more transparent with their data and provide more long-term information to the public about these drugs.\n\nDoctors have also warned that just two per cent of eligible people with early signs of Alzheimer's will be able to receive the drug due to the need for specialist PET brain scans which are not routinely available.\n\nThe Cambridge scientists say that the price of the drugs, the demands on the patient and health service in the administering of the treatment, and the high risk of side effects, make the potential roll out of the treatments \"extremely challenging for even the best-funded healthcare systems\".\n\n'A part of the puzzle'\n\nJen Keen, head of policy at Alzheimer's Society, says the two drugs \"are not a cure [but] they are a part of the puzzle\".\n\n\"Despite the issues raised in this research, we remain at an important and exciting moment for dementia. Scientists are learning more all the time about Alzheimer's disease and our ability to slow it down,\" she added.\n\n\"There are currently 164 active clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease and we expect more treatments to be submitted for regulatory approval in the future.\"\n\nA spokesman for donanemab manufacturer Eli Lilly said: \"Any new treatments are reviewed by the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) and would subsequently be considered by Nice (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) to determine clinical and cost-effectiveness and patient eligibility.\n\n\"Access to any new medicine will also depend on the appropriate diagnostic and treatment pathway being available for healthcare professionals and patients.\n\n\"Lilly is committed to

One characteristic of Alzheimer's is the build-up of clusters of misfolded proteins, one of these being a form of amyloid, leading to plaques in the brain. The cascade hypothesis, a dominant theory in the field, suggests that this triggers a series of processes which together lead to dementia symptoms.\n\nAdvances in developing treatments to reduce symptoms and slow down the progression in the early stages of Alzheimer's have been slow. However, there has been recent excitement surrounding amyloid immunotherapy agents, drugs that harness the immune system to remove amyloid pathology.\n\nTwo completed phase III randomized controlled trials of amyloid immunotherapy reported statistically significant reductions in the rate of cognitive and functional decline compared to placebos.\n\nBut as the Cambridge team point out, the effect sizes were small -- small enough that a doctor would struggle to tell the difference between the average decline of a patient on the drug and another on placebo, after 18 months. The drugs were also associated with significant adverse events, including brain swelling and bleeding; during the phase III trial of one agent, donanemab, there were also three deaths attributed to the treatment.\n\nCrucially, there is little known about the long-term effects of the drugs beyond the 18-month trial periods. Long-term placebo-controlled trials, which would be needed to see if there is any clinically meaningful slowing of decline, are unlikely to be feasible where drugs are already approved.\n\nDespite this, the US Food and Drug Administration has licensed two such drugs. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended rejecting one (lecanemab) predominantly on the grounds that the small effects seen do not outweigh the risk from side effects; it is reviewing the other. The UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is expected to take a decision on both drugs imminently.\n\nEdo Richard, Professor of Neurology at Radboud University Medical Centre in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, and co-author, said, \"If these drugs are approved by regulators in the UK and Europe, and become available, it is understandable that some people with early Alzheimer's will still want to try these drugs, given their despair living with this dreadful disease. But there is a lot of hyperbole around the reporting of these drugs, and significant effort will be needed to provide balanced information to patients to enable informed decisions.\"\n\nPress coverage of the drugs has implied they are suitable for anyone with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's. However, while the trials included those with \"early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease,\" it excluded those with other conditions that may have been contributing to their symptoms. Evidence suggests that the people in the trials represent less than 8% of those in the community with early Alzheimer's disease. Those in the trials were up to 10 to 15 years younger than those typically presenting to health services with early symptoms.\n\nLead author Dr. Sebastian Walsh, NIHR Doctoral Fellow in Public Health Medicine at Cambridge Public Health, University of Cambridge, added, \"If approved, the drugs are likely to be relevant only for a relatively small cohort of Alzheimer's patients, so potential recipients will need to undergo a range of assessments before being given access to the drugs. Plus, effect sizes seen in the trials are very small and the drugs will need to be administered as early in the disease process as possible, when symptoms are mild -- and people in these phases of disease can be hard to identify.\"\n\nThe resource requirements for rolling out such treatments are likely to be considerable. Even if approved for only a small proportion of Alzheimer's patients, a much broader group of people will need to be assessed for eligibility, requiring rapid specialist clinical assessment and tests. The authors question whether this is the best use of these resources, given the existing strain on health systems. Support would also be required for the large number of Alzheimer's patients (potentially as many as 92%) found to be ineligible. Those found to have insufficient amyloid to be eligible may then require follow-up assessments to determine eligibility in the future, with the further implications for services this would entail.\n\nProfessor Carol Brayne, Co-director of Cambridge Public Health, said, \"Even in high-income countries, rolling out such types of treatments at scale is highly challenging, but most dementia occurs in low- and middle-income countries. Health systems in these countries are highly unlikely to have the resources required to offer these new drugs, even to a very narrow group.\n\n\"Other compelling evidence suggests that attention to inequalities and health experience across people's lives could have greater impact on the rates of dementia in populations. Most dementia is more complicated than a single protein.\"\n\nThe team concludes that based on current evidence, it is far from clear whether amyloid immunotherapy can ever significantly reduce suffering caused by dementia at scale in the community, and we must continue to explore other approaches.\n\nProfessor Brayne added, \"With an aging population, we urgently need effective ways to support people living with dementia, but while the current amyloid immunotherapies may show a glint of promise for very selected groups, it's clear these drugs will not address dementia risk at scale.\"", "source": {"uri": "medicalxpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medical Xpress - Medical and Health News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Cambridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immunotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Phases of clinical research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Placebo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicines_and_Healthcare_products_Regulatory_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Effect size"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protein folding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Randomized controlled trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statistical significance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_event", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adverse event"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cerebral edema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bleeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2018/6-alzheimers.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792612", "eventUri": "eng-9792612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

A drug could be approved by as early as 2027.\n\nXanamem shares some similar traits to the mechanisms of GLP-1 drugs, in that it improves insulin sensitivity and may share some of the same metabolic benefits in the brain.\n\nHowever, it has been developed by Actinogen to target the toxic effects of the \"stress hormone\" cortisol in the brain - something that GLP-1 drugs don't do.\n\nXanamem also has a different safety profile.\n\n\"GLP-1 drugs work by in part by preventing your stomach emptying, which makes you feel full, with nausea as a main side effect,\" Dr Gourlay says.\n\n\"This is not a good profile for many Alzheimer's patients who forget to eat and are already losing weight.\"\n\nActinogen listed in October 2007 at 50 cents apiece, with an initial focus on soil-derived antibiotic-like compounds called actinomycetes (hence the Actinogen name).\n\nIn a radical course correction, Actinogen acquired Xanamem as UE2343 in 2014 from Edinburgh University, which had completed a phase I trial.\n\nAustralian clinical development started in 2015.\n\nDr Bill Ketelbey joined the company as CEO in December 2014. Dr Ketelbey was involved in developing Aricept, which remains the leading Alzheimer's treatment despite being developed almost 30 years ago.\n\nDr Gourlay succeeded Dr Ketelbey in early 2021. Dr Gourlay previously worked in senior roles at Genentech and then with Dr Geoff Brooke (now Actinogen chair) at GBS Venture Partners.\n\nAs founding chief medical officer of the San Francisco-based Principia Biopharma, he helped to take two immunology programs to advanced trials, at which point Sanofi acquired the company for $US3.7 billion ($A5.5 million).\n\nXananem is a brain tissue cortisol synthesis inhibitor, potentially with applications for psychiatric and neuro-degenerative diseases beyond Alzheimer's and depression (such as Fragile X syndrome and cognitive impairment in schizophrenia).\n\nOther Alzheimer's drugs work by inhibiting the formation of amyloid proteins, which form as plaques and are thought to be a key contributor to the disease.\n\nXanamem takes a different tack by inhibiting production of cortisol, which is synthesized by an enzyme called 11 beta HSD1.\n\nCortisol is a naturally occurring stress hormone and essential for the body, but elevated levels over a long period are thought to contribute to both Alzheimer's and mild cognitive impairment (which can often lead to the former).\n\nXanamem is expected not to interact with other drugs so could be used in older patients taking medications for conditions such as cholesterol and blood pressure.\n\nTo be effective, any drug first must cross the blood-brain barrier, the organ's natural defence against foreign agents. Xanamem appears to do this.\n\nTo date, Actinogen has studied 11 beta HSD1 inhibition in more than 350 patients and volunteers.\n\nActinogen has staged a remarkable recovery from the dark days of mid-2019, when its key trial - Xanadu - failed.\n\nThe study of 185 patients with clinical mild Alzheimer's disease showed Xanamem over 12 weeks worked no better than placebo.\n\nBut the company cut the data another way - as you do - by examining the stored blood samples of 72 of the enrolees to see if they had 'confirmed' Alzheimer's. This was measured by elevated blood levels of a protein biomarker called pTau181 or phosphorylated tau.\n\nThe results showed half the patients had a low level of the biomarker and showed no progression at all - and thus possibly didn't have Alzheimer's disease in the first place.\n\nIn patients with a high level of the biomarker, indicating 'real' Alzheimer's, twice as many Xanamem-treated patients had stable or improved disease relative to placebo, with a 60 to 80 percent reduction in disease progression over 12 weeks.\n\nThe company is running two phase II trials, the first of which is about to report results.\n\nThe phase IIa trial, Xanacidd, is studying the ability of Xanamem to improve cognitive dysfunction (difficulty thinking, remembering and solving problems) associated with major depression.\n\nThe trial has completed visits with 167 patients enrolled and will report top-line data on the primary endpoint of cognition, with secondary endpoints including reducing depression.\n\nOver six weeks, the patients receive 10 milligrams of either Xanamem or a placebo daily (in some cases in addition to their existing anti-depressant drugs).\n\nThe primary endpoint is a composite of three computerized Cogstate tests for working memory and attention.\n\nA key secondary endpoint is the commonly used Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale.\n\nDr Gourlay says that while anti-depressants might improve mood, they do little for the cognitive impairment or foggy thinking of patients with depression.\n\n\"Demonstrating improved cognition in patients with depression could pave the way for Xanamem to be used in other psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, where cognitive impairment is profound.\"\n\nA second phase IIb trial, Xanamia, is recruiting patients with biomarker-positive mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe 220 patients are dosed over 36 weeks - also with 10mg - and are included if they have elevated p-Tau blood levels.\n\nThe patients are assessed on both cognition and Alzheimer's progression.\n\n\"We believe we have already validated the target by showing improved cognition in healthy older volunteers and potentially a big clinical benefit in biomarker-positive patients with Alzheimer's,\" Dr Gourlay says.\n\nInterim results - covering the first 100 patients at the 24-week mark - are expected in mid-2025. Final results are expected in mid-2026.\n\nDr Gourlay says getting a depression drug to market would require at least two more pivotal trials, about twice the size of the current trial.\n\nHe expects the depression drug to be progressed with a partner, while the company would like to expand the current Alzheimer's study to more sites, off its own bat.\n\n\"This potentially could form one of the pivotal studies,\" he says. \"We would start the second phase III pivotal study as soon as we could and hopefully that would bring forward approval by a year or so.\"\n\nThe company expects FDA breakthrough designation for Alzheimer's and potentially for cognitive impairment in depression.\n\nPlenty of Alzheimer's drug development is taking place but so far there is no magic bullet.\n\nIn July, the FDA approved Eli Lilly's Kisunla (donanemab), a monoclonal antibody infusion for mild cognitive impairment or early Alzheimer's that targets the amyloid protein.\n\nIn February, sales of Biogen's first amyloid antibody, Aduhelm (aducanumab), were discontinued, reportedly because of poor sales and/or side effects.\n\nBiotech scholars will recall that the FDA in 2021 approved Aduhelm on the basis of only one positive phase III trial, snubbing the advice of its own 10-member expert committee.\n\n(Three of them quit, with one describing the decision as the worst drug approval in history).\n\nDr Gourlay says such drugs have set a low bar for approval because of their modest benefits and need for intensive safety monitoring and side effects.\n\n\"The amyloid drugs have probably shown the best data they can, so we are unlikely to see a better story emerge with amyloid as the target.\"\n\nActinogen has completed a placement and rights offer that raised $8.9 million, at 2.5 cents apiece. Holders received one share for every 15 held, plus one option for every two shares subscribed for.\n\nThe options are exercisable at five cents within three years. The company also has unlisted options exercisable at 3.75 cents, expiring in 2026 and if fully exercised all of these options would raise up to $16 million.\n\nActinogen's new CFO Will Souter says that with around $9.5 million in the bank and an expected $8 million research and development tax rebate, the company is funded to late 2025.\n\nCurrent cash burn is \"elevated\" but is expected to subside in the December quarter with the completion of the cognition/ depression trial.\n\nUnlike many other drug developers, Actinogen carries out most of the clinical work in house, rather than cede it to a contract research organisation (CRO).\n\n\"It is significantly cheaper than using a CRO and trial staff at sites love the direct relationship,\" Dr Gourlay says.\n\nOver the last year Actinogen shares have traded between two cents (in a prolonged period between August 2023 and January 2024) and the current zenith.\n\nHistorically the shares peaked shortly after listing in October 2007, at 55 cents and hit a nadir of one cent in September 2019.\n\nBoard: Dr Geoff Brooke (chair), Dr Gourlay, Dr George Morstyn, Malcolm McComas, Dr Nicki Vasquez\n\nFinancials (June quarter 2024): revenue $100,000, cash outflows $5.1 million, cash balance $9.5 million, quarters of funding: 1.9, but says it has resources to late 2025.\n\nGlobally, 55 million people have Alzheimer's disease - 500,000 in Australia - and the World Health Organisation rates the disease as the seventh-biggest cause of death (as of 2020).\n\nThe global Alzheimer's therapeutics market size is estimated to grow from $US4.82 billion in 2023 to around US$8.18 billion by 2032.\n\nIf Xanamem succeeds, Edison Research estimates peak sales of $US5 billion in the early 2030s, while depression is a $US2 billion market.\n\nNaturally, Actinogen has a long way to go, but Dr Gourlay is heartened by some big-ticket transactions in the neurology sector at pre-approval or even early stage.\n\nLast December, Bristol Myers Squibb acquired the Nasdaq-listed Karuna Therapeutics for $US14 billion. Karuna is developing its Karxt agent for schizophrenia and Alzheimer's, having lodged an FDA submission for the former.\n\nKarxt works by reducing dopamine levels in the brain, so there's more than one way to skin this rabbit.\n\nAs for the Ozempic-style drugs, do they pose a competitive threat to Actinogen in the same manner as Resmed (sleep apnoea) and CSL's Vifor arm (kidney dialysis)?\n\nDr Gourlay's premise is there will be a place for the 'Ozempics' in the Alzheimer's space: \"they probably will be better than the anti-amyloids but they won't be the safe and effective oral treatment, such as the one we are developing\".\n\nSo, the short answer is \"no\".\n\nOzempics or not, the Alzheimer's treatment Olympics is still an open race to the winner's podium.", "source": {"uri":

But improving dementia diagnosis can help us prepare for new treatments whilst also benefiting many more people living with dementia.\n\n\"Despite the issues raised in this research, we remain at an important and exciting moment for dementia. Scientists are learning more all the time about Alzheimer's disease and our ability to slow it down.\n\n\"There are currently 164 active clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease and we expect more treatments to be submitted for regulatory approval in the future.\"\n\nProfessor Carol Brayne, co-director of Cambridge Public Health, said: \"Even in high-income countries, rolling out such types of treatments at scale is highly challenging, but most dementia occurs in low and middle-income countries.\n\n\"Health systems in these countries are highly unlikely to have the resources required to offer these new drugs, even to a very narrow group.\n\n\"Other compelling evidence suggests that attention to inequalities and health experience across people's lives could have greater impact on the rates of dementia in populations. Most dementia is more complicated than a single protein.\n\n\"With an ageing population, we urgently need effective ways to support people living with dementia, but while the current amyloid immunotherapies may show a glint of promise for very selected groups, it's clear these drugs will not address dementia risk at scale.\"\n\nA spokesman for donanemab manufacturer Eli Lilly said: \"Any new treatments are reviewed by the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) and would subsequently be considered by Nice (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) to determine clinical and cost-effectiveness and patient eligibility.\n\n\"Access to any new medicine will also depend on the appropriate diagnostic and treatment pathway being available for healthcare professionals and patients.\n\n\"Lilly is committed to partnering with the NHS and regulatory bodies to ensure new innovations can reach the people that need them.\"", "source": {"uri":

Credit: SciTechDaily.com\n\nResearchers question the impact of amyloid immunotherapy on Alzheimer's, highlighting the small benefits versus significant risks and costs.\n\nDespite regulatory approval by the FDA, other bodies like the EMA express reservations, reflecting broader concerns about these treatments' real-world efficacy.\n\nCambridge researchers have cast doubt on whether new amyloid immunotherapy drugs will have the desired effect of significantly reducing the impact of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nWriting in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, the team from Cambridge Public Health argues that substantial challenges including the risk-benefit ratio, limited eligibility, and high cost of the roll-out will limit any benefits of these treatments.\n\nAlzheimer's disease is often quoted as causing 70% of the 55 million cases of dementia worldwide, though the definition of what constitutes the disease is hotly debated. One characteristic of Alzheimer's is the build-up of clusters of misfolded proteins, one of these being a form of amyloid, leading to plaques in the brain. The cascade hypothesis, a dominant theory in the field, suggests that this triggers a series of processes that together lead to dementia symptoms.\n\nAdvances in developing treatments to reduce symptoms and slow down the progression in the early stages of Alzheimer's have been slow. However, there has been recent excitement surrounding amyloid immunotherapy agents, drugs that harness the immune system to remove amyloid pathology.\n\nTwo completed phase III randomized controlled trials of amyloid immunotherapy reported statistically significant reductions in the rate of cognitive and functional decline compared to the placebo.\n\nBut as the Cambridge team point out, the effect sizes were small - small enough that a doctor would struggle to tell the difference between the average decline of a patient on the drug and another on placebo, after 18 months. The drugs were also associated with significant adverse events, including brain swelling and bleeding; during the phase III trial of one agent, donanemab, there were also three deaths attributed to the treatment.\n\nCrucially, there is little known about the long-term effects of the drugs beyond the 18-month trial periods. Long-term placebo-controlled trials, which would be needed to see if there is any clinically meaningful slowing of decline, are unlikely to be feasible where drugs are already approved.\n\nDespite this, the US Food and Drug Administration has licensed two such drugs. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended rejecting one (lecanemab) predominantly on the grounds that the small effects seen do not outweigh the risk from side effects; it is reviewing the other. The UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is expected to take a decision on both drugs imminently.\n\nEdo Richard, Professor of Neurology at Radboud University Medical Centre in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, and co-author, said: \"If these drugs are approved by regulators in the UK and Europe, and become available, it is understandable that some people with early Alzheimer's will still want to try these drugs, given their despair living with this dreadful disease. But there is a lot of hyperbole around the reporting of these drugs, and significant effort will be needed to provide balanced information to patients to enable informed decisions.\"\n\nPress coverage of the drugs has implied they are suitable for anyone with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's. However, while the trials included those with 'early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease', it excluded those with other conditions that may have been contributing to their symptoms. Evidence suggests that the people in the trials represent less than 8% of those in the community with early Alzheimer's disease. Those in the trials were up to 10 to 15 years younger than those typically presenting to health services with early symptoms.\n\nLead author Dr. Sebastian Walsh, NIHR Doctoral Fellow in Public Health Medicine at Cambridge Public Health, University of Cambridge, added: \"If approved, the drugs are likely to be relevant only for a relatively small cohort of Alzheimer's patients, so potential recipients will need to undergo a range of assessments before being given access to the drugs. Plus, effect sizes seen in the trials are very small and the drugs will need be administered as early in the disease process as possible, when symptoms are mild - and people in these phases of disease can be hard to identify.\"\n\nThe resource requirements for rolling out such treatments are likely to be considerable. Even if approved for only a small proportion of Alzheimer's patients, a much broader group of people will need to be assessed for eligibility, requiring rapid specialist clinical assessment and tests. The authors question whether this is the best use of these resources, given the strain health systems are already under. Support would also be required for the large number of Alzheimer's patients (potentially as many as 92%) found to be ineligible. Those found to have insufficient amyloid to be eligible may then require follow-up assessments to determine eligibility in the future, with the further implications for services this would entail.\n\nProfessor Carol Brayne, Co-director of Cambridge Public Health, said: \"Even in high-income countries, rolling out such types of treatments at scale is highly challenging, but most dementia occurs in low- and middle-income countries. Health systems in these countries are highly unlikely to have the resources required to offer these new drugs, even to a very narrow group.\n\n\"Other compelling evidence suggests that attention to inequalities and health experience across people's lives could have greater impact on the rates of dementia in populations. Most dementia is more complicated than a single protein.\"\n\nThe team concludes that based on current evidence, it is far from clear whether amyloid immunotherapy can ever significantly reduce suffering caused by dementia at scale in the community, and we must continue to explore other approaches.\n\nProfessor Brayne added: \"With an aging population, we urgently need effective ways to support people living with dementia, but while the current amyloid immunotherapies may show a glint of promise for very selected groups, it's clear these drugs will not address dementia risk at scale.\"\n\nReference: \"Considering challenges for the new Alzheimer's drugs: clinical, population, and health system perspectives\" by Walsh, S et al., 6 August 2024, Alzheimer's & Dementia.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/alz.14108", "source": {"uri": "scitechdaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SciTechDaily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Effect size"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Cambridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immunotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Phases of clinical research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Placebo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Medicines_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Medicines Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicines_and_Healthcare_products_Regulatory_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protein folding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skepticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_event", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adverse event"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cerebral edema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Placebo-controlled study"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bleeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://scitechdaily.com/images/Senior-Vision-Alzheimers-Eyes-Concept.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792612", "eventUri": "eng-9792612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Some of the most common side effects include dizziness, nausea, confusion, hallucination, psychosis, low blood pressure, agitation and delusion, according to StatPearls research. Long-term use can lead to complications like irreversible motor function changes, which affects roughly 50% of patients who take the drug for five to 10 years. Because of these side effects, \"our next step is to investigate how dopamine regulates neprilysin in the brain, which should yield a new preventive approach that can be initiated at the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease,\" Dr. Watamura Naoto, first author of the study and researcher with the RIKEN Center for Brain Science, said in a statement.\n\nDopamine -- also known as the \"feel-good neurotransmitter\" -- is a hormone and a type of neurotransmitter in the brain that's used by the nervous system to send messages to the nerves, according to the Cleveland Clinic. It plays an important role in the brain's reward system because it's released by the brain when a person does something that's pleasurable. This rush of dopamine causes a person to seek more of that feeling, which can lead to behaviors like drug and alcohol addiction and overeating, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Research has shown the hormone may play a big part in dementia because low dopamine levels may indicate early signs of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.\n\n6.7 million. That's how many Americans aged 65 years or older had Alzheimer's in 2023, according to the Alzheimer's Association. Around one in nine people aged 65 or older have Alzheimer's.\n\nErectile dysfunction drugs like Viagra may also be key Alzheimer's treatments, according to a Neurology study published in February. The researchers found participants who were prescribed erectile dysfunction drugs were 18% less likely to develop Alzheimer's than their counterparts who weren't. The types of drugs used in the study are called phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors, and the researchers believe PDE5Is may reduce Alzheimer's risk because some forms of the drugs can improve brain health by increasing blood flow to the brain, and reducing the amount of energy neurons consumed in the brain.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-DOPA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "L-DOPA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dopamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neurotransmitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hypotension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizziness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dizziness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parkinson's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motor control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reward system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nerve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nervous system"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66b271f1d8bfa4baa10a7dc6/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1891,1064,x0,y56,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792612", "eventUri": "eng-9792612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

The research involved over 200 individuals with Alzheimer's disease who were divided into two groups: one receiving Liraglutide and the other receiving a placebo. Over the course of a year, the participants underwent regular cognitive function tests and MRI scans to monitor changes in brain health.\n\nThe results were compelling, showing an 18% slower decline in cognitive function in the group receiving Liraglutide compared to the placebo group. Furthermore, there was an almost 50% reduction in volume loss in key brain regions associated with memory, language, decision-making, and learning -- functions that are often impacted by Alzheimer's.\n\nLead researcher Paul Edison, a neuroscience and medicine professor at Imperial College London said, \"The slower loss of brain volume suggests liraglutide protects the brain, much like statins protect the heart.\"\n\nWhile further research is necessary to comprehensively understand the mechanisms and potential applications of Liraglutide in treating Alzheimer's and dementia, Edison proposed several ways in which the drug might be beneficial.

The drug -- part of a family of treatments called GLP-1 agonists -- took the medical world (and internet) by storm for helping people manage diabetes, lower the risk of heart disease, and rapidly lose weight.\n\nThe drugs may also protect the brain against dementia. In a clinical trial including over 200 people with mild Alzheimer's disease, a daily injection of a GLP-1 drug for one year slowed cognitive decline. When challenged with a battery of tests assessing memory, language skills, and decision-making, participants who took the drug remained sharper for longer than those who took a placebo -- an injection that looked the same but wasn't functional.\n\nThe results are the latest from the Evaluating Liraglutide in Alzheimer's Disease (ELAD) study led by Dr. Paul Edison at Imperial College London. Launched in 2014, the study was based on years of research in mice showing liraglutide -- a GLP-1 drug already approved for weight loss and diabetes management in the United States -- also protects the brain.\n\nIn Alzheimer's disease, neurons die off and the brain gradually loses volume. In the trial, Liraglutide slowed the process down, resulting in roughly 50 percent less volume lost in several areas of the brain related to memory compared to a placebo.\n\n\"We are in an era of unprecedented promise, with new treatments in various stages of development that slow or may possibly prevent cognitive decline due to Alzheimer's disease,\" said Dr. Maria C. Carrillo, Alzheimer's Association chief science officer and medical affairs lead, in a press release. \"This research provides hope that more options for changing the course of the disease are on the horizon.\"\n\nThe results were presented last month at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference.\n\nThe quest for an Alzheimer's disease treatment is littered with failures. Most treatments aim to tackle toxic protein clumps that build up inside the brain. It's thought that breaking them up could prevent neurons from withering away.\n\nA few have had limited success. Last month, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a drug that breaks down the clumps in people already experiencing symptoms at an early stage of the disease. A few weeks later, the European Medicines Agency refused to approve another drug that also targets the clumps, saying the effects of delaying cognitive decline didn't balance the risk of serious side effects, including brain swelling and bleeding.\n\nOther scientists have looked elsewhere -- specifically, diabetes. Insulin helps maintain brain health, and Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease. Rather than directly breaking down protein clumps in the brain, might we protect the brain by tweaking the body's metabolism?\n\nEnter GLP-1 drugs. These mimic hormones released by the stomach after a satisfying meal, tricking the brain into thinking you're full. In other words, the drugs don't only influence the gut -- they also change brain functions.\n\nIn a mouse model of Alzheimer's, daily injections of liraglutide for eight weeks prevented memory problems. Their neurons also thrived. Synapses -- the junctions connecting brain cells -- were still able to rapidly form neural networks in areas especially damaged by the disease. Surprisingly, toxic protein clumps also declined by up to 50 percent, and inflammation dropped.\n\nLiraglutide didn't just work on neurons. Another study, also in an Alzheimer's mouse model, found it rapidly tweaked the metabolism of a particular kind of star-shaped brain cell that supports neurons. These cells don't form neural networks, but they do help provide energy. In Alzheimer's, they stop functioning normally, but liraglutide reversed the decline. In mice, the drug improved the cells' ability to support neurons, allowing the neurons to flourish and connect to others. The brain also made better use of sugar -- its primary fuel -- allowing it to give birth to new neurons in a region important for memory.\n\nBut as the field frustratingly knows, mice are not people. Many promising treatments in mice have failed in clinical studies, earning these endeavors the nickname \"graveyard of dreams.\"\n\nEdison took on the task of extending the research from mice to humans. In 2019, he and his colleagues detailed plans for a clinical trial to gauge liraglutide's effects in people with mild Alzheimer's. Called ELAD, the study was to be randomized and double-blind -- the gold standard in clinical trials. Here, neither doctor nor patient knows who's getting liraglutide or the placebo.\n\nThey recruited 204 people to receive injections, either liraglutide or placebo, every day for a year. Before the trial, each person had an MRI scan to map their brain's structure and volume. Other scans recorded brain metabolism, and a battery of memory tests detailed cognition. These tests were repeated at the end, with safety checkups in between, in case of side effects.\n\nThe study had several goals. One was to see if liraglutide increased the brain's metabolism in regions heavily impacted by Alzheimer's -- those related to learning, memory, and decision-making. Another examined brain volume, which decreases as the disease progresses. The last evaluated cognitive tests of memory, comprehension, language, and spatial navigation.\n\nPeople who took liraglutide had nearly 50 percent less brain volume loss, especially in regions associated with reasoning and learning. \"The slower loss of brain volume suggests liraglutide protects the brain, much like statins protect the heart,\" said Dr. Edison.\n\nLiraglutide also boosted cognition. Comparing scores from before the trial, at its midpoint, and at the end, those who received the drug had an 18 percent slower decline than those who took the placebo. However, the drug didn't affect brain metabolism.\n\nSide effects were relatively mild. The most common was nausea. More serious ones, not specified, occurred in 18 patients but weren't likely related to the treatment according to Edison.\n\nTo be clear, the team presented the results at a conference, and they haven't yet been formally vetted by other experts in the field. But they add to accumulating evidence that GLP-1 drugs slow cognitive decline. A Swedish study in June conducted a simulated trial in people with Type 2 diabetes given GLP-1 or two other types of drugs and assessed their cognition afterward. Using health data records from over 88,000 participants followed over four years, GLP-1 drugs were better than the two other diabetes drugs at keeping the risk of dementia at bay.\n\nWe don't yet know how liraglutide protects the brain. Based on studies in mice, it likely works multiple ways, such as reducing inflammation, clearing toxic protein clumps, and improving communicate between neurons, Edison said.\n\nBut the idea is gaining steam. EVOKE Plus, a late stage clinical trial of semaglutide -- the chemical in Ozempic -- is ongoing. The study will take about three and a half years, with an estimated enrollment of 1,840 people with early Alzheimer's disease. It's set to conclude in late 2026.\n\n\"Repurposing drugs already approved for other conditions has the advantage of providing data and experience from previous research and practical use -- so we already know a lot about real-world effectiveness in other diseases and side effects,\" said Carrillo.", "source": {"uri": "singularityhub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Singularity Hub"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shelly_fan@singularityhub.com", "name": "Shelly Fan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liraglutide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liraglutide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glucagon-like peptide-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neuron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Placebo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Weight loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Edison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaglutide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semaglutide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Model organism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College_London", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imperial College London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toxicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metabolism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://singularityhub.com/uploads/2024/08/brain-colorful-regions-1.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792612", "eventUri": "eng-9792612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

The report said: \"The major factors driving the growth of the Alzheimer's disease diagnostics and therapeutics market are the increasing use of biomarkers in Alzheimer's diagnosis and drug development and the rising prevalence of Alzheimer's worldwide. For instance, in September 2023, a report by the WHO stated that about 55 million people around the world are living with dementia, and nearly 10 million cases are reported annually. WHO also said that Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia and constitutes about 60%-70% of the total cases of dementia. Also, with the growing prevalence of Alzheimer's around the world, government and non-government entities are investing heavily in developing diagnostics and therapeutics for the disease, which may augment the market's growth.\" Active biotech, pharma companies in the markets this week include: Annovis Bio Inc.

Thus, the studied market is expected to witness healthy growth over the forecast period due to the use of biomarkers, increasing research and development, and advanced diagnostic technologies. North America is expected to witness significant growth over the forecast period owing to the high burden of Alzheimer's disease and the increasing aging population, huge investment in research and development activities, and the launch of new products in the region. Also, the growing aging population in the region is expected to increase the burden of Alzheimer's disease, as the geriatric population is more prone to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's as it is an age-associated disease. For instance, in March 2022, the Alzheimer's Association Report stated that approximately 6.2 million people aged 65 years and more are living with Alzheimer's-related dementia in the United States, and it is projected that this number will increase to 13.8 million people by 2060.\"\n\nAnnovis Bio (NYSE:ANVS) Reveals Preclinical Data on Buntanetap in Combination with GLP-1 Agonist Trulicity for Enhanced Alzheimer's Treatment - Annovis Bio Inc. (\"Annovis\" or the \"Company\"), a late-stage clinical drug platform company pioneering transformative therapies for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), today announced new preclinical data demonstrating the synergistic effect of its lead compound, buntanetap, when combined with the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist dulaglutide (Trulicity) in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nGLP-1 agonists, commonly used to treat diabetes, weight loss, and heart conditions, are now showing promising potential in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Recent data presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC) 2024 revealed that another GLP-1 agonist, liraglutide (Victoza), was able to decrease cognitive decline in Alzheimer's patients by 18% and reduce brain shrinkage in regions responsible for cognitive functions.\n\nIn 2018, Annovis Bio published data showing that buntanetap fully restored memory, learning, and synaptic potentiation in an Alzheimer's mouse model (Teich et al. 2018). Building on this research, Annovis recently investigated whether combining buntanetap with the GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide would produce a synergistic effect in the same animal model. The results were compelling: while buntanetap alone restored cognitive function to 100% and dulaglutide alone to 80%, the combination of these two compounds not only restored cognitive function but also enhanced it beyond levels seen in healthy controls.

The higher incidence of this neurodegenerative disorder has significantly elevated the demand for therapeutic solutions. Alzheimer's is characterized as a chronic brain condition that frequently results in dementia, particularly in older individuals. It adversely affects memory, cognitive function, and disrupts daily routines. Advanced age is a significant factor in increasing the likelihood of developing this condition... Other risk factors involve cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, and conditions related to vascular health. Notably, there is no singular test for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. The global Alzheimer's Disease Therapeutics Market is witnessing robust growth driven by a combination of factors. The escalating aging population, particularly in developed nations, is contributing to a rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease. Advances in diagnostic tools, neuroimaging, and molecular biomarkers are enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis, facilitating timely interventions. Immunotherapy, such as Aducanumab, and the exploration of various drug classes like cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists, signify an evolving landscape in therapeutic approaches. Active biotech, pharma companies in the markets this week include: Annovis Bio Inc. (NYSE: ANVS) (ANVS Profile), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY), GSK plc (NYSE: GSK), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO).\n\nAccording to a recent Market.us report, the global Alzheimer's Disease Therapeutics Market size is forecasted to exceed USD 30.8 Billion by 2033, with a promising CAGR of 18.8%from 2024 to 2033. The report said: \"Additionally, the market is propelled by ongoing research efforts, increased funding, and strategic partnerships to develop novel drugs and therapies. Despite past challenges, the continuous pursuit of innovative solutions and a deeper understanding of the multifaceted nature of Alzheimer's disease are fueling optimism for sustained market growth and improved outcomes for patients in the foreseeable future. Economic conditions play a crucial role in determining the overall healthcare landscape, affecting funding, research, and patient access to treatments. Government healthcare policies and regulations, particularly those related to drug approvals and reimbursement, significantly impact the market. Additionally, demographic trends, such as aging populations in many regions, contribute to the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, driving demand for therapeutics. Economic stability and healthcare infrastructure also influence the affordability and accessibility of treatments.\"\n\nAnnovis Bio (NYSE:ANVS) Reveals Preclinical Data on Buntanetap in Combination with GLP-1 Agonist Trulicity\u00ae for Enhanced Alzheimer's Treatment - Annovis Bio Inc. (\"Annovis\" or the \"Company\"), a late-stage clinical drug platform company pioneering transformative therapies for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), today announced new preclinical data demonstrating the synergistic effect of its lead compound, buntanetap, when combined with the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist dulaglutide (Trulicity\u00ae) in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nGLP-1 agonists, commonly used to treat diabetes, weight loss, and heart conditions, are now showing promising potential in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Recent data presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference\u00ae (AAIC\u00ae) 2024 revealed that another GLP-1 agonist, liraglutide (Victoza), was able to decrease cognitive decline in Alzheimer's patients by 18% and reduce brain shrinkage in regions responsible for cognitive functions.\n\nIn 2018, Annovis Bio published data showing that buntanetap fully restored memory, learning, and synaptic potentiation in an Alzheimer's mouse model (Teich et al. 2018). Building on this research, Annovis recently investigated whether combining buntanetap with the GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide would produce a synergistic effect in the same animal model. The results were compelling: while buntanetap alone restored cognitive function to 100% and dulaglutide alone to 80%, the combination of these two compounds not only restored cognitive function but also enhanced it beyond levels seen in healthy controls.

Tirzepatide demonstrated statistically significant improvements in both primary endpoints with a reduction in the risk of heart failure outcomes, assessed as a composite endpoint, and improvements in heart failure symptoms and physical limitations, as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) Clinical Summary Score (CSS), compared with placebo.\n\nAll key secondary endpoints were also met, including improvement in exercise capacity as measured by the 6-Minute Walk-Test Distance (6MWD), reduction in the inflammation marker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and mean body weight reduction from baseline at 52 weeks. For the efficacy estimand,tirzepatide led to a 15.7% body weight reduction compared to 2.2% for placebo. For the treatment-regimen estimand, tirzepatide led to a 13.9% body weight reduction compared to 2.2% for placebo.\n\nGSK plc (NYSE: GSK) recently announced the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Jemperli (dostarlimab-gxly) in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel (chemotherapy) followed by Jemperli as a single agent for the treatment of adult patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. This approval broadens the previous indication for Jemperli plus chemotherapy to include patients with mismatch repair proficient (MMRp)/microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors who represent 70-75% of patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer and who have limited treatment options. The supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) supporting this expanded indication received Priority Review and was approved ahead of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date.\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) recently announced that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion for an update of the Wegovy(semaglutide 2.4 mg) label to reflect data from the SELECT cardiovascular outcomes trial, demonstrating a risk reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attack (myocardial infarction) or non-fatal stroke in adults with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) and either overweight or obesity (initial BMI \u226527 kg/m) without diabetes.\n\nThe SELECT trial demonstrated that Wegovy statistically significantly reduced the risk of MACE by 20% compared to placebo when added to standard of care. In addition, the findings from SELECT showed that over a period of up to five years, risk reductions in MACE were achieved regardless of baseline age, sex, race, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI) and level of renal function impairment. The exact mechanism of cardiovascular risk reduction has not been established but is likely multifactorial.\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) recently reported financial results for the second quarter of 2024 and raised its full-year 2024 guidance for both Revenues and Adjusted diluted EPS. The second-quarter 2024 earnings presentation and accompanying prepared remarks from management as well as the quarterly update to Pfizer's R&D pipeline can be found at www.pfizer.com.\n\nDr. Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated: \"We are driving progress toward our 2024 strategic priorities through solid execution across the company. I am pleased with the strong performance of our product portfolio in the second quarter led by several of our acquired products, key in-line brands and recent commercial launches.

Planning ahead for weather changes, including extreme heat, can prevent injuries and help a person feel more relaxed and less overwhelmed.\n\n\"People living with Alzheimer's and other dementias can be more vulnerable than normal during extreme weather because their judgment may be impaired and they may be unable to communicate their discomfort,\" said Hammelev. \"It's important to take extra precautions with these individuals during periods of extreme heat or other severe weather conditions.\"\n\nThe Alzheimer's Association is offering important safety tips for caregivers and families dealing with Alzheimer's and other dementias to prepare for the hot days ahead:\n\n* Make a plan. Family and friends should prepare accordingly and make plans to regularly check in on a person living with Alzheimer's during periods of extreme heat. Arrange alternative plans for cooler spaces if air conditioning is unavailable, and make sure they dress in loose-fitting, light clothing.\n\n* Pay attention at night. Keep people living with Alzheimer's cool by using fans and keep the air conditioning on. At night, low temperatures can still exceed 75 degrees with little fluctuation in humidity levels, making for difficult sleeping conditions, heightened anxiety and increased agitation.\n\n* Prepare for behavioral changes. Research shows that heat can increase agitation and confusion in people. Try to remove behavioral triggers by addressing the person's physical needs related to the heat, then tending to their emotional needs.\n\n* Stay hydrated. Increased water intake is essential to maintaining good hydration and health during extreme heat. Know the signs of heat exhaustion to avoid heat stroke. Dehydration may be difficult to notice in a person living with Alzheimer's, as signs like increased fatigue, dry mouth and headache may be difficult to detect. People taking diuretics, sedatives, or certain heart medications may not sweat as much as others, but this does not mean they are not hot.\n\n* Stay indoors out of the sun. Heat stroke and heat exhaustion may occur in extreme heat conditions but symptoms may be difficult to detect in people living with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Keep individuals cool by using air conditioning at home or move to a public place, such as a senior center or shopping mall. If you must go outside, make sure your loved one is dressed appropriately with loose-fitting, light clothing and a hat and that they have applied a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher.\n\n* Stay informed. Keep an eye on local weather forecasts. High temperatures are not the only cause for concern. Humidity and air pollution can cause breathing difficulties. The person should be monitored regularly, and seek medical attention if symptoms arise of dehydration, heat exhaustion or heat stroke.\n\nThe Alzheimer's Association is available to help families prepare for and cope for such extraordinary circumstances.

Dickerson, MD, MMSc, has disclosed no relevant financial relationships.\n\nHello. My name is Brad Dickerson. I'm a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School in Boston, and director of the Frontotemporal Disorders Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, which is affiliated with our Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and our memory disorders clinic. I'm going to talk with you today about amyloid plaque-lowering monoclonal antibodies in Alzheimer's disease, and I'm going to focus on practical clinical experience.\n\nSo far, we've been working with lecanemab in our clinic. I want to focus on the practical clinical use of this new medication because it's the first in its class, and there's a large amount of interesting and challenging new experience that we're developing in rolling it out. We've been using it now for the past 6 months or so, and the first step in trying to determine whether a patient is an appropriate candidate for lecanemab is to figure out whether they have mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia that probably is happening as a result of Alzheimer's disease in the brain.\n\nAs you know, it's one of the most common causes of mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, but it's not the only cause by any means. There are plenty of people who have a mimic condition, and there are also people who have multiple conditions that are contributing to their cognitive impairment.\n\nThe first thing to do is a thorough clinical assessment, as you would do to make a new diagnosis. We want to figure out the patient's overall cognitive and functional status. Is it consistent with mild cognitive impairment, which is impairment in memory or one or more other domains of cognitive function? Could it be that the patient has language or executive function impairment, but their activities of daily living are relatively intact? Or is it mild dementia, which is impairment in memory, executive function, language, or more than one of those cognitive domains, with loss of independent social or occupational function?\n\nWe often augment our general clinical sense of this question of the patient's cognitive functional status with validated questionnaires that the patient themselves and, ideally, an informant who knows the person well can complete. We like to use the Functional Activities Questionnaire and also the Quick Dementia Rating System. They're not required, but one of them is ideally obtained on each patient that undergoes treatment with lecanemab.\n\nWe use those to try to determine the patient's overall cognitive functional status. Sometimes people are at the moderate stage of dementia; in that case, they're past the point where they would benefit regardless of whether it's Alzheimer's disease. Or they may be still cognitively unimpaired, in which case they may have subjective cognitive concerns or subjective cognitive decline, which is when the person themselves thinks their memory is changing but a thorough assessment does not show any evidence of impairment. In some cases, you may need a neuropsychological assessment to try to determine that.\n\nOnce you've determined that, you typically have a sense of their overall cognitive behavioral syndrome. You could also augment that, if you want, with another validated symptom survey instrument such as the Everyday Cognition Scale. We always try to ascertain neuropsychiatric symptoms as well, with an instrument such as the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Many patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease have depression, anxiety, or other psychiatric symptoms that are probably part of their overall condition.\n\nIt's also important to take into account the person's medical profile. We have to determine what their overall medical profile is and what medications they are taking in order to determine whether they are potentially eligible to take lecanemab.\n\nI think anticoagulation is the most common medical or medication-related exclusion criterion. Certain other medications may be as well, such as other kinds of antibody treatments, for example, for cancer. There's still much that's not fully known about potential interactions between the monoclonal antibodies against amyloid and other kinds of antibodies. When people have other inflammatory, autoimmune, or oncologic reasons to be receiving another antibody therapy, it's important to talk with their other clinicians to try to better understand what the possible interactions might be.\n\nI should mention that if a person has active, unstable psychiatric symptoms, such as psychosis, it's really not advisable to give them this type of therapy. We have to try to work toward getting them stabilized in regard to those types of symptoms.\n\nWe've got the cognitive functional status; cognitive behavioral syndrome, including neuropsychiatric symptoms; and medical profile. Once all of those things are evaluated and we're comfortable with where patients are, we can move forward to thinking about the underlying brain disease.\n\nI should also mention that typically, office-based cognitive screening instruments such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) are administered. There are no hard cut-points for those, although in general, we want people to be performing in the mild dementia or mild cognitive impairment range, which for most people is above 15 on the MoCA and above 20 on the MMSE.\n\nIf people are lower than that owing to test taking anxiety or aphasia, they may still be in the mild overall stage of dementia or even mild cognitive impairment, so we don't want to interpret that test in isolation. We want to take it in the context of the person's overall functional status as well.\n\nWith all that in mind, the next step is a brain MRI scan with a gradient recalled echo (GRE), or a susceptibility-weighted image sequence, and also a T2 sequence or flare sequence because we want to be able to look for the overall atrophy pattern. Is there atrophy consistent with early-stage Alzheimer's disease?\n\nWe also want to evaluate whether they have cerebrovascular disease that may be contributing to their symptoms. If they're greater than 2 on the Fazekas rating scale for cerebrovascular white-matter abnormality, that is typically an exclusionary criterion because the thinking is that cerebrovascular disease may be an important contributor to their cognitive impairment.\n\nThe most important thing, though, is to evaluate for microhemorrhage or other types of hemorrhage with the susceptibility-weighted image or GRE sequence. If people have more than four microbleeds, superficial siderosis, or other evidence of hemorrhage already, that's a contraindication to this class of therapies as well. There are some nuances around that, so I would encourage you to talk with your neuroradiologist to better understand how to apply that.\n\nOnce we get that information, then we can think about biomarkers. We need to test for a molecular biomarker that shows that the person probably has Alzheimer's disease, and we need to make an adjudication about whether we think that's the driving condition behind their cognitive impairment. Typically, that's determined by doing an amyloid PET scan or testing for cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of amyloid and tau. Those are the gold-standard biomarkers to prove that a person has evidence of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology in their brain.\n\nIt's up to the clinician to make sure that they believe that is the driver of their cognitive impairment, or at least one significant driver of their cognitive impairment. We do have some patients, for example, with frontotemporal lobar degeneration who are a little bit older and that's the main driver of their cognitive impairment but they have a positive amyloid PET scan, which you can see increasingly as people get older, without Alzheimer's disease being the main driver of their symptoms.\n\nOne way that we adjudicate that, at least at our center, is with FDG-PET. That can really help you determine how much neurodegeneration is present and what the localization of that is, with the idea that if it's posterior temporoparietal hypometabolism, that's typical of the neurodegeneration that is usually driven by neurofibrillary tau tangles in Alzheimer's disease and consistent with what you would expect to be a driving force behind their cognitive impairment.\n\nOnce we get those molecular biomarkers or a molecular biomarker to support the idea that Alzheimer's disease is present in the brain, then we can think about other aspects of risk stratification for the use of lecanemab. This will be similar for donanemab in the future. A key issue is the APOE4 genetic status. We don't test for that routinely as part of the diagnostic evaluation because it's a probabilistic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nSome people have it and do not have Alzheimer's disease, and some people do not carry the APOE4 gene and have Alzheimer's disease. We know that people who carry one APOE4 allele are at slightly elevated risk compared with people who do not, and homozygotes who carry two APOE4 alleles are at substantially elevated risk for the amyloid-related imaging abnormality (ARIA) side effects, which relate to edema and hemorrhage associated with these treatments. It's important to discuss the meaning of that genetic information for the patient, and also the fact that it is genetic information, so it potentially has implications for other family members.\n\nOnce we have all that information, we can have a real risk-benefit ratio discussion with patients. I like to talk first about the clinical benefits that were observed in the clinical trials, which include slowing of decline on changes in cognitive and functional outcomes. Nobody gets better that we know of so far, but they got worse at a slower rate by about 25%, on average, over the course of 18 months, in the clinical trial.\n\nWe need to recognize that it's not necessarily straightforward for us to figure out if a person is getting worse at a slower rate than they would have, but that's the expectation we would have for what the successful treatment with this medication would result in.\n\nWe also need, of course, to talk about the risks; that includes infusion-related reactions, which occur at the time of infusion, usually the first infusion or the first few infusions. Those are typically mild, but they're fairly common in about 25% of people. Those are typically fever, chills, or other flu-like illness that is transient and usually easily managed with simple medications like acetaminophen or diphenhydramine.\n\nThen there are the ARIA that need to be followed by surveillance MRI scans after patients start the treatment. Somewhere around 10%-15% of patients develop those on the scans, but only a smaller percentage -- and that's APOE dependent -- develop symptoms associated with those abnormalities. We have to talk through what those are and how best to report on them.\n\nThat's everything that goes into starting and considering treatment with amyloid plaque-lowering monoclonal antibodies.\n\nI hope this has been a useful discussion about some of the ways that we approach rolling out these treatments in patients. We look forward to the opportunity to take advantage of more new treatments for Alzheimer's disease as they, hopefully, emerge in the near future.", "source": {"uri": "medscape.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medscape"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_impairment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cognitive impairment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mild_cognitive_impairment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mild cognitive impairment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibody", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monoclonal antibody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Executive functions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Biomarker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Subjectivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antibody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cerebrovascular disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvard Medical School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Activities of daily living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychiatry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neuropsychiatry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_General_Hospital", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts General Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://img.medscapestatic.com/vim/live/professional_assets/medscape/thumbnail_library/C48666811_COE-Dickerson_thumb_VIM_v4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792612", "eventUri": "eng-9792612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

See what findings Philly-based researchers presented at last week's largest meeting of dementia experts, held at the Convention Center.\n\nPhiladelphia's leading Alzheimer's and dementia researchers took center stage at an international conference hosted at the Pennsylvania Convention Center last week.\n\nThe international meeting of the Alzheimer's Association, the world's largest gathering of researchers and clinicians focused on Alzheimer's and dementia, made headlines for presentations about emerging insights into and treatment options for a debilitating memory disease that is still not well understood.\n\nHighlights included a new blood test that can diagnose patients with Alzheimer's better than clinicians, and reporting that people exposed to wildfires and those who regularly ate processed red meats (such as hot dogs, bacon, and sausage) were more likely to develop dementia.\n\nHere are some other noteworthy findings presented by Philadelphia-based researchers.\n\nPeople who attend religious services are more likely to live longer and have better mental health, but less is known about the effect of a spiritual practice on brain health, according to Katherine Britt, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nTo investigate, Britt and her team reviewed data from more than 150 older adults (average age 74) in the Philadelphia area. The researchers found that any major changes in spiritual activity -- either attending services more or less frequently -- were linked to lower cognitive health.\n\nSpecifically, they saw that older adults who said they had changed how often they attend religious services in the past year were more likely to have worse cognitive scores. But these results were seen only in Black study participants, not white.\n\nWhat might underlie these racial differences? \"I don't think we know the answer to that yet,\" said Britt. But over and over, she sees the same result: \"In all my work, I keep finding associations: Different dimensions of religion or spirituality are associated with better cognitive health and memory.\"\n\nIt's possible that people who stopped going to services may have been experiencing illnesses that made it hard for them to attend, she noted. But for those who can attend, religious services offer many positive benefits for older adults, such as social interaction and resources, Britt said.\n\nWhat's more, spirituality can give people a sense of meaning and purpose, and is often associated with positive thinking, such as hope and optimism for the future, Britt added -- all of which could bode well for the brain.\n\nTraditional cognitive tests -- for instance, listening to a list of random words and repeating them back -- are less than ideal for diagnosing dementia. They often don't capture real-life skills, and, like many standardized tests, white people tend to perform better than Black people. These differences are not based in biology, and have instead been attributed to social disparities, such as in education.\n\nSo researchers are exploring other, better ways to measure brain health. In a version of a testing approach pioneered at Moss Rehab, researchers at Temple University asked 100 older adults living in the Philly area to try traditional cognitive testing, then do something very different: Make breakfast and lunch using everyday objects such as bread, a toaster, and jelly.\n\nThe researchers filmed and timed participants, and noted any potential errors, such as reaching for the wrong object, or being inefficient by moving items around unnecessarily.\n\nThey found that Black participants scored worse than white participants in traditional cognitive tests, but performed equally well in many of the measures related to making a meal.\n\nThe findings suggest that testing that measures skills people perform in their everyday lives could provide accurate measures of brain health, especially among Black patients. Study author Tania Giovannetti, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Temple, said she and her team are now trying to develop a digital version of the meal-making task for the clinic, where patients move simulated food items around on a touchscreen. \"We call that our virtual kitchen,\" she said.\n\nBy the time most older adults have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and dementia, they have other health conditions, as well.\n\nTo determine which conditions coexist most frequently with cognitive decline, researchers from Drexel University and Thomas Jefferson University Hospital scanned data from nearly 35,000 people ages 65 and older, looking for people diagnosed with Alzheimer's and related dementias. They noted whether they also had 12 other chronic conditions, including high cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and arthritis.\n\nThe researchers found that people with Alzheimer's and dementia were more likely to have at least four other health conditions than those who had not been diagnosed with cognitive decline. The conditions most associated with Alzheimer's and dementia were stroke, depression, and other mental health conditions.\n\nGoing outside for physical activity is good for older adults, but just how many are doing it is unclear.\n\nA study of more than 3,000 older adults by Drexel researchers found that, relative to people who go outside everyday, people who infrequently spend time outdoors were more likely to show signs of dementia, or live in neighborhoods that feel unsafe.\n\nThe findings suggest that older adults' neighborhoods could make it harder for them to engage in healthy behaviors such as going outside, the researchers note.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alison_mccook@inquirer.com", "name":

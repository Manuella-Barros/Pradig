They said the statue represents hatred and bigotry while also saying they disavow the \"tyranny\" of the \"alt left\" and \"leftist violence.\"\n\n\"This extremism should not be allowed in our country,\" one Trump supporter says on the video. \"If we disavow Nazism, we should disavow Marxism as well.\"\n\nTrump supporters continued to chant \"Stop alt left hate\" and \"Lenin is Hitler.\"\n\nSome Fremont residents countered their arguments.\n\n\"It's Fremont. It's satire. It was found in a junk yard,\" said one man passing by.\n\n\"Fremont makes fun of things,\" he said. \"We are making fun of him ... We make fun of Trump. We make fun of Obama. We make fun of Hillary.\"\n\nThe following Facebook live feed contains some mature language.\n\nSome interactions around the statue on Wednesday spiraled into yelling matches. But many conversations between Trump supporters and residents were tense but friendly; most agreeing in the right to free speech. Many parted ways with a handshake or a hug.\n\nThe demonstration comes as attention is drawn to many historical statues throughout America. A rally around a Robert E. Lee statue in Charlottesville, Va. led to a white supremacist allegedly driving his car through a crowd of counter protestors, killing one woman and injuring many others.\n\nRELATED: Trump believes Charlottesville demonstration was about a statue\n\nIt is not the first time that someone has called for the removal of the Lenin statue. A silicon valley venture capitalist recently promoted that Fremont's statue should go.\n\nIt is unique. We believe it is the only representation portraying Lenin surrounded by guns and flames instead of holding a book or waving his hat. The sculptor, while fulfilling the requirements of his state commission, was nevertheless able to express his vision of Lenin as a violent revolutionary; not just an intellectual and theoretician.\n\nThe statue was removed during the revolution in 1989. Lewis Carpenter, an American veteran who once taught in Poprad, admired the statue.

Joining him were were about five people holding signs that said \"Lenin is Hitler\" and \"my family in Venezuela hate this guy.\"\n\n\"All of these people which have been targeted by alt left hate -- this statue represents them, this statue represents their murder. This is a Russian. This is not an American citizen. This idol of evil must be torn down.\"\n\nHe's wrong though. The Lenin statue was brought to the United States by an American veteran teaching in Slovakia. It was erected there in 1988, only to be toppled in the revolution a year later. The veteran found the sculpture lying face-down and mortgaged his house to bring it to the United States.\n\nFar from honoring communism, the Lenin statue is a monument to kitsch. It stands in a small square next to a panini and falafel shop, as well as the Dumpling Tzar restaurant. While some Seattleites are conflicted about it, they've largely embraced it, even dressing it up in a tutu for Pride and sometimes clown makeup.\n\nThis Lenin is less \"bread and peace\" and more De Liberta Quirkas, Fremont's motto meaning, \"freedom to be peculiar.\"\n\nOne thing that separates the Lenin statue from the one of Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville is that it's private property. Jessica Vets, the director of the Fremont Chamber of Commerce, told The Stranger that the statue is privately owned, stands on privately owned land, and is not maintained by the city or by Fremont. Prosobiec, asked about whether the statue has any place in Seattle, or the United States in general, says yes: a museum.

Some see it as an intriguing art piece in a neighborhood known for compelling statues. Others over the decades have called for removal saying the statue is a reminder of a dictator who was responsible for the death of thousands.\n\nThe latest controversy with the Lenin statue came after there were calls and a petition to remove a Confederate monument from private property at Lake View Cemetery on Capitol Hill. Follow this link to read read a Q and A about the Confederate monument in Seattle.\n\nHow did the Lenin statue get to Seattle? Here is a Q and A created with information from the King County Department of Assessments, archived Seattle Times articles, information from the KIRO 7 archives and HistoryLink.org.\n\nHis full name was Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov. He was known as Lenin. He lived from 1870 to 1924 and under his administration Russia became a communist state. He founded the Russian Communist Party and led the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution.\n\nOpponents of Lenin's administration were suppressed in the Red Terror, a violent campaign administered by the state security services; tens of thousands were killed or interned in concentration camps, according to his Wikipedia page, which has extensive sources and additional reading. Lenin's administration defeated right and left-wing anti-Bolshevik armies in the Russian Civil War from 1917 to 1922 and oversaw the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1921, the page states.\n\nIt was commissioned by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and installed in 1988 in the city of Poprad in the former Czechoslovakia. Poprad is now Slovakia.\n\nEmil Venkov, a Bulgarian sculptor, created the statue that was installed in Communist Russia in 1988. Venkov won a competition to create the statue - originally envisioned as a smaller statue -- in 1978. But years of city politics endured before it was created. Venkov was born in 1937 in Bulgaria and died in June 2017.\n\nThe Lenin statue is 16 feet and made of bronze. It weighs somewhere between 7 and 8.5 tons depending on the news report.\n\nLewis Carpenter, an Issaquah native, found it in a Poprad scrap yard in 1993 and mortgaged his house for pay for the transport to the Northwest. Overall the project cost $40,000 to first bring it to Issaquah in 1993.\n\nCarpenter owned a construction company and had an interest in Slovakia after building homes for Slovakian families in the Seattle area, according to a story about him in The Seattle Times. Carpenter planned to start a Slovakian restaurant in Issaquah and install it there. The city of Issaquah talked about installing it there as public art, but that plan was scrapped after residents objected.\n\nLewis Carpenter died in 1994 in a Stevens Pass car accident.\n\nShortly after his death, a home in Fremont became a reality. Peter Bevis, founder of Fremont Fine Arts Foundry, was called by another artist interesting in melting it. \"I saw it there and thought what a wonderful piece,\" he told The Times in 1995. \"The way it was done, it was a picture of an intellectual standing into the future.\"\n\nJeannie Muir, a Fremont Chamber of Commerce member, told The Seattle Times in June 1995 that it was a phenomenal piece of history.\n\nIt was unveiled in its first location on June 3, 1995. But spring rains in 1996 weakened the foundation enough that another location needed to be found.\n\nThe Lenin statue was first in a parking lot two blocks south of the current location and in October 1996 moved to its current location at Fremont Place North and North 36 Street. Local businesses donated enough money to pay for the state of Lenin to be moved to its current location.\n\nThe Carpenter family, which created a trust with the Fremont Chamber of Commerce. It's been offered for sale since 1995. The initial asking price was $150,000, when the scrap value of the bronze was $30,000. In 2015, the asking price was $250,000 or best offer.\n\nWhat is Seattle Mayor Ed Murray's response to protests at the Lenin statue?\n\n\"You can look at the statue in two ways,\" Murray told KIRO 7 on Wednesday. \"It is a statue of a man who killed hundreds of millions of people. It's also considered a joke. So is it a statue honoring him, or is it a statue actually making him into a joke? There are several different ways to look at it. I can see how some folks in the city, particularly from eastern Europe might find that Lenin statue not a joke, but perhaps something that should be removed.\"\n\nTo see what Murray said about the Confederate monument in Seattle, follow this link.\n\nIn 1996, vandals hit the statue with shaving cream turning the face and crotch green.\n\nVandals hit it multiple times in 1995. In June 1995 it was splattered with paint.\n\nWhen it was installed at its current location in 1996, the head of Seattle's Polish Home Association, Marian Strutynski, told The Seattle Times that she was appalled and equated Lenin with Stalin and Hitler, saying Lenin represents the deaths of millions of people.\n\nIn 2015, vandals painted the statue hands red in protest of Lenin's actions. And there have been other acts of vandalism, though the protesters on Wednesday did not damage the statue.\n\nOne notable call for removal was in 2001 when Matt Rosenberg, a Seattle writer and regular contributor to The Seattle Times opinion page, said the statue was unconscionable and illegal, and should be in the trash heap from which it was retrieved.\n\n\"Imagine a statue in Westlake Plaza of Hitler, who stoked ethnic and class hatred to inspire extermination of six million Jews. Unthinkable.\" Rosenberg wrote in a Times column on July 4, 2001. \"Yet, under the insidious, value-neutral rubric of \"provocative art,\" Seattle proudly displays a larger-than-life sculpture of a man equally abhorrent.\n\n\"His focus on strict adherence to the bloody principles of revolutionary class war led to a vastly greater death toll than that of Hitler. There's much to the ugly truth about Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, whose likeness shamefully stands in a public square in Fremont.\"\n\nRosenberg's column brought support and opposition in letters to the Times. Among the people who disagreed was Robert Benish, a Lake Forest Park resident.\n\n\"Whenever I drive by Fremont's Lenin statue, I am reminded that it is a display of the very freedom that makes our country the greatest in the world and that to retain that freedom we must remain ever vigilant to preserve it from the attacks of those who would deprive us of it,\" he wrote.", "id": "9612717",

There were no battles here -- but there some Civil War memorials around the state that are getting attention in light of the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend.\n\nSeattle's Lake View Cemetery on Capitol Hill, off 15th Avenue East, has been home to a Confederate veterans' memorial since 1926, The cemetery was closed Wednesday, and an office staff member said it was going to stay closed until things \"calm down.\" The manager declined to talk to Q13 News on camera.\n\nThe cemetery is also the resting place for Seattle founders like the Dennys and the Dexters. More recently, the cemetery attracts tourists to the graves of celebrities Bruce Lee and his son, Brandon Lee. The cemetery staff says they're just being cautious about vandals.\n\nOur news partner at The Seattle Times reports the Confederate monument has been vandalized twice in the past.\n\nMade from granite shipped intentionally from Georgia, the monument has been in the cemetery for 91 years. The inscription says it is in memory of the United Confederate Veterans. It was paid for on the private land by the Daughters of the Confederacy organization.\n\nBut, this is not the only memorial to the losing side of the Civil War in Washington state. Whether you know the street as Highway 99, Aurora Avenue North or Evergreen Way -- until 2016 it was named after the only president of the Confederate States of America, Jefferson Davis.\n\nAt another site, the Confederate flag flies at a place called \"Jefferson Davis Park\" on a private plot of land along Interstate 5 in Clark County just north of Vancouver, Wash. It is run by a group called the Sons of Confederate Veterans, Pacific NW Division.\n\nOn their Facebook page, it says that they have been under attack. In a statement pinned on the group's Facebook page Wednesday, the group said, \"Our ancestors fought against a tyrannical government, that invaded our lands, killed hundreds of thousands of southern soldiers and civilians. The confederate cause was and still is a just cause.\"\n\nIn regards to the Seattle Confederate memorial, a petition on the website Change.org had gathered more than 2,800 signatures by the time of this writing. It called for the mayor of Seattle to remove the memorial, which is on private property.\n\nMayor Ed Murray responded Wednesday afternoon, saying, \"We must remove statues and flags that represent this country's abhorrent history of slavery and oppression based on the color of people's skin. It is the right thing to do. During this troubling time when neo-Nazis and white power groups are escalating their racist activity, Seattle needs to join with cities and towns across the country who are sending a strong message by taking these archaic symbols down.\"\n\nHowever, the mayor's statement continues to say that he acknowledges that the memorial is on private property and while he's reached out to the Lake View Cemetery, there is nothing he can do about relocating or removing it.\n\nFor history lovers, just north of the Lake View Cemetery is a cemetery and official Seattle city park dedicated to the Grand Army of the Republic.

Lake View is still reviewing whether to re-open on Thursday.\n\n>> To read exactly what led to the monument getting created in Seattle, read this Q& A\n\nThe granite memorial -- surmounted by the Southern Cross has the insignia of the Daughters of the Confederacy - was created by the same sculptor who created a statue honoring Chief Sealth, the city's namesake. The 10-ton piece was shipped to Seattle from Stone Mountain in Georgia.\n\nIt was erected in 1926 after a United Daughters of the Confederacy chapter raised funds for the plot. During the dedication ceremony that same year, Tacoma mayor Elect M.G. Tennant said it \"called attention to the lasting good that had come out of the struggle between North and South.\"\n\n>> Two more confederate era monuments are in Washington state. Read where here\n\nThe people behind the online petition say they want it moved because, in addition to what they believe are racial overtones, the monument is not a gravestone. KIRO 7 News found twelve people are buried at the monument alongside a preserved capsule.\n\nMayor Murray said his office called Lake View about the monument on Wednesday. Here's a statement his office sent to KIRO 7:\n\n\"We must remove statues and flags that represent this country's abhorrent history of slavery and oppression based on the color of people's skin. It is the right thing to do. During this troubling time when neo-Nazis and white power groups are escalating their racist activity, Seattle needs to join with cities and towns across the country who are sending a strong message by taking these archaic symbols down.\n\n\"The monument to Confederate soldiers in the Lake View Cemetery is located on private property. My office has called the cemetery operator to express our concerns regarding the monument. As we continue our ongoing proactive work to be an inclusive and welcoming community, we must also join the fight against the mainstreaming of hateful and despicable far-right political ideology.\"\n\n> >There also was a protest on Wednesday at the Vladimir Lenin statue in Fremont. Follow this link to read a Q and A about the Lenin statue, which includes details about the protest.\n\nMany of the statues discussed for removal in other cities were on public property. And some leaders, like the mayor in Baltimore, argued that it was in the best interested of safety to remove four statues, according to their city charter.\n\nThere is not a law in Seattle that prohibits the mayor from removing something from private property. This is a broad topic and would likely be a matter of private property rights and free speech, which flow from both statutory and common law, King County Law Library staff said in an email.\n\nIn California, a Los Angeles cemetery did remove a confederate memorial on one of its plot, but it was at the hands of Long Beach chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy after a prompt from

Lee in Charlottesville.\n\nRELATED: Small group calls for removal of Fremont's Lenin statue\n\nThe 18-foot tall Lenin statue has called Fremont home since 1995 after being saved from destruction in Slovakia by a Issaquah man. Unlike most portrayals of Lenin, which depicted him as a scholar or philosopher, the Fremont statue casts him as a revolutionary, surrounding him with flames and weapons.\n\nThe statue is on private land held in trust by the Fremont Chamber of Commerce.\n\nOver two-plus decades, the statue has come to be regarded as one of Seattle's quirkiest art installations, joining the likes of its Fremont neighbors, the Troll and the Rocket, but there are those who maintained it has no place in the city. The statue, which sports a $250,000 price tag and is still awaiting for a buyer, is often vandalized with graffiti and red paint meant to look like blood.\n\nAfter its completion in 1988, the statue was toppled in 1989 after Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution, and that's when English teacher Lewis Carpenter found it in a scrapyard. The Issaquah resident then mortgaged his house to purchase and transport the statue to Washington in 1993 before his death in 1994.\n\nIssaquah debated displaying the statue before eventually deciding against it, and Carpenter's family planned to sell it to a Fremont foundry to melt it down, but Seattle sculptor Peter Bevis instead found a place to display the statue until the family found a buyer. It was unveiled on June 3, 1995, two blocks south of its current location.\n\nIts arrival in Seattle met with controversy.\n\n\"This is highly inappropriate in this community,\" artist Frederick Edelblut told SeattlePI shortly after its unveiling. \"It's not a piece of art. It's a disgrace, a a symbol of denigration, and a symbol of millions of people who have died in Eastern Europe from communist domination.\"\n\nBevis disagreed, contending that \"art outlives politics,\" which echoes a sentiment shared on Fremont's official website.\n\n\"This sculpture is placed here in the Artist's Republic of Fremont, as a symbol of an artistic spirit that outlasts regimes and ideologies, and as tangible proof that art does outlive politics,\" it reads.", "id": "9783983", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Seattle mayor hands Trump supporters big win", "image": "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/36/76/77/8122308/3/rawImage.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 3143, "date": "1995-06-03", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3155}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Slovak Republic"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "203", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "label": {"eng": "Slovak Republic"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Fremont"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "227708", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont,_California", "label": {"eng": "Fremont"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Issaquah"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "235203", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issaquah,_Washington", "label": {"eng": "Issaquah"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "235512", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "235649", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "242096", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Police"}, "id": "302532", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sculpture"}, "id": "302805", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculpture"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Politics"}, "id": "302948", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Art"}, "id": "303166", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "Statue"}, "id": "303774", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "304165", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vandalism"}, "id": "306826", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}, "id": "308415", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Private property"}, "id": "309653", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property"}, {"label": {"eng": "Graffiti"}, "id": "314901", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "317288", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia", "label": {"eng": "Czechoslovakia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "KIRO (AM)"}, "id": "324189", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIRO_(AM)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vladimir Lenin"}, "id": "326857", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert E.

He is a naval intelligence officer, according to NBC News, and has falsely accused Hillary Clinton of running a pedophile ring out of a pizza place in Washington D.C.\n\nHolocaust-denier and former leader of the KKK David Duke also retweeted about the statue Tuesday.\n\nThe statue is privately owned and on private property. It's also for sale for $250,000, according to the Seattle Times.\n\nBut it's not just extreme-right personalities who have advocated tearing down the statue.

I don't think there should be statues of such people.\"\n\nFremont is not the statue's first home. It was installed in the Sloviakia in 1988. Following the fall of the Soviet Union, it was torn down.\n\nAn American veteran and teacher spotted the sculpture in Eastern European scrap yard 1989, and mortgaged his house to bring the sculpture to Issaquah. The teacher recognized the statue as a piece of art, regardless of its subject.\n\nThe statue is now owned by the teacher's family, and it sits at the \"temporary viewing\" site in Fremont while it's for sale.\n\nAccording to Fremont.com, the presence of the sculpture is supposed to illicit a wide range of responses as a piece of art.\n\n\"If art is supposed to make us feel, not just feel good, then this sculpture is a successful work of art,\" the website reads. \"The challenge is to understand that this piece means different things to different people and to learn to listen to each other and respect different opinions.

Sign up for free news alerts from WND.com, America's independent news network.\n\nThe statue was brought to the U.S. after being toppled during the 1989 revolution that overthrew the Communist Party in the former Czechoslovakia.\n\nDefenders of the statue see it as ironic, particularly in the context of the quirky Fremont neighborhood. Known for its hippies and artists, Fremont's motto is \"De Libertas Quirkas,\" the freedom to be peculiar. A giant statue of a troll sits under a major bridge, the annual summer solstice parade features nude bicyclists, and a cast aluminum sculpture at a bus stop of six people and a dog, called \"Waiting for the Interurban,\" is regularly dressed up by locals in a variety of apparel.\n\nThe Seattle Times noted in a 2015 story on the Lenin statue that it is \"loved and hated - and very Fremont.\" The eight-ton bronze was brought to Seattle from Poprad, Slovakia, by a Seattle-area man, Lewis Carpenter, who was teaching in the former East bloc nation. Carpenter died in 1994, but his family still owns the statue and, as of 2015, it was for sale for $250,000 or best offer.\n\nThe Independent Journal Review reported that in addition to Fremont's Lenin, an 18-foot Lenin originally commissioned by the USSR stands on an apartment rooftop on the Lower East Side of New York City, and a large metallic bust of the Soviet founder is on display outside a museum in Los Angeles.\n\nRed Terror\n\nThe Soviet Union, according to an averaging of academic reports by the war histories website Necromatics.com, was responsible for 56 to 62 million \"unnatural deaths\" overall, with 34 to 49 million under Stalin.\n\nUnder the \"Red Terror\" of repression carried out by Lenin's Bolsheviks after the 1917 revolution, it's estimated by some scholars that as many as 1.5 million people were killed.\n\nHistorian Robert Conquest contends Stalin's purges were consistent with Lenin's principles and a natural outgrowth of the system he established. The architect of perestroika and glasnost under Mikhail Gorbachev, Alexander Yakovlev, said the \"truth is that in punitive operations Stalin did not think up anything that was not there under Lenin: executions, hostage taking, concentration camps, and all the rest.\"\n\n'There are no statues of Hitler'\n\nGeekWire, which is based in Fremont, reported some defended the statue in the Twitter thread featuring Evans' comments. They argue it's a private piece on private land, although it stands near a busy thoroughfare amid shops and restaurants.\n\nThe website representing The Artist's Republic of Fremont argues \"art outlasts politics\":\n\nThe presence of this sculpture has evoked a wide range of responses. If art is supposed to make us feel, not just feel good, then this sculpture is a successful work of art. The challenge is to understand that this piece means different things to different people and to learn to listen to each other and respect different opinions. From an artist's standpoint, all points of view are valid and important.\n\nAfter his opening salvo in the Twitter debate, Evans was more resolute.\n\n\"There are no statues of Hitler. There should be none of Lenin,\" he reasoned. \"I see no justification for statues deliberately praising a fight for slavery\"", "id": "9800441", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "  Tech

Lake View Cemetery closed Wednesday after receiving threats related to the monument.\n\nOn Thursday, Lake View Cemetery said it would remain closed until Monday morning, \"due to the controversy over Confederate memorials.\"\n\nThe monument, erected in 1926 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, and the Lenin statue are both on private property. Still, Murray said, he believes they should be removed.\n\n\"Not only do these kinds of symbols represent historic injustices, their existence causes pain among those who themselves or whose family members have been impacted by these atrocities,\" Murray said in the statement. \"We should remove all these symbols, no matter what political affiliation may have been assigned to them in the decades since they were erected. This includes both confederate memorials and statues idolizing the founder of the authoritarian soviet regime.\"\n\nA petition on Change.org for the removal of the Confederate memorial has 4,719 signatures. Across the nation, groups have denounced the monuments, memorials and historical markers to Confederate soldiers, following a deadly weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia. Three people were killed as protesters clashed over the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee.\n\n\"We should never forget our history, but we also should not idolize figures who have committed violent atrocities and sought to divide us based on who we are or where we came from,\" Murray said.\n\nIn his statement, Murray also mentioned for the first time the Lenin statue in Fremont, where a small group of protesters gathered Wednesday. The statue is for sale and is often vandalized with red paint on one hand to symbolize blood.\n\nState Sen. Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle, weighed in on the debate on the Lenin statue, saying that it shouldn't be removed. Carlyle, whose family left Poland in 1924 after attacks on Jewish villages, called the statue a testament to the defeat of a \"murderous, painful regime.\"\n\n\"Art can be offensive and painful, but it can also bring us alive with curiosity, wonder, knowledge. Installing a political statue of a man and regime that would never allow installation of political statues of opponents is a symbolic representation of the victory of democracy and freedom over oppression,\" he wrote on his blog. \"And of the role of art itself.\"", "id": "9803465", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Seattle Mayor Murray calls for removal of Confederate monument, Lenin statue", "image": "https://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/88625326-8393-11e7-99f8-edacd769bec0-780x1116.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "179", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "235512", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Politics"}, "id": "302948", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Violence"}, "id": "302966", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Political party"}, "id": "303038", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party"}, {"label": {"eng": "History"}, "id": "303747", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}, {"label": {"eng": "Statue"}, "id": "303774", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue"}, {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}, "id": "304050", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "304165", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "id": "304554", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}, "id": "305157", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "Change.org"}, "id": "306410", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change.org"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vandalism"}, "id": "306826", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Petition"}, "id": "306865", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petition"}, {"label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}, "id": "308415", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Private property"}, "id": "309653", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cemetery"}, "id": "314599", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cemetery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Memorial"}, "id": "326156", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vladimir Lenin"}, "id": "326857", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Monument"}, "id": "331127", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ed Murray (Washington politician)"}, "id": "350121", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Murray_(Washington_politician)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert E.

Baltimore officials tore down a statute of a Confederate soldier Tuesday night. Protesters toppled another statue in Durham. And debates have sprung up in other cities as well. But most of those debates concern monuments on public property.\n\nThe mayor's call to remove the monuments follows a remark yesterday in which he expressed \"concern\" over a memorial for Confederate veterans, which was installed at Lake View Cemetery in 1926. No bodies are buried beneath the stone memorial.\n\nLake View Cemetery, owned by a private nonprofit, closed yesterday over public interest in the monument, and a voicemail message says the cemetery plans to stay closed until Monday.

In 1995, an artist arranged to put the statute in a trust held by the Fremont Chamber of Commerce until someone purchases it. The Fremont Chamber of Commerce did not respond to The Stranger's request for comment.\n\nFewer than ten protesters, led by a conspiracy theorist who has twice been retweeted by Donald Trump, demonstrated in front of the Lenin statute yesterday in response to the movement against confederate monuments.\n\nState Sen. Reuven Carlyle wrote a statement on his personal blog arguing that the Lenin statute should stay, claiming it's purpose is to demonstrate \"our very ability to install political art is the triumph of democracy over tyranny.\" He said there's no equivalency between the Fremont sculpture and Confederate monuments coming down across the country.\n\n\"Unlike the Confederacy statues throughout our nation built to formally honor those in that battle of ideas, this statue is distinctly not showcased in Fremont to celebrate the murderous, painful regime,\" Carlyle said. \"It is instead installed as a testament to its defeat and the victory of open ideas through the medium and sometimes painful juxtaposition of art itself.\"\n\nThe Fremont Troll, the more iconic sculpture in the Northwest Seattle neighborhood, did not respond to The Stranger's request for comment.", "id": "9790373", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Mayor Murray Calls For Removal of Fremont Lenin Statue and Capitol Hill Confederate Monument", "image": "https://media1.fdncms.com/stranger/imager/u/original/25358135/1503009464-monuments.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "189313", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "235512", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Communism"}, "id": "304261", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}, "id": "305157", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Veteran"}, "id": "311563", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cemetery"}, "id": "314599", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cemetery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Puget Sound region"}, "id": "320821", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound_region"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vladimir Lenin"}, "id": "326857", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Monument"}, "id": "331127", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument"}, {"label": {"eng": "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic"}, "id": "338772", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic"}, {"label": {"eng": "KING-TV"}, "id": "431006", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KING-TV"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States Army"}, "id": "466039", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_Army"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lake View Cemetery"}, "id": "515414", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_View_Cemetery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Reuven Carlyle"}, "id": "808344", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuven_Carlyle"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of monuments and memorials of the Confederate States of America"}, "id": "1282363", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_monuments_and_memorials_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 3, "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical Specialties", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical_Specialties"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 156, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual Arts/Sculpture", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual_Arts/Sculpture"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 926, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Death"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 927, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death Care", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death_Care"}], "time": "22:53:00"}

That's because it's Seattle. And because Seattle is in the United States of America, nominally, most people have no problem seeing a statue of one of history's losers. Who cares? It's just a statue.\n\nBut now that there's a moral panic to get rid of anything with the word \"Confederate\" on it, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray is at least trying to play fair. Here's a statement he just released, courtesy of MyNorthwest.com:\n\n\"In the last few days, Seattleites have expressed concerns and frustration over symbols of hate, racism and violence that exist in our city. Not only do these kinds of symbols represent historic injustices, their existence causes pain among those who themselves or whose family members have been impacted by these atrocities. We should remove all these symbols, no matter what political affiliation may have been assigned to them in the decades since they were erected. This includes both confederate memorials and statues idolizing the founder of the authoritarian soviet regime. Both are on private property, but I believe the confederate memorial at Lake View Cemetery and the Lenin statue in Fremont should be removed. We should never forget our history, but we also should not idolize figures who have committed violent atrocities and sought to divide us based on who we are or where we came from.\"\n\nNow we'll see how committed Seattleites are to this principle. After all, Communism has killed a lot more people than the Confederacy ever did. If Confederate memorials need to be taken down, why not Communist memorials?\n\nHave fun grappling with the cognitive dissonance, lefties!", "id": "9771150", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Seattle Mayor Requests Removal Of Lenin Statue", "image": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/themes/thedc/images/the-dc.png", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "235512", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Violence"}, "id": "302966", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Political party"}, "id": "303038", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party"}, {"label": {"eng": "History"}, "id": "303747", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}, {"label": {"eng": "Statue"}, "id": "303774", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "304165", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Communism"}, "id": "304261", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}, "id": "308415", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Private property"}, "id": "309653", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vladimir Lenin"}, "id": "326857", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Frustration"}, "id": "364925", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frustration"}, {"label": {"eng": "Moral panic"}, "id": "398183", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_panic"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of statues of Vladimir Lenin"}, "id": "471290", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statues_of_Vladimir_Lenin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lake View Cemetery"}, "id": "515414", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_View_Cemetery"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of mayors of Seattle"}, "id": "613664", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mayors_of_Seattle"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 927, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death Care", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death_Care"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1031, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam"}], "time": "20:20:00"}

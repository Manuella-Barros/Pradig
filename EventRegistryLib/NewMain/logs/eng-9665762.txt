Now, in a related development, enrollment at the school is down, and they're laying off staff members.\n\nLongtime readers know that I am a graduate of Emerson. It brings me no joy to report this.\n\nEmerson College announces layoffs amidst enrollment decline linked to campus protests\n\nFollowing an enrollment decline, Emerson College, in an email sent to faculty and staff Tuesday, announced that it will lay off staff and not fill some vacant positions in fiscal year 2025, according to The Boston Globe.\n\nThe college is blaming the enrollment decline in part on \"negative press and social media\" from the pro-Palestinian demonstrations and subsequent arrests.\n\nIn the early morning hours of April 25, 118 student protesters were arrested by Boston police when officers swept through the pro-Palestine encampment at Boylston Place Alley, a public right-of-way that leads to the State Transportation Center.\n\nPresident Jay Bernhardt wrote that he expects the enrollment decline to last only one year, but the effects will ripple through the budget for the next several.\n\n\"We attribute this reduction to multiple factors, including national enrollment trends away from smaller private institutions, an enrollment deposit delay in response to the new FAFSA rollout, student protests targeting our yield events and campus tours, and negative press and social media generated from the demonstrations and arrests,\" Bernhardt wrote in an email shared with the Globe...\n\nBoston.com could not reach members of the Emerson Staff Union in time for publication...\n\n\"It doesn't make any sense,\" said Illona Yosefov, an instructional technologist at the college and chief steward of the union. Yosefov is also a member of the Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine.\n\nEmerson was one of several Boston-area colleges that saw pro-Palestinian protests inspired by student protesters at Columbia University. Protesters set up tents in a public alley next to Boylston Street in April. They said they wouldn't leave until Emerson called for a ceasefire in Gaza and divested from companies and institutions doing business with Israel\n\nOn April 25, Boston police in riot gear broke up the protests, arresting 108 at the camp. Four officers were injured during the arrests. Police said protesters were violating city ordinances by camping out in the alley, which is not solely owned by Emerson.\n\nEmerson said the enrollment decline is believed to be \"a one-year phenomenon,\" but it will still require \"immediate spending reductions\" to make up for lost tuition and housing revenue.\n\nParents of prospective students touring campus this past spring must have seen the protests, encampments, and all the unrest.", "source": {"uri": "legalinsurrection.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le\u00b7gal In\u00b7sur\u00b7rec\u00b7tion"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_lachance@legalinsurrection.com", "name": "Mike LaChance", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_College", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emerson College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Globe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Boston Globe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Police_Department", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Police Department"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-of-way_(transportation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-of-way (transportation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAFSA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FAFSA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boylston,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boylston, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boylston, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boylston_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boylston Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_ordinance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local ordinance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riot control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://legalinsurrection.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Emerson-College-Israel-Protest.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665762", "eventUri": "eng-9665762", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 809, "textEnd": 817, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

(RELATED: The Left's Anti-Americanism Problem Laid Bare In Nationwide Campus Protests)\n\nEmerson College President Jay Bernhardt sent a letter to faculty and staff informing them of the budget cuts and layoffs for the upcoming fiscal year.\n\n\"We attribute this reduction to multiple factors, including national enrollment trends away from smaller private institutions, an enrollment deposit delay in response to the new FAFSA rollout, student protests targeting our yield events and campus tours, and negative press and social media generated from the demonstrations and arrests,\" Bernhardt said in the letter sent to faculty, which was posted to X.\n\nPro-Palestinian protests took place on college campuses across the county, causing disruptions and injuring police officers. In May, New York University (NYU) students were arrested at a pro-Palestinian protest in New York City. The New York Police Department (NYPD) arrested 133 individuals, over half of them being outside agitators.\n\nEmerson College and Bernhardt did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

More colleges are preparing for the prospect of similar enrollment declines as a perfect storm of factors threatens to drive students to pursue alternative routes after high school.\n\nIn an email this week to faculty and staff, Emerson College President Jay Bernhardt said that the school is responding to an enrollment decline he anticipates will only affect fiscal 2025, but that budget cuts from loss of tuition should be anticipated for the next several years.\n\n\"We attribute this reduction to multiple factors, including national enrollment trends away from smaller private institutions, an enrollment deposit delay in response to the new FAFSA rollout, student protests targeting our yield events and campus tours, and negative press and social media generated from the demonstrations and arrests,\" Bernhardt's email stated.\n\nThe announcement came after Emerson College, like many schools across the country, dealt with pro-Palestinian protest encampments. Boston police adorned in riot gear put down the protest on April 25, resulting in the arrest of over 100 agitators.\n\nIt also comes after the Biden administration's botched rollout of the new Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, application, which many anticipate will sink enrollment across the board for at least the fall 2024 semester. Since the chaotic rollout, there has been a double-digit decline in completed FAFSA applications.\n\n\"Many colleges are financially on the edge,\" Adam Kissel, visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation's Center for Education Policy, told the Washington Examiner. \"Jolts like the FAFSA fiasco and bad handling of campus conflicts will send these colleges out of business more quickly.\"\n\nMichigan schools are seeing a decline in FAFSA applications, officials announced this week, despite the fact that state university officials say they are cautiously optimistic about overall enrollment numbers for the fall. According to Bridge Michigan, Eastern Michigan University has seen a 20% decline in FAFSA information for first-time students as well as continuing students.\n\nOverall, 41% of the state's graduating high schoolers have completed FAFSA, compared to 48% last year -- meaning nearly 7,400 students have not completed the application.\n\nWhile Kissel said there are multiple factors at play in declining enrollment, some appear to be cultural. Young people view colleges as both declining in importance at the same time tuition prices are skyrocketing.\n\nThe FAFSA debacle could push some prospective students to decide against attending college altogether, as they will have a year to start a life after high school if they delay enrollment due to the financial aid problems. Similarly, programs such as community college, certificates, and trade school are becoming more appealing to Generation Z.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nWhile those factors appear to be driving enrollment drops, some observers are also pointing to what has been labeled an \"enrollment cliff\" tied to the birthrate dropping significantly (23%) during the 2008 recession.\n\nWhile demographic decline has been predicted for some time, colleges are now facing down recession-era babies turning 18 and looking to attend college -- but there will simply be fewer of them. While that may not primarily affect colleges until 2025, the coming demographic drop means colleges such as Emerson that believe their enrollment decline will last one year could be wrong.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "breccan_f_thies@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Breccan F.

Could we be seeing this staple rule of Newtonian physics being carried out in another instance, that of declining enrollment in certain American liberal arts colleges? And if so, why?\n\nMaybe it's because those colleges coddle young skulls full of mush who spend their time protesting Israel's war against Hamas terrorists.\n\nA Boston liberal arts college admitted that the recent anti-Israel protests on campus have contributed to low enrollment for the upcoming academic year which will necessitate possible staffing cuts.\n\nIn an internal message this week, Emerson College president Jay Bernhardt pointed to \"multiple factors\" prompting a \"significant\" shortage in the incoming freshman class, including the protests and the press generated by them.\n\n\"We want to share with our community that the size of our incoming first-year class for Fall 2024 is significantly below what we had hoped,\" Bernhardt's statement declared this week.\n\nWhile it would be easy - and fun - to point at Emerson College and remind them that what goes around comes around, there may be more to it than this.\n\nSee Related: Ocasio-Cortez Is No Longer the Woke Darling at Columbia: She Dared to Support Israel's Iron Dome\n\nGOP Leader Slams Two-Tiered Justice System After Pro-Hamas Destruction Yields Zero Arrests\n\nHere's the onion:\n\n\"We attribute this reduction to multiple factors, including national enrollment trends away from smaller private institutions, an enrollment deposit delay in response to the new FAFSA rollout, student protests targeting our yield events and campus tours, and negative press and social media generated from the demonstrations and arrests.\"\n\nThere are a couple of layers to this onion. First, there is that little bit of hand-waving over trends away from smaller private institutions, and there can be little doubt that is in large part due to this:\n\nBernhardt disclosed that the school would be looking to implement layoffs and budget cuts to account for the lost revenue. Tuition for the 2024-25 school year is listed at $55,200, and room and board costs are more than $20,000.\n\nSo, attending this \"small private institution\" will set a typical student back $75,000 - per year. I remember very well my cost of tuition when I was attending the University of Northern Iowa in the early '80s, and even though the New GI Bill picked up much of the tab for my education, I do remember tuition being only around $750 per semester.\n\nSecond, note that the statement mentions the student protests, but get a load of the qualifier: \"...and negative press and social media generated from the demonstrations and arrests.\" So, not so much the protests, but rather, the fact that people had the temerity to report on the useful idiots who were, in effect, protesting in support of Hamas. Frankly, it's somewhat baffling they are getting any new students at all.\n\nNone of these seem likely to fulfill the main purpose of education, which is to equip young adults with skills that are valuable in the employment marketplace.\n\nEmerson's loss of enrollment isn't surprising. What's surprising is that anyone at all is paying $75K per annum for this horse squeeze. But the fact that, at least, enrollment is dropping may well be a small cause for hope that something might be salvaged from the higher education system.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ward_clark@redstate.com", "name": "Ward Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_College", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emerson College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classical mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_college", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberal arts college"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Modern liberalism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Onion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAFSA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FAFSA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iron Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Northern_Iowa", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Northern Iowa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._Bill", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "G.I.

According to the police, the protesters were breaking city ordinances that banned camping on public property, per CBS News.\n\nAlthough the decline in enrollment is expected to be \"a one-year phenomenon,\" the college will have to make \"immediate spending reductions\" -- including possible faculty layoffs, the letter stated.\n\n\"We will limit our staff and faculty searches next year and carefully review existing programs and offerings for future savings,\" Bernhardt said in the letter. \"Finally, we will need to eliminate some staff positions, both vacant and filled, and potentially reduce some faculty positions.\"\n\nAccording to the latest data on the college's website, Emerson enrolled 1,002 first-year students in fall 2022.\n\nThe college enrolled a total of 4,149 undergraduate students in fall 2022, 4,117 in fall 2021, and 3,708 in fall 2020, Boston Herald reported.\n\nThe number of students enrolled for the fall 2024 term has not been shared, and it's unclear how many students Emerson had expected for the upcoming semester. The college did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside regular business hours.\n\nHowever, declining college enrollment rates could also be due to the changing sentiments of the younger generation.\n\nMore and more Gen Zs no longer see the value in higher education.

Several Jewish students were so unsettled by the protests that they chose to relocate to off-campus hotel rooms. Others considered transferring.\n\nThe conflict came to a head when Massachusetts state troopers cleared the encampments at the direction of Boston's mayor, Michelle Wu, and arrested more than 100 students.\n\nThe administration reportedly posted bail for all of the arrested students, urged the Boston police to drop all charges, and even offered to provide them with summer housing until their legal cases were resolved.\n\nTheir over-the-top support for the arrested students drew criticism from Jewish community members, who accused the administration of \"appeasement.\"\n\nThe college president, Jay Bernhardt, eventually issued an apology, citing the administration's intentions to \"balance our genuine support for student civic activism without commitment to safety on our urban campus.\"\n\nReports of rampant antisemitism were not unique to Emerson nor was the mounting criticism of its administration's response. The college joins the likes of Harvard, Columbia, UCLA, and countless other universities which made headlines for becoming hotbeds of chaos, violence, antisemitism, and mistrust, all the while offering Jewish students little support.\n\nWhile Emerson leads the pack in its public announcement, the impact of antisemitism on Jewish students' school choice is already being seen.\n\nMost recently, Yeshiva University, a private Orthodox Jewish institution with four locations across New York, has reported an uptick in student applications. The university has seen a 53 percent increase in student transfer applications from Yale, Cornell, and Columbia, Fox Business reports.\n\nThe report stokes speculations of an impending Jewish student

Paxton, who died back in 2017, was one of the leads in the original film Twister (1996), which also starred Helen Hunt, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Cary Elwes, Alan Ruck and Jamie Gertz.\n\nTwister opened in cinemas during the summer movie season of '96, and now Powell and his castmates are carrying on the \"stormy\" mantle almost 30 years later. Powell wrote in loving memory of his friend and colleague Paxton in a social media post (via X, formerly Twitter):\n\nAs we release Twisters into the world today, I just wanted to look up and tip my hat to the legend that is Bill Paxton. A great friend of mine who saw poetry in the natural world. His boots are impossible to fill, but this life is all about chasing the greats.\n\nTwisters PG-13ActionAdventureThriller 3.5/5\n\nA follow-up to the 1996 original film Twister, Twisters is a sequel set years after the original, said to be fast-tracked by Steven Spielberg and Mark L. Smith, with Frank Marshal as producer. Little details exist about the film, but Helen Hunt is expected to reprise her role as Jo, with the film likely to pay homage to the late Bill Paxton.\n\nRelease Date July 19, 2024 Director Lee Isaac Chung Cast Daisy Edgar-Jones , Glen Powell , Anthony Ramos , Brandon Perea , Daryl McCormack Runtime 2h 2m Writers Michael Crichton , Mark L. Smith Studio Amblin Entertainment, The Kennedy/Marshall Company, Universal Pictures Tagline Chase. Ride. Survive. Distributor(s) Universal Pictures , Warner Bros. Pictures Expand\n\nA few years before Paxton passed away, Powell and the late actor collaborated together on director Will Wallace's Western, Red Wing (2013). The photo Powell shared of himself and Paxton on social media (below) is an image from that project.\n\nGlen Powell Fondly Remembers Friend & Colleague Bill Paxton Close\n\nTwisters storms into theaters and begins its theatrical run with $10.7 million thanks to its preview screenings domestically on Thursday. And while the follow-up isn't officially a sequel, there's a strong emotional connection to Twister thanks to the relationship formed between the franchise's stars Bill Paxton and Glen Powell. And, as an added bonus, Paxton's son James has a cameo in director Lee Isaac Chung's disaster movie. Powell said in an interview with Yahoo Entertainment:\n\n\"I think just knowing Bill and knowing how much this movie meant to him, and how he saw the world differently afterward, and then having his son James Paxton in this movie and shooting that sequence with him and hearing stories about Bill -- it all grounds it in a way that's hard to describe.\"\n\nRelated Glen Powell's Twisters Storms Out to a Higher Rotten Tomatoes Score Than the 1996 Original\n\nTwisters is receiving mixed reviews from critics, but the film's Tomatometer rating is still much higher than the original film.\n\nPowell said of his relationship with Paxton and how that bond resulted in making Twisters even more \"meaningful\" during the same interview:\n\n\"I think that's made this thing even more meaningful. [Twister] is a movie that really meant a lot to me as a kid, you know, growing up in Texas, it's a movie that felt very... just very much a story of kind of the community I grew up around and the people I grew up around.\"\n\nTwisters is forecast to make $45 million to $50 million domestically over its opening weekend, and the film already has the advantage of posting a far, far better Rotten Tomatoes audience score with the fans (93%) than the original film ever did (58%). At the time of this writing, it's still too early to report Twisters' CinemaScore.\n\nTwisters is now playing exclusively in theaters.", "source": {"uri": "movieweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Movieweb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisters_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twisters (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glen Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Paxton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Paxton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Hunt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Helen Hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "RoboCop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Isaac_Chung", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Isaac Chung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_L._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark L.

But the film did find a way to pay tribute to Bill Paxton, the star of Twister, and it's actually kind of sweet!\n\nIn Twister, Bill Paxton played storm chaser-turned-TV weatherman Bill Harding, who arrives in Oklahoma to get his ex-wife Jo (Helen Hunt) to sign divorce papers, so he can remarry, but ends up returning to his passion for chasing tornadoes along with his old team and, well, Jo. Similar to what Jurassic Park did for paleontology, Twister's release caused a major upswing in the number of people opting to study meteorology in the United States. When Paxton passed away in 2017, storm chasers even paid tribute to him by spelling his initials using the Spotter Network.\n\nAnd now, Twisters has tipped its cowboy hat to the actor and filmmaker by featuring his son James Paxton in a small role in the film!\n\nIn one scene from Twisters, Daisy Edgar-Jones and Glen Powell's characters Kate and Tyler are out watching a rodeo when a tornado hits the area. They run to a nearby motel to seek shelter and help other people, when they encounter a motel guest fighting with the manager over some issues with his room. And he's played by James Paxton! While what happens with this dissatisfied motel guest might not be the most important character arc, it was a nice way for the late actor's spirit to be present in the sequel!\n\nThis isn't the first time James Paxton has paid tribute to one of his father's works. Back in 2014, Bill Paxton starred in Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. as the bad guy, John Garrett. After Paxton's death, the show's final season in 2020 had James reprise the younger version of his father's character.\n\nFans of Paxton and Twister received another treat when actor Glen Powell posted a picture of him and Paxton to mark Twisters' release day. Powell called Bill \"A great friend of mine who saw poetry in the natural world,\" and added, \"His boots are impossible to fill, but this life is all about chasing the greats.\"\n\nAppearing on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert for Twisters promotions, Powell talked about how Paxton had helped with the research for his character in Apollo 13, and taught him an acting trick to avoid squinting when shooting outdoors, that he has been using all his career since then.\n\nBill Paxton and Glen Powell worked together on the 2017 Western Red Wing, which also starred Breann Johnson, Joelle Carter, Frances Fisher, and the late Luke Perry. But let's not forget their Spy Kids history too! Paxton played Dinky Winks in Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams and Spy Kids 3D: Game Over, with his son James Paxton playing Dinky Winks Jr in the third film. Powell starred in it too as Long-fingered Boy!\n\nTwisters is the perfect summer film and Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones' chemistry is already a hot topic, with fans unhappy that the film's ending changed a little scene that they really wanted to see.", "source": {"uri": "themarysue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mary Sue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jinal_bhatt@themarysue.com", "name": "Jinal Bhatt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisters_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twisters (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glen Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twister_(game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twister (game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Paxton_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James Paxton (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Paxton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Paxton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_Edgar-Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daisy Edgar-Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurassic Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Hunt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helen Hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_chasing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Storm chasing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_G._Harding", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warren G.

Twisters' first trailer also featured a \"critical scene\" that was almost deleted.\n\nGlen Powell's career is riding high following a string of breakout hits. Audiences found his charm irresistible in Top Gun: Maverick, and he proved he's leading-man material in Anyone but You and Hit Man. He's now venturing into blockbuster territory with Twisters, a standalone sequel to the 1996 disaster flick that starred Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt. The pair's onscreen chemistry was palpable in that film, something Powell and co-star Daisy Edgar-Jones have replicated in the sequel. The first Twisters trailer teased a film with spectacle and rom-com elements, but Powell's brief white T-shirt scene also helped. Director Lee Isaac Chung told Entertainment Weekly that his editing staff ensured that sequence wasn't deleted.\n\nRelated\n\nTwisters Blows the Minds of Critics As Sequel Lands Rotten Tomatoes Score\n\nTwisters, which features Glen Powell, Daisy Edgar-Jones and Anthony Ramos gets encouraging feedback before its anticipated debut on Jul. 19.\n\nClose\n\nThe first Twisters trailer ended with rapid-fire highlights, including a quick cut of Powell wearing a white T-shirt and white cowboy hat; the scene saw him casually walking as the rain drenches his shirt. \"I almost trimmed that shot,\" Chung revealed. \"But the funny thing is there were people on my editing staff who told me, 'You cannot trim that scene.' They almost rioted.\" While it's debatable if that shot was integral to the scene or the plot, Chung confirmed he made the right call, knowing how fans have responded. \"Yeah, seems like it,\" he quipped. Powell's charisma is indeed palpable throughout the film, emulating Paxton's charm in the 1996 original. Powell already has more films lined up, but Twisters affirmed he can headline a blockbuster.\n\nGlen Powell's Dream Role And Missed Opportunities\n\nPowell revealed he almost played key roles in Oppenheimer, Star Wars, and the Jurassic Park reboot. He's confirmed to star in The Running Man remake (currently in development), and that could make him a bankable action star. Some critics have suggested he would be perfect as Steven Rogers / Captain America, even though Powell has asserted he wants to play Batman given half the chance. \"I was always a Batman guy,\" he told GQ. \"I would have a wild take on Batman. It definitely would not be like a Matt Reeves tone - it'd probably be closer to Keaton.\" His performance in Hit Man does confirm his broad acting range by playing a \"consulting\" undercover agent for the police department.\n\nRelated\n\nTwisters Stars Reveal Similarities Between the Standalone Sequel and Twister\n\nThe Twisters cast delves into how much the upcoming disaster film sequel pays homage to the original Twister featuring Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton.\n\nPowell confirmed Twisters' tornado scenes would demonstrate his physicality. He praised the stunt team for doing the brunt work, which also pushed him to go all-in. \"You're talking about humans getting sucked up into a tornado,\" he told Fandango. \"But you're recreating what it's like to be getting hit by debris and all that stuff. So you're watching real stuntmen getting sucked up into the sky, you're watching trucks move across [the field], you're jumping into a pool and you're getting dragged... it's a fully physical experience because the investment as an actor that you have to have is like, it can't be delicate.\" Initial reviews of Twisters affirmed all the work that went into the sequel paid off in spades.\n\nTwisters is now showing in theaters.\n\nSource: Entertainment Weekly\n\nTwisters\n\nAction\n\nAdventure\n\nThriller\n\nAn update to the 1996 film 'Twister', which centered on a pair of storm chasers who risk their lives in an attempt to test an experimental weather alert system.\n\nDirector Lee Isaac Chung\n\nRelease Date July 19, 2024\n\nCast Glen Powell , Kiernan Shipka , Maura Tierney , Daisy Edgar-Jones , Katy M.

James Paxton plays Cody, an angry motel guest who meets a darkly comedic fate. Twisters cleverly references the original film and honors Bill Paxton's legacy.\n\nEagle-eyed fans of the original Twister can spot a clever James Paxton cameo in Twisters. Twisters takes inspiration from the prior movie, 1996's Twister, and explores it with a new perspective and cast of characters. It pays tribute to the original in small ways, even if stars like Helen Hunt don't appear in Twisters. The film also largely works as a stand-alone film disconnected from the 1996 disaster classic.\n\nWhile the characters of Twisters are all unique from the protagonists of the previous film, the son of one of Twister's stars does make an appearance in the film. Bill Paxton's son James has followed in his father's footsteps, becoming an actor and appearing in films like The Fanatic and shows like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Playing effectively the opposite of Bill Paxton's Twister role as a man dismissive of any dangers posed by the titular weather phenomenon, James Paxton's cameo is small but memorable in Twisters.\n\nRelated Twisters Ending Explained: Do Kate & Tyler Tame The Tornadoes?\n\nTwisters' ending sees a new future for Kate, Tyler, and Javi. We break down the film's biggest takeaways, what's next for Kate and Tyler, and more.\n\nBill Paxton's Son Is The Angry Motel Guest In Twisters James Paxton Has A Small But Memorable Role In Twisters\n\nAs reported by Screen Rant, Bill Paxton's son James briefly appears in Twisters as an angry motel guest named Cody, giving the film a meta-connection to the original film. Twister starred Bill Paxton as Bill Harding, a former storm chaser who ends up working alongside his estranged wife to survive an outbreak of twisters that break out across Oklahoma. Twisters is largely disconnected from the previous film, with only a few minor direct connections to the 1996's Twister. Paxton passed away in 2017, making it impossible for the actor to appear in the film even just as a cameo.\n\nLuckily, his son James was able to honor his father's role in the original and make a memorable (if brief) cameo in Twisters. James Paxton appears as Cody, a dissatisfied traveler who is introduced complaining to a motel manager about the difficulties in renting a room. The scene is a darkly comedic way to cut through the tension of the approaching twister. While Kate and Tyler scramble to find a way to survive the oncoming storm, Cody and his girlfriend dismiss the danger until it's far too late.\n\nRelated Twisters Soundtrack Guide: Every Song & When They Play\n\nThe Twisters soundtrack contains country songs by Luke Combs, Chris Stapleton, Miranda Lambert, and more. Here's when each song plays in the movie.\n\nJames Paxton's Character Dies In Twisters Cody And His Girlfriend Don't Escape The Twister Close\n\nJames Paxton's appearance is brief and ends with a brutal demise. After realizing that Kate and Tyler are right about their warnings, Cody and his girlfriend flee to their car in hopes of outrunning the twister. Unfortunately, they aren't able to get moving in time and are quickly swept up by the cyclone, which is treated as a death sentence throughout Twisters. Although any prospective death isn't seen on-screen, it's heavily implied to be the final fate for Cody and his partner.\n\nJames Paxton's scene in Twisters is a clever way to reference the legacy of the original film while still retaining enough distance to feel like a wholly stand-alone film, with James explaining to Entertainment Weekly that it was done to honor his father. The film also references Bill's work within the world of Twister by revealing his Dorothy storm-tracking system is still used by aspiring meteorologists, confirming that the films occur in the same universe. The inclusion of James Paxton in a brief role shows that Twisters hasn't forgotten the influence his father had on the original movie.\n\nSource: Entertainment Weekly, Screen Rant\n\nTwisters\n\nA follow-up to the 1996 original film Twister, Twisters is a sequel set years after the original, said to be fast-tracked by Steven Spielberg and Mark L.

If you buy something through this post, the publisher may get a share of the sale.\n\nNearly 30 years after the 1996 disaster movie Twister, Universal is returning to the tornado-plagued plains of Oklahoma for a standalone sequel. IGN's Twisters review called the follow-up \"less visually appealing than its predecessor, but more emotionally engaging, resulting in a worthwhile summer blockbuster.\"\n\nIf you're wondering how and where you can watch Twisters this weekend, take a look at the info below.\n\nWhere to Watch Twisters - Showtimes and Streaming\n\nTwisters is now available in theaters everywhere. To find when and where you can watch the movie near you, check the local showtime listings at the main theater sites below:\n\nFandangoAMC TheatersCinemark TheatersRegal TheatersTwisters Streaming Release Date\n\nTwisters will eventually be released on Peacock, followed by Prime Video. As per Universal's streaming deals for live-action movies, Twisters will be available on Peacock for four months before moving to Prime Video for the next 10.\n\nUniversal has yet to announce a streaming release date for Twisters. The distributor's latest live-action movie to hit streaming, Monkey Man, came to Peacock 70 days after its theatrical debut. Should the distributor follow suit here, Twisters would come to Peacock by the end of September.\n\nWhat Is Twisters About?\n\nTwisters is a standalone sequel to 1996's Twister. Like its predecessor, Twisters follows a group of storm chasers in Oklahoma. Here's the official synopsis from Universal:\n\nDaisy Edgar-Jones stars as Kate Carter, a former storm chaser haunted by a devastating encounter with a tornado during her college years who now studies storm patterns on screens safely in New York City. She is lured back to the open plains by her friend, Javi to test a groundbreaking new tracking system. There, she crosses paths with Tyler Owens, the charming and reckless social-media superstar who thrives on posting his storm-chasing adventures with his raucous crew, the more dangerous the better.\n\nAs storm season intensifies, terrifying phenomena never seen before are unleashed, and Kate, Tyler, Javi and their crews find themselves squarely in the paths of multiple storm systems converging over central Oklahoma in the fight of their lives.\n\nHow to Watch Twister (1996)\n\nThe original Twister is available to stream on Max.

Led by the wonderful Daisy Edgar-Jones (Normal People) and the utterly charming and wonderful Glen Powell (Top Gun: Maverick, Hit Man), this is a movie for people that just love movies.\n\nAlthough a sequel to the iconic 1996 disaster flick, Twister, director Lee Isaac Chung (Minari) went the route of not having any direct ties to the original except, you know, the tornadoes. No one is a relative of Helen Hunt's Jo or Bill Paxton's Bill, and that feels like a smart decision.\n\nMORE: 16 fabulous pictures of Glen Powell (and Brisket) from the Twisters red carpet events\n\nInstead, we get the world of Twister but with a new spin (no pun intended). It is a lot of pressure on Edgar-Jones and Powell to match the charisma of Hunt and Paxton, but the duo succeeds. In the 2024 upgrade of the disaster flick, we have Kate (Edgar-Jones), who survives a traumatic experience with a twister and goes on to work in an office in New York instead of continuing to chase tornadoes in Oklahoma.\n\nThe remaining members of Kate's crew, Javi -- played by Anthony Ramos of Hamilton and In the Heights -- reaches out to her five years later with a proposition to help him track down storms to collect data with the hopes of preventing future devastation.\n\nShe eventually gives in, returning home and running into Powell's Tyler Owens, a cowboy streamer in the world of tornadoes that has groupies and followers as a self-proclaimed \"tornado wrangler.\"\n\nEssentially, Twisters is like if Helen Hunt's character started out with Cary Elwes's character from the original then met and was charmed by Bill Paxton's character and the pair teamed up to make a difference.\n\nThe action pieces are unreal (see this in IMAX if you can), and it grips you from start to finish.

In terms of its decade's offerings, it's far from one of the best. It has nonetheless emerged as a TV cable favorite and a source of comfort for many cinephiles. Is it the film's eclectic, exceptionally well-cast array of actors, which includes deeply missed hall-of-fame worthy heavy hitters like Bill Paxton and Philip Seymour Hoffman? Is it the tangible nature of its central American setting with all of its dirt roads and wind-whipped grass fields? Or the fact that everyone involved in the film seemed aware of exactly what kind of movie they were making?\n\nThe answer, truthfully, is all of the above. It takes both a certain level of technical skill and a healthy bit of self-awareness to make a film as absurd and yet infectiously, breathlessly entertaining as Twister. The same is true of its new, standalone sequel, Twisters. The movie, directed by Minari filmmaker Lee Isaac Chung, doesn't go out of its way to connect itself to its 1996 predecessor. You don't need to have even seen Twister to enjoy its sequel. The two films are, however, inextricably bound by their similar sense of adventure and their directors' shared belief in the power of big-screen spectacle. If Twister showed that you could take even the most forgettable material and elevate it, then Twisters proves that you can, in fact, catch lightning in a bottle twice.\n\nUnlike so many other legacy sequels, Twisters does not saddle itself with unnecessary links to its parent film. No character in it is the daughter or estranged cousin of one of Twister's heroes. Instead, the sequel's plot revolves around Kate Cooper (Normal People breakout star Daisy Edgar-Jones), a bright young woman who is turned away from her lifelong dream of finding a way to destabilize tornadoes after a terrifying encounter with one cost the lives of almost her entire college crew. Chung opens Twisters with this formative moment in a sequence that is beautifully paced, viscerally gripping, and purposefully reminiscent of the storm shelter prologue of de Bont's original film.\n\nChung's sequel eventually picks back up with Kate five years later when she is lured back to her tornado-chasing ways by Javi (Transformers: Rise of the Beasts star Anthony Ramos), an old friend similarly haunted by their last, failed adventure together. Once she arrives back in Oklahoma, Kate quickly catches the attention of Tyler Owens (Hit Man star Glen Powell), a YouTube-famous tornado \"wrangler\" whose crew of eccentric thrill-seekers make themselves immediately and loudly known wherever they go. As both Tyler and Javi push her to engage further with the season's increasingly destructive tornado \"outbreak,\" Kate finds herself torn between her fear of another life-threatening accident and her desire to revisit her previously abandoned dream.\n\nLike de Bont did before him, Chung surrounds his Twisters leads with a bevy of colorful supporting characters. Nope star Brandon Perea stands out the most with his turn as Tyler's exuberant videographer and right-hand man, Boone. Of all the film's minor figures, Perea comes the closest to replicating the heightened comedic energy that Philip Seymour Hoffman brought to Twister nearly three decades ago. Harry Hadden-Paton also makes a memorable impression as Ben, a British journalist profiling Tyler who is repeatedly forced far out of his comfort zone, while Superman actor David Corenswet steals a few scenes as Scott, Javi's misogynistic, gum-chewing business partner. The film's vibrant supporting performances help distract from the thinness of Javi's friend-zoned affection for Kate and Ramos' uncharacteristically flat turn as his character.\n\nIt's ultimately Edgar-Jones and Powell who anchor Twisters. The two actors have both been on the rise over the past few years, and they get the chance to shine here. Edgar-Jones' natural stillness makes her well-suited to play Kate, a character whose initial stoicism might have rendered her boring or one-note by a less present performer. She's a perfect counter to Powell, whose movie-star smile and charisma make you buy Tyler as the only person capable of pulling Kate out of her self-constructed shell. The Revenant co-writer Mark L. Smith's script, meanwhile, finds the space for welcome scenes of fiery flirtation between Kate and Tyler, which then organically give way to more open-hearted moments of romantic connection.\n\nPowell and Edgar-Jones, for their part, rise effortlessly to meet the film's dramatic and comedic demands, and Twisters knows how to balance its lighter and darker moments. It moves like a summer blockbuster should, and it has the confidence to stand on its own. The film's Twister callbacks are rare; the only obvious one being the inclusion of the Dorothy device created by Bill Paxton's Bill and Helen Hunt's Jo. Even that Easter egg proves to have a greater purpose, though, when Chung builds on its Wizard of Oz connection by partly setting Twisters' destructive climax in a small-town movie theater.\n\nAs the theater's screen tears away to reveal a real-life tornado swirling viciously on the other side (and yet still perfectly framed by the movie palace's red curtains), Chung's belief in the enduring power of the Hollywood blockbuster is made spectacularly clear. When movies like Twisters are done right, the director shows us, they don't just offer a vision of alternate worlds like Oz, but a portal into them.\n\n2024's blockbuster slate has proven to be an exceptionally good one. Many of this year's best studio offerings have all brought something back to Hollywood's big-budget field, whether it be uninhibited imagination (Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga) or pure, unadulterated romance (The Fall Guy). Twisters isn't better than either of those films, but it has plenty of note to offer, including a real, rom-com spark between its two leads.\n\nMore than anything, Twisters has something that has become increasingly hard to find in our era of CGI-driven filmmaking: texture. Chung and cinematographer Dan Mindel chose to shoot Twisters on 35mm celluloid film, and that not only gives the sequel a glorious, almost imperceptible grain but it also imbues it with a warmth that invites you in and further highlights the contrasting colors created by its orange-red dirt roads, green fields, and blue skies. The effect is immediate and immersive.\n\nAs one of his many catchphrases, Powell's Tyler has a habit of telling his YouTube viewers, \"If you feel it, chase it.\" It's a fitting line for a film that has a knack for making you feel the wind, grass, and rain of its Oklahoma setting. Rarely has \"sit back and enjoy the ride\" felt quite as applicable.\n\nTwisters is now playing in theaters.", "source": {"uri": "digitaltrends.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Trends"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_welch@digitaltrends.com", "name": "Alex Welch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisters_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twisters (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Isaac_Chung", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Isaac Chung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glen Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twister_(game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twister (game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_Edgar-Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daisy Edgar-Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_de_Bont", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jan de Bont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Seymour_Hoffman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philip Seymour Hoffman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adventure film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Mindel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Mindel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmophile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filmophile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Paxton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Paxton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinematography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_People_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Normal People (miniseries)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Perea", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Perea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nope_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nope (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Corenswet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Corenswet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Hadden-Paton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Hadden-Paton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_role", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breakthrough role"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RoboCop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_in_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superman in film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transformers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_L._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark L.

So it's very hard to sleep because you're excited, you're trying to read, and then there's also this tornado you have to worry about.\n\n\"So, the movie lives up to its name as far as the location they picked to film it in,\" he added.\n\nThe original movie Twister stars Helen Hunt, the late Bill Paxton, and the late Philip Seymour-Hoffman.\n\nWhile Helen's not expected to appear in the new film, Glen has enlisted his parents, Cyndy and Glen Sr., for a cameo.\n\nIn a TikTok shared by the official Twisters account last week, Glen coached his parents before shooting their parts in the rodeo scene.\n\n\"How are you guys feeling?\" Glen asked his father, who excitedly replied, \"I'm feeling ready! I can't wait!\"\n\n\"Game time!\" the Hit Man star's mother added.\n\nThe clip continued with Glen asking the Powell patriarch and matriarch whether they'd done any preparation for their cameos.\n\nGlen Sr. assured that they did and then joked, \"I mean, I'm going to ultimately get Tyler's signature on my hat,\" referencing Glen's character in the film.\n\nThe video then showed the pair getting styled in their country getup of cowboy hats and bandanas.\n\nGlen revealed his parents sit directly behind him and Daisy in the film, which his father admitted was a proud moment for them.\n\n\"Just to get to be with Glen and share the whole experience is so much fun,\" Glen Sr. told the camera.\n\nOther stars in the film include Kiernan Shipka, David Corenswet, Katy O'Brian, Maura Tierney, Daryl McCormack, Harry Hadden-Paton, Tunde Adebimpe, Nik Dodani and Brandon Perea.\n\nAccording to Variety, Twisters is expected to rake in $50 million to $55 million when it hits theaters in the United States over the weekend.\n\nHowever, its international numbers will carry a lot of weight as Universal will need to make up for the $155 million it cost to produce the film.\n\nThe cast has been out promoting the movie, with Glen recently boasting about its wild stunts during an interview with Fandango's Big Ticket.\n\nGlen told the outlet that Twisters has \"one of the most incredible action sequences of all time\" and might've hinted that he performed his own stunts, adding that he \"put his body on the line in order to sell that experience.\"", "source":

Chasing twisters has become more popular than ever, but it has also become more dangerous than ever. Nowhere was this more exemplified than in the deadly El Reno F5 tornado in 2013 that killed veteran storm chaser Tim Samaras and the TWISTEX crew.\n\nSamaras was known as one of the most professional, cautious, and risk-averse chasers in the business, which made it even more shocking that his team got caught up in a twister and ultimately lost their lives.\n\nGiven that the trailer for the movie featured a water tower with the name El Reno scrawled across it, they may be hinting at an easter egg in the movie referencing or paying homage to Samaras and the TWISTEX team.\n\nThere is a cameo appearance from real-life storm chasers\n\nStorm chasing has exploded in popularity since Twister originally touched down in 1996. Guys such as Reed Timmer, Jim Cantore, and Sean Casey have all gained fame from chasing tornadoes. It would only make sense to include at least some references to these real-life chasers. Ideally, the movie should feature them in some way. They could just be extras at a restaurant or someplace where the team encounters them along the road.\n\nHowever, the best option would be to have a brief cameo where they cross paths as a rival chase team. It doesn't even have to be a long scene, as the real-life chase team could say they are pursuing a different storm and then quickly head off in a different direction. It just makes too much sense to feature them in the movie in some capacity.\n\nThe film features a cameo from the original cast\n\nAlthough it appears unlikely as of right now, it would be a great surprise for fans if we got to see at least one of the characters from the original movie make a cameo in the upcoming film alongside Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones. Unfortunately, Bill Paxton passed away in 2017, but with the power of CGI, it's always possible they could do some sort of flashback involving Bill's character.\n\nThe more likely route would be to bring back Helen Hunt, who would reprise her role as Jo Harding. Given that the actress expressed interest in making a sequel several years ago, it's possible that things could have been worked out behind the scenes for her to make an appearance.\n\nTyler and Kate end up together\n\nThe plot of the original Twister was ultimately a love story built around chasing tornadoes. It would be interesting to see the sequel take a similar approach and have Tyler (Glen Powell) and Kate (Daisy Edgar-Jones) end up together, or at least some romantic tension between the duo.\n\nIt's possible the film is planning to go this route, and they might have already teased this angle of the story. one scene that has been highly featured In trailers and promotional materials includes Kate saying we never had a chance in a solemn voice, followed by Tyler asking her, \"Do you want one?\"\n\nThis could be about anything, and the clip is clearly edited to avoid context so that viewers can't tell if they are talking about her plan to stop tornadoes or the two of them ending up together. However, from Tyler's voice in the look on his face, it seems to be more of a personal conversation than a professional conversation.\n\nIt also appears that the two are on some sort of date when tragedy strikes in the form of a deadly nighttime twister.\n\nTwisters will make more than $60 million during opening weekend\n\nTwisters appears to feature all the elements of a classic summertime disaster blockbuster movie. It has energy and can bring limitless excitement into a crowded theater with breathtaking scenes of deadly tornadoes and close calls.\n\nThe movie also brings a sense of fear that can create exhilaration and euphoria for audiences, creating the perfect ingredients for a summer date night movie. It features the love story angle in the classic pairing of a country boy and a city girl.\n\nIncreased public interest in tornadoes will drive the film's success\n\nThis movie could aim even higher than the level of commercial success that the original Twister received. Think about what it was like when Jaws first came out. That was a classic summer disaster film, a blockbuster that everybody just had to say. That terrifying yet beautiful film still evokes many of the same feelings in viewers to this day.\n\nIf Twisters is done right, it could reach that same status. The original 1996 film was a hit, but it was also a bit of a sleeper as tornadoes and storm chasing did not have the widespread interest, popularity, and acclaim that they do today.\n\nSince the original Twister came out, numerous inspiring yet deadly F5 tornadoes have made national headlines throughout the United States. We're talking about the 1999, 2003, and 2013 Moore tornadoes as well as the 2013 El Reno tornado.\n\nThe 1999 Ridge Creek Moore tornado generated the highest wind speed ever recorded on earth at 321 mph. The 2003 storm was part of a larger super-sale system and tornado outbreak that lasted for more than a week, devastating the great plains and the areas further east that weren't used to getting hit by tornadoes.\n\nIn fact, Moore, Oklahoma has become known throughout the country as a tornado magnet, because of how many powerful and deadly twisters have struck the city in recent memory.\n\nJust this year, there have been several deadly tornado outbreaks throughout the southeast and midwest. All of these storms combined with the fame achieved by some stormchasers could help propel twisters to commercial heights that even the original film didn't quite reach.\n\nThe increasing frequency and power of the storms, combined with the somewhat recent shift that has seen them hitting areas outside of what was traditionally known as Tornado Alley, has greatly increased public awareness of the storms. There's no way that Twisters will be a sleeper film now. If it flops, which is unlikely, it's simply because it wasn't good enough.\n\nThe film is being marketed aggressively, including an ad spot in the Super Bowl. Glen Powell is one of the brightest upcoming action stars around, flying high after the success of films, such as Top Gun: Maverick, Hit Man, and Anyone but You.\n\nGlen Powell's role as the headlining star combined with the investment in aggressive marketing campaigns and an increased interest in tornadoes should propel Twisters to immense box office success.\n\nClimate change should be addressed, but probably won't be\n\nIt would be a disservice to the world and science if this Glen Powell-led movie didn't take the opportunity to reflect on climate change and how pollution is fueling increasingly powerful and deadly storms all around the world. It's difficult to deny that this is happening when we have already seen numerous outbreaks of large and deadly tornadoes in the past two decades and when this year has already seen a number of large and deadly tornado storms.\n\nAnother thing that would be interesting would be for the writers to explore how climate change has contributed to the shifting of Tornado Alley, with large and dangerous storms striking states such as Alabama, Georgia, Ohio, Nebraska, and even Pennsylvania with increasing frequency.\n\nThis seems to be somewhat unlikely, as it appears that the writers want to keep the movie focused on Oklahoma. That's understandable, as the state was the epicenter of Tornado Alley and is viewed as quintessentially American. It would also pay homage to the original movie, which was based entirely within Oklahoma's borders.\n\nThe sad reality\n\nThe unfortunate reality is that it's doubtful the writers delve too far into climate change at all. With all of the ingredients for a summer blockbuster easily within their reach, the last thing that studio executives will want is for the movie to become a part of the culture wars and risk alienating segments of its audience.\n\nThat would be a shame to let financial goals take away from creative talent, particularly when the movie is based around scientists and the art of studying the weather. Unfortunately, though, that's the reality we live in and it would be surprising if this movie takes a close look at how climate change is fueling deadly weather.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_rooney@clutchpoints.com", "name": "David Rooney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisters_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twisters (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_Edgar-Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daisy Edgar-Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glen Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twister_(game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twister (game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_chasing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Storm chasing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Reno,_Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "El Reno, Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "El Reno, Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWISTEX", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TWISTEX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Paxton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bill Paxton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Hunt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Helen Hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Samaras", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Samaras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Timmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reed Timmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cantore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Cantore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujita_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fujita scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_tower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water tower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Easter egg (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Movie theater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_(acting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extra (acting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore,_Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moore, Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moore, Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_outbreak", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tornado outbreak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_G._Harding", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warren G.

The original Twister is a beloved classic combining realistic effects with a gripping narrative. Fans can relive the intense chase scenes of Twister and enjoy a double feature with Twisters in theaters.\n\nWith the release of Twisters this week, a standalone sequel to the iconic 1996 film Twister, it's no surprise that the original movie has surged to the top spot on Max's streaming service. Fans old and new are revisiting the original storm-chasing thriller, reminding us why it remains a beloved classic even after nearly three decades. Twisters, directed by Lee Isaac Chung, best known for his Oscar-nominated film Minari, brings a fresh take to the tornado-chasing genre without relying on the characters from the original. Instead, it introduces a new set of storm chasers led by Kate Carter, played by Daisy Edgar-Jones, and Tyler Owens, portrayed by Glen Powell. The plot revolves around these characters' differing approaches to storm chasing, set against the backdrop of increasingly severe and unpredictable weather patterns in Oklahoma.\n\nFor those catching up, the original Twister follows the story of Dr. Jo Harding (Helen Hunt), a meteorologist obsessed with tornadoes after witnessing one kill her father during her childhood. Her estranged husband, Bill Harding (Bill Paxton), a former storm chaser turned weatherman, returns to finalize their divorce but gets drawn back into storm chasing. Together, they aim to deploy \"Dorothy,\" a device designed to release sensors into a tornado to gather critical data and improve warning systems. The film combines realistic special effects with a gripping narrative, culminating in the successful deployment of Dorothy into a massive F5 tornado, while Jo and Bill rekindle their relationship amidst the chaos. The film features an eclectic supporting cast including the likes of Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Cary Elwes, Jami Gertz, Alan Ruck and more.\n\nAnd it's not just at the movies where people want to get a hit of storm chasing. The acclaimed docuseries In the Eye of the Storm is also trending and in the top ten. Following one of the more violent storm seasons across the midwest, it seems as if nature itself has decided to go viral this year, and folks just can't get enough of acts of God. Hold on tight.\n\nIs 'Twisters' Worth Seeing?\n\nEarly reviews for Twisters highlight its thrilling action sequences and impressive special effects, which have been praised for their realism and intensity. Critics have noted that while the film embraces the adventurous spirit of its predecessor, it also incorporates modern elements, including social media dynamics and advanced storm-tracking technology. For those who have fond memories of the original Twister, Twisters offers a nostalgic yet fresh experience. As audiences flock to theaters to catch the latest storm-chasing adventure, it's clear that the legacy of Twister continues to captivate and inspire.\n\nIf you haven't seen Twister in a while or are curious to see what all the fuss is about, now is the perfect time to stream it on Max. Whether you're reliving the intense chase scenes and groundbreaking special effects or experiencing them for the first time, Twister remains a must-watch. And with Twisters now in theaters, you can enjoy a thrilling double feature that spans generations of storm-chasing excitement.\n\nTwister\n\nPG-13\n\nAction\n\nAdventure\n\nDrama\n\nThriller\n\nBill

This time around, it's a modern take on 1996's Twister, which starred Helen Hunt, Bill Paxton and a scene-stealing Philip Seymour Hoffmann.\n\nAnd it's pretty bloomin' good too.\n\nDaisy Edgar-Jones from Normal People stars as Kate Cooper, a meteorologist and former storm chaser. Following a terrifying and devastating encounter with a tornado, she starts a new life in New York.\n\nWe need your consent to load this YouTube contentWe use YouTube to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.

Despite her mental scars, she goes for it.\n\nAs she and her new twister team mates - who are being bankrolled by a local businessman of dubious character - swing into action, they find themselves competing with Tyler Owens (an irresistible Glen Powell), a charming but reckless social media superstar who posts his storm-chasing adventures.\n\nNaturally, Kate and Tyler are oil and water opposites. But gradually, she warms to him as she discovers more attractive layers - for one, he's a qualified meteorologist rather than a mere chancer - once she scratches beneath the surface of his grinning grifter image.\n\nIt's all pretty predictable rom-com-in-a-storm fun, though the technical jargon on display seems both superfluous and a tiny bit tedious. Of course these people are smart. Otherwise they wouldn't know what they were doing.\n\nThe last 30 minutes or so, though, is where the movie really takes off, and in spectacular fashion.\n\nThe special effects are a given in a summer blockbuster such as this, but the idea of centring the final tornado challenge in a cinema showing the classic Frankenstein flick ('It's alive!') was a stroke of genius. A very Spielbergian touch in what's almost an homage to the patron saint of celluloid.\n\nThe performances are pretty solid and characters largely one-dimensional, but Glen Powell is pitch perfect as Tyler Owens.

Here's the official synopsis from Universal:\n\nDaisy Edgar-Jones stars as Kate Carter, a former storm chaser haunted by a devastating encounter with a tornado during her college years who now studies storm patterns on screens safely in New York City. She is lured back to the open plains by her friend, Javi to test a groundbreaking new tracking system. There, she crosses paths with Tyler Owens, the charming and reckless social-media superstar who thrives on posting his storm-chasing adventures with his raucous crew, the more dangerous the better.\n\nAs storm season intensifies, terrifying phenomena never seen before are unleashed, and Kate, Tyler, Javi and their crews find themselves squarely in the paths of multiple storm systems converging over central Oklahoma in the fight of their lives.\n\nThe original Twister is available to stream on Max.

On the show, she revealed her plans to make it with Hamilton star Daveed Diigs co-writing the script and her directing.\n\nHunt said her pitch made in June 2020 centered on \"all Black and Brown storm-chasers.\" \"They wouldn't do it,\" she said, adding \"it would have been so cool.\"\n\nTeasing further details, she said at the time, according to Insider, \"There was a HBCU where we wanted it to take place, and a rocket science club, and in this one they shoot the rockets into the tornado. It was going to be so cool.\"\n\nDiggs, 42, later gave more insight into the rejected pitch, saying to Insider in April 2023, \"... All I'll say is there was an opportunity where we were talking about that, and it didn't happen, and the reasons that it didn't happen are potentially shady. But shady in the way that we know the industry is shady.\"\n\nThe new film stars Daisy Edgar-Jones, Glen Powell, Anthony Ramos, Brandon Perea, Maura Tierney, Sasha Lane, Harry Hadden-Patton, David Corenswet, Daryl McCormack, Tunde Adebimpe, Katy O'Brian, Nik Dodani, Kiernan Shipka and Paul Scheer.\n\nTwisters director Lee Isaac Chung said he was not involved in any discussions about Hunt's pitch.\n\n\"I don't know what [Hunt's] version was, and, unfortunately, I have not been able to talk to her nor Jan de Bont nor to anyone from the cast about the movie,\" Chung told IndieWire.\n\n\"We have a few people who worked on the original in our crew. When I read the script, I really loved the approach they were taking with it, that it was going to be a new story, with new characters and an entirely new science project.\"\n\nRelated: Glen Powell Says Twisters Cast Went Storm Chasing After Filming: 'We Survived' (Exclusive)\n\nChung added, \"I really believe Helen Hunt is a genius, and I would have loved to work with her. That choice was just never a part of me coming on board with this, however.\"\n\nSpeaking to Entertainment Weekly in a recent interview alongside Hunt, Twister director de Bont said, \"I don't know anything about the new movie; I wasn't involved and haven't seen it yet.\" Hunt told the outlet, \"The fact that it holds up is amazing. I've been in big movies, and you look back, and you have to cringe a little bit because technology's come so far. But I don't know that it's come further than what Jan did with this movie.\"\n\nPaxton, who died in 2017, told the AV Club back in 2012 that he would \"love\" to direct a potential Twister sequel one day. (Paxton's son James, 30, has a cameo in the new film.)\n\n\"I've always felt like there was a Jaws version of that movie.

Directed by Jan de Bont, who was still riding high off the success of Speed, Twister was loud, action-packed, and, especially when viewed today, utterly of its time.\n\nIt's totally '90s Hollywood, from the treacly, faux-Spielberg score, to the glow of Helen Hunt's movie stardom, to the fact that the only non-white cast member among dozens of characters has just a single incidental line. There was plenty that filmmakers might do differently with a sequel.\n\nBut there was one aspect worth repeating: the storm-tossed intensity of the action, presented with run-and-gun urgency, and shot and edited with the dexterity of a filmmaker who had cut his teeth as a cinematographer on action bangers like Die Hard.\n\nThat cow-spinning, edge-of-your-seat excitement is what's largely missing from Twisters, directed by Lee Isaac Chung. Chung, riding high off the success of his excellent, Oscar-nominated 2020 indie drama Minari, seems a daring choice to helm a $200-million-budgeted studio tentpole.\n\nThe bet pays off in terms of Twisters feeling grounded in real world consequences, where tornadoes aren't just great video content for storm-chasing yahoos, but are terrible monsters of nature that decimate whole communities. Yet, the film's disaster mayhem remains fairly low-key -- save for a suspenseful sequence of a twister whipping through an oil refinery on its way to walloping a small town.\n\nOften in those scenes, with cyclones bearing down on a town, or, as in one scene, bum-rushing a rodeo, Chung keeps the camera on the characters cowering in fear, when really we want to see twisters whipping up destruction. There's a balance between relishing the devastation, and caring for the characters in danger, and this movie misses it.\n\nThe balance also seems off in the casting. The story is built around meteorology expert Kate Carter, who, years after losing almost her entire field crew to a twister, is pulled back into storm chasing for a good cause. Played by top-billed Daisy Edgar-Jones, best known for TV roles in British series Normal People and Cold Feet, Kate is ostensibly the hero of Twisters.\n\nYet, Edgar-Jones is consistently outshined by co-star Glen Powell as the self-proclaimed \"Tornado Wrangler\" Tyler Owens, a good ol' boy from Arkansas in a ten-gallon cowboy hat. Had the movie twisted midway to focus instead on just Tyler and his quirky, diverse crew of storm hounds -- including Nope's Brandon Perea and Love Lies Bleeding star Katy O'Brian -- that would have been fine by me.\n\nBut we're stuck with dour Kate, who is still mourning her crew, and is ambivalent about getting back in the storm-chasing game, and is seemingly oblivious to the fact that Tyler, somehow, starts falling for her staid, unfunny self as their separate crews race around Oklahoma looking for twisters.\n\nIn one scene, Tyler silently takes her in, realizing she might be the girl of his dreams. Powell -- talk about movie star glow -- conveys the instant that Tyler starts to see this woman not as competition but as a kindred spirit. Cut to Edgar-Jones' Kate, not seeing or feeling the same things, and, more importantly, not giving us the twinkle of anything that Tyler would find so enchanting.\n\nBeyond intelligence and beauty, we need to see star quality, and Edgar-Jones doesn't bring that \"It\" factor. That's an issue when she's the center of a romantic triangle that also includes Anthony Ramos as storm scientist Javi, a survivor of the disaster that took her previous crew.\n\nEquipped with a military prototype radar system he hopes to use for more accurate and useful imaging of how twisters form, Javi comes calling for Kate's help. \"You have a gift,\" he tells her, trying to recruit her to his new team, co-led by stickler Scott, played by upcoming big-screen Superman David Corenswet (who looks super, though Scott is an asshole).\n\nJavi and Scott have a deep-pocketed sponsor and the right tech, but their team needs Kate and her gift for reading the winds, like some ancient sage, discerning which way storms will blow. As demonstrated by her highly gifted method of tossing dandelion seeds into the breeze, she's \"the only one\" who can get them close enough to twisters to deploy the equipment.\n\nWhat Kate wants is to use the tech to figure out how to shut down storms and save lives. That appears to be what Javi wants, too. Like Kate, he also has a redemption arc here, and it's more compelling than his pining for her. Although, the love triangle angle does provide maybe the movie's best sight gag, a slow motion shot of both guys running to Kate's aid.\n\nThere's a version of this movie where Tyler and Javi just keep running, past Kate, into each other's arms, driving off into the sunset in Tyler's comically large Ram pickup.

Discovery, has been a rather successful platform with its varied selection of both films and television shows. Now one such offering, a beloved 90's movie, is currently dominating the Max streaming charts.\n\nOf course, it's not exactly a surprise. A sequel to this particular movie is just now hitting theaters several decades after its release. It seems as though fans are eager to revisit the film that started it all prior to seeing the new sequel.\n\nThe film has just entered the Top 10 list on Max as of this writing. It's great to see considering that the film was first released in 1996, proving that it can still offer something to audiences so many years later. Especially when a new sequel is just on the horizon.\n\nThe film, if you haven't guessed already, is none other than Twister. The 1996 blockbuster from director Jan de Bont stars Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton as part of a group of storm chasers that become involved with some dangerous tornados. It's a great premise for a modern-day disaster movie, and it's clear why they revisited the concept for a sequel this year.\n\nThe sequel, titled Twisters, is directed by Lee Isaac Chung from a screenplay written by Mark L. Smith with a story by Joseph Kosinski. It's a stand-alone sequel to its 1996 predecessor, but once again follows a group of storm chasers that find themselves enduring a number of tornados.\n\nIt's nice to see that not just one but two Twister movies exist at this point, and that both have received positive reviews from viewers. Stay tuned to ScreenGeek for more news on Twister, its new sequel, and any other trending titles on streaming services including Max as we have them. For now, subscribers can check out the beloved classic movie Twister on Max prior to seeing Twisters in theaters.", "source": {"uri": "screengeek.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenGeek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_dressler@screengeek.net", "name": "Jacob Dressler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Twister tore up the Midwest; Independence Day blew up the east coast (and the rest of the world, but it was those images of DC and New York landmarks that really lingered); The Rock threatened San Francisco with a chemical attack (and some very reckless driving); and Fled, The Frighteners, Multiplicity, and Kazaam all left a smoking crater nationwide when they bombed on the same weekend. (A different form of disaster, granted, but still.) In 2024, Twisters is a big-budget disaster-movie sequel coming out in mid-July that somehow feels like a form of counterprogramming -- to what else is playing at the multiplex, anyway. Depending on where and when you see it, the movie could also come across as scarily in sync with your surroundings. 18 hours after I saw it, my phone buzzed with an emphatic tornado warning. My family made mordant jokes about viral marketing. Then four such storms touched down in the geographical region I was visiting -- western New York state, not exactly known as Tornado Alley.\n\nIs the real world too stormy to enjoy escapism in the form of Twisters? Obviously real tornados existed in 1996, too; they lent an otherwise pretty silly movie some gravity, the sense that then-new-ish CG tech was being used to supersize nature into spectacle worthy of a stunt show. In the decades since, we've gotten used to seeing similarly apocalyptic images come to life on the news or the actual world -- whether through the man-made devastation of 9/11 or the different-man-made devastation of the environment, disguised as something more natural but no less frightening.\n\nTwisters, directed by Minari's Lee Isaac Chung, offers a fantasy of prevention, with a safe side dish of righteousness over the potential exploitation of families who lose everything in natural disasters. Kate Cooper (Daisy Edgar-Jones) has big dreams of neutralizing storms by allowing just the right substance to get sucked up into a tornado and sapping its moisture. This gives her fresh-faced team a logistical challenge not unlike the launch of Dorothy, the data-collection tool from Twister, only this time with bigger results, dammit. Unfortunately, Kate suffers a terrible loss in the opening sequence, and she takes her preternatural storm-watching prowess to a New York City weather-service desk job. Years later, her former colleague Javi (Anthony Ramos) lures her back into the field, which is how she meets showboating storm-chasing YouTuber Tyler Owens (Glen Powell).\n\nIt's supposed to be a variation on the original movie's lovably cornball dynamic, where scrappy scientists Helen Hunt, Bill Paxton, and pals were pitted against corporate, soulless competition; here, the earnest and idealistic scientist has corporate backing, while the scrappy folks appear more opportunistic. Yet despite some narrative switches and less ensemble hijinks, the movie's attempts to separate the two teams are muddled, and often seem to be based on the characters' own false assumptions; it takes forever for Tyler to catch up with the audience's knowledge that \"city girl\" Kate is actually an Oklahoma native, and the movie doesn't seem to understand or care that both teams use plenty of tech (or that the custom drills outfitted underneath his manly truck, designed to root it to the ground mid-storm, are also, in fact, pretty advanced technology). The movie doesn't seem to have any particular feelings about Tyler's sharable daredevilry or, especially, Kate's desire to \"disrupt\" weather without ever speaking to the root causes of more frequent extreme weather events. Just so long as their hearts are in the right place, y'all.", "source": {"uri": "gq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "British GQ"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@gq.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9

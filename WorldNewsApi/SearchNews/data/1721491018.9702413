{"id": 237079104, "title": "War Crimes Hearing Gives Public Virtual Look Inside a Secret C.I.A. Prison", "text": "The public on Monday got its first view of a C.I.A. \u201cblack site,\u201d including a windowless, closet-size cell where a former Qaeda commander was held during what he described as the most humiliating experience of his time in U.S. custody. The former commander, Abd al-Hadi al-Iraqi, led the 360-degree virtual tour of the site, Quiet Room 4, during a sentencing hearing at Guant\u00e1namo Bay that began last week. He described being blindfolded, stripped, forcibly shaved and photographed naked on two occasions after his capture in 2006. He never saw the sun, nor heard the voices of his guards, who were dressed entirely in black, including their masks. Mr. Hadi, 63, was one of the last prisoners to be held in the overseas black site network where the George W. Bush administration held and interrogated about 100 terrorism suspects after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.", "summary": "Years after the agency\u2019s \u201cblack site\u201d program was shut down, details are slowly emerging during trials at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/us/politics/hearing-hidden-secret-cia-prison.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/17/multimedia/17dc-gitmo-bgkh/17dc-gitmo-bgkh-facebookJumbo.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:01:42", "author": "Carol Rosenberg", "authors": ["Carol Rosenberg"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.311}

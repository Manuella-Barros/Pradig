The Spaniard, who turns 38 next week, was expected to retire at the end of the current season but said on Saturday that he was not certain that this year\u2019s tournament would be his last. \u201cIf I have to tell you it\u2019s 100 per cent my last Roland Garros, sorry, but I will not, because I cannot predict what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. Tournament director Amelie Mauresmo admitted that Nadal had already told her about his apparent U-turn. She said: \u201cAs you can imagine, we had something planned for him, but he said yesterday \u2013 he told us actually before yesterday \u2013 that because he doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be his last Roland Garros or not. \u201cHe wants to leave the door open for him maybe to come back next year as a player. So we\u2019re not going to push him obviously to do anything. \u201cIt\u2019s his decision when he wants to have a proper ceremony. So we\u2019re not going to do it this year. That\u2019s his wish, even though we\u2019re ready to push the button.\u201d Nadal faces German world number four Alexander Zverev in his first-round match on Tuesday afternoon. Mauresmo also revealed there would be no special send-off for Andy Murray, who is also wavering on whether to call it a day this year. \u201cSame as Rafa,\u201d she said. \u201cIn advance I called him and he said \u2018I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not sure, let\u2019s not do anything\u2019. \u201cIt seems that they don\u2019t know, so we respect that.\u201d", "summary": "Nadal said on Saturday that he was not certain that this year\u2019s tournament would be his last.", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/rafael-nadal-french-open-amelie-mauresmo-andy-murray-alexander-zverev-b2551760.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/26/13/10-a92de6f54a004313a135fd389dae38fd.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:12:53", "author": "Andy Sims", "authors": ["Andy Sims"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.825}

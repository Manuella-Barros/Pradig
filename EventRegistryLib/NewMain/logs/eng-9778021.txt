bronze medallist with a VERY famous father", "body": "Many First Dates fans tuning into day five of the Olympics, more specifically the diving event may recognise the name of one of Team GB's athletes.\n\n19-year-old Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix is appearing in her second Olympic Games making up one half of the British duo who featured in the 10m synchronised diving final this morning.\n\nAndrea appeared alongside Lois Toulson in the event where they claimed the bronze medal for Team GB, making it Team GB's fifth bronze medal of the games so far.\n\nHowever many may be unaware that the Team GB diver is actually the daughter of First Dates host Fred Sirieix and his ex Alex Spendolini.\n\nAndrea Spendolini-Sirieix and Lois Toulson claimed Team GB's fifth bronze medal of the Paris Games so far in the 10m synchronised diving final\n\nMany fans tuning in to watch the final may have recognised one one of the diver's names Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix for a different reason\n\nAndrea is the daughter of famous foodie Frenchman Fred Sirieix\n\nHere is everything you need to know about Fred Sirieix's daughter who has made a name for herself away from her famous father and in the diving world.\n\nThe up and coming diving sensation, who made her Olympic debut at just 16 and just claimed her first Olympic medal in Paris for the 10m synchronised dive is the daughter of famous foodie Fred and Italian mother Alex Spendolini.\n\nAndrea grew up alongside her brother Matteo in London and admitted it was her mother who got her into diving from a young age despite her initial fear.\n\n'I didn't want to start diving... my mum forced me to start diving,' the Team GB diver admitted with a laugh in a video on Team GB's YouTube channel.\n\n\"My family means so much to me because they really dropped everything for my sport'.\n\nThe diving sensation is the daughter of Fred Sirieix and Alex Spendolini\n\nHer family are her biggest supporters and Fred is often spotted cheering on his daughter in the crowd\n\nThe diver who has Italian and French heritage made her international debut aged 13, and won her first first solo gold medal at the 2020 FNA Diving Grand Prix in her breakthrough season.\n\nWhich also saw her claim an array of titles including World junior champion, double European senior champion, double Commonwealth Games gold medallist, as well as becoming a national champion several times over in both individual and synchronised 10m platform events, whilst simultaneously securing a World senior medal.\n\nThe diving phenomen, also wrestled off stiff competition from the likes of Jude Bellingham to be awarded the BBC Young Sports Personality of the year award back in 2018.\n\nAnd she is set for another remarkable year, having claimed gold in the team event at the 2024 World Aquatics Championships earlier this year and has now followed it up with a Olympic medal.\n\nAndrea claimed gold in the team event at the 2024 World Aquatics Championships\n\nFred was announced as part of the BBC presenting panel for the Olympics as he is in attendance to cheer on Andrea\n\nThe 19-year-old has a remarkable support system and BBC revealed that her father Fred would be joining the Olympics presenting panel, providing commentary and analysis from inside the studio.\n\nAs it was announced that Team GB had done enough to take home the bronze medal, one of the first people the camera panned to was Fred, who was ecstatically jumping up and down with pride.\n\nDespite the unconditionally love and support shown by her father, Andrea admitted that she has previously struggled with being predominantly known as Fred Siriex's daughter, especially at the beginning of her career and heading into the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n'My name wasn't in the newspaper,' she told Olmpics.com in 2022.\n\n'I was simply Fred Sirieix's daughter, which was quite hard because I was doing the diving, but my name wasn't coming up.'\n\nThat has all changed now, with Andrea now being known for her first name and not her shared last name.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

I couldn't throw myself. I couldn't do anything simple, anything hard.\"\n\nShe subsequently went into her first Olympics feeling the pressure of \"disappointing everyone\" and knowing she wasn't at her best.\n\nRemarkably, she still managed to get through the rounds and reached the final in the women's 10m platform, ultimately finishing seventh - Britain's best individual result by a female diver in Tokyo.\n\nBut her mental health struggles persisted - so much so that she nearly gave up diving entirely a few months later.\n\n\"When you get overwhelmed with things you can't control, it affects your diving. If you're not mentally 'on it' on that 10m [platform], the risks are quite severe,\" she told World Aquatics.\n\nShe developed a \"mental block\" when it came to diving and said it became a fear.\n\n\"I was going to quit, so I had to tell someone that I wasn't okay,\" she added.\n\nReaching new heights in health and career\n\nAfter a challenging first half of 2022, Spendolini-Sirieix began confiding in her family, friends and coach.\n\n\"I used to want to do everything by myself and didn't want to put my burdens on other people,\" the diver told Olympics.com. \"But they are there for a reason and they can't help you unless you go to them.\"\n\nShe says it was that communication which allowed her to pick herself back up both mentally and physically.\n\nThe year ended up becoming a breakthrough year for her, seeing her win double European gold, two Commonwealth titles, and a bronze medal at the World Championships.\n\nA year later, she topped that by winning silver at the 2023 World Championships.\n\nShe now has 24 senior national and international medals in total and sounds confident about Paris.\n\n\"My overall goal is to get a medal at an Olympic Games and Paris is very close to my heart because it's in France,\" she told Olympics.com.\n\n\"I've got family, I'm half French and I think it's going to be as close to a home games as possible. But as of right now, I'm taking the process one day at a time.\"\n\nBut the teenager dives deep - even outside of the water.\n\n\"Success to me doesn't equate to medals,\" she told PA news agency.\n\n\"I want to go there focused and determined and joyful. I want to come back feeling like I made the most of it, I gave it my everything.\n\n\"A competition doesn't define who I am, but I really want to make memories. Without those memories, those medals are worthless.\"\n\n'I was simply Fred Sirieix's daughter'\n\nThe teenager previously admitted she found it \"a little bit difficult\" being known predominantly as Fred Sirieix's daughter in the build-up to the 2020 Olympics.\n\n\"My name wasn't in the newspaper,\" she told Olmpics.com in 2022.\n\n\"I was simply Fred Sirieix's daughter, which was quite hard because I was doing the diving, but my name wasn't coming up.\n\n\"Then this year ever so slightly the newspapers started to say 'Andrea'. And then my name would repeat a bit more, bit more.\n\n\"It's very nice to finally have that recognition and to know that I am the diver. I'm Andrea. Dad does his job and he is amazing at it, but it is great to build my own identity off my own achievements.\"\n\nThe pair have a strong relationship, Sirieix being a vocal supporter of his daughter on social media.\n\nHe was also seen crying on the sidelines when his daughter won individual gold at the 2022 Commonwealth Games.\n\nHis daughter says they are \"proud\" of each other's achievements.\n\nFred Sirieix 'too nervous' to talk about daughter's diving\n\nThe television maitre d' will be commentating on air during coverage of the summer games - but says he will avoid doing so while his daughter dives.\n\n\"I'll be at the pool, watching Andrea, not working, I don't want to comment on my daughter diving. It's too close to my heart,\" he told Radio Times.\n\n\"I'll be speaking and commentating post-event, when everything's done. I want to enjoy it. Regardless of what happens, there will be tears.\n\n\"If somebody deserves a medal, it's her little brother, who was dragged to the pool, sitting in the stands to watch his iPad, or play with other kids he didn't know.\n\n\"He's the real hero of the story, but mum and dad, they don't deserve a medal. This is what parents do. You look after your kids, give them all the opportunities you can.\"\n\nHe said he'll be supporting Team GB due to his daughter's affiliation with them and because he's met many of the British athletes.\n\n\"But I'm also proud to go back to my home country and showcase France to the Brits,\" he added.\n\nWhen will Spendolini-Sirieix compete?\n\nShe'll first be in action today in the synchronised 10m platform diving alongside partner Lois Toulson, with the competition starting at 10am.\n\nShe'll then compete in the individual 10m platform diving on 5 August.", "source": {"uri":

It is the 19-year-old's second Olympic appearance and hopes are high that she will bring home a medal.\n\nProud dad Sirieix - maitre d' of the restaurant in the Channel 4 dating show - has served A-list celebrities during his successful career, but says nothing compares to the tension of watching his daughter compete at the Olympics.\n\nWriting in the Daily Mail, the Frenchman, 52, said: \"An inner turmoil grips my body when I watch Andrea dive. I remember almost having a heart attack at the Commonwealth Games in 2022, where she won two gold medals. Thankfully Andrea handles the pressure a lot better than I do!\"\n\nHe added: \"I'm sitting in the stands watching Andrea and trying to put myself in her state of mind. My heart goes up a few beats and I just think to myself 'OK, you've got to relax Fred'.\n\n\"I've spent my career working in Michelin-starred restaurants with A-List clients and, let me tell you, the stress of those nights is nothing compared to this.\"\n\nSpeaking ahead of Wednesday's event, Fred told The Sun: \"She's going to fight like a lion and we hope she gets a medal of course but whatever happens she will do her best and that is all you can ask.\n\n\"It has been a slow process with Andrea, it has happened very gradually over the years. It started when she was eight and then 15, she was a British champion and now she is at her second Olympics which is brilliant.\"\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY! Are you enjoying the Olympics so far? Tell us in the comments section below.\n\nSpendolini-Sirieix represents Team GB, having been born in London in September 2004. As well as France, she could also have represented Italy, the country of her mother, Alex Spendolini's birth.\n\nWhile her parents are no longer together, they will be united in their support of their daughter, who is determined to make her family proud. She once declared: \"Every competition I do, my family's always in my heart.\" On her dad's celebrity status, she said last year: \"I see him in person. I see him on TV. I'm proud of him. He's proud of me. You get used to it.\"\n\nSpeaking ahead of the Olympics, Fred admitted he was too nervous to speak about Andrea on air. He told the Radio Times: \"I'll be at the pool, watching Andrea, not working, I don't want to comment on my daughter diving. It's too close to my heart.\n\n\"I'll be speaking and commentating post-event when everything's done. I want to enjoy it. Regardless of what happens, there will be tears.\"\n\nOn the sacrifices the family has made for Andrea, he added: \"If somebody deserves a medal, it's her little brother, who was dragged to the pool, sitting in the stands to watch his iPad or play with other kids he didn't know.\n\n\"He's the real hero of the story, but mum and dad, they don't deserve a medal. This is what parents do. You look after your kids, give them all the opportunities you can.\"\n\nFollow all the action on day five of the Paris Olympics with Mirror Sport's live blog\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

I remember almost having a heart attack at the Commonwealth Games in 2022, where she won two gold medals. Thankfully Andrea handles the pressure a lot better than I do!\n\nIn this sport, every dive matters. Often your last is the one that decides which colour medal you are going home with. You know you have got to pull it out of the bag.\n\nThey climb all the way up there to the 10-metre platform and suddenly there is pin-drop silence in the crowd. You can cut the tension with a knife. Then, once you have dived, the roar from the crowd is deafening.\n\nI'm sitting in the stands watching Andrea and trying to put myself in her state of mind. My heart goes up a few beats and I just think to myself 'OK, you've got to relax Fred'.\n\nI've spent my career working in Michelin-starred restaurants with A-List clients and let me tell you, the stress of those nights is nothing compared to this.\n\nFred Siriex (left) will be nervously watching his daughter Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix (right) try to win gold at the Olympics in synchronised diving on Wednesday\n\nAndrea Sirieix is aiming for gold with Team GB in the women's synchronised 10m platform dive on Wednesday\n\nAndrea is amongst the favourites to finish on top of the podium but knows that every dive matters\n\nAndrea will partner her Team GB colleague Lois Toulson (right) in the women's diving event\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nIf I'm in a restaurant, I'm in control and know what I'm doing. You're fighting the same battle every day and there's no way I'm going to lose.\n\nIn diving, there's always risk. Even the best have days where they miss a dive. Andrea has now reached a level where those days are incredibly rare, so I'm not scared when she dives.\n\nIt was a different story when Team GB invited me to come in and try it myself for a week. I was absolutely petrified.\n\nAndrea was watching me and was saying 'Daddy, you just need to relax because I can see your heart beating in your chest'. My heart was pounding so hard she could see it from the poolside!\n\nJumping from up there is the true meaning of commitment. You're standing on the board way up there and have to throw yourself off. If you commit in the wrong way, there is a painful ending. Trust me, I speak from personal experience.\n\nI was left completely black and blue because I kept landing the wrong way. That's why you've got to be young and fit. When you're 52 like me it's not a good idea!\n\nAndrea couldn't have done anything more to be ready for this moment. She's in the shape of her life but will be up against very strong competition in the 10m synchronised platform today/tomorrow alongside her partner, Lois Toulson.\n\nAndrea couldn't have done anything more to be ready for this moment, said father Fred\n\nFred has been soaking up the atmosphere within Team GB's camp at the Paris Olympics\n\nFor Andrea to win an Olympic medal in France, the country of my birth, would be the stuff of dreams.\n\nGold is the aim, but life will not revolve around whether she wins the Olympics or not. It's amazing even to be selected to represent Team GB at a second Games.

Fittingly, he found inspiration in one of his other great loves: food.\n\n\"Life is like a pie. There are many slices, and if you have just one big slice, which is diving - if, God forbid, you get injured, then that's all you have,\" he told her.\n\n\"You can dive, we'll take you left, right and centre. But you've got to dedicate just as much time to school.\"\n\nThe hard work, both at the pool and in the classroom, has paid off for Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix. Fred's duckling - \"mon caneton\", \"mon b\u00e9b\u00e9\", he coos - is now in Paris, aged 19, with a real chance of securing an Olympic medal.\n\nSirieix, who moved to the UK at the age of 20, has been unveiled as a BBC studio guest for the Games. Will discussing his daughter's dive in front of millions of viewers feel awkward?\n\n\"I'll be at the pool, watching Andrea, not working,\" he says, sipping a cappuccino. \"I don't want to comment on my daughter diving. It's too close to my heart. I'll be speaking and commentating post-event, when everything's done. I want to enjoy it. Regardless of what happens, there will be tears.\"\n\nA Commonwealth and European champion, World Championship silver medallist in 2023 and team gold medallist in 2024, Andrea could become the first female British diver to make the Olympic podium since 1960. \"She's in with a real chance of a medal. She's in the shape and form of her life,\" Sirieix says. \"She is dedicated to the sport.\"\n\nAndrea's diving career began with a stroke of luck. When she was eight, Crystal Palace Diving Club came to a talent-spotting day at her primary school in south-east London, putting pupils through their paces with some flexibility and strength exercises.\n\n\"She was a sporty little girl, and they said, 'You're doing great. Do you want to come for a trial?' So she went and she loved it. Who doesn't like jumping into a pool? I do, and I'm 52!\"\n\nHer success was rapid. Last year, she and Lois Toulson made history by winning Britain's first World Championship medal in a women's event, taking silver in the 10-metre synchro. In 2022, she won European gold. In 2021, when Andrea was just 16, she was the youngest member of the Team GB diving team in Tokyo, and came seventh in the 10m platform final on her Olympic debut.\n\n\"She was competing and winning in competitions from the age of 12 and 13, becoming British champion when she was 15,\" Sirieix says. \"Nobody saw her coming. She beat girls who were 18, 19, 20.\"\n\nIt has, the I'm a Celebrity... contestant admits, \"been quite a rollercoaster\" when you've \"suddenly got an athlete in your house - somebody who thinks and breathes like a champion\". \"All they [divers] think about is diving, and they want to win.\"\n\nAre there any downsides? \"If you want her to go on holiday or away for a weekend, it's not going to happen because she's training. You say, 'Just one day?' No, she can't! But I understand. I don't insist. It's something I tried at the beginning, but even then, she was fully dedicated.\"\n\nAndrea has paid tribute to her parents - the couple have separated and Sirieix lives with his fianc\u00e9e - for \"dropping everything for my sport\", and described her mum as her superhero.\n\nSirieix dismisses the idea that he made sacrifices for his daughter to pursue her dream. \"If you have to get up early and take them diving, that's what you do. I don't think it's a sacrifice at all,\" he says.\n\n\"If somebody deserves a medal, it's her little brother, who was dragged to the pool, sitting in the stands to watch his iPad, or play with other kids he didn't know. He's the real hero of the story. But Mum and Dad, they don't deserve a medal. This is what parents do. You look after your kids, give them all the opportunities you can.\"\n\nNot every parent, however, flings themselves off a 10-metre board \"to see what it was like\"... albeit feet-first instead of head-first.\n\n\"I was black and blue,\" Sirieix recalls of the experience in 2021. \"My legs, my bum... completely bruised. I'm not going to do it again unless somebody pays me!\n\n\"Andrea was on the ground, shouting, 'Daddy, you've got to relax, stop being scared. I can see your heart beating in your chest!' I felt my heart just pumping like this,\" he gesticulates extravagantly. \"It was so scary.\"\n\nA year later, Andrea herself developed a \"fear of diving\" - a mental block that made her scared of taking on even the easiest of dives - and she was close to quitting. Sirieix says the family responded with \"support and love\". \"There was no pressure, no expectations.\"\n\nHaving \"spent weekends in clubs, drinking with my mates\" when he was his daughter's age, Sirieix is passionate about the benefits sports can bring - \"focus, resilience, and having a goal\".\n\n\"There are lots of kids missing out,\" he says. \"How are we going to give more opportunities to our kids? Were Andrea not at that school and that talent-spotting day hadn't happened, she wouldn't be where she is.\"\n\nAnd that's a long way from the days when he took Andrea to nursery in a Cinderella or Snow White dress, almost every day. \"She said, 'I want to wear that, Daddy.' I used to dress her up like that! The woman at the nursery was rolling her eyes... But she was three years old. When is she going to do that again? That was a beautiful memory.\"\n\nSirieix has lived in the UK for 32 years, longer than he lived in France. His book, Seriously British, to be published in September, is described as a love letter to Britain. So, will his loyalties be torn in Paris?\n\n\"I'm not officially British, but I feel British,\" he says. \"I will be supporting Team GB. Obviously, I'm a bit biased, because my daughter is part of Team GB, and I've met many of the athletes.\n\n\"But I'm also proud to go back to my home country and showcase France to the Brits. I hope the French put a Games on that are just as good as the Brits did in 2012. I was in the stadium during the Opening Ceremony, and I felt so proud.\"\n\nSirieix had been to see Andrea and Lois practising the day before our chat. \"Their synchronisation was really good,\" he says. \"Andrea's diving has gone up a notch. It's beautiful because I have seen the evolution over the years, and now it's the best I've seen. The quality and consistency of the dives is incredible.\"\n\nBut he says Andrea knows winning isn't everything: \"When she wins, she commiserates with the losers, but, in the end, she celebrates. When she loses, she says well done to the winners, and she has a little cry. And an hour later, that's it. It's gone.\n\n\"That is the spirit of the Olympics. Pierre de Coubertin, when he restarted them, said, 'What's important is taking part.' You've got to enjoy it, and she's really enjoying it.\" It's safe to say that her father is, too.", "source": {"uri": "radiotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

His charm and wit quickly led him to become a fan favourite, going on to feature on ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here and Gordon, Gino and Fred: Road Trip with Gordon Ramsay and Gino D'Acampo.\n\nIt looks like fame runs in the Sirieix blood, as his daughter, Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix is also in the spotlight, as a diver for Team GB who is taking part in the Paris 2024 Olympics. The 19-year-old is already going into her second Olympic Games, quickly becoming one of the country's most promising athletes.\n\nOn Wednesday morning (July 31) Andrea will be taking part in the synchronised 10m platform diving, as she hopes to win gold for her country at the young age of 19, already holding 24 senior national and international medals in total.\n\nAndrea made her Olympic debut at just 16 when she reached the the 10m platform final in Tokyo in 2021. She has achieved a staggering amount at such a young age, and has already competed at the World Aquatics Championships, European Aquatics Championships, Commonwealth Games, and the British Diving Championships.\n\nThe young star recently won gold in the 2024 World Aquatics Championships team event, and she didn't stop there as she went on to make history by becoming the first British woman in world diving championships history to secure a medal in an individual Olympic event, after securing the bronze in the ten-metre platform.\n\nThe Team GB diver has also used her platform to 'speak out' against people objectifying athletes for simply wearing their uniform. \"I feel like now I'm a lot braver to actually call it out, but I've had DMs which I've blocked and deleted messages where people have (said) 'You aren't a good role model for the way you wear your costume'\", she told PA.\n\n\"The fact that I'm throwing myself over 10 metres should be enough to start a conversation. If you're honing in on my costume, it's very telling about how you've conditioned your mind.\n\nThe teen then went on to say she was 'disgusted' that people in sport were 'overly sexualised'\n\n\"When I see volleyball players (or) people in my sport who are overly sexualised, I kind of feel disgusted by that,\" she continued. \"We've dedicated our lives to this. We're not doing this so you can tell us we look good. We know we look good! We work for these bodies,\" Andrea said before concluding people need to 'wake up'.\n\n\"We can't change our costumes, but they can change the way that they think.\"\n\nAndrea credits her mother for getting her into the sport, Fred's ex wife Alex Spendolini, who the Channel 4 star was in a 12-year relationship with. The couple share two children, Andrea and Lucien.\n\n\"I didn't want to start diving... my mum forced me to start diving,\" she chuckled in a video on Team GB's YouTube channel.\n\nAndrea will be competing in the synchronised 10m platform diving alongside partner Lois Toulson on Wednesday July 31, and will then compete in the individual 10m platform diving on 5 August.\n\nSign up to OK!'s daily newsletter to get updates sent to your inbox for free", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kiesha_dosanjh@ok.co.uk", "name": "Kiesha Dosanjh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diving (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Spendolini-Sirieix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon,_Gino_and_Fred:_Road_Trip", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gordon, Gino and Fred: Road Trip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Dates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Dates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Sirieix", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Sirieix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gino_D'Acampo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gino D'Acampo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Ramsay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Ramsay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FINA_World_Aquatics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FINA World Aquatics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Channel 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Team GB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_Toulson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lois Toulson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK!", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OK!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/incoming/article33363882.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Fred-and-diving-daughter.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778021", "eventUri": "eng-9778021", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 3041, "textEnd": 3049}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 646, "textEnd": 653, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nTeam GB's Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix is hoping to win her first ever Olympic medal as she stars in the synchronised 10m platform diving competition on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe 19-year-old is appearing at her second Games, but after a tough debut in Tokyo, is confident of pushing for a place on the podium this time around. She is not short on medals, however, having already been crowned a world, European, national and Commonwealth champion during her career so far.\n\nA BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year winner in 2018, Spendolini-Sirieix goes into this year's Games iin Paris off the back of winning a gold medal in the team event of the 2024 World Aquatics Championships. She also won a bronze medal in the 10m platform competition - the first world medal won by a British woman in an individual Olympic event - and another bronze in the 10m synchronised platform event, so things are looking promising for the teenager.\n\nREAD MORE: Fred Sirieix's daughter at Olympics, his mystery fianc\u00e9e and famous TV clash\n\nREAD MORE: Olympics star Matt Richards' parents scammed over Paris tickets before Martin Lewis steps in\n\nAn Olympic medal, however, would not just be the highlight of her fledgling career, but would also see her step fully out of the shadow of her famous father. Yes, if the name sounded familiar, the diving sensation is the daughter of TV host and star of Channel 4's First Dates, Fred Sirieix.\n\nThe father and daughter are incredibly proud of each other's achievements, with the maitre d' regularly seen cheering her on from the stands at events. But Spendolini-Sirieix admits it has been nice to be finally acknowleged for what she has achieved as a diver rather than for her family name, having grown up \"standing in the back\" while her dad was recognised by fans.\n\nShe previously admitted it was \"a little bit difficult\" to get seen as an athlete rather than the daughter of a celebrity ahead of the 2020 Games, telling the Olympics website: \"My name wasn't in the newspaper. I was simply Fred Sirieix's daughter, which was quite hard because I was doing the diving, but my name wasn't coming up.\n\n\"Then this year ever so slightly the newspapers started to say 'Andrea'. And then my name would repeat a bit more, bit more,\" she added. \"It's very nice to finally have that recognition and to know that I am the diver. I'm Andrea. Dad does his job and he is amazing at it, but it is great to build my own identity off my own achievements.\"\n\nHowever, Spendolini-Sirieix has emerged as a star in her own right and, having gained a legion of fans for her honest insights into struggling with body image and mental health, was recently tipped to hit millionaire status before her 20th birthday next month.\n\nPR expert Carla Speight told the Sun late last year that the diving star could become a teen millonaire, having already signed big brand deals with Adidas and Lego. The expert added that she was set for a \"lucrative and diverse career\" which could see her earning millions of pounds through endorsements and other other opportunities.\n\n\"She's got a glittering future ahead of her and no doubt has it all mapped out,\" Speight said. \"She's standing on her own two feet and forging a successful career for herself, it's only right that big brands are queuing up to work with her, and she's set to earn millions.\"\n\n\"What's impressive about Andrea is she's achieved a lot of these highlights and prestigious awards at an incredibly young age in an industry that's worlds apart from her father. She's worked incredibly hard and has huge achievements under her belt - all due to her own talents and work ethic.\"\n\nSpeight added that Spendolini-Sirieix could also pursue a career in TV like her father if she wanted to, explaining: \"\"If she chooses to stay on her current pathway, there's no reason why we wouldn't see more of her on TV soon.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nHuddersfield's Lois Toulson has bagged an Olympic medal at the third time of asking alongside her Team GB partner Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix.\n\nIt is another Yorkshire medal to the collection in the Olympic games in Paris as the pair secured a bronze medal in the women's synchronised 10m platform at the Paris Olympics. It also maintains their flawless record in the diving pool with three medals from three events. China clinched the gold medal while North Korea took home the silver.\n\nDespite a shaky third dive, the British pair executed an impressive final dive to score 77.76, propelling them into medal contention. Although they were overtaken by China and North Korea, competitors Mexico and Canada failed to match their score.\n\nREAD MORE Tot '20 minutes from death' after drinking Slush Puppie at birthday party\n\nThe Cleckheaton hero Lois, 24, was cheered on by her boyfriend Jack Laugher and celebrity chef Fred Sirieix, father of Spendolini-Sirieix, who were both visibly emotional in the stands as their loved ones secured third place.\n\nIt comes after Olympics disappointment in Rio where, as a 16 year old, finished fifth, and a disappointing seventh in Tokyo. But having teamed up with Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix in the last 18 months, and winning two world championships, they have managed to secure a medal on the biggest stage of them all.\n\nThis is the third consecutive diving event where Team GB has won a medal, following Scarlett Mew Jensen and Yasmin Harper's bronze in the women's 3m synchro and Tom Daley and Noah Williams' silver in the 10m men's synchro. Mew Jensen expressed her delight at seeing her country's excellent performance at this year's Games continue.\n\nShe praised their 'nail-biting' effort but admitted that the ending had left her feeling stressed. She enthused on Radio 5 Live, \"Absolutely incredible, I went mental in the stands, lost my voice completely but that was absolutely incredible. It was down to the wire but so so proud of the girls. I felt just as stressed, if not more. That was nail-biting. They deserve it, they really do. Just incredible.\"\n\nThe 19 year old is also set to vie for a medal in her second event with the qualifying rounds for the individual 10m platform scheduled for Monday and the final anticipated the day after. Her father Fred admits finding it tough to watch his daughter's performances.\n\nThe Frenchman, 52, told the Daily Mail: \"An inner turmoil grips my body when I watch Andrea dive. I remember almost having a heart attack at the Commonwealth Games in 2022, where she won two gold medals. Thankfully Andrea handles the pressure a lot better than I do! \".\n\nHe shared, \"I'm sitting in the stands watching Andrea and trying to put myself in her state of mind. My heart goes up a few beats and I just think to myself 'OK, you've got to relax Fred'.\"\n\nRecounting his high-pressure experiences, he added, \"I've spent my career working in Michelin-starred restaurants with A-List clients and, let me tell you, the stress of those nights is nothing compared to this.\"\n\nGet all the latest and breaking news in Yorkshire by signing up to our newsletter

I wasn't Andrea.\n\n\"Then people realised, she's more than just someone's daughter, she has a lot more to say.\n\n\"I feel like that has helped me come out of this shadow. I'm really proud of my dad. And he does incredible things. But I want to build my own legacy.\n\n\"Also for my children in the future. I don't want them to just be someone's daughter or someone's son. I want them to be their own person.\n\n\"I'm being recognised for the achievements that I have, not just from being 50 per cent of someone's DNA.\n\n\"It's been a progression since Tokyo.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nViewers tuning into the BBC's coverage of the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris may be taken aback by a surprise face among the presenting lineup.\n\nWhile the usual suspects, the likes of Gabby Logan, Mark Chapman and Clare Balding will be leading the coverage, an unlikely addition has been made to the cast of presenters, with Fred Sirieix - best known as the maitre d' from Channel 4's First Dates - also on board.\n\nThe 52-year-old has emerged as a TV star after making his debut on the dating show in 2015, presenting series for the BBC, ITV and Channel 4, starring alongside Gordon Ramsey and Gino D'Acampo in a hit programme and appearing on reality shows including Gogglebox and I'm A Celebrity...\n\nBut who is the real Fred Sirieix and why has he been given the Olympics gig? Here's everything you need to know about the Frenchman's life away from the cameras, including his athlete daughter, mystery fiancee and his clash with a certain Nigel Farage.\n\nREAD MORE: Gabby Logan 'blindsided' by devastating family tragedy as she breaks down in tears\n\nREAD MORE: BBC Match of the Day pundit disappeared from TV after the Euros to become a preacher\n\nOlympian daughter\n\nLast month, the BBC confirmed that Sirieix would be joining the Olympics presenting line-up, providing commentary and analysis from inside the studio.\n\nWhile he has not worked in sports broadcasting before, however, he does have a link to the Games with his daughter Andrea Spendolini-Siriex part of the Team GB diving team in Paris.\n\nAndrea - the daughter of Siriex and his former partner Alex Spendolini - appeared at the last Olympics aged just 16, reaching the 10m platform final on her competition debut in Tokyo.\n\nBut it was in 2022 that she enjoyed her breakout year, as she became a World junior, two-time European senior, two-time Commonwealth Games and two-time national senior champion across 10m platform and 10m synchronised platform events, as well as a World senior medallist in the team event.\n\nThe 2018 BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year winner goes into this year's Games off the back of winning a gold medal in the team event of the 2024 World Aquatics Championships. She also won a bronze medal in the 10m platform competition - the first world medal won by a British woman in an individual Olympic event - and another bronze in the 10m synchronised platform event.\n\nSirieix has previously spoken of his pride at his daughter's achievements, telling Aimee Fuller's Monday Mile podcast: \"She's got a will of iron, her mind is just incredible.\"\n\nAfter competing in the World Aquatics Championships in February, Spendolini-Sirieix told the BBC. \"Every competition I do, my family's always in my heart. I always do my best to make them proud.\n\n\"He's just my dad. I don't really see him as Fred Sirieix the ma\u00eetre d', I don't see him as anything other than my dad.\"\n\nMystery fianc\u00e9e\n\nAfter splitting with his partner of 12 years, Sirieix found love again with a new woman who he affectionately nicknamed 'Fruitcake'.\n\nHaving started dating in 2014, the pair got engaged in 2020 and were due to marry the following year, only for their big day to be pushed back due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFruitcake's real identity has yet to be publicly revealed, but she has appeared alongside Sirieix in many social media posts and supported him during his stint on I'm A Celebrity... last year.\n\nWhile on the show, Sirieix said he was going to finally marry his fianc\u00e9e in 2024 as he recalled how the pair met.\n\n\"I've never had a bad date,\" he said. \"But the way I met Fruitcake, I met her in Peckham... I was walking up and she was smiling at me and I was smiling at her and I liked her eyes.\n\n\"I just had to talk to her, I asked for her number. I said: 'Shall we go for a drink tonight?'. That was nine years ago. We're getting married next year in Jamaica.\"\n\nClash with Nigel Farage\n\nWhile in the I'm A Celebrity... jungle, Siriex butted heads with some of his fellow campmates, including Reform UK leader Nigel Farage.\n\nThe maitre d' was left fuming during one clash with the Brexit architect, as he accused him of \"talking b*******\" and branded his behaviour \"shameful\".\n\nAs they became engaged in an argument over the deciision to leave the EU, Sirieix asked the former UKIP leader: \"What's the benefit of Brexit then? If you are an average person from Britain, what's the benefit?\"\n\nFarage replied: \"To know that we're independent, we stand on our own two feet in the world.\" But Sirieix was not having any of it as he fired back: \"'Brexit was about immigration, I remember your poster. I thought it was shameful what you did Nigel. Shameful.\"\n\nAfter another clash, the First Dates star ranted in the Bush Telegraph: \"He never answers the questions. But do you know why? Because he's talking b*****.\"\n\nAhead of this year's election, Siriex reignited the feud as he took to X to write: \"I spoke at length and extensively with Nigel Farage for three weeks while in the jungle. I wanted to make my own mind up about him and his views. Conclusion is simple.\n\n\"He was very good at washing the dishes in the river but when it comes to politics he has no plan and no substance. No vision. No concrete policies. He is not interested in making the UK / the world a better place. He just rants.\"", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_jones@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "John Jones", "type": "author",

After struggling with loneliness in Tokyo, as well as a bout of the 'twisties - the same terrifying, mid-air mental block that had haunted Simone Biles at those Games - having both the proud Frenchman and her Italian mother here has been a source of calm.\n\nFred, on soft duty for the BBC in the press box, was understandably anything but, though it perhaps helped the tension that gold was always out of reach. China's triumph here ahead of North Korea kept the sport's dominant force on track to sweep every gold medal at these Games, with the one they missed out on in Tokyo, to Tom Daley and Matty Lee in the men's equivalent off this event, already secure.\n\nHongchan Quan and Chen Yuxi were just 14 and 15 when winning this title three years ago, as well as, between them, individual silver and gold. Here, they were away and gone from the opening dive, almost 30 points clear by the third. Such was their eventual margin of victory, they might have belly-flopped the fifth and still won.\n\nBritain, though, had a perfect record of their own to maintain, silver for Daley and Noah Williams and bronze for Scarlett Mew Jensen and Yasmin Harper meaning they, too, had had podium presence in every event.\n\nThey started well, scores of 48.60 in each of the opening two rounds taking them first into the bronze medal position and then silver, as the Canadians faltered.\n\nAs the difficulty increased into round three came the first wobble, a slight miss on execution and a slip to fifth. The minor medals, still, were almost anyone's at that stage, seven points covering China's five distant chasers and then a gap to the out-of-sorts Americans and the never likely to contend home pair of France.\n\nThe North Koreans upped the ante, silver suddenly theirs to lose and Britain, a place outside the medals, with ground to make up.\n\nUnder extreme pressure, though, Toulson and Spendolini-Sirieix were superb, a dive scoring 77.76 taking their final total to 304.38, too good for Canada, who eventually finished fourth on 299.22.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Spendolini-Sirieix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diving (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Sirieix", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Sirieix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_Toulson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lois Toulson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Yuxi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chen Yuxi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matty_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matty Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Daley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Daley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Mew_Jensen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scarlett Mew Jensen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Williams_(diver)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noah Williams (diver)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver_and_Flatware", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver and Flatware", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/f53eeedb354624daf44234b60f5c4dbb", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778021", "eventUri": "eng-9778021", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Daughter of TV star bids for diving medal in Paris", "body": "Our mission is to deliver unbiased, fact-based reporting that holds power to account and exposes the truth.\n\nWhether $5 or $50, every contribution counts.\n\nSupport us to deliver journalism without an agenda.\n\nOlympic diver Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix was just 16 when she reached the the 10m platform final on her Olympic debut three years ago in Tokyo, and has since secured individual 2022 Commonwealth and European titles and a bronze this year that made her the first British woman in World Diving Championships history to secure a medal in an individual Olympic event.\n\nThe Team GB medal contender ahead of Paris 2024 feels particularly \"honoured\" by the opportunity she now has to serve as a role model for younger athletes, spreading a gospel of self-love and the importance of understanding the science behind why their bodies change.\n\nSurrounding herself with family, \"angel\" best friend Ben, and staying steered by her Christian faith has helped the multilingual Londoner with an Italian mum and a French father - her dad is First Dates maitre d' Fred Sirieix , who will be part of the BBC's coverage of the Olympics - remain grounded while the rest of the world wants to prematurely propel Spendolini-Sirieix onto an Olympic podium in one of the three countries she calls \"home\".\n\n\"I just need a small circle,\" she added. \"I feel like I've really grown in communicating my needs. It takes courage to communicate, because you put your heart on the line.\n\n\"Success to me doesn't equate to medals. I want to go there focused and determined and joyful. I want to come back feeling like I made the most of it, I gave it my everything.\n\n\"A competition doesn't define who I am but I really want to make memories. Without those memories, those medals are worthless.\"\n\nSpendolini-Sirieix says she will use her newfound courage to call out anyone who objectifies an athlete for simply wearing their uniform.\n\nThe soon-to-be journalism student has also written candidly about what was once a destructive relationship with food and body image, one she says has got \"a lot better\" after shedding internalised stereotypes and embracing self-acceptance.\n\n\"I feel like now I'm a lot braver to actually call it out, but I've had DMs which I've blocked and deleted messages where people have (said) 'You aren't a good role model for the way you wear your costume',\" Spendolini-Sirieix told the PA news agency.\n\n\"The fact that I'm throwing myself over 10 metres should be enough to start a conversation. If you're honing in on my costume, it's very telling about how you've conditioned your mind.\n\n\"When I see volleyball players (or) people in my sport who are overly sexualised, I kind of feel disgusted by that.\n\n\"We've dedicated our lives to this. We're not doing this so you can tell us we look good. We know we look good! We work for these bodies.\n\n\"People need to wake up. We can't change our costumes, but they can change the way that they think.\"\n\nGrowing up in an \"aesthetic\" sport, Spendolini-Sirieix, 19, found it difficult not to absorb the incorrect assumption that divers needed to be small, with thin frames and flat stomachs, and put pressure on herself to look a certain way.\n\nShe said: \"From such young age, from the age of eight, I was already very exposed with my costume and everything.\n\n\"I feel like even now, sometimes I struggle with... I don't want people to just tune in because they think, 'Oh, these girls are good-looking, so I'm not looking at the sport, I'm looking at their bodies'.\n\n\"I'm not going to dive in a wetsuit. I refuse. I know I'm not wearing this costume to attract attention, I'm not wearing it for the eyes of men or other people.\n\n\"For people to almost assume that women in sport and men in our sport as well wear these costumes so they can get attention is rude and insensitive to the hard work we actually put in.\"\n\nSpendolini-Sirieix, an ambassador by Team GB partner Toyota, is aware the spotlight is shining brighter on her in Paris, where she has cemented herself as one to watch, than it did in Tokyo.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"},

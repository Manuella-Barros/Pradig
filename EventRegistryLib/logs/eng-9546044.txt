Black women die from it 40% more often than white women, even though fewer of them are diagnosed. Also, Black women are 60% more likely to die from cervical cancer and almost twice as likely to die from endometrial cancer compared to white women.\n\nWhy Are More Black Women Getting Cancer?\n\nTo figure out why these big differences exist, the American Cancer Society started a study called VOICES of Black Women on Tuesday. They aim to sign up over 100,000 Black women aged 25 to 55 in the U.S. This would be the biggest study like this ever done in the country.\n\nThe participants must be cancer-free upon enrolling in the study, which will follow them for 30 years to see how their medical histories, lifestyle factors, and experiences of racism affect their risk of developing or dying from cancer.\n\nParticipants must live in one of 20 states or Washington, D.C., which together account for than 90% of the U.S. population of Black women ages 25 to 55.\n\nEnrollment starts with a brief registration on the study's website, followed by a survey that asks about medical history, diet, sleep patterns, physical activity, mental health, stress levels, and experiences of racism and discrimination.\n\nOnce they are enrolled, participants will be asked to fill out two surveys each year. If a woman develops cancer, the study researchers may ask her permission to reach out to her doctor for more information about her diagnosis.

It's within this context that the American Cancer Society is launching VOICES of Black Women,\" Dr. Lauren McCullough, a co-principal investigator and the visiting scientific director at the American Cancer Society, said at a briefing.\n\nBlack women have long been underrepresented in health research, in part because of a history of medical exploitation of Black patients. Examples abound: In the 19th century, physician James Marion Sims performed experimental gynecological surgery on Black women without anesthesia. Starting in 1932, the 40-year Tuskegee experiment denied treatment to Black men with syphilis. And in 1951, Henrietta Lacks' cancer cells were cultured without her consent, then subsequently used in decades of key scientific research.\n\n\"We recognize that there has been historic mistrust in the Black community for several reasons,\" said a co-principal investigator of the VOICES study, Dr. Alpa Patel, senior vice president of population science for the American Cancer Society.\n\n\"It's been really front and center for us to ensure that we've partnered with Black women to understand how to build this study in a way that is respectful,\" she said.\n\nThe study allows participants to opt out of providing medical records and keeps their names hidden from published research. A review board will also provide ethical oversight.\n\nTo be eligible for the study, participants must live in one of 20 states or Washington, D.C., which together account for than 90% of the U.S. population of Black women ages 25 to 55.\n\nEnrollment starts with a brief registration on the study's website, followed by a survey that asks about medical history, diet, sleep patterns, physical activity, mental health, stress levels and experiences of racism and discrimination.\n\nOnce they are enrolled, participants will be asked to fill out two surveys each year.

For example, Black and White women are equally likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer, but Black women are almost 40% more likely to die from it.\n\nBlack women are also twice as likely to be diagnosed with stomach cancer as White women and 2.3 times more likely to die from it.\n\nYet Black women have historically been excluded from most clinical research that has focused mostly on White men.\n\nThe Voices of Black Women study hopes to recruit at least 100,000 Black women from 20 states and the District of Columbia to follow for 30 years.

The organization hopes to see a similar breakthrough with this newest research.\n\n\"Voices of Black Women represents a crucial step toward achieving health equity in a population that is long overdue,\" said Dr. Alpa Patel, co-principal investigator of the study and the senior vice president of population science at the American Cancer Society, in a statement.\n\n\"The data we've uncovered through previous population studies has been critical in reducing the unacceptably high burden of cancer, but the reduction has sadly not been equal.

Study participants can withdraw at any time after giving consent.\n\nThe VOICES of Black Women study is a crucial step toward achieving health equity in a population that is long overdue, according to Alpa Patel, American Cancer Society senior vice president for population science and co-principal investigator of the study.\n\n\"By centering Black women's voices and experiences, we can dig deeper in uncovering the unique challenges and barriers contributing to cancer disparities and develop tailored interventions to mitigate them,\" Patel said in a statement.\n\nFor more information about the study and how to participate, visit voices.cancer.org.", "source": {"uri": "news.wttw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTTW News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eunice_alpasan@news.wttw.com", "name": "Eunice Alpasan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hispanic whites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breast cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epithelium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biological life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Navigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skin cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Organizations", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Organizations", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://news.wttw.com/sites/default/files/field/image/Mammogram_BV_FILE.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546044", "eventUri": "eng-9546044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

I didn't understand then, but she had one breast.\"\n\nYears later, Breanna Berry said she watched as a friend, also a Black woman, was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 28, and as her father died after being diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, a diagnosis she said took over one year as his symptoms were misdiagnosed.\n\nJacque Berry not only watched her grandmother and husband battle cancer, but she is currently a caregiver to a close friend with breast cancer and has another friend who is battling the same disease.\n\nNow, the mother and daughter, who both live in Atlanta, are part of the effort to help save the lives of Black women and future generations.\n\nThe Berrys are some of the first participants in VOICES for Black Women, a study launched May 7, by the American Cancer Society that aims to figure out why Black women have increasingly high rates of cancer.\n\n\"I want to know why this is happening,\" Breanna Berry said of her motivation to join the study, which is currently accepting participants.\n\n\"I have a granddaughter, so knowing that my voice was heard to help her generation is very huge to me,\" Jacque Berry added.\n\nVOICES for Black Women is described by the ACS as the largest-ever study of cancer risk and outcomes in Black women in the United States. The study will collect the data of 100,000 Black women ages 25 to 55 over a period of 30 years, looking at everything from their medical history to their income, environment, lifestyle and more, according to Dr. Alpa Patel, senior vice president of population science at the ACS.\n\n\"We will really build a relationship and go on a journey with these women over the next several decades, learning about their lived experiences and collecting information along the way from participants,\" Patel told \"GMA.\" \"And we use all of that information then to understand what is related to [the] risk of developing or dying from cancer and other health outcomes.\"\n\nPatel said current cancer data shows the need for the study. According to data from the ACS, Black women are more likely than other women to die of cancer regardless of the stage of cancer when diagnosed, and before the age of 50, Black women are twice as likely to die of a breast cancer diagnosis than white women.\n\n\"It's an unequal burden, and it's more pronounced at younger ages,\" Patel said. \"That was part of our motivation to set our enrollment age range it at a younger age range of 25 to 55.\" <-- PLEASE CHECK THIS QUOTE\n\nAmong all races and genders, Black people have the highest death rate from cancer, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWhen it comes to Black women, they are more likely than white women to be diagnosed with breast, lung, and colorectal cancers at a late stage, according to the CDC.\n\nLast year, a study released in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that Black women had the same risk of dying from breast cancer if they were screened starting at age 42 as the general population had with screenings starting at the recommended age of 50.\n\nAnd Black women are now being told more about the cancer risks associated with the beauty products they may use, specifically hair straighteners. Late last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it was considering issuing a proposed rule to ban hair straighteners with formaldehyde, a known carcinogen which has been found to cause an increased risk of endometrial cancers when used in chemical hair straighteners, often marketed to Black women.\n\nOther products -- including perms, hair relaxers, lotions and gels -- geared towards Black women have been found to raise the risk of diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease and other health risks.\n\nPatel said many of the questions about Black women's health remain unanswered because, for decades, they have not been the primary focus of studies, both because of their race and their sex.\n\n\"Most studies, while they have been inclusive of Black women, there has been an underrepresentation of Black and brown individuals,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, what that's meant is a lot of what we've learned has been built off of studies of predominantly white individuals. We know a lot, but we don't know whether the same holds true in different populations.\"\n\nPatel said inequitable access to high-quality medical care is one contributor to Black women's health outcomes, but it's not the only one.\n\nParticipants in the VOICES for Black Women study, according to Patel, will share information about their daily personal lives so that researchers can look into the roles that other factors like diet, income, stress, mental health, social support and more play in health risks for Black women.\n\nShe said the study -- which is led by an all-Black female scientific advisory board -- was built and named intentionally with the hope of giving voice to Black women.\n\n\"What we hope to accomplish through the study is to really give an opportunity for 100,000 Black women to allow their voice to be heard, to change what cancer means for their daughters and their granddaughters,\" Patel said. \"This is a legacy gift. What I really hope is that women will choose to participate in honor of their daughters and their granddaughters and their nieces and the generations to come.\"", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Breast cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pancreatic cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tissue (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorectal cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JAMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Endometrial cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carcinogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cosmetics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Menopause", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Menopause", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/2ee4f47b-5514-449d-8633-789866daff98/Breana-jacque-berry-cancer-ht-thg-240506_1715006069071_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546044", "eventUri": "eng-9546044", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 1151, "textEnd": 1156}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Given her extensive family history of breast cancer, she underwent testing and found out she has a hereditary gene that predisposed her to getting the disease. That helped her make the decision to undergo a double mastectomy seven years ago.\n\nCosta's grandmother died from breast cancer when Costa was very young. \"A few aunts that I've never been able to meet\" also had breast cancer and died before she was born. Her sister has breast cancer, an uncle had breast cancer, and her father is \"at the moment\" dealing with prostate cancer that has spread to his bones.\n\n\"It made sense,\" Costa said, \"to get tested\" for the gene.\n\nNow she wants other Black women to be educated about the cancer risks they may face.\n\nShe is serving as a \"Voices Ambassador\" for the American Cancer Society, which on Monday announced the launch of one of its largest population studies to find out why, a society researcher said, Black women have \"some of the poorest outcomes and lowest survival of most types of cancer.\"\n\nThe study is seeking to enroll 100,000 study participants, including more than 6,000 in New York, to be monitored over several decades. The goal is to understand what propels the high cancer risk in Black women and how to improve outcomes.\n\nWomen may not want to choose Costa's path of undergoing a prophylactic mastectomy. But she wants them to know about their options.\n\n\"So many people didn't know they had options in my family. It was something that just sort of happened to us instead of being warned. ... \"I'm hoping to spread the word,\" Costa said, who has self-published a book about her experience she called \"The Beautiful Defect.\"\n\n\"Perhaps if we're more educated [about cancer], if these societies can figure out what's happening with us, we'll have more information,\" she said.\n\nThe American Cancer Society's population research study is called the \"Voices of Black Women,\" which will involve delving into the \"unique lives\" of Black women, assessing not only their demographic information, such as their socio-economic status, but stressors in their lives, over the course of 30 years.\n\nAlpa V. Patel, senior vice president of the American Cancer Society's population science division, said in a virtual news conference: \"The study is going to be truly transformative in helping us learn about why Black women have some of the highest death rates and shortest survival of any racial, ethnic group in the United States for most cancers.\"\n\nBlack/African Americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group for all cancers combined and for most major cancers, according to the United States Department of Health and Human Services. From 2015-2019, Black/African American women were almost 40% more likely to die from breast cancer, as compared to non-Hispanic white women.\n\nThe society is recruiting Black women from 20 states and the District of Columbia, a geographic swath of the nation that runs from the Northeast, portions of the Midwest to California and Texas, and across the South, which officials said captures 90% of the Black population. Officials are looking for 6,666 Black women who are cancer-free except for certain types of skin cancer, ranging in age from 25 to 55, across New York to participate. For more information, go to https://voices.cancer.org.\n\nThe researchers said the study has undergone ethical oversight by the society's review board, is pledging data privacy protections and is guided by a Black Women Scientific Review Board, reflecting a sensitivity to the \"mistrust\" some Black people may have of the medical establishment because of past mistreatments in health care and science research.\n\nLauren McCullough, the society's visiting scientific director of epidemiology, and a study principal investigator, along with Patel, said that as a Black woman herself, \"The work that I do is very personal. You live and experience this and you know that it affects health. But you can't necessarily articulate how, until you have the data.

Black women are also about 60% more likely than white women to die of cervical cancer and more than twice as likely to die of stomach cancer.\n\nTo better understand these racial differences and ultimately remove barriers and improve outcomes for Black women, The American Cancer Society is launching a landmark study called VOICES of Black Women.\n\nThe VOICES of Black Women study hopes to recruit at least 100,000 Black women from 20 states including Georgia between the ages of 25 and 55 -- and follow them for 30 years. The large-scale study is concentrating on these areas because that is where 90% of the U.S. Black women between these ages live.\n\n\"My immediate hope is that in joining this study, Black women feel that there are people out there who see them and are fighting for them and they want better outcomes for them and their family and their future daughters, grandaughters etc.,\" said Dr. Lauren McCullough, an Atlanta resident and one of the lead researchers of the ACS study.\n\nThe study will look at medical history and information about the women's daily lives so researchers can better understand how many factors -- including diet, income, physical activity, stress levels and experiences of racism and discrimination -- may affect the risk of developing or dying of cancer.\n\nThe study will look at where people live and how poor air quality and heavy metals in the soil can impact cancer progression.\n\nAlso importantly, McCullough said access to health care doesn't necessarily mean a Black woman will get the quality health care they need.\n\n\"I engage with breast cancer survivors on a consistent basis and some of the stories I hear blow people's minds,\" said McCullough.\n\nShe said a young women in her late 20s with a lump went to her doctor who dismissed it as nothing to worry about.

Cancer society launches long-term study", "body": "Cases of uterine cancer are on the rise, and it can be seen more in black women than in white women.\n\nA cancer diagnosis is terrifying for anyone, but Black women have an extra reason to be afraid. Although Black women have a slightly lower risk of developing cancer, once they've been diagnosed they are more likely to die and die faster than non-Black women.\n\n\"We always say cancer affects everyone, but it doesn't affect everyone equally,\" said Alpa Patel, a senior vice president at the American Cancer Society.\n\nTo understand why, the American Cancer Society Tuesday is launching the largest-ever study of cancer risk and outcomes in Black women.\n\nThe Society, which has run other large, long-term studies over the last 70 years, aims to enroll more than 100,000 Black women between the ages of 25 and 55 who are cancer-free and follow them over three decades. They are focusing enrollment in 20 states and the District of Columbia - areas where the majority of Black American women live.\n\nPrevious long-term studies by the Cancer Society solidified the link between smoking and lung cancer, tied obesity to a variety of health problems and showed that regular aspirin use can reduce the risk of colon cancer. So organizers are hopeful that 30 years of data on Black women will reveal important insights.\n\n\"This study has so much potential to change what cancer means to generations of Black women,\" said Patel, an expert in population science.\n\nThe ACS chose to launch the study now, because the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted health disparities by race and also because over the last decade, Black women have become more interested in health issues, said Lauren McCullough, co-principle investigator on the study.\n\n\"We're trying to engage a community that is already activated and really wants this opportunity to understand why they have disproportionate rates of cancers and other diseases,\" she said in a Monday call with reporters.\n\nParticipants will be asked to fill out an initial questionnaire, that takes about 15 minutes, followed by an hour-long, more detailed questionnaire about their lives and family histories, and their mental and emotional health, McCullough said.\n\nThen, there will be a 30-minute online follow-up survey every six months for the next 30 years.\n\nAnyone is eligible to participate as long as they identify as Black, were assigned female at birth or self-identify as a woman, don't have a history of cancer (except basal or squamous skin cancer), are between 25 and 55 and live in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia or Washington, D.C.\n\nMore information about the Voices of Black Women study and how to participate is available at voices.cancer.org.\n\nPatel said the answers will begin coming once large numbers of Black women join the study.\n\n\"The faster we get to 100,000, the faster we get to the first wave of answers,\" Patel said. Participant information will be de-identified and the Cancer Society has been careful to center Black women in developing the study to help build relationships with participants and combat historic mistrust, she said.\n\nOverall, about 10% of all breast cancer falls into the most aggressive category, called triple-negative, because it lacks receptors for any hormones. Among Black women, however, 20% of breast cancers are in this category, but it's not clear whether that's because of genetics, environment, diet, the stress of enduring racism or some other factor.\n\n\"This is something we really need to be able to learn to find successful ways to intervene,\" Patel said.\n\nBlack women also experience higher rates of colon and endometrial cancer and at earlier ages. The study will collect tumor samples if a study participant is diagnosed with cancer.\n\n\"We're at a point in time where we have to say we can't keep talking about it, we have to solve it,\" she said.\n\nUpdated guidelines: Task force says this is when women should begin breast cancer screening, get mammograms\n\nIn an unrelated study published May 4, researchers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute found that their peers had been too focused on identifying racial disparities rather than investing in efforts to reverse them.\n\nCancer deaths have fallen substantially over the last three decades, the study noted, but those benefits have not been spread equally.\n\nMost of the federal funds available for addressing disparities have been spent on public education and research rather than on efforts to reduce differences in care, the study found.\n\n\"What is the use of developing new therapies if the communities that could benefit the most are the very ones that cannot access them?\" study author Dr. Christopher Lathan, Dana-Farber's associate chief medical officer said in a statement.\n\nTo try to reduce racial and socioeconomic health disparities in cancer diagnoses, real estate developer Bruce Ratner announced Monday he would help fund increased lung and breast cancer screening across the borough of Queens, New York.\n\nThe Ratner Early Detection Initiative will invest in better early detection tools, patient navigation and practices to increase screenings in underresourced areas, in collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and MediSys Health Network, which includes Jamaica Hospital Medical Center and Flushing Hospital Medical Center.\n\nRatner, who co-wrote a new book Early Detection: Catching Cancer When It's Curable with science writer Adam Bonislawski, has been interested in the early detection of cancer since his brother Michael Ratner died of the disease in 2016.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Named the VOICES of Black Women study, this ambitious endeavor seeks to enroll at least 100,000 Black women from across the United States, including Georgia, to participate in a comprehensive examination of cancer risk and outcomes within the community.\n\nWith cancer affecting millions of lives each year, particularly within minority populations, the VOICES of Black Women study represents a critical step towards achieving health equity and improving cancer outcomes for Black women. The study, spanning a duration of 30 years, aims to shed light on the factors contributing to disparities in cancer incidence, treatment, and survival rates among Black women.\n\n\"VOICES of Black Women represents a crucial step towards achieving health equity in a population that is long overdue,\" Dr. Alpa Patel, Senior Vice President of Population Science, American Cancer Society, said. \"The data we've uncovered through previous population studies has been critical in reducing the unacceptably high burden of cancer, but that reduction has sadly not been equal.\"\n\nParticipation in the VOICES of Black Women study is open to Black women aged 25 to 55 who have not been diagnosed with cancer, with the exception of some skin cancers. The study will involve participants completing a series of surveys about their behavioral and environmental experiences related to cancer risk factors. Importantly, the study does not require participants to undergo clinical testing or take medications.\n\n\"By centering Black women's voices and experiences, we can dig deeper in uncovering the unique challenges and barriers contributing to cancer disparities and develop tailored interventions to mitigate them,\" Patel explained.\n\nThe launch of the study comes at a critical time, as cancer continues to disproportionately affect Black communities across the nation. In Georgia alone, the ACS estimates that over 63,000 individuals will be diagnosed with cancer this year, with approximately 18,740 expected to succumb to the disease.\n\nBy enrolling in this first-of-its-kind study, Black women have an opportunity to contribute to groundbreaking research that could ultimately lead to more effective prevention strategies, early detection methods, and treatment options.", "source": {"uri": "atlantadailyworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Atlanta Daily World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skin cancer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Organizations", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://atlantadailyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/05/friendship-day-3104635_1280.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546044", "eventUri": "eng-9546044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

There are a number of cultural, regional, and religious characteristics that intertwine to affect how they interact with the world. Their social environment, their behaviors, and ultimately their health outcomes. With this additional granularity, we can start to pull things apart. It's not just about being Black or it's not just about, you know, having a lower socioeconomic status or living in a rural or a metro area. We want to be able to explore the intersections of these things. That helps us get to better, tailored interventions for women living in this population,\" McCullough said.\n\nThe American Cancer Society says past similar studies have contributed to landmark discoveries in cancer science, from the linkage of cigarette smoking to lung cancer, obesity to the risk of early death, and red and processed meat intake to higher risk of colon cancer.\n\nDoctors often diagnose breast cancer at later and more aggressive stages in Black women than in White women,\u202fand\u202fBlack women are more likely than any other women to\u202fdie from\u202fcervical cancer, according to the CDC.\n\nParticipants will take a 30-minute survey twice a year.

Your story is not in isolation,\" McCullough said. \"I have talked to hundreds of women who have the same experience. I, as a Black woman, have had the same experience.

Black women are also about 60% more likely than white women to die of cervical cancer and more than twice as likely to die of stomach cancer.\n\nTo better understand these racial differences and ultimately remove barriers and improve outcomes for Black women, The American Cancer Society is launching a landmark study called VOICES of Black Women.\n\nThe VOICES of Black Women study hopes to recruit at least 100,000 Black women from 20 states including Georgia between the ages of 25 and 55 -- and follow them for 30 years. The large-scale study is concentrating on these areas because that is where 90% of the U.S. Black women between these ages live.\n\n\"My immediate hope is that in joining this study, Black women feel that there are people out there who see them and are fighting for them and they want better outcomes for them and their family and their future daughters, grandaughters etc.,\" said Dr. Lauren McCullough, an Atlanta resident and one of the lead researchers of the ACS study.\n\nThe study will look at medical history and information about the women's daily lives so researchers can better understand how many factors -- including diet, income, physical activity, stress levels and experiences of racism and discrimination -- may affect the risk of developing or dying of cancer.\n\nThe study will look at where people live and how poor air quality and heavy metals in the soil can impact cancer progression.\n\nAlso importantly, McCullough said access to health care doesn't necessarily mean a Black woman will get the quality health care they need.\n\n\"I engage with breast cancer survivors on a consistent basis and some of the stories I hear blow people's minds,\" said McCullough.\n\nShe said a young women in her late 20s with a lump went to her doctor who dismissed it as nothing to worry about. She kept pushing for more tests until finally, after bleeding from her nipple, she was taken seriously, and diagnosed with stage 3 cancer.\n\n\"From a scientific end, we want to have the scientific evidence that systemic racism is real and there are places where we need interventions. We need environmental interventions. We need overhauls. We need social interventions,\" said McCullough. \"And from a clinical perspective to say, well this treatment is not working. We need to be able to say why certain treatments don't work. What are the things we need to be looking for? What are the alternatives for these women?\"\n\nEnrolled participants will fill out two surveys a year delivered via a secure online portal. No medication, clinical testing, treatment, or lifestyle changes are part of the study, according to ACS. The women enrolling in the study must be cancer-free.\n\nPast population studies from ACS, which has included about 2.5 million research participants over the years have contributed to groundbreaking discoveries and have transformed our understanding of cancer including research linking cigarette smoking to lung cancer and more recent research linking a high consumption of red and processed meat to a higher risk of colon cancer.\n\nBlack women have long been underrepresented in cancer research. Black patients -- men and women -- account for only 5% of clinical trial participants in the U.S.\n\nMcCullough said the reasons for the low numbers include medical mistrust and not being recruited to participate.\n\n\"So often times when we get the results we have to always ask is, is this relevant to this particular demographic? Are there things that we haven't taken into account that may uniquely affect Black women? To have a study that is focused on Black women will help us make significant advancements in the understanding the health of Black women,\" she said.\n\nThis massive study hits close to home for Atlanta attorney Imani Monica McCullough, who is of no relation to Dr. McCullough.\n\nShe knew something was off in her body.\n\nShe saw doctor after doctor, at least four in all, hoping for an answer.\n\nEach time, she was told that nothing was wrong. She even paid for an MRI out of pocket because a doctor didn't think she needed one.\n\nOne time she happened to see her chart and a doctor had described her as \"hyper-vigilant.\"\n\n\"I don't know if that was meant to be a positive or not,\" she said. \"I kept going because they kept turning me away.\"\n\nEventually, two years ago, McCollough, 52, was diagnosed with follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Doctors have not recommended treatment and are just monitoring her, which is common with this diagnosis, she said.\n\n\"It was a long road,\" said McCollough, who thinks one of the reasons she had to push so hard to be heard was that she was a Black woman. \"I know the healthcare industry is taxed, doctors are overloaded and guidelines have to be followed, but sometimes I didn't feel that I was seen and heard in the same way,\" as others. And even then, because her chart showed she was an attorney, she thinks she may have been heard more than other Black women, who don't have similar occupations, \"sadly.\"\n\n\"Sometimes there is a disparity,\" she said. She thinks studies like the current one can help address why Black women have a higher mortality rate for certain types of cancer.\n\nShe's also thinking about younger members of her family. \"This research can benefit younger people to understand the risks and do all we can to prevent and change the trajectory of the disease.\"", "source": {"uri": "ajc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution"}, "authors": [{"uri": "helena_oliviero@ajc.com", "name": "Helena Oliviero", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "shelia_poole@ajc.com", "name": "Shelia Poole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Breast cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cervical cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stomach cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physical activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heavy metals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evidence-based medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Institutional racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bleeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipple", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nipple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processed_meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Processed meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hodgkin_lymphoma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hodgkin lymphoma"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Organizations", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Organizations", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://thumb.spokesman.com/zeXisqn8TWyaYbf9AlOSSS3lhkM=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2024/05/09/663d1f6046aba.hires.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546044", "eventUri": "eng-9546044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

The risk is nearly double for endometrial cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\nLauren McCullough, co-principal investigator and the visiting scientific director at the American Cancer Society highlighted during a briefing that Black women are often diagnosed at later stages with more aggressive tumour types, contributing to higher mortality rates.\n\nHistorical mistrust in the healthcare system among the Black community, rooted in past medical exploitation, poses a challenge to such research efforts.\n\nNotable past abuses include unauthorised surgeries by James Marion Sims in the 19th century, the Tuskegee syphilis experiment beginning in 1932, and the case of Henrietta Lacks in 1951, whose cancer cells were used in research without her consent.\n\nAddressing these concerns, Dr. Alpa Patel, senior vice president of population science at the American Cancer Society and a co-principal investigator of the study, emphasized the careful planning and ethical considerations involved in VOICES. \"We've partnered with Black women to understand how to build this study in a way that is respectful,\" she stated.\n\nParticipants in the study, who must be cancer-free at enrollment and reside in one of 20 states or Washington, D.C., will be asked to complete biannual surveys covering a wide range of topics from medical history to experiences of racism. This comprehensive data collection aims to shed light on how various factors, including systemic racism, impact cancer risks among Black women.\n\nThe findings from VOICES could play a crucial role in breaking down barriers to cancer prevention, detection, and treatment for Black women, potentially leading to more targeted and effective healthcare interventions.\n\n\"It's rare that I use the word 'transformative,' but I think it's very appropriate here,\" Patel concluded, underscoring the potential impact of the study on improving health outcomes and achieving equity in cancer care.", "source": {"uri": "thetrentonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Trent"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ekamma_jacobs@thetrentonline.com", "name": "Ekamma Jacobs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cervical cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breast cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tuskegee Syphilis Study"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Marion_Sims", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Participants must be cancer-free upon enrollment and will be tracked for 30 years to examine the impact of medical history, lifestyle factors, and experiences of racism on cancer risk and mortality.\n\n\"To be eligible for the study, participants must live in one of the 20 states or Washington, D.C., which together account for more than 90% of the U.S. population of Black women ages 25 to 55,\" McCullough clarified.\n\nThe initiative seeks to confront historical injustices in medical research, which have often excluded or exploited Black participants. McCullough referenced past instances of medical exploitation, including the Tuskegee experiment and the unauthorized use of Henrietta Lacks' cells.\n\nThe study allows individuals to opt out of providing medical records, and their identities will remain confidential in published research. Officials said this would safeguard participants' privacy and ensure ethical oversight,\n\nA brief registration on the study's website precedes a thorough survey covering medical history, lifestyle choices, and encounters with racism and discrimination.\n\nEnrollment is open in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.\n\n\"This isn't just a study; it's a collective commitment to understanding and improving the health of Black women across the nation,\" affirmed cancer society officials. \"And that change starts with you.\"", "source": {"uri": "theskanner.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

With the 20 states and D.C. selected, McCullogh said they represented just over 90% of the U.S. Black population.\n\nAnd with the age group 25-55, she said it's because black women are diagnosed with cancer younger than any other race or ethnic group.\n\nPopulation Science allows the collection of large groups of people and their lived experiences to track health outcomes.\n\nThat's Dr. Alpa Patel does with ACS.

After being diagnosed with breast cancer in March, she underwent surgery and a voluntary double mastectomy to treat her cancer.\n\n\"I'm a tough cookie, but it was terrifying. It really was,\" Candelario said.\n\nBut she also remembers wondering why. After all, she had always eaten right, worked out and got her mammograms on time.\n\n\"I just kept wondering. (The) doctor said you don't have to do anything (wrong). You can be one of the healthiest people in the world, and cancer just picked you,\" she said.\n\nBut that question of \"why\" is motivating the American Cancer Society to take a deeper look at Black women and their cancer rates. The organization is recruiting 100,000 Black women between ages 25 and 55 who have not been diagnosed with cancer for a long term tracking of their health over 30 years.\n\n\"We will be tracking the population for over three decades. But we really look at it as a relationship that we're building with 100,000 black women.

(WAVY) - The American Cancer Society has picked Hampton Roads to be involved in a new study to help fight breast cancer, focusing on Black women.\n\nIts called the Voice of Black Women study. Researchers here and in Atlanta are looking for 100,000 women to participate in the study. They want 90% of participants to be African-American women. The goal of the study is to determine why Black woman have a higher mortality rate of breast cancer, despite more white women developing the disease.\n\n10 On Your Side talked with Dr. Bruce Waldholtz with the American Cancer Society. He is involved in the study.\n\n\"African-American women are actually a little bit less likely than white women to get breast cancer, but have a 40% higher mortality rate,\" said Waldholtz, who is a cancer survivor himself. He's also a researcher at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk.\n\n\"There are likely multiple causes for that. And this study, which is done entirely online... it explains the purpose of the study, which is to try to decrease health care disparities in breast cancer,\" Waldholtz said.\n\nThe 30-year study will involve 20 women from 20 states and Washington, DC. Researchers will look at things like medical history and lifestyle factors to find early triggers that could cause breast cancer for women down the road. They are looking for participants ages 25 to 55. Women will be required to compete a 30-minute study two times a year.\n\nRecruitment for the study began in Oct. 2023 with a pilot launch in Atlanta and Hampton Roads. The national launch expands enrollment to Alabama, California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.\n\nEligible participants must identify as Black, be assigned female at birth or self-identify as women and not have a history of cancer.\n\nResearchers say the information they learn from this story will be used to help fight cancer for future generations.\n\nThe American Cancer Society says the cost of the study is about $100 million dollars over 30 years.\n\nIf you're interested in participating, you can sign up on-line using the link here.", "source": {"uri": "wavy.com", "dataType": "news",

It is the leading cause of cancer death in Black women, who are 40% more likely to die than their white counterparts. Uterine cancer deaths are highest among black women, according to the National Cancer Institute, and Black women are 60% more likely to die of cervical cancer.\n\nBlack men and women in the United States have a history as the victims of medical research abuse and ethical violations, which had led to their underrepresentation from many modern-day studies. Starting in the early 1900s, laws passed in 32 states allowed the government to sterilize the \"insane,\" \"feebleminded,\" \"dependent\" and \"diseased\" that saw more than 60,000 victims, most of whom were Black women. From 1932 to 1972, Black men were lied to about participating in a study to find a cure for syphilis when, in reality, they were part of a federally financed experiment into untreated syphilis. The public became aware of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study in the 1970s and the government soon after began paying reparations to its victims. In the 1940s, the cancerous cells of Henrietta Lacks were taken by doctors at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and given to researchers without her knowledge or consent, a major ethical violation. Her cells led to numerous breakthroughs in biological research but researchers continued to use them unethically -- and her family never saw any money from the profits produced using her materials and no consent was ever given for the publishing of her name, medical records or cell genome, which was later redacted. The Lacks family later reached an agreement with the U.S. National Institutes of Health over further releases.\n\nParticipants in one of 20 states or Washington, D.C. can register for the study at voices.cancer.org.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cervical cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medical research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Endometrial cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breast cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uterine cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cancer_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Cancer Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syphilis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_(microbiology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sterilization (microbiology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tuskegee Syphilis Study"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Henrietta Lacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johns Hopkins Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Institutes of Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Menopause", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Menopause", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/663a30f975cb7fe541007c2c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2660,1380,x0,y749,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546044", "eventUri": "eng-9546044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

The American Cancer Society launches 'Voices of Black Women' to find answers.\n\nBlack women in the United States have the highest cancer death rates across all malignancies. This dim reality, cut in the history of epidemiology, has led to major concerns among scientists and health experts alike. Why do black women have a disproportionately higher chance of dying from cancer than their white counterparts? The hunt for answers has kindled the flame of inquiry within the halls of the American Cancer Society (ACS), resulting in the launch of the colossal project known as Voices of Black Women.\n\nThe urgency to fathom the underlying causes behind the alarming cancer mortality rates among Black women cannot be overstated. Astonishingly, Black women are not only more likely to develop certain cancers, such as stomach cancer, but they also face significantly elevated mortality rates from these malignancies. For instance, the ACS reports that Black women are twice as likely as White women to be afflicted by stomach cancer and 2.3 times more likely to succumb to it.\n\nWomen's studies are not only a crucial act of self-empowerment but also a tangible step towards collective progress in understanding and addressing health disparities. Eligible participants must meet specific criteria to enroll in this transformative endeavor. Prospective contributors should be between the ages of 25 and 55, devoid of a history of cancer except for basal or squamous cell skin cancer, and reside within the geographical confines of the 20 states earmarked for the study.\n\nWith a focus on inclusivity and representation, the study aims to collect the narratives of 100,000 black women aged 25 to 55 over a span of 30 years.Dr. Alpa Patel, senior vice president of population science at the ACS, elucidates the multifaceted approach of the study, delving into diverse facets of participants' lives, including medical history, socioeconomic status, environmental influences, and lifestyle factors.\n\nDespite advancements in medical science, black women continue to face higher mortality rates and disproportionate burdens of cancer incidence.Dr. Patel stresses the urgency of addressing systemic inequities in access to high-quality medical care while acknowledging the multifactorial nature of health disparities. Beyond healthcare access, the study seeks to explore the complex interplay of factors such as diet, income, stress, mental health, and social support in shaping health outcomes for black women.\n\nThe journey of discovery begun by participants in the Voices of Black Women study is multifaceted and deeply introspective. Through biannual surveys, individuals are invited to share the mosaic of their lived experiences, spanning the spectrum from childhood reminiscences to adult realities. Every narrative, every anecdote, and every insight serve as a precious brick in the edifice of knowledge, fortifying the foundation upon which future advancements in cancer prevention and treatment shall be erected.\n\nThe ACS states that the study is significant because \"for generations, Black women have not been equally included in important health research, resulting in a lack of information about Black women's health.\"", "source": {"uri": "shethepeople.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheThePeople"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oshi_saxena@shethepeople.tv", "name": "Oshi Saxena", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stomach cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_squamous-cell_carcinoma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anatomical terms of location"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medical history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_support", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social support"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Socioeconomic status"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Menopause", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Menopause", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://img-cdn.thepublive.com/fit-in/580x326/filters:format(webp)/shethepeople/media/media_files/8PtTd3py6JT2pf767OVD.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546044", "eventUri": "eng-9546044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4588235294117647, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

It is the largest study of its kind led by the American Cancer Society.\n\nThe goal is to enroll 100,000 Black women across the country between the ages of 25-55. Participants would then be followed for 30 years to see if they were diagnosed with cancer and what types.\n\nThe organization says it is looking for participants from Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.\n\nStudy leaders say these areas account for 90% of the nation's Black population.\n\nRegina Johnes said she is pleased to see a study like this starting. The Wake Forest mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 36.\n\n\"My husband lived in one city and I lived in another city,\" shared Johnes. \"Here we are trying to plan a wedding and a move and talking about a family - and everything halted.\"\n\nJohnes said she found out she would need surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. She married her husband on April 3, 2011. Two weeks later, she was on the operating table getting a mastectomy.\n\n\"We went from being a wife and a husband to a caregiver and a patient.,\" she said.\n\nJohnes recalled being the only Black woman in the room for most of her treatment. Her experience led her to become an advocate for women of color receiving cancer diagnoses.\n\n\"For me it looked different,\" she said. \"I was young, I was Black.\"\n\nShe explained she wanted to help call attention to the health disparities that exist within cancer diagnoses and treatments.\n\nJohnes continued, \"Chemotherapy, even how our nails turn dark and black, it's different from other people.\"\n\nShe said doctors should understand the differences and explain them to patients to help them deal with diagnosis and treatment.\n\n\"You need to tell us this, that this treatment is going to look different on you,\" she said.\n\n\"Everyone thought when your hair grows back, you're good to go, but the damage it actually does to your bones is different.\"\n\nJohnes is now a mother of twin girls.\n\nAs she prepares to celebrate their eighth birthday in June, she said she is hopeful studies like this can pave a better future for younger generations of at-risk women.\n\n\"I don't want them to hear those words because it was devastating,\" said Johnes. \"I just want to make sure all of us have a chance not to just survive, but thrive.\"\n\nThose interested in enrolling in the study are asked to fill out a survey online through the American Cancer Society's website.", "source": {"uri": "wral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WRAL"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A new study is aiming to change that.\n\nIt's called \"Voices of Black Women\" and it's aimed at addressing cancer disparities.\n\n\"But we need to really get at what those multilevel drivers are to understand how we can best intervene,\" said Alpa Patel, Senior Vice President of Population Science with the American Cancer Society.\n\nThe organization said about one-in-three Black men and women will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime and one in six Black women will die from the disease. Factors that influence cancer disparities include structural racism, socioeconomic status, access to care, other health conditions and medical mistrust.\n\n\"But there's so much more to that story that we still don't understand as it relates to cancer inequities for Black women,\" Patel said.\n\nThat's why researchers started this study, hoping to enroll at least 100,000 cancer-free Black women between the ages of 25 and 55 in 21 states. After eligibility conformation and consent to participate, those taking part will fill out a health and lifestyle survey. After that, surveys to update or collect new information will be sent out twice a year for the next 20 to 30 years.\n\n\"It's really about an hour of time from the participant's perspective on an annual basis to go on this journey with us, to help us uncover the different factors that may be related to how we can improve the health of Black women for future generations,\" Patel said.\n\nEnrollment opened May 6 in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio,

I said please tell me something good because I just lost my father, and she says I wish I could but it's malignant,\" Charlene Jaudon described the devasting moment she learned she had stage three breast cancer as something she will never forget.\n\nIn March the DeKalb County Firefighter and mother of three had a full head of hair when we interviewed her, but now she's started chemotherapy.\n\n\"We have good news with the numbers! We are trending downward, I had almost a 20 point drop in my tumor marker so we're doing good over here!

I featured their writings in the dissertation I wrote to get my Ph.D. in curriculum and instruction.\n\nThe women spoke of being silenced.\n\n\"It's not just the beating me down that is hard,\" one participant told me about constantly having her intelligence questioned. \"It is the fact that it feels like I'm villainized and made out to be the problem for trying to advocate for myself.\"\n\nThe women told me they did not feel like they belonged. They spoke of routinely being isolated by peers and potential mentors.\n\nOne participant told me she felt that peer community, faculty mentorship and cultural affinity spaces were lacking.\n\nBecause of the isolation, participants often felt that they were missing out on various opportunities, such as funding and opportunities to get their work published.\n\nParticipants also discussed the ways they felt they were duped into taking on more than their fair share of work.\n\n\"I realized I had been tricked into handling a two- to four-person job entirely by myself,\" one participant said of her paid graduate position. \"This happened just about a month before the pandemic occurred so it very quickly got swept under the rug.\"\n\nThe hostility that Black women face in higher education can be hazardous to their health. The women in my study told me they were struggling with depression, had thought about suicide and felt physically ill when they had to go to campus.\n\nOther studies have found similar outcomes. For instance, a 2020 study of 220 U.S. Black college women ages 18-48 found that even though being seen as a strong Black woman came with its benefits - such as being thought of as resilient, hardworking, independent and nurturing - it also came at a cost to their mental and physical health.\n\nThese kinds of experiences can take a toll on women's bodies and can result in poor maternal health, cancer, shorter life expectancy and other symptoms that impair their ability to be well.\n\nI believe my research takes on greater urgency in light of the recent death of Antoinette \"Bonnie\" Candia-Bailey, who was vice president of student affairs at Lincoln University. Before she died by suicide, she reportedly wrote that she felt she was suffering abuse and that the university wasn't taking her mental health concerns seriously.\n\nSeveral anthologies examine the negative experiences that Black women experience in academia. They include education scholars Venus Evans-Winters and Bettina Love's edited volume, \"Black Feminism in Education,\" which examines how Black women navigate what it means to be a scholar in a \"white supremacist patriarchal society.\" Gender and sexuality studies scholar Stephanie Evans analyzes the barriers that Black women faced in accessing higher education from 1850 to 1954. In \"Black Women, Ivory Tower,\" African American studies professor Jasmine Harris recounts her own traumatic experiences in the world of higher education.\n\nIn addition to publishing the findings of my research study, I plan to continue exploring the depths of Black women's experiences in academia, expanding my research to include undergraduate students, as well as faculty and staff.\n\nI believe this research will strengthen this field of study and enable people who work in higher education to develop and implement more comprehensive solutions.\n\nThe Research Brief is a short take on interesting academic work.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

She's been cancer-free for almost 18 years.\n\nIn learning about her diagnosis, she found there was much more she didn't know.\n\n\"I learned that we didn't survive,\" Townsend said. \"The treatments are out there. But the access to the treatments, and the quality of the treatments I learned early on might not have been the same.\"\n\nTownsend said learning her diagnosis was \"numbing.\"\n\n\"There's a possibility that I might not survive the disease and that a lot of it had to do with the fact that there were disparities,\" Townsend said.\n\nRELATED | Initiative launched in 20 states to understand cancer disparities, health conditions of Black women\n\nThe American Cancer Society said African Americans have the highest death rate and shortest survival of any racial/ethnic group for most cancers.\n\nPart of these realities highlight how diverse groups don't participate in research or clinical trials.\n\nMayo Clinic is looking to advance inclusive research. They've done multiple studies -- all in a commitment to address health disparities.\n\nDr. Folakemi Odedina, enterprise deputy director for Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center, said clinical trials are the golden standard for interventions, medications and devices created to be responsive to different people.\n\nBut it's been discouraged for some people, following cases like the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, or Henrietta Lacks.\n\n\"Even in the present, we sometimes experience that discrimination, we sometimes experience racism in healthcare,\" Odedina said. \"If I did not participate, and I as a Black woman, I was never represented in that study, I'm the guinea pig after the study is done. Because you have what is called post-marketing surveillance. Then they're going to say, 'Oh, the drug is now approved. If anything is wrong with you while you're taking the drug, let us know.' Right? So, we have to make the informed choice.\"\n\nMORE | Breast cancer is deadlier for Black women. A study of mammograms could help close the gap\n\nThey work with different community organizations like the American Legion to address cancer in veterans.\n\nTownsend said she's thankful to be here and wants to remind women there is some hope.\n\n\"So the purpose of course is to help where we are now but you got to think about the future. And your daughters and your family and friends that you, perhaps may be diagnosed in the future,\" Townsend said. \"We need to take that information into the community where it's going to matter so that we're not losing our black women to this disease at the rate that we are.\"", "source": {"uri": "news4jax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News 4 Jax"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marilyn_parker@news4jax.com", "name": "Marilyn Parker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayo Clinic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breast cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethnicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tuskegee Syphilis Study"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Henrietta Lacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guinea pig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mammography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Legion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Legion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Menopause", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Menopause", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/anyclip/jk5LX48BnHikCJsC-CJR/1715290942682_1920x1080_thumbnail.jpg?_a=ATAPphC0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546044", "eventUri": "eng-9546044", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 452987846, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 39, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 39}}}

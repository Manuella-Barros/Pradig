Officials at Delhi\u2019s airport canceled operations at Terminal 1 after an outdoor metal canopy collapsed during torrential rainfall on Friday. Multiple cars were crushed outside the airport, which was recently renovated, killing one person and injuring eight, according to the authorities. The area recorded its heaviest one-day June rainfall in 88 years that day.Several hundred kilometers east, in the state of Bihar, four bridges recently collapsed and a structure at an airport in central India caved in. With the start of the monsoon season, water-logging is now the norm in many cities. In Ayodhya, the roof of a massive temple inaugurated by Modi earlier this year has been leaking, and flooding has inundated newly built roads, according to local reports. The issues cast a harsh spotlight on Modi\u2019s building spree, which officials are leaning on to boost development in the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy. According to Bloomberg Economics, 44.4 trillion rupees ($532 billion) worth of new infrastructure will become operational over the next two years. That figure equals the value of all projects built in the last 11 years.Modi has presided over ribbon-cutting ceremonies at many of them. Modernising infrastructure was a key part of his pitch to voters during this year\u2019s national election, when he won a third term as prime minister. Over the last decade, his government says it\u2019s built 80 new airports, upgraded railways and expanded highways by many thousands of kilometers.Niranjan Sahoo, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi, says Friday\u2019s disaster at Terminal 1 raises fresh questions about the quality of India\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cIt puts the country, which aspires to be a global power, in a very poor light,\u201d he said, calling many of the projects an \u201celectoral gimmick.\u201dEconomists and business leaders have justified a big budget for infrastructure, arguing that it\u2019s necessary to turbo-charge India\u2019s growth and build out the nation\u2019s manufacturing sector. As China\u2019s economy slows, many international companies are looking to the South Asian nation as an alternative for their factories. Bloomberg Economics expects the infrastructure drive to help lift economic growth to 9 per cent by 2030, up from 8.2 per cent in the last fiscal year.India\u2019s opposition leaders, however, have criticised some of the projects, calling them wasteful and rife with corruption. They\u2019ve accused Modi of diverting resources and attention from reducing poverty or unemployment. The country\u2019s infrastructure is \u201cfalling like a deck of cards,\u201d Mallikarjun Kharge, president of the opposition Indian National Congress party, wrote on X.Officials attempted damage control after Friday\u2019s incident outside Terminal 1. India\u2019s aviation minister, Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu, said the structure that collapsed wasn\u2019t part of the recent renovations. \u201cThe building inaugurated by PM Modi is on the other side,\u201d he said. Still, the disaster at the very least suggests poor maintenance, Sahoo said, and gives Modi\u2019s critics fresh fodder to attack his record.\u201cInfrastructure is just not about building those bridges, airports and ports and roads,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is also about governance. It is about maintaining them.\u201d", "summary": "The disaster at the very least suggests poor maintenance and gives Modi's critics fresh fodder to attack his record", "url": "https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/delhi-airport-roof-collapse-raises-concerns-over-india-s-massive-infra-push-124062900083_1.html", "image": "https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2024-06/28/full/1719567894-3244.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 03:49:26", "author": "Bloomberg", "authors": ["Bloomberg"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.168}

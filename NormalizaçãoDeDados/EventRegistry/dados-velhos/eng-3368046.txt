But she's unrepentant saying any anger it may have sparked was fine as it started a debate about face coverings.\n\nHanson has also suggested \"these people\" who wear burqas \"should go to a country that suits their needs\".\n\nHanson said she wasn't challenged as to her identity. Although she has conceded security may have suspected the One Nation leader was beneath the face covering.\n\nThe stunt on Thursday is the latest round in Hanson's battle against the burqa.\n\nGasps of \"what on earth?\" could be heard from the Senate as she sat down. Attorney-General George Brandis looked bemused by the spectacle and later berated Hanson for \"mocking\" law abiding Australian Muslims.\n\nOn Sydney radio station 2GB she said the burqa was \"un-Australian\".\n\nTalking to presenter Ben Fordham, she said, \"Is it extreme? yes. Is it getting my point across? I hope so.\"\n\nHanson said she entered the Senate without being checked.\n\n\"No security guards at any point in time asked to see my face,\" she said.\n\n\"One of the attendants on the floor of parliament, he just gasped.\n\n\"He did not ask to see my face. Apparently they were told I was going to do it, they did not check if it was me.\"\n\nShe said that in five years or more time, Australian women might be forced to wear the burqa. \"This is a western country. If these people want to dress up, go to a country that suits your needs.\"\n\nSenator Hanson also claimed Greens Senator Peter Whish Wilson shook her hand in the corridor while she was wearing the burqa. He'd never greeted her or shaken her hand previously.\n\nOn Twitter, Senator Whish Wilson didn't address the claims but did retweet another social media user who said shaking someone's hand proved they were not \"confronting\".\n\nAn expert on Islam has said Hansons's remarks could incite hatred towards women.\n\nDirector of the Institute for Religion, Politics and Society at Australian Catholic University, Dr Joshua Roose, said, \"knowing that Muslim women are likely to be targeted in verbal and physical attacks due to their more recognisable appearance, Senator Hanson's stunt is likely to directly and indirectly increase the risk of violence towards Muslim communities.\"\n\nPauline Hanson's stunt today was a hurtful, offensive & dangerous display for her own ignorance.

I understand she is not a Muslim. She is not of the Islamic faith.\n\n\"Can I appear tomorrow in fancy dress unchallenged?\n\nSenate President Stephen Parry said he wouldn't tell senators what to wear.\n\nIn a statement on her Facebook page, the noted critic of Islam said she had attended Question Time \"dressed modestly in a full burqa\" and would deliver a speech calling for the Government to ban full face coverings in public.\n\n\"Senator Hanson said that she believed that full face covering, such as the burqa, were oppressive, presented barriers to assimilation, disadvantaged women from finding employment, were causing issues inside our justice system, presented a clear security threat and had no place in modern Western society,\" the statement read.\n\nThe stunt continued when Senator Hanson removed the covering to ask Brandis if the burqa could be banned as a matter of national security.\n\nShe was told \"No\" by Senator Brandis who criticised her for \"mocking\" religious garments.\n\nHe was given a standing ovation by Labor senators, and was congratulated by Labor Leader Penny Wong, and was given applause from his own Coalition side.\n\nThe Attorney-General said: \"Senator Hanson no, we will not be banning the burqa.\n\n\"Now Senator Hanson, I'm not going to pretend to ignore the stunt you have tried to pull today by arriving in the Chamber dressed in a burqa, when we all know you are not an adherent of the Islamic faith.\n\n\"And I would caution you and counsel you Senator Hanson, with respect, to be very, very careful of the offence you may do to the religious sensibilities of other Australians.\n\n\"We have about half a million Australians of the Islamic faith in this country, and the vast majority of them are law-abiding good Australians.\n\n\"Senator Hanson, it is absolutely consistent with being a good, law-abiding Australian and being a strict adherent Muslim.\"\n\nAt one point Senator Brandis could be seen to choke back tears.\n\nSenator Hanson had couched her call for a ban on national security lines.\n\n\"In light of our national security of this nation, will you work with me to actually ban the burqa in Australia considering there have been 13 foiled national threats against us with terrorism, three that have been successful that Australians have lost their lives.\n\n\"Terrorism is a true threat to our country.

When she rose to ask Brandis about Muslim face coverings and security, he delivered his thoroughly seething takedown.\n\nWhen Hanson arrived in the chamber, Senate president Stephen Parry told those present that her identity had been already been established.\n\nSenator Derryn Hinch questioned the appropriateness of Hanson's attire, asking if he would be \"unchallenged\" if he entered the chamber in fancy dress.\n\nParry replied that he would not dictate the standard of dress worn in the chamber.\n\nHanson had earlier given notice that she wanted to debate a burqa ban in the Senate on Thursday afternoon, saying that \"she believed the need to ban full face coverings in public was an important issue facing modern Australia that needed to be discussed\".\n\nALP senator mutters Senator Hanson has \"got what she wants\" because media (inc me) have rushed in to cover the One Nation leader's burqa. -- Louise Yaxley (@louiseyaxley)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nHanson is leaving the Senate chamber with a smile, burqa in hand.

She founded the One Nation Party in 1997 and spent 11 weeks in jail in 2003 for electoral fraud before her convictions were eventually overturned.", "id": "9660020", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Burqa Stunt In Australian Parliament Prompts Emotional Speech On Importance Of Unity", "image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599562f522000009371a667b.png?cache=oed2wx6qkd&ops=2000_1000", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 861, "freq": 6, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 876}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "12", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "Clothing"}, "id": "303653", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}, "id": "304967", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}, "id": "308102", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general"}, {"label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}, "id": "308441", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam and clothing"}, "id": "308809", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_clothing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Burqa"}, "id": "311238", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Derryn Hinch"}, "id": "318128", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derryn_Hinch"}, {"label": {"eng": "One Nation (Australia)"}, "id": "318130", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation_(Australia)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pauline Hanson"}, "id": "318133", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Hanson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Crossbencher"}, "id": "318134", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbencher"}, {"label": {"eng": "Australian Federal Police"}, "id": "349735", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police"}, {"label": {"eng": "George Brandis"}, "id": "363884", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Brandis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cory Bernardi"}, "id": "423893", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Bernardi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Question Time (TV series)"}, "id": "452857", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_Time_(TV_series)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Penny Wong"}, "id": "512008", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Wong"}, {"label": {"eng": "Religious clothing"}, "id": "520732", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_clothing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islamic dress in Europe"}, "id": "668138", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_dress_in_Europe"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 643, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Islam", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Islam"}], "time": "10:10:00"}

Things are getting seriously weirder by the day,\" he posted to Twitter.\n\nSenator Hanson has previously vowed to ban the garb in all official buildings in Queensland if her party wins the upcoming state election, but she has also called for the ban to be implemented nationally.\n\nShe has previously called the burqa an \"evil tool of oppression\" and \"an extreme national security risk\".\n\nThe incredible stunt comes after Senator Hanson met with prominent Australian businessman Dick Smith to discuss immigration policy in Canberra today.", "id": "9627997", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Why Pauline Hanson wore the burqa", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a6d36ea985d7532b687aa57df3eaa0ac", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "12", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Queensland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "70210", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland", "label": {"eng": "State of Queensland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Religion"}, "id": "303332", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"}, {"label": {"eng": "Clothing"}, "id": "303653", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}, "id": "308441", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party"}, {"label": {"eng": "Burqa"}, "id": "311238", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Derryn Hinch"}, "id": "318128", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derryn_Hinch"}, {"label": {"eng": "One Nation (Australia)"}, "id": "318130", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation_(Australia)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pauline Hanson"}, "id": "318133", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Hanson"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Courier-Mail"}, "id": "344927", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Courier-Mail"}, {"label": {"eng": "George Brandis"}, "id": "363884", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Brandis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cory Bernardi"}, "id": "423893", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Bernardi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Question Time (TV series)"}, "id": "452857", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_Time_(TV_series)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 1207, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures"}], "time": "06:59:00"}

I am sick and tired of these gutless pollies behind the scnees that agree with me. I will walk away and say I have done the best on my principles.\n\nEarlier after carrying out her stunt, Senator Hanson told 2GB radio her One Nation colleague Brian Burston identified her to the senate security guards but said none of the guards checked to confirm her identity before she walked in.\n\n\"I put it on in my office, the media were taking photos, I walked straight down the hallway, down the stairs. I met two security guards and I walked straight up the chamber.\n\n\"No one, no security guard at any point of time asked to see my face.\n\n\"When I walked into the chamber one of the attendants ... he just gasped.\"\n\nSenator Hanson described the experience of wearing the burqa as \"horrible\".\n\nShe said the idea for the stunt was her own and was designed to expose the security threats to Parliament and to call for the ban.\n\n\"It's been an idea of mine to actually expose the burqa,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm very much against the burqa. I think it's confronting. I think it's un-Australian.\n\n\"It's hard to describe - I feel for these women who are actually forced to wear it because the pressure is put on them by their husbands and their fathers,\" she said.\n\n\"It's not a religious requirement, let's get that clear.\"\n\nHer provocative move comes ahead of her call to ban the garment in Australia.\n\nThe One Nation leader made a speech to the Parliament about the ban, which she has called for in the past. Her bid to ban the burqa was rejected by all Labor, Greens, and Coalition senators.\n\nWhile in the chamber, Senator Hanson asked why someone should be allowed to take their place in the Senate while obscuring their face and argued it should be banned from parliament.\n\nShe eventually removed the garment before asking her question and said: \"I'm quite happy to remove this, because this is not what should belong in this Parliament\".\n\nShe left the chamber to jeers from Labor senators at around 2.30pm before issuing a statement.\n\nSenator Hanson said she made the decision to attend Question Time in a full face covering because she believed \"the need to ban full face coverings in public was an important issue facing modern Australia that needed to be discussed\".\n\nWatch Senator Brandis' stinging attack on Senator Hanson below.\n\nSenator Hanson said she wished to raise the issue of full face covering presenting a security threat not only to Parliament House, but also to the greater Australian public.\n\nShe said she believed that full face covering, such as the burqa, were \"oppressive, presented barriers to assimilation, disadvantaged women from finding employment, were causing issues inside our justice system, presented a clear security threat and had no place in modern Western society\".\n\nLabor senators called \"shame\" and \"you're a disgrace\" as Senator Hanson rose to ask if the Government would work towards implementing the ban.\n\nAttorney-General George Brandis received a standing ovation from the Labor senators when he said her actions were \"appalling\" and \"disgraceful\" and that her stunt was ridiculing and mocking the Muslim community.\n\n\"Senator Hanson, no, we will not be banning the burqa,\" Brandis said.\n\n\"I am not going to pretend to ignore the stunt that you have tried to pull today by arriving in the Chamber dressed in a burqa when we all know that you are not an adherent of the Islamic faith.\n\n\"I would caution and counsel you with respect to be very, very careful of the offence you may do to the religious sensibilities of other Australians.\"\n\n\"We have about 500,000 Australians in this country of the Islamic faith and the vast majority of them are law abiding good Australians.\n\n\"Senator Hanson, for the last four years, I have had responsibility pre-eminently among the ministers subject to the Prime Minister for national security policy.\n\n\"And I can tell you, Senator Hanson, that it has been the advice of each Director-General of security with whom I have worked and each Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police with whom I have worked that it is vital for their intelligence and law enforcement work that they work cooperatively with the Muslim community and to ridicule that community, to drive it into a corner, to mock its religious garments is an appalling thing to do and I would ask you to reflect on that.\"\n\nIn defence of her act, Senator Hanson also told 2GB radio: \"Don't the Australian people have the right to know that whoever sits in the chamber, that is actually the person they voted for,\" she said.\n\n\"How do I know, that if you have someone ... in a burqa in that chamber it is that person who walks in that chamber every time?\"\n\n\"These are questions that need to be asked.\n\n\"To blatantly come out, as Senator Brandis did with a definite no, 'we're not going to ban the burqa, we're not going to have equality as far as anyone wearing full faced coverings into a bank or into the chamber, a blatant 'No' straight off without saying 'Let's discuss this' ... it was just a definite 'No'.\n\nSenator Hanson hit back at the suggestions she was mocking the Islamic faith.\n\n\"That's absolute rubbish - I'm not mocking anyone,\" she said.\n\n\"People have a right to their own faith and what they believe in, I've got no problems with that.\n\n\"But when that faith stops at a religion and then becomes a political ideology, that's what I have problems with.\n\n\"The burqa is not a religious requirement. It is a matter of controlling women.\"\n\n\"Is it extreme? Yes. Is this getting my message across? I hope so.\"\n\n\"I hope it's creating debate. Because we have overall probably more than 55 per cent of Australians want to see the burqa banned. And I think there's no better place to start than with the Parliament.\"\n\nSenator Hanson said while she was walking to the chamber in the burqa, a Greens senator, Peter Whish-Wilson, shook her hand.\n\nShe described it as \"tokenism\".\n\nHanson also condemned the standing ovation from the Greens and Labor senators to Senator Brandis's response.\n\n\"It's basically saying this is the future, we're not going to stop the spreading of Islam, we're not going to stop this division happening in our society.\"\n\nSenate President Stephen Parry made no comment on the stunt beyond that the chamber had a rule that people with face coverings had to identify themselves before entering.\n\nSenator Hanson has previously vowed to ban the garb in all official buildings in Queensland if her party wins the upcoming state election, but she has also called for the ban to be implemented nationally.\n\nShe has previously called the burqa an \"evil tool of oppression\" and \"an extreme national security risk\".\n\nHANSON STUNT AN EYE-ROLL MOMENT\n\nCounter-terrorism expert and Labor MP Anne Aly, who was the first Muslim woman to be elected to federal parliament, said Senator Hanson's stunt would be \"just another eye-roll moment\" for most Muslim Australians.\n\n\"I think most young muslims and I think most muslims in general know Pauline Hanson, they know what her agenda is,\" Dr Aly told News Corp.\n\n\"This is probably just another eye-roll moment, although one that has reached a new level of low, and quite disgraceful to carry out such a stunt in our Parliament.\n\n\"Most Australians are already disaffected with politics and with politicians.\n\n\"This is not the way to increase that trust between individuals and groups in our society and the political institutions and the politicians that represent them.\"\n\nDr Aly said while she personally did not agree with the call to ban the burqa, the discussion could be had respectfully.\n\n\"If people want to have a conversation about it, have a conversation about it respectfully,\" she said.\n\n\"You do not need to wear a burqa in the senate and absolutely make a mockery of the parliament and a mockery of the office that you're elected into by the Australian people to make that point.\"\n\nDr Aly said a handful of women wearing a burqa in Australian society did not add to the risk of terrorism.\n\n\"If that literature exists, if that research exists, if that empirical evidence exists, I'd like to see it - but I haven't seen it anywhere,\" she said.\n\n\"It's an argument designed to make her real agenda a little bit more palatable.\n\n\"That is to ban Muslims from Australia ... basically to disenfranchise and isolate and create division between all Australians and Muslim Australians. Most Australians, who are decent people who treasure our social harmony, who treasure our multicultural society, wouldn't stand for that.\"\n\nHANSON AND DICK SMITH UNITE\n\nThe incredible stunt comes after Senator Hanson met with prominent Australian businessman Dick Smith to discuss immigration policy in Canberra today.\n\nThe One Nation leader tweeted a film clip of her meeting with Mr Smith, who recently launched a 'grim reaper' anti-immigration ad campaign, to argue Australia's annual intake should be capped at 70, 000.\n\n\"Every Australian family doesn't have 20 kids. They have the number of kids they can give a good life too. I want our politicians to have a similar plan for the nation,\" Mr Smith said in the video.\n\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S ONE NATION WARNING\n\nSenator Hanson's stunt comes two days after the Trump administration named Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party among threats to religious freedom in Australia.\n\nThe annual report on threats to religious freedom internationally, released by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Wednesday, highlighted the party's calls for \"ceasing Muslim immigration, holding a royal commission on Islam, halting construction of mosques, installing surveillance cameras in mosques, banning wearing of the burqa and niqab in public places, and prohibiting members of parliament from being sworn in under the Quran\".\n\nThe report also noted that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull disagreed with the party's position.\n\nMPS REACT TO HANSON'S STUNT AND BRANDIS' ATTACK\n\nMPs from boths houses of Federal Parliament took to social media to condemn Senator Hanson for her stunt and praise Senator Brandis for his remarks.\n\nGreens Leader Richard Di Natale also labelled her actions \"disgraceful\" and argument for a multicultural code of conduct for the parliament to prevent future stunts.\n\nLabor frontbencher Penny Wong said the \"bigotry and divisiveness\" Senator Hanson displayed \"has no place in our society\".\n\n\"It certainly has no place in our parliament,\" she said.\n\n\"Today our parliament showed leadership when it was needed.\n\n\"It is one thing to wear religious dress as an act of faith. It is another to wear it as a stunt. That can only give offence and divide.\n\n\"Nobody needs to defend Senator Hanson's right to speak. The people that need defending are the people she attacks.\"\n\nSenator Wong said leaders have an obligation to stand up for the people in Australia, and said Senator Brandis and the Parliament had done so.\n\nLabor senator Sam Dastyari, who is fond of a stunt himself, told 2GB Senator Hanson had crossed a line.\n\nHanson's stunt beneath contempt.

Photo: Reuters\n\nAccording to Reuters, Hanson appeared in the assembly wearing the burqa. She removed the burqa after 20 minutes before speaking on the banning of the attire for the sake of 'public and security reasons'.\n\nThe leader of the far-right One Nation Party spoke to the Senate, \"I m quite happy to remove this because this is not what should belong in this parliament,\" Hanson, who leads the far-right One Nation party, told the Senate.\n\n\"If a person who wears a balaclava or a helmet in to a bank or any other building, or even on the floor of the court, has to remove it, why is it not the same case for someone who is covering up their face and cannot be identified?\"\n\nHanson gained popularity during the 90s because of her vocal opposition towards the immigration from Asia and to asylum seekers. In her recent campaigns Hanson talks against Islamic clothing and the building of mosques.\n\nHanson's burqa stunt wasn't received well by some Senators who were appalled. Attorney General George Brandis admonished Hanson. He condemned her for offending religious groups.\n\n\"I am not going to pretend to ignore the stunt that you have tried to pull today by arriving in the chamber dressed in a burqa,\" he said.\n\nThe leader of the government in the Senate, the attorney general George Brandis, who was appalled by Hanson's burqa stunt told the One Nation leader the ruling Coalition had no intention of banning the burqa.\n\nBrandis received applause from opposition parties.

I think it's confronting. I think it's un-Australian.\n\n\"It's hard to describe - I feel for these women who are actually forced to wear it because the pressure is put on them by their husbands and their fathers,\" she said.\n\n\"It's not a religious requirement, let's get that clear.\"\n\n\"Is it extreme? Yes. Is this getting my message across? I hope so.\"\n\n\"I hope it's creating debate. Because we have overall probably more than 55 per cent of Australians want to see the burqa banned.

Fedpol.

This is not our way of life. And so many in the suburbs of Sydney, if you are honest about it, if you are not a Muslim, you really don't want to go to these places because you don't feel welcome there.\"\n\nIslamic Friendship Association of Australia spokesman Keysar Trad predicted some \"women who wear the burqa will feel hurt and will feel that they are under siege again\" by the Senator's actions.\n\n\"Why isn't Pauline Hanson supporting their right to dress as they choose?\"\n\nIslamic Council of Victoria vice-president Adel Salman said the stunt was offensive, and \"doesn't really help the debate\".\n\n\"The current discourse is really negative. It's about time [Senator Hanson] is ridiculed and her platform is ridiculed,\" he said.\n\nBoth Mr Trad and Mr Salman praised Senator Brandis' strong response.\n\nLabor, Greens and other crossbench senators, including Derryn Hinch and Nick Xenophon, called for Senator Hanson's stunt to be ignored.\n\nUndeterred, Senator Hanson took to the Senate floor later that same day to deliver a speech calling for the burqa ban and claiming Islam was \"threatening our way of life\", speaking to an almost empty room.\n\nFollow us on Facebook\n\nThe story Hanson burqa stunt ignites firestorm over religious freedoms first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.", "id": "9643500", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Hanson burqa stunt ignites firestorm over religious freedoms", "image": "http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/9b41ef14-dec6-44fc-af85-ff3f9b0900e3.jpg/r0_36_729_448_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 353, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 367}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "12", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "69951", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Queensland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "70210", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland", "label": {"eng": "State of Queensland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Canberra"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "71684", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra", "label": {"eng": "Canberra"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "Clothing"}, "id": "303653", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tony Abbott"}, "id": "308424", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott"}, {"label": {"eng": "Coalition (Australia)"}, "id": "308431", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_(Australia)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}, "id": "308441", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam and clothing"}, "id": "308809", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_clothing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Niq\u0101b"}, "id": "311231", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niq\u0101b"}, {"label": {"eng": "Burqa"}, "id": "311238", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa"}, {"label": {"eng": "One Nation (Australia)"}, "id": "318130", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation_(Australia)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pauline Hanson"}, "id": "318133", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Hanson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Australian Federal Police"}, "id": "349735", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police"}, {"label": {"eng": "George Brandis"}, "id": "363884", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Brandis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Keysar Trad"}, "id": "446173", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keysar_Trad"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bronwyn Bishop"}, "id": "536081", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronwyn_Bishop"}], "location": null, "categories": [], "time": "08:35:00"}

It is absolutely consistent with being a good, law-abiding Australian and a strict, adherent Muslim.\"\n\nSenator Brandis said he'd had responsibility for the national security for four years and intelligence and law enforcement officials worked closely with the Muslim community.\n\nHis voice quivered with emotion as he concluded his response, saying: \"To ridicule that community, to drive it into a corner, to mock its religious garments is an appalling thing to do and I would ask you to reflect on what you do\".\n\nThe senate erupted with applause as he concluded his reply and Labor senators and many on the crossbench stood to applaud.\n\nGeorge Brandis on the verge of tears as he tells Pauline Hanson her behaviour is \"appalling\".

Just brilliant. Strongest I have ever heard him.\n\n-- Sam Dastyari (@samdastyari) August 17, 2017\n\nWhen question time in the senate ended at 3pm Greens senators crossed the chamber and shook hands with senator Brandis.\n\nHanson subsequently issued the following media release on Facebook:\n\nSenator Pauline Hanson has attended question time dressed modestly in a full burqa and will later be delivering a speech in Parliament calling for the Government to ban full face coverings in public.\n\nSenator Hanson said she made the decision to attend question time in a full face covering because she believed the need to ban full face coverings in public was an important issue facing modern Australia that needed to be discussed.\n\nSenator Hanson said she wished to raise the issue of full face covering presenting a security threat not only to Parliament House, but also to the greater Australian public.\n\nSenator Hanson said that she believed that full face covering, such as the burqa, were oppressive, presented barriers to assimilation, disadvantaged women from finding employment, were causing issues inside our justice system, presented a clear security threat and had no place in modern Western society.\n\nSenator Hanson said that this was a debate that was happening across the world and Australia could not hide from a difficult conversation out of fear of causing offence.\n\nSenator Hanson is scheduled to deliver a speech outlining the full extent of her position later today.", "id": "9640518", "details": {"liCnt": 80}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "'DISGRACEFUL,

\"religious sensibilities of other Australians\".\n\n\"Senator Hanson, I'm not going to pretend to ignore the stunt that you have tried to pull today by arriving in the chamber dressed in a burqa when

attorney general made clear to the right-wing leader that there is no intention of banning the burqa as his remarks drew applause from those present in the chamber.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, during the questioning time, Hanson asked the attorney general if the government would work to ban the burqa \"in light of [the country's] national security\".\n\nShe pointed out that there have been 13 foiled terror attacks in Australia and three in which lives have been lost.\n\n\"Terrorism is a true threat to our country,\" added Hanson, saying that she was speaking on \"behalf of the Australian people\".\n\nHanson was called a \"threat to national security\" and a \"disgrace\" by Senator Sam Dastyari who, according the The Guardian, is a non-practicing Muslim of Iranian heritage.\n\nHanson left the Senate chamber after posing her question to the attorney general.\n\nLast year, amid deteriorating race relations and an escalating fear of violence, Hanson's One Nation

Most Australians, who are decent people who treasure our social harmony, who treasure our multicultural society, wouldn't stand for that.\"\n\nOTHER MPS REACT TO HANSON\n\nNick Xenophon praised Senator Brandis's stance describing what Ms Hanson did as \"toxic behaviour\".\n\n\"George Brandis spoke like a true statesman,\" he said.\n\n\"He displayed the leadership and clarity of purpose the country needs on an issue like this. So good on you George.\n\n\"He has shown what it means to be a statesman when many other politicians would have shied away, he did the right thing.\"\n\nGreens Leader Richard Di Natale also labelled Ms Hanson's actions \"disgraceful\" and argument for a multicultural code of conduct for the parliament to prevent future stunts.\n\nHANSON FIGHTS BACK IN ANGER\n\nOf the stunt, Senator Hanson told radio station 2GB her One Nation colleague Brian Burston identified her to the senate security guards but said none of the guards checked to confirm her identity before she walked in.\n\n\"I put it on in my office, the media were taking photos, I walked straight down the hallway, down the stairs. I met two security guards and I walked straight up the chamber,\" she said.\n\n\"No one, no security guard at any point of time asked to see my face.\n\n\"When I walked into the chamber one of the attendants ... he just gasped.\n\nPauline Hanson's stunt today was a hurtful, offensive & dangerous display for her own ignorance. The Senate stood up to her as we should. -- Sarah Hanson-Young\u17064 (@sarahinthesen8)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\n\"Doesn't the Australian people have the right to know that whoever sits in the chamber, that is actually the person they voted for,\" she said.\n\n\"How do I know, that if you have someone ... in a burqa in that chamber it is that person who walks in that chamber every time?\"\n\n\"These are questions that need to be asked.\n\n\"To blatantly come out, as Senator Brandis did with a definite no, 'we're not going to ban the burqa, we're not going to have equality as far as anyone wearing full faced coverings into a bank or into the chamber, a blatant 'No' straight off without saying 'Let's discuss this' ... it was just a definite 'No'.\n\nSenator Hanson hit back at the suggestions she was mocking the Islamic faith.\n\n\"That's absolute rubbish - I'm not mocking anyone,\" she said.\n\n\"People have a right to their own faith and what they believe in, I've got no problems with that. But when that faith stops at a religion and then becomes a political ideology, that's what I have problems with.\n\n\"The burqa is not a religious requirement. It is a matter of controlling women.\"\n\nSenator Hanson said while she was walking to the chamber in the burqa, a Greens senator, Peter Whish-Wilson, shook her hand.\n\nShe described it as \"tokenism\".\n\nHanson also condemned the standing ovation from the Greens and Labor senators to Senator Brandis's response.\n\n\"It's basically saying this is the future, we're not going to stop the spreading of Islam, we're not going to stop this division happening in our society.\"\n\nSenator Hanson has described the experience of wearing the burqa as \"horrible\".\n\nShe said the idea for the stunt was her own and was designed to expose the security threats to Parliament and to call for the ban.\n\n\"It's been an idea of mine to actually expose about the burqa,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm very much against the burqa. I think it's confronting. I think it's un-Australian.\n\n\"It's hard to describe - I feel for these women who are actually forced to wear it because the pressure is put on them by their husbands and their fathers,\" she said.\n\n\"It's not a religious requirement, let's get that clear.\"\n\n\"Is it extreme? Yes. Is this getting my message across? I hope so.\"\n\n\"I hope it's creating debate. Because we have overall probably more than 55 per cent of Australians want to see the burqa banned. And I think there's no better place to start than with the Parliament.\"\n\nHANSON ATTACKED BY MORE MPS\n\nLabor frontbencher Penny Wong said the \"bigotry and divisiveness\" Senator Hanson displayed \"has no place in our society\".\n\n\"It certainly has no place in our parliament,\" she said.\n\n\"Today our parliament showed leadership when it was needed.\n\n\"It is one thing to wear religious dress as an act of faith. It is another to wear it as a stunt. That can only give offence and divide.\n\n\"Nobody needs to defend Senator Hanson's right to speak. The people that need defending are the people she attacks.\"\n\nSenator Wong said leaders have an obligation to stand up for the people in Australia, and said Senator Brandis and the Parliament had done so.\n\nLabor senator Sam Dastyari, who is fond of a stunt himself, told 2GB Senator Hanson had crossed a line.\n\nSenator Derryn Hinch said Senator Hanson's behaviour was \"disgusting\".\n\n\"Pauline Hanson mocked the religion of some Australians, she was insulting their religion,\" he told Sky News.\n\nSenator Hinch said Senator Hanson should not have been allowed into Question Time wearing the religious garment.\n\n\"It is like in court, you have to be able to see people's faces,\" he said.\n\n\"She made a mockery of an honourable place. To pull a stunt like this I find it insulting.\"\n\nSenator Hanson also praised the Attorney-General's speech and the positive reaction it received.\n\n\"He gave the best speech I have heard from him,\" he said.\n\n\"He did a very good job and it was an act of all decent members of Parliament to show the Hansonites that this doesn't work, this won't work.\"\n\nHowever Senator Hinch did concede Senator Hanson's supporters would approve of the stunt.\n\n\"People that irrationally hate all Muslims, they will be happy about this,\" he said.\n\nHanson's stunt beneath contempt. Response from Brandis is spot on. Now let's give her the attention she deserves - absolutely none. -- Bill Shorten (@billshortenmp)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nVery proud to be a friend and colleague of George Brandis - a fine, appropriate and necessary statement. -- Simon Birmingham (@Birmo)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nCredit where credit is due - a fine and necessary response from Senator Brandis, restoring dignity to the Senate. https://t.co/54prQyKJTk -- Mark Dreyfus (@markdreyfusQCMP)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nIt's not often I agree with George Brandis. The Greens stand with him in condemning Senator Hanson's appalling actions in Question Time. -- Richard Di Natale (@RichardDiNatale)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nTrue leadership shown by Senator Brandis today.

Some but not all government MPs also applauded but kept their seats.\n\nThe leader of the opposition in the Senate, the Labor senator Penny Wong, said if the standing orders permitted, she would have issued a vote of thanks to Brandis for his remarks.\n\nWong, also clearly infuriated, told Hanson: \"It is one thing to wear religious dress as a sincere act of faith and another to wear it here as a stunt in the Senate chamber.\"\n\nHanson's call for the banning of the burqa prompted disorderly interjections from across the chamber.\n\nThe One Nation leader's question was posed to Brandis along the following lines: \"In light of our national security of this nation, will [the government] work with me to actually ban the burqa in Australia considering there have been 13 foiled national threats against us with terrorism, three that have been successful that Australians have lost their lives?\n\n\"Terrorism is a true threat to our country. Many Australians are in fear of it.

One Nation has a policy of banning the burqa in all government buildings, including parliament, but that doesn't really explain why Hanson herself would put one on in the Senate chamber.\n\nBut when Hanson stood up to ask a question, all was revealed. It turns out she was wearing a burqa in parliament in some kind of bizarre protest against wearing the burqa in parliament.\n\nIn a media release sent out by her office Hanson said she was \"dressed modestly in a full burqa\" because \"she believed the need to ban full-face coverings in public was an important issue facing modern Australia that needed to be discussed\". She went on to describe full-face coverings as a \"security threat\".\n\nIf she was trying to demonstrate that \"security threat\" with her stunt, it backfired pretty heavily. The Senate President, Stephen Parry, said that because Hanson had established her identity in the chamber, prior to donning the burqa, there was no security threat and she was able to take part in the parliamentary proceedings.\n\nHanson's question about banning the burqa was directed at the attorney-general, George Brandis. Brandis responding by declaring Hanson's actions a \"stunt\".\n\n\"I would caution and counsel you to be very, very careful of the offence you may do to the religious sensibilities of other Australians,\" Brandis said. \"It is absolutely consistent being a good, law abiding Australian, and being a strict, adherent Muslim.\"\n\nBrandis' response drew spontaneous applause from the entire Senate, including Labor and Greens politicians.\n\nPauline Hanson is vile. She's a threat to a decent, caring Australia.

She removed it as she rose to ask Brandis whether he would work to ban the burqa, citing foiled and actual terrorist incidents. \"There has been a large majority of Australians [who] wish to see the banning of the burqa,\" she said.\n\n\"Senator Hanson, no, we will not be banning the burqa,\" Brandis said. He said he was not going to pretend to ignore her stunt - and warned of the damage such behaviour could do.\n\n\"I would caution you and counsel you, senator Hanson, with respect, to be very, very careful of the offence you may do to the religious sensibilities of other Australians.\n\n\"We have about half-a-million Australians in this country of the Islamic faith, and the vast majority of them are law-abiding, good Australians. Senator Hanson, it is absolutely consistent being a good, law-abiding Australian and being a strict-adherent Muslim.\"\n\nHe said the advice of each director-general of security and each commissioner of the Australian Federal Police with whom he had worked was \"that it is vital for their intelligence and law enforcement work that they work co-operatively with the Muslim community.\n\n\"To ridicule that community, to drive it into a corner, to mock its religious garments is an appalling thing to do, and I would ask you to reflect on what you have done.\"\n\nHanson then asked whether the government would \"ban the burqa in this house ... as a security risk\" and \"also, the fact is the people of Australia have the right to see the face of a person that they elect to this parliament\".\n\nSenate President Stephen Parry said this came within the purview of parliament's presiding officers, not the attorney-general.\n\n\"The Speaker and I have made arrangements that anyone who enters these premises with their face covered by whatever means is clearly identified prior to entering the building.\" He said he had ascertained when she entered who she was.\n\nShadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus tweeted praise for Brandis:\n\nLater Hanson moved a motion calling on \"the government to ban full face coverings in public places on the grounds of social cohesion, the need to identify people seeking community support and for public safety\". It was defeated on the voices.\n\n\"Muslims determine the electoral outcomes in up to 15 lower house seats,\" she told the Senate in her speech on the motion.\n\n\"The Muslim vote will continue to increase in importance because of the high birth rates in Australian Muslim communities. The number of Muslims in Australia doubled in the decade from 2006 to 2016 through immigration and high numbers of children born to Muslim families.\n\n\"If we do not draw a line in the sand against immigration from Islamic countries the influence of Muslims in this country will continue to grow and Australia will continue down the path of Islamisation.\"\n\nShe told 2GB that just outside the Senate chamber she had passed Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson. \"He actually put out his hand to shake my hand. Now I shook it. He has never done that to me as Pauline Hanson. He did it to shake hands with a person completely covered up. It was a tokenism that he was shaking the hand of Islam.\"\n\nCrossbencher Jacqui Lambie said Hanson had diminished the chamber and was dividing the nation.\n\nAnne Aly, a member of the House of Representatives, said Hanson had made a mockery of the parliament and her behaviour needed to be called out.\n\nCrossbench senator Nick Xenophon said her action was offensive, \"demeaning to people of other faiths\".\n\n\"I wouldn't even call this a stunt, this was just toxic,\" Xenophon said.\n\nAustralian Conservatives' Cory Bernard, who supports a ban on the burqa, said it had been \"a shock when Pauline Hanson walked past me in the flag of fundamentalism\".\n\n\"She made a particularly blunt point, but I'm not sure it is a point that should be made in the Senate chamber. I'm just as concerned about the dignity of our parliamentary system as I am about preserving our culture, and I don't like stunts of this nature to take place in our Parliament,\" Bernardi said.", "id": "9705058", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Unrepentant Hanson hopes burqa stunt will create debate", "image": "https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/182394/width1356x668/file-20170817-13494-w9q1t.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "12", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Law"}, "id": "302557", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Religion"}, "id": "303332", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "Clothing"}, "id": "303653", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lower house"}, "id": "304335", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}, "id": "305609", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim world"}, "id": "307248", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world"}, {"label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}, "id": "307295", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}, "id": "308441", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party"}, {"label": {"eng": "Australian Greens"}, "id": "309773", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens"}, {"label": {"eng": "Burqa"}, "id": "311238", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa"}, {"label": {"eng": "2GB"}, "id": "312004", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2GB"}, {"label": {"eng": "Xenophon"}, "id": "318122", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nick Xenophon"}, "id": "318129", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Xenophon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pauline Hanson"}, "id": "318133", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Hanson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Crossbencher"}, "id": "318134", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbencher"}, {"label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}, "id": "339871", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration"}, {"label": {"eng": "Creative Commons license"}, "id": "343511", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license"}, {"label": {"eng": "Australian Federal Police"}, "id": "349735", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police"}, {"label": {"eng": "George Brandis"}, "id": "363884", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Brandis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tokenism"}, "id": "371878", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Simon Birmingham"}, "id": "407331", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Birmingham"}, {"label": {"eng": "Peter Whish-Wilson"}, "id": "423881", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Whish-Wilson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam in the Netherlands"}, "id": "436300", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_the_Netherlands"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam in Australia"}, "id": "449690", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Australia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mark Dreyfus"}, "id": "575903", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Dreyfus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jacqui Lambie"}, "id": "1273659", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqui_Lambie"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 643, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Islam", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Islam"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1207, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures"}], "time": "08:14:00"}

In a stunt to draw attention to her push to ban the face covering, Hanson entered the Senate wearing the shroud, leaving her Senate colleagues shocked and open-mouthed during Question Time.\n\nEmployment minister Michaelia Cash had risen to her feet to answer a question but re-took her seat seemingly in shock as other members of the chamber turned to watch Hanson take her seat.\n\n\"What on earth?\" one senator was heard to say, as gasps and groans rang around the room.\n\nhere's video of Hanson entering the Senate, in a full black face covering - \"what on earth?\" says one senator pic.twitter.com/HyBSITxYrU -- Josh Butler (@JoshButler)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nHanson sat quietly, wearing the burqa, but eventually removed it.

It's about time [Senator Hanson] is ridiculed and her platform is ridiculed,\" he said.\n\nBoth Mr Trad and Mr Salman praised Senator Brandis' strong response.\n\nLabor, Greens and other crossbench

A voice on the recording can be heard saying, \"What on Earth?\"\n\nHanson has long called for the burqa to be banned in public, saying the central issue is the \"right of others to see a face.\"\n\nAmid unrest from her fellow senators, Hanson dramatically took off the veil, saying \"I'm quite happy to remove this because it's not what should belong in this parliament.\"\n\nHanson then asked Attorney General George Brandis, if \"in light of what is happening with national security... will you work to ban the burqa?\"\n\nBrandis, a member of the governing Liberal National coalition, received a standing ovation when, close to tears, he tore into Hanson for mocking the Muslim dress.\n\n\"Senator Hanson, no, we will not be banning the burqa.\"\n\n\"Senator Hanson, I'm not going to pretend to ignore the stunt that you have tried to pull today by arriving in the chamber dressed in a burqa, when we all know you are not an adherent of the Islamic faith.\"\n\nHe told Hanson to be \"very, very careful\" of offending the \"religious sensibilities of other Australians.\"\n\n\"To ridicule that community, to drive it into a corner, to mock its religious garments is an appalling thing to do,\" he said.\n\nTerror threat\n\nIn a speech to Parliament, Hanson referred to terror threats as one reason for her proposed ban.\n\nAustralia's terrorism threat level is currently listed as \"probable,\" on a four level scale between \"possible\" and \"expected.\"\n\nLast month, Australian authorities thwarted alleged twin terror plots described as the \"most sophisticated\" ever planned on Australian soil. They included plans to release a toxic gas in public.\n\nSince Australia's national terrorism threat level was last raised in September 2014, there have been five attacks and 13 \"major counter terrorism disruptions,\" according to a representative for the Australian Security Intelligence Organization.\n\nIn her speech, Hanson cited an attack on the Iranian parliament building in June, by men believed to be dressed in burqas, as being one example of the security threat.\n\n\"This is not the first case of this kind and it will not be the last,\" she said.\n\nGrowing Muslim population\n\nThe issue of burqa bans flared across the West last year amid calls to ban the full-length garment. They're already banned in France, Belgium, Austria and Switzerland. Earlier this year, the German parliament voted in favor of a partial ban, backed by Prime Minister Angela Merkel.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Hanson said: \"I have long believed that full face coverings, such as the burqa, were oppressive, presented barriers to assimilation, disadvantaged women from finding employment, were causing issues inside our justice system, presented a clear security threat and has no place in modern Western society.\"\n\nAccording to a Pew Research Center poll released in February, around half of Australian surveyed said that sharing the customs and traditions of the country is very important to anyone to be considered \"truly\" Australian.\n\nThere are around 600,000 Muslims in Australia -- about 2.6% of the population -- according to 2016 Census data.\n\nThe Australian far right has long attempted to ban face-covering Muslim clothing, however, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has insisted that it won't happen.\n\nDivisive figure\n\nThis is not the first time Pauline Hanson has captured the political spotlight in Australia.\n\nThe far-right politician became a national figure in Australia in 1996 when during her first speech to Parliament, after being elected as an independent MP, she said the country was at risk of being \"swamped by Asians.\"\n\nAmong the policies of Hanson's One Nation party are surveillance cameras in mosques, stopping Muslim immigration to Australia and holding a national inquiry into Islam.\n\nShe was found guilty of fraudulently obtaining $500,000 in election funding in 2003 and spent 11 weeks in jail before successfully appealing.\n\nHanson has run in numerous elections, including the 2007 and 2013 general votes, but has failed to win a seat until now. She also appeared on several reality TV shows, including Australia's Celebrity Apprentice in 2011.\n\nWhile the populist has been compared by some in the Australian media to US President Donald Trump -- and Hanson herself boasted of being invited to his inauguration -- his administration recently listed her political party a threat to religious freedom.\n\nThe annual International Religious Freedom Report highlights the campaign platform of Hanson's One Nation Party, which included \"cessation of Muslim immigration and limits on some Islamic practices,\" among an executive summary of the status of religious freedom in Australia.\n\nOnline criticism\n\nThe politician was widely criticized online for her recent stunt, by the public and fellow politicians.\n\nOne Twitter user, apparently a Melbourne-based, hijab-wearing Muslim woman, condemned Hanson's act.\n\n\"Our choice of clothing and religious expression is not your political football,\" she wrote.\n\nSome, however, applauded her move.\n\n\"Pauline Hanson made a very powerful statement in the Australian Senate by wearing a burqa,\" one commenter wrote. \"And Australian senators couldn't stomach it!\"\n\nOpposition leader Bill Shorten said the politician's \"stunt\" was \"beneath contempt.\"", "id": "9665295", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Far-right Australian senator slammed for burqa 'stunt'", "image":

Pauline Hanson, leader of the anti-Muslim, anti-immigration One Nation minor party, sat wearing the black head-to-ankle garment for more than 10 minutes before taking it off as she rose to explain that she wanted such outfits banned on national security grounds.\n\n\"There has been a large majority of Australians (who) wish to see the banning of the burka,\" said Hanson, an outspoken fan of President Donald Trump, as senators objected. Attorney-General George Brandis drew applause when he said his government would not ban the burqa, and chastised Hanson for what he described as a \"stunt\" that offended Australia's Muslim minority.\n\n\"To ridicule that community, to drive it into a corner, to mock its religious garments is an appalling thing to do and I would ask you to reflect on what you have done,\" Brandis said. Opposition Senate leader Penny Wong told Hanson: \"It is one thing to wear religious dress as a sincere act of faith; it is another to wear it as a stunt here in the Senate.\" Sam Dastyari, an opposition senator and an Iranian-born Muslim, said: \"We have seen the stunt of all stunts in this chamber by Sen.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nStory highlightsAnti-Muslim politician wears burqa in Australian senate session Politicians decry action as a \"stunt\"\n\n(CNN)An Australian senator known for her strong stance against Muslim immigration has been widely condemned for wearing a burqa to Parliament House.\n\nIn video of the parliamentary session, One Nation leader Pauline Hanson can be seen taking her seat in the floor-length Islamic garment. A voice on the recording can be heard saying, \"What on Earth?\"Hanson has long called for the burqa to be banned in public, saying the central issue is the \"right of others to see a face.\" Amid unrest from her fellow senators, Hanson dramatically took off the veil, saying \"I'm quite happy to remove this because it's not what should belong in this parliament.\" Hanson then asked Attorney General George Brandis, if \"in light of what is happening with national security... will you work to ban the burqa?\"Read MoreBrandis, a member of the governing Liberal National coalition, received a standing ovation when, close to tears, he tore into Hanson for mocking the Muslim dress.\"Senator Hanson, no, we will not be banning the burqa.\"\"Senator Hanson, I'm not going to pretend to ignore the stunt that you have tried to pull today by arriving in the chamber dressed in a burqa, when we all know you are not an adherent of the Islamic faith.\"He told Hanson to be \"very, very careful\" of offending the \"religious sensibilities of other Australians.\"\"To ridicule that community, to drive it into a corner, to mock its religious garments is an appalling thing to do,\" he said.\n\nGeorge Brandis on the verge of tears as he tells Pauline Hanson her behaviour is \"appalling\". Standing ovation from ALP/Greens. #auspol #QT pic.twitter.com/KQpc6q5RVN -- Michael Koziol (@michaelkoziol)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nTerror threatIn a speech to Parliament, Hanson referred to terror threats as one reason for her proposed ban.Australia's terrorism threat level is currently listed as \"probable,\" on a four level scale between \"possible\" and \"expected.\"Last month, Australian authorities thwarted alleged twin terror plots described as the \"most sophisticated\" ever planned on Australian soil. They included plans to release a toxic gas in public.Since Australia's national terrorism threat level was last raised in September 2014, there have been five attacks and 13 \"major counter terrorism disruptions,\" according to a representative for the Australian Security Intelligence Organization.In her speech, Hanson cited an attack on the Iranian parliament building in June, by men believed to be dressed in burqas, as being one example of the security threat.\"This is not the first case of this kind and it will not be the last,\" she said.Growing Muslim population The issue of burqa bans flared across the West last year amid calls to ban the full-length garment. They're already banned in France, Belgium, Austria and Switzerland. Earlier this year, the German parliament voted in favor of a partial ban, backed by Prime Minister Angela Merkel. North region, Cameroon Xinjiang, China Lombardy, Italy Diffa, Niger Stavropol, Russia Reus, Spain Ticino, Switzerland Belgium Chad France Gabon Republic of Congo Azerbaijan Banned in schools Kosovo Banned in schools Malasyia Banned for public servants Syria Banned for university students Egypt Netherlands Tunisia Germany In a Facebook post, Hanson said: \"I have long believed that full face coverings, such as the burqa, were oppressive, presented barriers to assimilation, disadvantaged women from finding employment, were causing issues inside our justice system, presented a clear security threat and has no place in modern Western society.\" According to a Pew Research Center poll released in February, around half of Australian surveyed said that sharing the customs and traditions of the country is very important to anyone to be considered \"truly\" Australian.There are around 600,000 Muslims in Australia -- about 2.6% of the population -- according to 2016 Census data. The Australian far right has long attempted to ban face-covering Muslim clothing, however, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has insisted that it won't happen.Divisive figureThis is not the first time Pauline Hanson has captured the political spotlight in Australia.The far-right politician became a national figure in Australia in 1996 when during her first speech to Parliament, after being elected as an independent MP, she said the country was at risk of being \"swamped by Asians.\"Among the policies of Hanson's One Nation party are surveillance cameras in mosques, stopping Muslim immigration to Australia and holding a national inquiry into Islam.She was found guilty of fraudulently obtaining $500,000 in election funding in 2003 and spent 11 weeks in jail before successfully appealing.Hanson has run in numerous elections, including the 2007 and 2013 general votes, but has failed to win a seat until now. She also appeared on several reality TV shows, including Australia's Celebrity Apprentice in 2011.While the populist has been compared by some in the Australian media to US President Donald Trump -- and Hanson herself boasted of being invited to his inauguration -- his administration recently listed her political party a threat to religious freedom.The International Religious Freedom Report, published annually by the US government, highlights the campaign platform of Hanson's One Nation Party, which included \"cessation of Muslim immigration and limits on some Islamic practices,\" among an executive summary of the current status of religious freedom in Australia. Online criticism The politician was widely criticized online for her recent stunt, by the public and fellow politicians.One Twitter user, apparently a Melbourne-based, hijab-wearing Muslim woman, condemned Hanson's act. \"Our choice of clothing and religious expression is not your political football,\" she wrote.\n\nOur choice of clothing and religious expression is not your political Football. \u1f621\u1f621\u1f621 #PaulineHanson @PaulineHansonOz -- Rana Hussain (@ranahuss)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nSome, however, applauded her move. \"Pauline Hanson made a very powerful statement in the Australian Senate by wearing a burqa,\" one commenter wrote. \"And Australian senators couldn't stomach it!\"\n\nPauline Hanson made a very powerful statement in the Australian Senate by wearing a burqa. And Australian senators couldn't stomach it! -- Mervyn Sullivan (@PMS280153)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nOpposition leader Bill Shorten said the politician's \"stunt\" was \"beneath contempt.\"\n\nHanson's stunt beneath contempt. Response from Brandis is spot on. Now let's give her the attention she deserves -- absolutely none. -- Bill Shorten (@billshortenmp)\n\nAugust 17, 2017", "id": "9665144", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Far-right

He displayed the leadership and clarity of purpose that this country needs on issues such as this. So good on you George.\"\n\nOne Nation leader Pauline Hanson: In light of the national security of our nation, will you work to ban the burqa in Australia? (calls for order) In light of what is happening with national security, there has been 13 foiled national threats against us with terrorism, three that have been successful and Australians have lost their lives. Terrorism is a true threat to our country, many Australians are in fear of it. What I would like to ask on behalf of the Australian people considering a large majority of Australians wish to see the banning of the burka.\n\nAttorney-General George Brandis: Senator Hanson no, we will not be banning the burka. Now Senator Hanson, I'm not going to pretend to ignore the stunt that you have tried to pull today by arriving in the chamber dressed in a burka when we all know you are not an adherent of the Islamic faith. And I would caution and counsel you Senator Hanson with respect, to be very very careful of the offence you may do to the religious sensibilities you may do to other Australians. We have about half a million Australians in this country of the Islamic faith. And the vast majority of them are law abiding, good Australians and Senator Hanson is is absolutely consistent with being a good law abiding Australian and being a strict adherent Muslim.\n\nNow, Senator Hanson, for the last four years I have had responsibility preeminently among the ministers subject to the Prime Minister, for national security policy. And I can tell you Senator Hanson, it has been the advice of each director-general of security with whom I have worked and each commissioner of the Australian Federal Police with whom I have worked that it is vital for their intelligence and their law enforcement work that they work cooperatively with the Muslim community. And to ridicule that community, to drive it into a corner, to mock its religious garments is an appalling thing to do, and I would ask you to reflect on what you have done. (applause)\n\nOne Nation media release:\n\nSenator Pauline Hanson has attended question time dressed modestly in a full burqa and will later be delivering a speech in Parliament calling for the Government to ban full face coverings in public.\n\nSenator Hanson said she made the decision to attend question time in a full face covering because she believed the need to ban full face coverings in public was an important issue facing modern Australia that needed to be discussed.\n\nSenator Hanson said she wished to raise the issue of full face covering presenting a security threat not only to Parliament House, but also to the greater Australian public.\n\nSenator Hanson said that she believed that full face covering, such as the burqa, were oppressive, presented barriers to assimilation, disadvantaged women from finding employment, were causing issues inside our justice system, presented a clear security threat and had no place in modern Western society.\n\nSenator Hanson said that this was a debate that was happening across the world and Australia could not hide from a difficult conversation out of fear of causing offence.\n\nSenator Hanson is scheduled to deliver a speech outlining the full extent of her position later today.", "id": "9637320", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Hanson defends burka stunt", "image":

It really happened\n\nAttorney-General George Brandis showed no hesitation.\n\nWhen Senator Hanson whipped off the garment with a dramatic flourish, exclaiming how glad she was to be free of it, and asked Senator Brandis if the government would join her in banning the burqa, he did not hold back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Senator Hanson, no, we will not be banning the burqa,\" he said, visibly angry, and looking at one point like he was close to tears.\n\nYou will now receive updates from Breaking News Alert Breaking News Alert\n\nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy .\n\n\"I am not going to pretend to ignore the stunt that you have tried to pull today by arriving in the chamber dressed in a burqa when we all know that you are not an adherent of the Islamic faith.\n\n\"I would caution and counsel you with respect to be very, very careful of the offence you may do to the religious sensibilities of other Australians.\"\n\n\"We have about 500,000 Australians in this country of the Islamic faith and the vast majority of them are law-abiding good Australians.\n\n\"Senator Hanson, for the last four years, I have had responsibility pre-eminently among the ministers subject to the Prime Minister for national security policy.\n\n\"And I can tell you, Senator Hanson, that it has been the advice of each director-general of security with whom I have worked and each commissioner of the Australian Federal Police with whom I have worked that it is vital for their intelligence and law enforcement work that they work co-operatively with the Muslim community, and to ridicule that community, to drive it into a corner, to mock its religious garments is an appalling thing to do.\n\n\"I would ask you to reflect on that.\"\n\nIn extraordinary scenes, Labor and Greens senators burst into spontaneous applause, before getting to their feet in enthusiastic praise, while his Coalition colleagues remained seated.\n\nSenator Hanson and Senator Burston left the chamber shortly after, to calls of \"good on you, George\" from the opposing side.\n\nBut she had made her point, reigniting a debate that flamed in 2014 when then-prime minister Tony Abbott was forced to reverse a decision by Speaker Bronwyn Bishop and Senator Parry to isolate women wearing a burqa or niqab in glass enclosures away from the public galleries.\n\nASIO head Duncan Lewis rebuked Senator Hanson earlier this year after she asked whether a terrorist threat was \"being brought in\" with Middle Eastern refugees.\n\n\"We've made it plain on a number of occasions, senator, that we have no security reason to be concerned about the wearing of a burqa other than the requirement for individuals to identify themselves to authorities, and there are regulations in place for that,\" Mr Lewis said in May.\n\nHe stood by his assessment despite criticism from One Nation and conservative members of the Coalition in the following days.\n\nIn 2014, Fairfax Media revealed ASIO had examined the issue and concluded the consequences of banning the burqa would be \"predominantly, if not wholly, negative\".\n\nThe previously secret 2011 report found a ban would increase tension and distrust between communities and provide \"further fuel for extremist propaganda, recruitment, and radicalisation efforts\".\n\nBut while politicians from across the political divide united in their praise of Senator Brandis for his swift and unwavering condemnation of her actions, Senator Hanson - whose party was recently named by the Trump administration as a threat to religious freedoms - was relishing having \"started the debate\". \"...It was a horrible feeling, I felt just cut off from the rest of the world,\" she told Radio 2GB.\n\n\"Here I am, no one can see my facial features, no one can see if I have given them a smile, or look at my eyes, or my reaction to them - isn't that a part of our society, that we have to interact with people?\n\n\"...It is foreign to us. This is not our way of life. And so many in the suburbs of Sydney, if you are honest about it, if you are not a Muslim, you really don't want to go to these places because you don't feel welcome there.\"\n\nIslamic Friendship Association of Australia spokesman Keysar Trad predicted some \"women who wear the burqa will feel hurt and will feel that they are under siege again\" by the Senator's actions.\n\n\"Why isn't Pauline Hanson supporting their right to dress as they choose?\"\n\nIslamic Council of Victoria vice-president Adel Salman said the stunt was offensive, and \"doesn't really help the debate\".\n\n\"The current discourse is really negative. It's about time [Senator Hanson] is ridiculed and her platform is ridiculed,\" he said.\n\nBoth Mr Trad and Mr Salman praised Senator Brandis' strong response.\n\nLabor, Greens and other crossbench senators, including Derryn Hinch and Nick Xenophon, called for Senator Hanson's stunt to be ignored.\n\nUndeterred, Senator Hanson took to the Senate floor later that same day to deliver a speech calling for the burqa ban and claiming Islam was \"threatening our way of life\", speaking to an almost empty room.\n\nFollow us on Facebook", "id": "9749061", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17",

(Lukas Coch/AAP Image via AP)\n\nCANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- An Australian senator provoked an angry backlash from lawmakers by wearing a burqa in Parliament on Thursday as part of her campaign for a national ban on Islamic face covers.\n\nPauline Hanson, leader of the anti-Muslim, anti-immigration One Nation minor party, sat wearing the black head-to-ankle garment for more than 10 minutes before taking it off as she rose to explain that she wanted such outfits banned on national security grounds.\n\n\"There has been a large majority of Australians (who) wish to see the banning of the burqa,\" said Hanson, an outspoken fan of President Donald Trump, as senators objected.\n\nAttorney-General George Brandis drew applause when he said his government would not ban the burqa, and chastised Hanson for what he described as a \"stunt\" that offended Australia's Muslim minority.\n\n\"To ridicule that community, to drive it into a corner, to mock its religious garments is an appalling thing to do and I would ask you to reflect on what you have done,\" Brandis said.\n\nOpposition Senate leader Penny Wong told Hanson: \"It is one thing to wear religious dress as a sincere act of faith; it is another to wear it as a stunt here in the Senate.\"\n\nSam Dastyari, an opposition senator and an Iranian-born Muslim, said: \"We have seen the stunt of all stunts in this chamber by Sen. Hanson.\"\n\n\"The close to 500,000 Muslim Australians do not deserve to be targeted, do not deserve to be marginalized, do not deserve to be ridiculed, do not deserve to have their faith made some political point by the desperate leader of a desperate political party,\" Dastyari said.\n\nSenate President Stephen Parry said Hanson's identity had been confirmed before she entered the chamber. He also said he would not dictate the standards of dress for the chamber.\n\nParliament House briefly segregated women wearing burqas and niqabs in 2014. The department that runs Parliament House said that \"persons with facial coverings\" would no longer be allowed in the building's open public galleries. Instead, they were to be directed to galleries usually reserved for noisy schoolchildren, where they could sit behind soundproof glass.\n\nThe policy was branded a \"burqa ban\" and was widely condemned as a segregation of Muslim women, as well as a potential breach of anti-discrimination laws.\n\nOfficials relented, allowing people wearing face coverings in all public areas of Parliament House after the coverings were removed temporarily at the building's front door so that staff can check the visitor's identity.\n\nThe reason behind the segregation was never explained, but it seems to have been triggered by a rumor on Sydney talk radio that men dressed in burqas were planning an anti-Muslim demonstration in Parliament House.", "id": "9713282", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Anti-Muslim Australian senator wears burqa in Parliament", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VivjcQvJBBL7DHd2BeoKTA--/aD0yMDQ4O3c9MzA3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/397178d139b343b0b57ad3f7d2b817d0.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 160, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 173}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "12", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "107", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Canberra"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "71684", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra", "label": {"eng": "Canberra"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Political party"}, "id": "303038", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Religion"}, "id": "303332", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "Clothing"}, "id": "303653", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing"}, {"label": {"eng": "National security"}, "id": "305998", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security"}, {"label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}, "id": "306436", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"}, {"label": {"eng": "Women in Islam"}, "id": "308807", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Burqa"}, "id": "311238", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa"}, {"label": {"eng": "One Nation (Australia)"}, "id": "318130", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation_(Australia)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pauline Hanson"}, "id": "318133", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Hanson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}, "id": "339871", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration"}, {"label": {"eng": "Australian Senate"}, "id": "348112", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Senate"}, {"label": {"eng": "George Brandis"}, "id": "363884", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Brandis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Penny Wong"}, "id": "512008", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Wong"}, {"label": {"eng": "Religious clothing"}, "id": "520732", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_clothing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sam Dastyari"}, "id": "584753", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Dastyari"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islamic dress in Europe"}, "id": "668138", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_dress_in_Europe"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 643, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Islam", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Islam"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1207, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures"}], "time": "14:47:00"}

were to be directed to galleries usually reserved for noisy schoolchildren, where they could sit behind soundproof glass.\n\nThe policy was branded a \"burqa ban\" and was widely condemned as segregating Muslim women, as well as a potential breach of anti-discrimination laws.\n\nOfficials relented, allowing people wearing face coverings in all public areas of Parliament House after the coverings were removed temporarily at the building's front door so that staff can check the visitor's identity.\n\nThe reason behind the segregation was never explained, but it seems to have been

The department that runs Parliament House said that \"persons with facial coverings\" would no longer be allowed in the building's open public galleries. Instead, they were to be directed to galleries usually reserved for noisy schoolchildren, where they could sit behind soundproof glass.\n\nThe policy was branded a \"burqa ban\" and was widely condemned as a segregation of Muslim women, as well as a potential breach of anti-discrimination laws. Officials relented, allowing people wearing face coverings in all public areas of Parliament House after the coverings were removed temporarily at the building's front door so that staff can check the visitor's identity.\n\nThe reason behind the segregation was never explained, but it seems to have been triggered by a rumor on Sydney talk radio that men dressed in burqas were planning an anti-Muslim demonstration in Parliament House.", "id": "9734675", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Anti-Muslim Australian senator wears burqa in Parliament | From the Trenches World Report", "image": "https://i0.mail.com/mcom/698/5446698,pd=1,f=teaser-card-s/pauline-hanson.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "12", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "107", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Canberra"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "71684", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra", "label": {"eng": "Canberra"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Political party"}, "id": "303038", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Religion"}, "id": "303332", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "Clothing"}, "id": "303653", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}, "id": "306436", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"}, {"label": {"eng": "Women in Islam"}, "id": "308807", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Burqa"}, "id": "311238", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa"}, {"label": {"eng": "One Nation (Australia)"}, "id": "318130", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation_(Australia)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pauline Hanson"}, "id": "318133", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Hanson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}, "id": "339871", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration"}, {"label": {"eng": "Australian Senate"}, "id": "348112", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Senate"}, {"label": {"eng": "George Brandis"}, "id": "363884", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Brandis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Penny Wong"}, "id": "512008", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Wong"}, {"label": {"eng": "Religious clothing"}, "id": "520732", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_clothing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sam Dastyari"}, "id": "584753", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Dastyari"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islamic dress in Europe"}, "id": "668138", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_dress_in_Europe"}], "location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Canberra"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 643, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Islam", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Islam"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1207, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures"}], "time": "16:36:00"}

Pauline Hanson pulls off a burqa in the Senate chamber at Parliament House on Thursday. (AAP/Mick Tsikas/via Reuters)\n\nFaceless in a long, black burqa, the woman took a front-row seat in the Australian Senate chambers Thursday and sat like that for several minutes: silent, well aware she'd caused a scene.\n\nThen she rose with a dramatic flair, whipped the veil off her bright red hair and cast the burqa to the floor, her identity revealed.\n\nThe senators behind her did not look remotely surprised. The woman was Sen. Pauline Hanson, one of Australia's most acerbic politicians, and she was about to make yet another long speech about Islam.\n\n\"I'm quite happy to remove this because it is not what should belong in this Parliament,\" Hanson said, flipping her hair back in place as she began. \"The central issue in this motion before the Senate is the right of others to see a face.\"\n\nHanson accused security guards of failing to identify her as she walked anonymously into the chambers (the Senate president denied this, according to the Associated Press). And she chastised a senator who shook her hand on the way, when he had never done so before.\n\n\"It was the burqa that drew him\" Hanson said.\n\nOver the next 20 minutes, she would warn of hypothetical burqa-clad bank robbers, of \"migrants who want to come here and change the foundation stones of our way of life,\" of a Muslim war on Christmas -- and she'd eventually demand a ban on burqas and Islamic immigration alike.\n\nShe had done this type of thing before -- if not always in costume.\n\nThe proprietor of a fish-and-chips shop at the time, Hanson first won a Parliament seat in the 1990s. She used it to accuse aboriginals of milking government benefits, and Asians of flooding Australia.\n\nBut Australia is \"one of the world's most peaceful and socially harmonious immigrant-driven countries,\" as The Washington Post once noted. Hanson lost her seat and spent long years out of power. She was jailed on charges of electoral fraud in the 2000s, though the conviction was later overturned, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.\n\n[An anti-Muslim political party in Australia is rebounding]\n\nShe stunned many politicians last year, when she led her One Nation party to win four seats in the Senate by courting voters' fears of immigrants.\n\nHer first speech to the Senate, in September, ran for half an hour. Australia now \"swamped by Muslims\" Hanson told the Senate, and declared that \"Islam cannot have a significant presence in Australia if we are to live in an open, secular and cohesive society.\"\n\nAround the same time, Hanson later told an Australian radio host, she found out the Senate had no dress code and began putting together her burqa plan.\n\n\"Is it extreme? Yes,\" she said on 2GB 873 AM after Thursday's stunt. \"Is it getting my message across, I hope so.\"\n\n[An anti-immigrant group mistook empty bus seats for women wearing burqas]\n\nWhile a tiny fraction of Australians practice Islam -- let alone wear burqa -- the full-body coverings have become a target of anti-immigrant groups and politicians around the world, regardless of whether many people actually wear them. In one notable example of hysteria, a group of Norwegians became alarmed by a photo of what turned out to be empty bus seats.\n\nHanson told the radio host she found the garb \"horrible\" when she tried it on this week.\n\n\"More than just uncomfortable,\" she added. \"It's really hard to describe.

The leader of the government in the senate, attorney general George Brandis, told the One Nation leader the ruling coalition had no intention of banning the burka.\n\nIn remarks that secured him a standing ovation from the opposition Labor Party, and the Greens as well as other crossbench senators, Mr Brandis warned Ms Hanson against indulging in behaviour that Muslim Australians would find offensive.\n\n\"Senator Hanson, no, we will not be banning the burka,\" Mr Brandis told the senate on Thursday. \"Senator Hanson, I'm not going to pretend to ignore the stunt that you have tried to pull today by arriving in the chamber dressed in a burka when we all know you are not an adherent of the Islamic faith.\n\n\"I would caution you and counsel you, Senator Hanson, with respect, to be very very careful of the offence you may do to the religious sensibilities of other Australians.\"\n\n\"We have about half a million Australians in this country of the Islamic faith, and the vast majority of them are law abiding, good Australians, and Senator Hanson, it is absolutely consistent with being a good law abiding Australian and a strict, adherent, Muslim.\"\n\nMr Brandis reminded Ms Hanson that as attorney general he held preeminent portfolio responsibility for national security, and the advice from intelligence agencies was clear - countering the risks of extremism required close co-operation with the Islamic community.\n\nHe rebuked Ms Hanson for causing offence to a faith community. \"To ridicule that community, to drive it into a corner, to mock its religious garments, is an appalling thing to do, and I would ask you to reflect on your behaviour.\"\n\nMs Hanson smiled throughout Mr Brandis's comments , and visibly delighted with the commotion caused by her intervention, left the senate chamber shortly after her designated question.\n\nMr Brandis's rebuke prompted Labor, Greens and some crossbenchers to stand and applaud. Some but not all government MPs also applauded but kept their seats.\n\nThe leader of the opposition in the senate, the Labor senator Penny Wong, said if the standing orders permitted, she would have issued a vote of thanks to Mr Brandis for his remarks.\n\nMs Wong, also clearly infuriated, told Ms Hanson: \"It is one thing to wear religious dress as a sincere act of faith and another to wear it here as a stunt in the Senate chamber.\"\n\nMs Hanson's call for the banning of the burka prompted disorderly interjections from across the chamber.\n\nThe One Nation leader's question was posed to Mr Brandis along the following lines: \"In light of our national security of this nation, will [the government] work with me to actually ban the burka in Australia considering there have been 13 foiled national threats against us with terrorism, three that have been successful that Australians have lost their lives?\n\n\"Terrorism is a true threat to our country. Many Australians are in fear of it.

Pauline Hanson sent Parliament into a frenzy Thursday by entering the Senate chambers wearing a burqa, making a statement as part of her campaign to ban the traditional Islamic garb.\n\nHanson is the founder and leader of the right-wing nationalist One Nation Party, which was founded in 1997. She turned heads by entering the chamber late so her entrance would draw the maximum amount of attention.\n\nAfter sitting quietly for a short time, Hanson confronted Liberal Senate leader George Brandis, imploring him to support her efforts to ban the burqa in Australia.\n\n\"I'm quite happy to remove this, because this is not what should belong in this Parliament,\" Hanson said, according to Yahoo. \"Senator Brandis, in light of the national security of this nation, will you work with me to ban the burqa in Australia. There has been 13 foiled national threats against us with terrorism, three that have been successful, and Australians have lost their lives.\n\n\"What I would like to ask on behalf of the Australian people, considering there has been a large majority of Australians wish to see the banning of the burqa,\" Hanson said.\n\nHanson faced severe backlash and chastisement from her fellow senators for what Brandis called a \"stunt.\" Australia has a sizable Muslim population, which other senators said would be offended by the insincere use of their religious dress.\n\n\"I would caution and counsel you with respect to be very, very careful of the offense you may do to the religious sensibilities of other Australians,\" Brandis said. \"We have about 500,000 Australians in this country of the Islamic faith and the vast majority of them are law-abiding good Australians. Senator Hanson, it is absolutely consistent with being a good, law-abiding Australian and being a strict adherent Muslim.\"\n\nThe subject of Islamic terrorism has been of growing concern in Australia, with several attacks taking place that the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for. Two men were killed and three police officers shot in a hostage situation in Melbourne in June.\n\nIn 2014, an Islamic gunman took 18 people hostage in a Sydney cafe, and two people were killed before the gunman was killed by authorities. These events have increased the dialogue surrounding burqas and their implications for national security.\n\nCountries in Europe, Asia, and Africa have instituted full or partial bans of full-face veils in recent years.

The woman was Sen. Pauline Hanson, one of Australia's most acerbic politicians, and she was about to make yet another long speech about Islam.\n\n\"I'm quite happy to remove this because it is not what should belong in this Parliament,\" Hanson said, flipping her hair back in place as she began. \"The central issue in this motion before the Senate is the right of others to see a face.\"\n\nHanson said no security guards had tried to identify her as she walked anonymously into the chambers (the Senate president denied this, according to the Associated Press). And she chastised a senator who shook her hand on the way, when he had never done so before.\n\n\"It was the burqa that drew him\" Hanson said.\n\nOver the next 20 minutes, she would warn of hypothetical burqa-clad bank robbers, of \"migrants who want to come here and change the foundation stones of our way of life,\" of a Muslim war on Christmas - and she'd eventually demand a ban on burqas and Islamic immigration alike.\n\nShe had done this type of thing before, if not always in costume.\n\nThe proprietor of a fish-and-chips shop at the time, Hanson first won a Parliament seat in the 1990s. She used it to accuse aboriginals of milking government benefits, and Asians of flooding Australia.\n\nBut Australia is \"one of the world's most peaceful and socially harmonious immigrant-driven countries,\" as The Washington Post once noted. Hanson lost her seat and spent long years out of power. She was jailed on charges of electoral fraud in the 2000s, though the conviction was later overturned, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.\n\nShe stunned many politicians last year, when she led her One Nation party to win four seats in the Senate by courting voters' fears of immigrants.\n\nHer first speech to the Senate, in September, ran for half an hour. Australia is now \"swamped by Muslims\" Hanson told the Senate, and declared that \"Islam cannot have a significant presence in Australia if we are to live in an open, secular and cohesive society.\"\n\nAround the same time, Hanson later told an Australian radio host, she found out the Senate had no dress code and began putting together her burqa plan.\n\n\"Is it extreme? Yes,\" she said on 2GB 873 AM after Thursday's stunt. \"Is it getting my message across? I hope so.\"\n\nWhile a tiny fraction of Australians practice Islam, let alone wear burqas, the full-body coverings have become a target of anti-immigrant groups and politicians around the world, regardless of whether many people actually wear them. In one notable example of hysteria, a group of Norwegians became alarmed by a photo of what turned out to be empty bus seats.\n\nHanson told the radio host she found the garb \"horrible\" when she tried it on this week.\n\n\"More than just uncomfortable,\" she said. \"It's really hard to describe. I'm hiding behind something. I feel for these women that are forced to wear it.\"\n\nHanson chose to, of course.\n\n\"It is clear that Muslims particularly those with extremist views have chosen to live separately from other Australians,\" she said near the end of her speech, after calling for a five-year ban on Islamic immigration.\n\n\"Islam threatens our way of life,\" she said.\n\nWhen she was done, Attorney-General George Brandis rose to reply, his voice sometimes catching as he defended his country's Muslim population.\n\n\"Senator Hanson, no, we will not be banning the burqa,\" he said. \"To ridicule that community, to drive it into a corner, to mock its religious garments, is an appalling thing to do, and I would ask you to reflect on what you have done.\"\n\nApplause then filled the chamber, despite calls for order.

Credit - Australian Parliament House via Storyful6:38\n\nOne Nation's Pauline Hanson has come under fire from her for wearing a burqa in the Australian Senate on Thursday. When Hanson entered the Senate chambers on August 17, audible gasps could be heard from other Senators. Hanson, in a press release, said she attended Question Time \"dressed modestly in a full burqa\" to call for the government to ban full face coverings in public, arguing burqas were a national security risk. When it was her turn to present a question to Attorney-General George Brandis, she stood up and removed the burka, and asked the AG if the government planned to ban the garment which is worn by some Muslim women. Brandis said the government had no plans to ban the wearing of burqas. He then said Hanson's attire was a \"stunt\", adding it was \"appalling\" and offensive towards the Muslim community, whom he said co-operated with law enforcement and security agencies in Australia. \"To ridicule that community, to drive it into a corner, to mock its religious attire is an appalling thing to do,\" Brandis said, before the left side of the chamber erupted in applause. Hanson's stunt has put her One Nation party back in the spotlight after a US State Department report published on August 16 warned her policy of banning Muslim immigration was a threat to religious freedom in Australia.

After several minutes she removed her head covering to demand the government ban the garment in public places, claiming it could be used to abet terrorism plots. The burqa is worn by some Muslim women in accordance with their faith.\n\nIt's the latest bid by Hanson to draw attention to her stance against Muslims, which includes demands to ban their migration to Australia, installing closed-circuit cameras in mosques and holding a widespread public inquiry into Islam.\n\nThe senator, who was elected to the lower house in the 1990s on an anti-Asian immigration platform before her party imploded, returned to parliament last year along with three other members of her One Nation party. Turnbull usually needs the votes of One Nation senators to pass legislation.\n\nWhile Muslims represent less than 3 percent of Australia's population, Hanson claims they are responsible for all recent terrorism-linked crimes in the country. Her comments come as racial tensions increase in other Western nations including the U.S., where white supremacists and anti-fascists clashed in Charlottesville. President Donald Trump has sparked a furor in the U.S. by equating white supremacists to counter-protesters.\n\nAustralian intelligence services have disrupted or stopped 13 major terrorism plans since 2014, according to the government, including a plot uncovered last month where two men allegedly planned to blow up a plane with a bomb made with explosives provided by Islamic State. In December 2014, a gunman who'd claimed allegiance to Islamic State died after a siege at a Sydney cafe, alongside two hostages.\n\n\"Terrorism is a true threat to our country,\" Hanson said in her question to Attorney General George Brandis, when she asked for the government ban on the burqa. \"Many Australians are in fear of it.\"\n\nBrandis quickly dismissed Hanson's request, and said his advice from intelligence agencies was the government should work closely with Islamic communities to counter extremism.\n\n\"We have about half a million Australians in this country of the Islamic faith and the vast majority of them are law-abiding, good Australians,\" Brandis said, his voiced shaking with emotion. \"To ridicule that community, to drive it into a corner, to mock its religious garments, is an appalling thing to do and I would ask you to reflect on what you have done.\"\n\nHis comments drew applause and a standing ovation from Labor and Greens lawmakers.", "id": "9643483",

George Brandis, who leads the Senate, was adamant that there will be no burqa ban in the country. \"Senator Hanson, I'm not going to pretend to ignore the stunt that you have tried to pull today by arriving in the chamber dressed in a burqa when we all know you are not an adherent of the Islamic faith,\" he said. \"I would caution you and counsel you, Senator Hanson, with respect, to be very very careful of the offense you may do to the religious sensibilities of other Australians.\"\n\nAnother member of the Senate, Penny Wong, called out Hanson for insulting Islam and making a mockery of religious practice. \"It is one thing to wear religious dress as a sincere act of faith and another to wear it here as a stunt in the Senate chamber,\" she said.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, Hanson seemed \"visibly delighted with the commotion caused by her intervention\" and left after she asked Brandis if Australia would ban the garment -- a request he refused to allow.\n\nSome countries have already passed laws that prevent women from wearing burqas in public. The German parliament passed a partial ban on burqas in April, and France became the first country to outlaw wearing burqas in public in 2011. Last summer saw conflict over burkini swimsuits, which cover more of the body than most suits but are completely unlike actual burqas.

In 2016, she claimed Australia was being swamped by Muslims.\n\nMore from Newsweek\n\nAustralia: Court Hears Harrowing Accounts of Child Abuse in Diocese Linked to Vatican Cardinal George PellPriests Should Be Charged if They Don't Report Child Sex Abuse Disclosed in Confession, Says Australian InquiryAustralia: Flesh Eating Sea Fleas Attack Teen's Legs While Swimming", "id": "9766770", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Pauline Hanson: Far-Right Australian Leader Shocks Wearing Burqa in Senate, Demands Ban", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/u9nhc_IC6O99kOMW5jKPZg--/aD0yMzM0O3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/newsweek_europe_news_328/7225713b86e98ccdb4668243db63fe1f", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 1417, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1426}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "12", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "107", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "191", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "212", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Queensland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "70210", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland", "label": {"eng": "State of Queensland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Canberra"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "71684", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra", "label": {"eng": "Canberra"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Reuters"}, "id": "302588", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Religion"}, "id": "303332", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"}, {"label": {"eng": "Meat"}, "id": "303412", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "Clothing"}, "id": "303653", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Populism"}, "id": "305804", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam and clothing"}, "id": "308809", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_clothing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Burqa"}, "id": "311238", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}, "id": "311241", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "One Nation (Australia)"}, "id": "318130", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation_(Australia)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pauline Hanson"}, "id": "318133", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Hanson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}, "id": "339871", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration"}, {"label": {"eng": "Australian Senate"}, "id": "348112", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Senate"}, {"label": {"eng": "George Brandis"}, "id": "363884", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Brandis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Attorney-General for Australia"}, "id": "394622", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney-General_for_Australia"}], "location": null, "categories": [], "time": "13:02:00"}

In her maiden speech in Parliament in 1996, she warned that Australia was at risk of being \"swamped by Asians\". As the topic of Asian immigration faded from public debate, Hanson and her One Nation colleagues have followed the lead of other far-right movements, focussing their ire on Muslims, says Quartz.\n\nAfter being elected to the Senate in last year, she echoed her 1996 speech, this time suggesting the country was being \"swamped by Muslims\".

Instead, they were to be directed to galleries usually reserved for noisy schoolchildren, where they could sit behind soundproof glass.\n\nThe policy was branded a \"burka ban\" and was widely condemned as a segregation of Muslim women, as well as a potential breach of anti-discrimination laws.\n\nOfficials relented, allowing people wearing face coverings in all public areas of Parliament House after the coverings were removed temporarily at the building's front door so that staff can check the visitor's identity.\n\nThe reason behind the segregation was never explained, but it seems to have been triggered by a rumour on Sydney talk radio that men dressed in burkas were planning an anti-Muslim demonstration in Parliament House.", "id": "9719624", "details": {}, "date":

Her maiden speech to the House of Representatives dealt with these issues and it had also garnered wide attention. Later, her comment on Africans transmitting AIDS to Australia forced her own party members to distance away from her, according to her biography.\n\nBorn into a poor family, Hanson had a troubled childhood. She often ran away from home in search of a better style. By the age of 21, she was divorced with two children to look after. She settled in Ipswich, England, and ran a petty shop selling fish and chips for a living.

House after the coverings were removed temporarily at the building's front door so that staff can check the visitor's identity.\n\nThe reason behind the segregation was never explained, but it seems to have been triggered by a rumor on Sydney talk radio that men dressed in burkas were planning an anti-Muslim demonstration in Parliament House.", "id": "9723748", "details": {}, "date":

That's democracy, you get the full spectrum.\n\n\"What's important is that the government of the day responds, and that's what George Brandis did.\"\n\nUndeterred by Senator Brandis' response, Senator Hanson, burqa under her arm, walked out of Parliament and straight into a radio interview.\n\nWhen she returned, she spoke to her motion calling for a ban of \"full face covering\" in public places.\n\nThe One Nation leader conceded what she has done was \"radical\", but said it was required to make a point and start a debate.\n\nNo one had checked her identity when she walked into the Senate, Senator Hanson claimed. But Senate President Stephen Parry said he'd verified that the woman underneath the veil had been her.\n\nCoalition senators were also asked why they did not join Labor and the Greens in standing after Senator Brandis' speech.\n\nEmployment Minister Michaelia Cash refused to explain the move, saying only that Senator Brandis had articulated the government's position on the matter.\n\nThe response from Labor, the Greens and the crossbench was more direct.\n\n\"I know a thing or two about stunts. But I wouldn't even call this a stunt. This was just toxic,\" Senator Nick Xenophon said.\n\nFellow crossbencher Derryn Hinch said her actions were \"disgraceful\".\n\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten described it as \"beneath contempt\".

The Greens stand with him in condemning Senator Hanson's appalling actions in Question Time,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nLabor's Anne Aly, Australia's first female Muslim MP, said Senator Hanson had made a \"mockery\" of the Parliament.\n\nDespite Senator Hanson's actions, the words of Senator Brandis, delivered off the cuff, had shown Australia to be a \"tolerant and accepting\" society, said Ali Kadri, vice-president of the Islamic Council of Queensland.\n\nThe Attorney-General appeared to fight back tears as he told Senator Hanson he could not \"ignore the stunt you have tried to pull today\".\n\n\"We all know you are not an adherent of the Islamic faith,\" he said.\n\n\"We have about half a million Australians of Islamic faith. And the vast majority of them are law-abiding, good Australians. And Senator Hanson, it is absolutely consistent being a good, law-abiding Australian and a strict, adherent Muslim.\n\n\"To ridicule that community, to drive it into a corner, to mock its religious

This is not the way that we do things in parliament, it is an absolute disgrace, it is a mockery of our parliament,\" she said.\n\n\"Even trying to sell it as national security really is drawing a very, very long bow here.\n\n\"There are women who are risking their lives in places like Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia for their rights, for women's rights, to advance the cause of women's rights -- Pauline Hanson does not care about those women.\"", "id": "9740291", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "In 4 Words, Ludlam Summed Up The Vulgarity Of Hanson's Burqa Stunt", "image": "https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/1076x566+0+0/resize/1200x630!/format/jpg/quality/85/http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fdc074813293764974b95a024b3cbbacf%2F205574010%2FHanson-Ludlam%2BMash.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1453, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1468}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "id": "302545", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Religion"}, "id": "303332", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}, "id": "304967", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}, "id": "305609", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)"}, {"label": {"eng": "National security"}, "id": "305998", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sky News"}, "id": "307454", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of Australian Leaders of the Opposition"}, "id": "307735", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Australian_Leaders_of_the_Opposition"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bill Shorten"}, "id": "307740", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten"}, {"label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}, "id": "308441", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party"}, {"label": {"eng": "Australian Greens"}, "id": "309773", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens"}, {"label": {"eng": "Burqa"}, "id": "311238", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}, "id": "311364", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights"}, {"label": {"eng": "One Nation (Australia)"}, "id": "318130", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation_(Australia)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pauline Hanson"}, "id": "318133", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Hanson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Senate of Canada"}, "id": "323453", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Canada"}, {"label": {"eng": "Farce"}, "id": "348742", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farce"}, {"label": {"eng": "George Brandis"}, "id": "363884", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Brandis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Parliament of Australia"}, "id": "365957", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Scott Ludlam"}, "id": "407829", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Ludlam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cory Bernardi"}, "id": "423893", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Bernardi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Question Time (TV series)"}, "id": "452857", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_Time_(TV_series)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 115, "label": "dmoz/Society/People", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 121, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Women"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1207, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures"}], "time": "07:11:00"}

Ms Hanson later removed the burka.\n\nHer motion to ban the garment will be debated in the Senate later on Thursday.

You can read an abbreviated transcript of their exchange below.\n\nPAULINE HANSON: In light of what is happening with national security, there has been 13 foiled national threats against us with terrorism, three that have been successful and Australians have lost their lives. Terrorism is a true threat to our country. Many Australians are very much in fear of it. What I would like to ask, on behalf of the Australian people considering there has been a large majority of Australians wish to see the banning of the burka.\n\nGEORGE BRANDIS: Thank you. Senator Hanson, no, we will not be banning the burka.\n\nSenator Hanson, I am not going to pretend to ignore the stunt that you have tried to pull today by arriving in the Chamber dressed in a burka when we all know that you are not an adherent of the Islamic faith. I would caution and counsel you with respect to be very, very careful of the offence you may do to the religious sensibilities of other Australians.\n\nWe have about 500,000 Australians in this country of the Islamic faith. And the vast majority of them are law-abiding, good Australians. Senator Hanson, it is absolutely consistent with being a good, law-abiding Australian and being a strict, adherent Muslim.\n\nSenator Hanson, for the last four years, I have had responsibility pre-eminently among the ministers subject to the Prime Minister for national security policy. And I can tell you, Senator Hanson, that it has been the advice of each director-general of security with whom I have worked and each commissioner of the Australian Federal Police with whom I have worked that it is vital for their intelligence and law-enforcement work that they work cooperatively with the Muslim community. And to ridicule that community, to drive it into a corner, to mock its religious garments is an appalling thing to do and I would ask you to reflect on what you have done.\n\nSENATOR HANSON: I thank the Senate.\n\nIs the Attorney-General aware that the burka is not a religious requirement at all? My question is will the Attorney-General then ban the burka in this House for -- in future as a security risk and, also, the fact is that the people of Australia have the right to see the face of a person that they elect to this Parliament and they are the person who is actually going to be making decisions in the Parliament on their behalf?\n\nSTEPHEN PARRY (SENATE PRESIDENT): Before I call the Attorney-General, [it is] in the purview of the presiding officers, not the Attorney-General, to determine what happens as far as security is concerned within the Parliament House. The speaker and I have made arrangements that anyone who enters with their face covered is clearly identified prior to entering the building. Further, the first thing ascertained when you walked in to the ... Chamber, dressed as you were, I ascertained who you were. Attorney-General, do you have any comment that you wish to make in relation to that matter?\n\nSENATOR HANSON: I will. If a person who wears a balaclava or a helmet into a bank or any other building or on the floor of a court they must be removed. Why isn't it the same for someone who is covering up their face and cannot be identified? Will the Government make changes to the laws?", "id": "9640500", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Full transcript: Brandis condemns Hanson's burka stunt", "image": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/8817244-1x1-700x700.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "12", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Law"}, "id": "302557", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Religion"}, "id": "303332", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "Clothing"}, "id": "303653", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}, "id": "305157", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate"}, {"label": {"eng": "National security"}, "id": "305998", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security"}, {"label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}, "id": "307295", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}, "id": "308102", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general"}, {"label": {"eng": "Burqa"}, "id": "311238", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa"}, {"label": {"eng": "One Nation (Australia)"}, "id": "318130", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation_(Australia)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pauline Hanson"}, "id": "318133", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Hanson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Australian Federal Police"}, "id": "349735", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police"}, {"label": {"eng": "George Brandis"}, "id": "363884", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Brandis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aboriginal Australians"}, "id": "366156", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Australians"}, {"label": {"eng": "Attorney-General for Australia"}, "id": "394622", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney-General_for_Australia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Question Time (TV series)"}, "id": "452857", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_Time_(TV_series)"}, {"label": {"eng": "PARRY"}, "id": "854031", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARRY"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 1207, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures"}], "time": "04:50:00"}

(Credit: ABC)\n\nWhen Pauline Hanson shrugged off her burka costume, revealing her smug face revelling in the attention, it barely caused a ripple in the lives of Australian Muslim women.\n\nIt was if amnesia had taken hold. Forgetting that Muslim women had long ago been boiled down to a reduction, a caricature of oppression. That Muslim women had been fought over through the narratives of liberation, in the wars of culture, the lightning rod in the clash of civilisation debates.\n\nMany Australian Muslim women have repeatedly raised concerns with the same parliamentarians who rebuked Ms Hanson, over the political rhetoric used by them when they have discussed issues such as terrorism, free speech and refugees.\n\nWe have grown to expect false consultations, reports on Australian values and citizenship, insincere platitudes and empty reassurances.\n\nThere is no power to fight the burden that falls on Muslim women to engage with racists, as if their racism was one big misunderstanding.\n\nI'm expected to listen patiently to racists that lecture me on my religion, to debate neo-nazis, to participate in campaigns such as to \"hug a Muslim\" or \"date a Muslim\". Indeed, even large Muslim organisations and Muslim leaders advocate that narrative. To jump through hoops, with a pretty smile on my face, so that a common humanity is recognised.\n\nWhen a terrorist incident occurs overseas, Australian Muslim women modify their behaviour in public and restrict their participation in public spaces.\n\nAt all times, we remain acutely aware of our safety and the safety of our children in public.\n\nThe food we eat, where we live, our relationship: they are all heavily politicised, lest of all our bodies and our dress.\n\nThis is our normal. This is our reality. As is the acceptance that we are politically disposable. We are entirely aware that we are a form of political currency, the value of which is dictated by the context.\n\nFor Hanson, it was the star attraction in a stunt more closely resembling a year 12 muck-up day prank.\n\nSenator George Brandis has been congratulated for (finally) calling out Ms Hanson's hate speech; but he is not an anti-racism hero.\n\nEven in his condemnation of Ms Hanson, he stressed that every single head of intelligence and Australian Federal Police commissioner has stressed how vital Australian Muslims are to Australia's national security. Time and time again, Muslims are viewed purely though a prism of security, where we are policed, our belonging questioned and our loyalties demanded.\n\nThe default position is to suspect us unless we have demonstrated our loyalty against an ever shifting line in the sand.\n\nMany prominent Muslim advocates and \"leaders\" contribute to this binary to further their own agendas.\n\nThey should take heed of the comments made by Brandis: \"that it is consistent with being a good law abiding citizen and a strict adherent Muslim\".\n\nI was not surprised to watch Ms Hanson play dress-up, nor her dressing down by Brandis. Using our Parliament as an act of political theatre was not invented by Ms Hanson; nor will she be the last actor on its stage.\n\nIt is surprising that Brandis and Co are that shocked over Hanson's stunt. How could they expect anything less?\n\nThe political leadership in this country has allowed the cultivation and festering of the conditions that gave birth to Ms Hanson and her supporters.\n\nIt is far easier condemning dangerous right-wing ideology when it comes from outside your own political party.\n\nThe risk is that when the Senate resumes, the underlying racism that is fuelling this fire will still be burning. It is a fire that threatens to disintegrate the bonds that bind us as Australians.\n\nIronically, Ms Hanson demonstrated that the very security reforms she is erroneously pushing are effective and adaptable.\n\nMs Hanson was processed through the security checkpoints inside Parliament House and had her identification confirmed before entering Parliament.\n\nIn a strange and glorious twist of fate, Hanson demonstrated that a woman's choice of dress does not impede their ability to participate in our Parliament and contribute to the process of democratic decision-making.\n\nMs Hanson gave hope to little Hijabis and Niqaabis everywhere.

Some politicians have gained reputations -- good and bad -- for pushing the boundaries of acceptable behaviour by elected representatives and Pauline Hanson is one of them. She is the leader of the rightwing One Nation party and caused a ruckus when she entered the Senate chamber wearing a black burqa. She has called for a ban on the wearing of the burqa on the grounds of national security, and quickly drew the ire and the admonishments of a basket of other parties representatives.\n\nThe leader of the government in the Senate told Hanson that the ruling coalition had no intention of banning the burqa and that her actions were likely to be found offensive by Australian Muslims. There are around half a million Australian Muslims and they already face a rise in discrimination against them. The Speaker pointed out that countering the risks relative to extremism required the cooperation of the Muslim community. Banning the burqa was unlikely to do much to further that goal.\n\nAlthough Hanson's behaviour was offensive, ill judged and bizarre it is far from unique among politicians worldwide that are increasingly confident in advancing an anti-Muslim agenda. Time and again 'security concerns' are cited as the reason and they have had some success in Europe. Hanson is no fool. Odious as she is, she will have been playing to a receptive sector of the Australian electorate, not only the members of her own party. There may even be Senate members that were quietly supportive of her as not all members applauded the put-downs that came her way. There is a troubling and global swing to the political right, and events in Charlottesville less than a week ago and the equivocal initial response of President Trump tell us that extremism can and does reach the top.

Forgetting that Muslim women had long ago been boiled down to a reduction, a caricature of oppression. That Muslim women had been fought over through the narratives of liberation, in the wars of culture, the lightning rod in the clash of civilisation debates.\n\nMany Australian Muslim women have repeatedly raised concerns with the same parliamentarians who rebuked Ms Hanson, over the political rhetoric used by them when they have discussed issues such as terrorism, free speech and refugees.\n\nWe have grown to expect false consultations, reports on Australian values and citizenship, insincere platitudes and empty reassurances.\n\nThere is no power to fight the burden that falls on Muslim women to engage with racists, as if their racism was one big misunderstanding.\n\nI'm expected to listen patiently to racists that lecture me on my religion, to debate neo-nazis, to participate in campaigns such as to \"hug a Muslim\" or \"date a Muslim\". Indeed, even large Muslim organisations and Muslim leaders advocate that narrative. To jump through hoops, with a pretty smile on my face, so that a common humanity is recognised.\n\nWhen a terrorist incident occurs overseas, Australian Muslim women modify their behaviour in public and restrict their participation in public spaces.\n\nAt all times, we remain acutely aware of our safety and the safety of our children in public.\n\nThe food we eat, where we live, our relationship: they are all heavily politicised, lest of all our bodies and our dress.\n\nThis is our normal. This is our reality. As is the acceptance that we are politically disposable. We are entirely aware that we are a form of political currency, the value of which is dictated by the context.\n\nFor Hanson, it was the star attraction in a stunt more closely resembling a year 12 muck-up day prank.\n\nSenator George Brandis has been congratulated for (finally) calling out Ms Hanson's hate speech; but he is not an anti-racism hero.\n\nEven in his condemnation of Ms Hanson, he stressed that every single head of intelligence and Australian Federal Police commissioner has stressed how vital Australian Muslims are to Australia's national security. Time and time again, Muslims are viewed purely though a prism of security, where we are policed, our belonging questioned and our loyalties demanded.\n\nThe default position is to suspect us unless we have demonstrated our loyalty against an ever shifting line in the sand.\n\nMany prominent Muslim advocates and \"leaders\" contribute to this binary to further their own agendas.\n\nThey should take heed of the comments made by Brandis: \"that it is consistent with being a good law abiding citizen and a strict adherent Muslim\".\n\nI was not surprised to watch Ms Hanson play dress-up, nor her dressing down by Brandis. Using our Parliament as an act of political theatre was not invented by Ms Hanson; nor will she be the last actor on its stage.\n\nIt is surprising that Brandis and Co are that shocked over Hanson's stunt. How could they expect anything less?\n\nThe political leadership in this country has allowed the cultivation and festering of the conditions that gave birth to Ms Hanson and her supporters.\n\nIt is far easier condemning dangerous right-wing ideology when it comes from outside your own political party.\n\nThe risk is that when the Senate resumes, the underlying racism that is fuelling this fire will still be burning. It is a fire that threatens to disintegrate the bonds that bind us as Australians.\n\nIronically, Ms Hanson demonstrated that the very security reforms she is erroneously pushing are effective and adaptable.\n\nMs Hanson was processed through the security checkpoints inside Parliament House and had her identification confirmed before entering Parliament.\n\nIn a strange and glorious twist of fate, Hanson demonstrated that a woman's choice of dress does not impede their ability to participate in our Parliament and contribute to the process of democratic decision-making.\n\nMs Hanson gave hope to little Hijabis and Niqaabis everywhere. Of course, little Hijabis and Niqaabis already know that.\n\nIt was more of a lesson for those who doubted it in the first place.", "id": "9824076", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Pauline Hanson's burka stunt disproved her point: you can safely wear a burka in Parliament", "image": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/8817210-1x1-700x700.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "12", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Law"}, "id": "302557", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Politics"}, "id": "302948", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Political party"}, "id": "303038", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee"}, "id": "303062", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"}, {"label": {"eng": "Culture"}, "id": "303325", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}, {"label": {"eng": "Religion"}, "id": "303332", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"}, {"label": {"eng": "Citizenship"}, "id": "303514", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "id": "303629", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"}, {"label": {"eng": "Civilization"}, "id": "304533", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}, "id": "304537", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric"}, {"label": {"eng": "Theatre"}, "id": "304633", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"}, {"label": {"eng": "Narrative"}, "id": "304929", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "State school"}, "id": "305633", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"}, {"label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}, "id": "305776", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech"}, {"label": {"eng": "National security"}, "id": "305998", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security"}, {"label": {"eng": "Caricature"}, "id": "306041", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caricature"}, {"label": {"eng": "Leadership"}, "id": "307628", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pauline Hanson"}, "id": "318133", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Hanson"}, {"label": {"eng": "George Brandis"}, "id": "363884", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Brandis"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 121, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Women"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 276, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 643, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Islam", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Islam"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 811, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders"}], "time": "00:36:00"}

risk here, we need to address it,\" Ms Hanson said.\n\n\"The burka is not accepted by the majority of Australians, they find it confronting and they don't want the burka.\"\n\nShe claimed the garment was \"not Australian\" and that wearing it \"is incompatible with our culture and our way of life\".\n\n\"If people want to live in a country wearing the full burka, which is not a religious requirement, then go back to an Islamic country where you can wear that,\" she said.\n\nThere are around half a million people of Islamic faith living in Australia and her call for a ban on the burka was met with a swift rebuttal from her fellow parliamentarians.\n\nThe country's attorney-general, George Brandis, said the government had no plans to introduce a ban and criticised her actions.\n\n\"To ridicule that community, to drive it into a corner, to mock its religious garments, is an appalling thing to do and I would ask you to reflect on what you have done,\" Mr Brandis said.\n\nMs Hanson is the leader of Australia's One Nation party, which is anti-Muslim and anti-immigration.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News, she claimed her identity was not checked before she went into parliament and said terrorists could use burkas to avoid detection.\n\nBut her statement contradicts that of Australia's senate president, Stephen Parry, who said her identity was confirmed before she entered the chamber.\n\nMs Hanson blamed political correctness for Australia's unwillingness to introduce a burka ban as, she claimed, many other countries around the world have already done.\n\nShe also rejected claims her actions were a stunt to raise her profile and reinforce her reputation with her base in Queensland.\n\n\"It was proving a point,\" she said. \"It was lack of security.\"\n\nShe said she had no problem with women wearing hijab as their faces were visible.", "id": "9740233", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Oz senator defends burka stunt after

But it was probably a good thing that this woman was allowed to stay and hear the reaction of virtually every other MP to her outrageous mockery of Islam. Indeed she had probably been hoping that she would be expelled, which would have allowed her to claim she had been victimized.\n\nInstead after she had delivered a stumbling speech endeavoring to justify her conduct and calling for the burqa to be banned, she was exposed to withering criticism from all sides of the house.\n\nThe condemnation was led by the government's Attorney General George Brandis. The Australian parliament is known for the scathing comments and rudeness that members dish out to each other. Yet however much anger and contempt he may have felt for Hanson's wicked piece of theater, Brandis was notably moderate in his response, but that very moderation gave his words extra power.\n\nHe said that the racist politician's actions had risked the more than half a million Muslims in Australia's population. To ridicule this community, to mock its religious garments was an appalling conduct and he suggested she reflect on what she had done. He concluded by telling her that the government of Malcolm Turnbull in which he served had no intention of banning the burqa.\n\nHanson, who had sat awkwardly throughout Brandis' dignified skewering of her insulting stunt and objectionable racist policies, then had to endure a rare demonstration of parliamentary unity when all opposition politicians joined government members in standing and applauding the attorney-general's words.\n\nThere is an argument that the election of bigots like Hanson, Gert Wilders in the Netherlands and Marine Le Pen in France has the benefit of exposing the contorted, ugly face of intolerance for all the world to see. Their poisonous propaganda when exposed to public view in national legislatures can be seen for the disfiguring threat it poses to all decent and civilized values. Had Hanson been thrown out of the chamber in Canberra she would have carped on about her right of free speech. Perhaps she was so hesitant in delivering her bile-filled speech against the wearing of the burqa because she had not expected she would be given the opportunity to make it.\n\nBut there is one still very recent lesson from a Europe that prided itself on its sophistication and political maturity, which cannot be ignored. Hitler's Nazi party came to power through the ballot box and in and out of parliament it made no secret of its hatred for Jews. Democracies wring their hands about the right of free speech and insist that even the most deplorable views deserve to be heard. But who would now deny that if there had been an undemocratic way to stop Hitler's Nazis from seizing power and replacing democracy with dictatorship, it should have been taken?", "id": "9813093", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Islamophobic mockery in Australia", "image": "http://saudigazette.com.sa/themes/saudigazette/images/no-image.png", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "74", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "166", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Canberra"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "71684", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra", "label": {"eng": "Canberra"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Politics"}, "id": "302948", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Politician"}, "id": "302954", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician"}, {"label": {"eng": "Member of Parliament"}, "id": "302970", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament"}, {"location": null, "score": 1, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Marine Le Pen"}, "id": "303052", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Le_Pen"}, {"label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}, "id": "303091", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Religion"}, "id": "303332", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"}, {"label": {"eng": "Clothing"}, "id": "303653", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}, "id": "303910", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}, "id": "305776", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech"}, {"label": {"eng": "Malcolm Turnbull"}, "id": "307738", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull"}, {"label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}, "id": "308102", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adolf Hitler"}, "id": "311203", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler"}, {"label": {"eng": "Burqa"}, "id": "311238", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}, "id": "313196", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Political philosophy"}, "id": "315717", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_philosophy"}, {"label": {"eng": "One Nation (Australia)"}, "id": "318130", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation_(Australia)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pauline Hanson"}, "id": "318133", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Hanson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Geert Wilders"}, "id": "342582", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geert_Wilders"}, {"location": null, "score": 1, "id": "349815", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party", "label": {"eng": "Nazi Party"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "George Brandis"}, "id": "363884", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Brandis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Parliament of Australia"}, "id": "365957", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam in Australia"}, "id": "449690", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Australia"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 276, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 414, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1207, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures"}], "time": "03:01:00"}

Ms Hanson, who has ferociously campaigned against multiculturalism, took her seat during question time wearing a full burqa ahead of a debate on banning full-face coverings in public.\n\nPoliticians and senators were united in condemning the political stunt as religious mockery.\n\n\"To mock its religious garment is an appalling thing to do and I would ask you to reflect on what you've done,\" Attorney-General George Brandis told Ms Hanson before she removed the burqa and left the chamber with it in hand.\n\nThe former fish and chip shop owner and Dancing with the Stars finalist has become infamous for her political stunts and controversial remarks, some of which critics have labelled racist.\n\nShe first came to prominence after she was disendorsed as a Liberal candidate in 1996 for making racist comments about Aboriginal Australians but secured a victory in the Queensland lower house seat of Oxley anyway because she still appeared on the ballot paper.\n\nIt was during her maiden speech to Parliament in 1996 that she uttered her now infamous words: \"I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians\".\n\n\"They have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate,\" Ms Hanson continued.\n\n\"Of course, I will be called racist but, if I can invite whom I want into my home, then I should have the right to have a say in who comes into my country.\n\n\"A truly multicultural country can never be strong or united.\"\n\nBut that was just the beginning.\n\nMs Hanson later appeared in an interview on 60 Minutes when reporter Tracey Curro asked her if she was xenophobic.\n\n\"Please explain?\" she responded.\n\nThe remark became a popular catchphrase that is still used by Australians today. It was also appropriated by satirical character Pauline Pantsdown, played by Simon Hunt, in the song I Don't Like It, which reached the Australian Top 10 charts.\n\nThe following year, Ms Hanson made a video to be released to the public in the event of her assassination. She feared her stance on immigration put her life in danger after launching a new political party, One Nation, in 1997.\n\n\"Fellow Australians, if you are seeing me now it means that I have been murdered,\" Ms Hanson said staring down the barrel of the camera.\n\n\"Do not let my passing distract you even for a moment. For the sake of our children and our children's children, you must fight on.\"\n\nThe \"voice from the grave\" video came after Prime Minister John Howard had been advised to wear a bulletproof vest as he spoke in rural Victoria because of his tough new gun policy in the wake of the Port Arthur massacre. Ms Hanson's video was subsequently derided as a cheap political stunt.\n\nMs Hanson described South African migrants to Australia as having AIDS during a statement about returning to politics following a hiatus.\n\n\"We're bringing in people from South Africa at the moment. There's a huge amount coming into Australia, who have diseases; they've got AIDS,\" she said in 2006.\n\n\"They are of no benefit to this country whatsoever; they'll never be able to work. And what my main concern is: is the diseases that they're bringing in and yet no one is saying or doing anything about it.\"\n\nMs Hanson heralded her political comeback in 2016 by warning Australia was at risk of being \"swamped by Muslims\".\n\nIt was a reference to her maiden speech to Parliament in 1996, in which she made the same claim about Asians.\n\nThe One Nation leader repeated her call for a ban on Muslim immigration and warned Australians would eventually be forced to live under sharia law if something did not change.\n\n\"We are in danger of being swamped by Muslims who bear a culture and ideology that is incompatible with our own,\" she said.\n\nMs Hanson again raised eyebrows when she incorrectly declared there was \"no definition to an Aboriginal\".\n\n\"You know, there's no definition to an Aboriginal,\" Ms Hanson said in a 2016 interview on the Bolt Report.\n\n\"If you marry an Aboriginal, you can be classified as an Aboriginal.\n\n\"Or if the community or the elders accept you into that community, you can be defined as an Aboriginal.\n\n\"And that's not good enough, because then if you make a comment about it, well what are you - are you an Aboriginal, or not an Aboriginal?\"\n\nThe Federal Government defines an Aboriginal person as someone of Aboriginal descent, who identifies as Aboriginal and is accepted as such by the community in which they live.\n\nMs Hanson called for a debate into the definition.\n\nMs Hanson was last year forced to address rumours she was fixated on US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe accusations came after she revealed she had secured tickets to the US President's inauguration and gushed that \"I can see in Donald Trump a lot of me and what I stand for in Australia ... I think he's great\".\n\nShe later tweeted: \"Mr President my door will always be open.\"\n\nHer praise was so effusive she told Karl Stefanovic on Channel 9's Today: \"I swear to God I don't have a

Ms Hanson, who has ferociously campaigned against multiculturalism, took her seat during question time wearing a full burqa ahead of a debate on banning full-face coverings in public.\n\nPoliticians and senators were united in condemning the political stunt as religious mockery.\n\n\"To mock its religious garment is an appalling thing to do and I would ask you to reflect on what you've done,\" Attorney-General George Brandis told Ms Hanson before she removed the burqa and left the chamber with it in hand.\n\nThe former fish and chip shop owner and Dancing with the Stars finalist has become infamous for her political stunts and controversial remarks, some of which critics have labelled racist.\n\nShe first came to prominence after she was disendorsed as a Liberal candidate in 1996 for making racist comments about Aboriginal Australians but secured a victory in the Queensland lower house seat of Oxley anyway because she still appeared on the ballot paper.\n\nIt was during her maiden speech to Parliament in 1996 that she uttered her now infamous words: \"I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians\".\n\n\"They have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate,\" Ms Hanson continued.\n\n\"Of course, I will be called racist but, if I can invite whom I want into my home, then I should have the right to have a say in who comes into my country.\n\n\"A truly multicultural country can never be strong or united.\"\n\nMs Hanson later appeared in an interview on 60 Minutes when reporter Tracey Curro asked her if she was xenophobic.\n\n\"Please explain?\" she responded.\n\nThe remark became a popular catchphrase that is still used by Australians today. It was also appropriated by satirical character Pauline Pantsdown, played by Simon Hunt, in the song I Don't Like It, which reached the Australian Top 10 charts.\n\n'IF YOU ARE SEEING ME NOW IT MEANS I'VE BEEN MURDERED'\n\nThe following year, Ms Hanson made a video to be released to the public in the event of her assassination. She feared her stance on immigration put her life in danger after launching a new political party, One Nation, in 1997.\n\n\"Fellow Australians, if you are seeing me now it means that I have been murdered,\" Ms Hanson said staring down the barrel of the camera.\n\n\"Do not let my passing distract you even for a moment. For the sake of our children and our children's children, you must fight on.\"\n\nThe \"voice from the grave'' video came after Prime Minister John Howard had been advised to wear a bulletproof vest as he spoke in rural Victoria because of his tough new gun policy in the wake of the Port Arthur massacre. Ms Hanson's video was subsequently derided as a cheap political stunt.\n\n'THEY'VE GOT AIDS'\n\nMs Hanson described South African migrants to Australia as having AIDS during a statement about returning to politics following a hiatus.\n\n\"We're bringing in people from South Africa at the moment. There's a huge amount coming into Australia, who have diseases; they've got AIDS,\" she said in 2006.\n\n\"They are of no benefit to this country whatsoever; they'll never be able to work. And what my main concern is: is the diseases that they're bringing in and yet no one is saying or doing anything about it.\"\n\n'WE ARE IN DANGER OF BEING SWAMPED BY MUSLIMS'\n\nMs Hanson heralded her political comeback in 2016 by warning Australia was at risk of being \"swamped by Muslims\".\n\nIt was a reference to her maiden speech to Parliament in 1996, in which she made the same claim about Asians.\n\nThe One Nation leader repeated her call for a ban on Muslim immigration and warned Australians would eventually be forced to live under sharia law if something did not change.\n\n\"We are in danger of being swamped by Muslims who bear a culture and ideology that is incompatible with our own,\" she said.\n\n'THERE'S NO DEFINITION OF WHAT AN ABORIGINAL PERSON IS'\n\nMs Hanson again raised eyebrows when she incorrectly declared there was \"no definition to an Aboriginal\".\n\n\"You know, there's no definition to an Aboriginal,\" Ms Hanson said in a 2016 interview on the Bolt Report.\n\n\"If you marry an Aboriginal, you can be classified as an Aboriginal.\n\n\"Or if the community or the elders accept you into that community, you can be defined as an Aboriginal.\n\n\"And that's not good enough, because then if you make a comment about it, well what are you -- are you an Aboriginal, or not an Aboriginal?\"\n\nThe Federal Government defines an Aboriginal person as someone of Aboriginal descent, who identifies as Aboriginal and is accepted as such by the community in which they live.\n\nMs Hanson called for a debate into the definition.\n\nMs Hanson was last year forced to address rumours she was fixated on US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe accusations came after she revealed she had secured tickets to the US President's inauguration and gushed that \"I can see in Donald Trump a lot of me and what I stand for in Australia ... I think he's great\".\n\nShe later tweeted: \"Mr President my door will always be open.\"\n\nHer praise was so effusive she told Karl Stefanovic on Channel 9's Today: \"I swear to God I don't have a crush on Donald Trump\".", "id": "9658436", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Crazy Hanson moments you forgot about", "image":

It has become an article of faith among coalition strategists that One Nation is to be respected and tolerated, irrespective of how offensive its politics becomes.\n\nPerhaps that's why Hanson did it. Like a toddler whose poor behaviour is ignored by its parents, Senator Hanson is forced to engage in ever more outlandish stunts as a means of gaining our attention.\n\nComparisons are already being drawn with Julia Gillard's misogyny speech. These should be ignored. Gillard's speech was in defence of Peter Slipper, the discredited former speaker to whom Gillard's faltering minority government was entirely beholden. It was a cynical exercise in political survival, not a heartfelt expression of principle.\n\nBrandis's speech was directed against a key government ally, someone whom the government must do business with if it's to pass its legislative agenda. It's difficult to see what Brandis or the government had to gain in attacking Hanson.\n\nIn decrying Hanson's mockery of Islam -- for that is what it was -- Brandis drew from the deepest traditions of classical liberalism, for which freedom of religion is a core tenet.\n\nIn this sense he distinguished mainstream political conservatism from the rabble-rousing conservatism of the populist right. For this alone Brandis deserves praise.\n\nThe populist right might make a show of their love of freedom, but when it comes to defending one of its core elements -- freedom of worship -- their conviction always seems to stop shy of the mosque gate. This is no freedom at all.\n\nSenator Hanson's burka stunt was notionally about national security, but this is of course is rubbish. There is no threat to national security that cannot be managed with sensible screening procedures.\n\nFor the populist right the burka is a Trojan horse; a device through which a larger anti-Islamic agenda can be smuggled into public life.\n\nTo its credit, One Nation makes no bones of this. It is upfront about calling for a ban on Muslim migration.\n\nBut others are not quite so honest and it was this anti-Muslim xenophobia that Brandis identified in the Senate yesterday. The truth is Senator Hanson couldn't give a toss about the burka. It's Muslims she's after.\n\n'Pauline Hanson couldn't give a toss about the burka. It was Muslims she was after.'\n\nSome have said Brandis overreacted to Hanson's provocations. But what else was he supposed to do?\n\nBrandis is the head of the government in the senate.

It either represents the interests of Australia's Muslim community or it does not.\n\nIt is possible to deplore the burka as an instrument of female oppression, as I do, but respect the right of women to wear it.\n\nThis is another thing that separates Burkean conservatives from the populist right -- the latter sees the law as a convenient means of expressing their disapproval while the former sees it as an intrusion into individual liberty whose power must be used sparingly.\n\nBrandis didn't overreact to Hanson's stunt.

Senator Hanson does not speak for me or Australians. The Attorney-General was right to point out that she and her attention-seeking antics are a real threat to our national security.\n\nWilliam Chandler, Surrey Hills\n\nWalk a mile in another's shoes\n\nSo Senator Hanson proves it's safe for a woman to choose to wear a burqa into our Parliament, good for her! Now I would like to see her walk round an area that has a high number of One Nation supporters dressed like that and with no TV or security so she can experience what her followers are like to Muslim Australians.\n\nDoug Steley, Heyfield\n\nResponse was an overreaction\n\nGeorge Brandis' response to Pauline Hanson's Senate stunt was somewhat of an overreaction. Parliament is not the place to take the mickey out of someone's religious clothing, but should we in a liberal society allow for a little mockery to be made about the attire religious people wear on some occasions? One only has to go into a fancy dress shop and you can hire the full range of garments there for a whole variety of faiths.\n\nHenk van Leeuwen, Elwood\n\nAdvertisement Dress based on conviction\n\nFor 45 years I have covered myself in the modest clothing of an Orthodox Jewish woman. I am luckier than Muslim wearers of the burqa, niqab and hijab in that my garments don't single me out for verbal abuse or worse. However, we are united in that our style of dress is based on personal religious conviction, practice of which is permitted and protected in Australia. Pauline Hanson's empty charade is offensive to anyone of either sex who demonstrates faith by their clothing choice.\n\nElizabeth Morris, Elsternwick\n\nYou will now receive updates from Breaking News Alert Breaking News Alert\n\nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy .\n\nAdvocate for women's rights\n\nSenator Hanson may have become an accidental advocate for women's rights. Knowingly or not she has spearheaded the issue of women's health, identity and sexuality right into Australia's centre stage. A covered face is an identity stripped away and oppresses self expression. Australia has come so far with the progression of women's rights, the wearing of head and face coverings pulls us back a thousand years. Senator Hanson was unfairly accused of disrespecting a religious minority. Open honest and respectful debate needs to happen now.\n\nSusan Gay, Lake Wendouree\n\nBrandis to be congratulated\n\nGeorge Brandis is to be congratulated for showing leadership against Hanson's offensive stunt. It's unfortunate he and others have not also spoken out against the anti-Muslim \"dog-whistle\" and the government's proposed citizenship changes, both of which are more sophisticated attempts to marginalise Muslims with far more serious consequences.\n\nSusie Latham, Preston\n\nHanson challenges Parliament\n\nI commend Pauline for her burquest stunt. The automatic outrage was predictable. She had challenged the Parliament to think about the problem, and the response was: \"It's too difficult for us. We are only simple parliamentarians.\" And the House returned to its usual shambles.\n\nPaul Drakeford, Kew\n\nShame on Liberals for not standing\n\nCongratulations to the Labor Party and crossbench senators for endorsing Attorney-General Brandis, by giving him a standing ovation. Shame no Liberal stood, and very few managed to clap. Could it be they don't want to lose Pauline Hanson's vote?\n\nRon Reynolds, Templestowe\n\nTHE FORUM Glimmer of hope\n\nIn the same week I have found myself supporting an opinion piece by Amanda Vanstone and a speech by George Brandis. I'm not sure which parallel universe I have entered but it appears there is at least a glimmer of hope in this one.\n\nSteve Roddis, Ringwood East\n\nClash of symbols\n\nHow is our national celebration of Australia Day different from the statues in the US celebrating the institution of slavery? Both are deeply hurtful to the people who are targeted; both prolong that hurt by continually flaunting it before them. It's time to quietly abandon such outdated, insensitive and divisive symbols. When we become a republic in our own right (hopefully before our head of state is King Charles - out-dated, un-Australian symbols, indeed), we can have an Australia Day that includes every Australian citizen.\n\nRose Marie Crowe, Ormond\n\nWe know better\n\nSuch was our collective blindness to Aboriginal culture and history, our ignorance or denial of the facts about our dispossession and oppression of them, and our apparent lack of concern for their feelings, our leaders probably did not consider their perspective when they chose the national day.\n\nBut we know better now.\n\nThe recent Uluru Statement by Indigenous leaders is one of the most inspiring yet tragically honest self-assessments of their plight and the hope they hold for constitutional recognition or treaty to improve their position. If, as a result of our listening, one outcome is to change the date of our national celebration, it should cause no great offence to us as the majority. It may give comfort to these brothers and sisters who are offended by the celebration of January 26, 1788.\n\nPat Love, Newport\n\nDivisive day\n\nNo, Mr Turnbull, January 26 does not unite us. It divides us. It commemorates the day Europeans took the land of Indigenous Australians without even recognising their existence. And they are expected to celebrate this? In years to come, when we have changed the date, we will ask: How could we have been so insensitive?\n\nRobert Salter, Clifton Hill\n\nLaw without force\n\nMandatory reporting of confessions to priests of child sexual abuse might seem a way of stopping this repugnant and damaging crime and changing the misuse of a ritual which allows paedophiles to feel better about their actions. But, sadly, such a law may be unenforceable, will almost certainly be self-defeating, and it would create an undesirable legal precedent to which no one seems to have given thought.\n\nIf a priest did not accept the state's authority in the matter, how would you know he had heard something? And what is to prevent abusers from confessor-shopping? Or finding a darker confessional, not in their parish?\n\nEven if priests were universally co-operative, what paedophile would confess where exposure was a certainty?\n\nA legal rubicon will be crossed if the mandate is legislated: the government will be making a law regarding the conduct of religion, something I don't think has been done before in Australia. We lack a bill of rights guaranteeing, among other things, freedom of religion, even if it is to have none. And how to justify mandating only with child abuse?\n\nLet's hope this is just a signal from the royal commission for the church hierarchy to toughen up and change the ritual to \"absolution only after submission to a supervised program of atonement and restitution\" for child abusers.\n\nBrian McGuire, Glen Waverley\n\nEnergy profiteers\n\nThe energy retail sector review ('State paying far too much for its power', The Age, 14/8) is the first high-level bipartisan acknowledgment of full retail competition being bad public policy, wrongly adopted and retained by successive Victorian governments. Energy Minister Lily D'Ambrosio's initial response \"there's something wrong with our system\" misses the mark. The energy retail system was designed and belongs to the privatised energy industry: it's their system, not ours. It was built fit for their purpose, to maximise profits. It needs replacing with a system designed to deliver affordable, accessible, safe, secure, quality energy supplies operated in the public interest.\n\nCheryl Wragg, Moe\n\nWrong lovesong\n\nKevin Donnelly ('This is why I'll be saying 'no', The Age, 18/8) in arguing for the centrality of heterosexual marriage to family and culture quotes T.S. Eliot, who is a strange choice. Eliot never once visited his first wife when she was hospitalised for years; he conducted two long-term affairs, declining to marry the women, then married his 30-year-old editor when he was 70, writing smutty poems about the advantages of being a short man to his tall wife. He had no children - all in all, T. S. Eliot was hardly a poster boy for family.\n\nMary Cahill, Brunswick\n\nIt won't go away\n\nEven if the non-binding opinion poll of some Australians results in a \"no\" vote, which leads to not having a conscience vote by our elected representatives in Canberra, does anybody really think that this issue will just go away?\n\nEldert De Graaf, Wheelers Hill\n\nMuddled thinking\n\nIt is truly astonishing that Kevin Donnelly still thinks being gay is a life \"choice\". To support this he cites census figures suggesting that about 2 per cent of the population are gay. This is very questionable evidence indeed, but even if accurate it means that hundreds of million people globally are homosexual: clearly it is natural and as such not a choice.\n\nDonnelly makes much of the fact that gay couples can't have children. We all know this, but we shouldn't worry: the human race is not presently in danger of extinction and if it is it won't be because of gay marriage. Donnelly stresses the \"special union of body and soul\" that is marriage. But every time the beauty of marriage is advanced in support of its traditional form, one has to wonder why this gift should be denied gay people.\n\nFinally on whose authority should the \"unique ritual\" and \"sacred compact\" that is marriage be confined to one section of the population, even if it is the majority? Is the spontaneous expression and ritual consecration of love to be circumscribed by arbitrary rule and custom?\n\nMichael Read, Ashburton\n\nChanging city\n\nRather than being purely profit driven, good governance must attain an appropriate balance between competing interests and outcomes.\n\nHowever, as a result of foreign developers and purchasers buying as much as 40 per cent of all new apartments in Melbourne as reported in The Age (15/8), we are undergoing an unprecedented population boom that is having a severe impact on the city's infrastructure, housing affordability and unique character. The \"canyons\" of large towers are obliterating the marvellous qualities experienced in the city until recent times, not the least being a diverse variety heritage precincts, a greater degree of human-scale and pedestrian comfort, and more interesting building form to complement the open spaces and celebrated laneway culture.\n\nGary Bateman, North Melbourne\n\nNot about safety\n\nI just don't accept the excuse of Alyssa's special school in St Albans ('Locked gate keeps family apart', The Age, 18/8) that it's about children's safety. Its response ranges from a lack of imagination to outright ignorance and obstruction.\n\nJanny Ryan, Carlton\n\nLook into banks\n\nIs the government so flush with funds that it can have a postal survey on same-sex marriage costing $120 million when it's not compulsory, not binding and still needs to go back to Parliament for a vote? Wouldn't it be more productive spending the money on a royal commission into the banking industry?\n\nGiuseppe Corda, Aspendale\n\nWhere's the train?\n\nSo the paddocks of Truganina are to be transformed into the \"Glen Waverley of Melbourne's west\", but without the guarantee of a railway station when the residents move in. ('The new view from the fringe', The Age, 16/8) Perhaps if less infrastructure money from the state's coffers had been spent removing level crossings that aren't really dangerous or congested, a station could be provided.\n\nRoss Bardin, Williamstown\n\nAND ANOTHER THING Pauline Hanson\n\nPauline; it is so easy to propagate hate and fear; you will always have a following.\n\nGary Bryfman, Brighton\n\nBan the burqua-wearing senator.\n\nGreg Bradshaw, Dandenong North\n\nWell done Pauline. You've actually proven that wearing a burqua poses no undue threat.\n\nSteve Melzer, Hughesdale\n\nAmazing how much Pauline Hanson revealed about herself while covered in a burqa.\n\nLawrence Habegger, Ballarat\n\nPauline by name, appauline by nature.\n\nNick Neary, Armadale\n\nIt is obvious Pauline Hanson's chosen method of dress had prevented her from seeing how far she had overstepped the mark.\n\nBarbara Abell, Ringwood North\n\nFirst Amanda Vanstone (Monday), then George Brandis (Thursday): this Greens voter starts to like the Liberals.\n\nEd Castenmiller, Airport West\n\nSenator Brandis once said \"people have a right to be bigoted\". Or has Hanson's bigotry gone too far George?\n\nIan Dale, Rosebud\n\nOther matters\n\nGerard Ridsdale would have to live longer than Methuselah in order to serve enough jail time for his abhorrent heinous crimes.\n\nMartin de Boerr, Coburg\n\nA former Tattersalls boss chairing an AFL working party on pokies? Talk about putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank.\n\nLindsay Zoch, East Melbourne\n\nAustralia became a nation on May 27, 1967. What other time have 90 per cent of Australians agreed on one issue? This should be Australia Day.\n\nMatthew Digby, Prince's Hill\n\nFinally\n\nAlmost all lower house MPs entered Parliament with disposable coffee cups.

Those who see in Senator Hanson someone willing to speak their minds, and voice their fears, congratulated her. These supporters won't be found in most newsrooms, boardrooms, corporate offices, political party rooms or other spaces of power in Australia. There are probably few in Canberra, insulated as it can be from regional grievances.\n\nHer stunt resonated with her base, impatient with financial and cultural elites that Hanson supporters believe have tilted the odds against them and robbed them of control over their destiny. This is only more troubling because so few of Senator Hanson's critics are likely to know just where her theatrics were welcomed, and why. Most of the nation is talking across One Nation's supporters. On their part, Hansonites despise what they see as the arrogance and naivety of opponents who shout down their racist slurs, a response they see as the muzzle of \"political correctness\".\n\nIn the crossfire of this battle are Muslims living in Australia. There can be no mistake: the onslaught of grubby tabloid smears, misinformed public attacks and unwarranted hostility not only besiege and marginalise Muslims in this country. They also do nothing to make Australia safer; in fact, they do the opposite. ASIO head Duncan Lewis has made clear how pivotal his agency's relationship with Muslim communities is to protect national security. To use words from Liberal senator George Brandis' commendable speech on Thursday, driving Muslims into a corner will only damage the country's counterterrorism efforts.\n\nAside from its obvious offensiveness, Senator Hanson's burqa stunt and the case she made against Islam afterwards were riddled with nonsense and irrationality. First, most victims of terrorism are actually Muslims. The so-called Islamic State has made massacres against Shi'ite Muslims a priority, and the Global Terrorism Index ranks Iraq as the country worst-affected by terror, followed by Afghanistan, Nigeria, Pakistan and Syria. All are Muslim-majority countries.\n\nSecond, Islam does not make its followers more likely to be fundamentalists, just as being white is not in itself the cause of neo-Nazism and ethnic supremacism. Extremism is caused by other forces, largely economic and political. Both these points bear repeating every time Senator Hanson attacks Muslims.\n\nHer power lies in that base she performed her stunt for. Unless she implodes - which is not unlikely - those voters will keep listening to her. How the rest of Australia handles that is another question, but it could start by doing what it can to show that Senator Hanson's actions are nothing about Australia's security or the harmony of its communities. She only wants to keep her political stocks high.", "id": "9847967", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Burqa stunt harms national security, but helps Hanson", "image":

He said what all of us were feeling.\n\nBut as attention-grabbing as her stunt may have been, there was nothing particularly original about Hanson's little game of dress-ups: even her attempt at mockery is plagiarised. Burqas have been a favourite costume at far-right rallies throughout the world for years. If Hanson continues to go down this path, we can expect she and her fellow One Nation senators to stage ISIS-style \"mock\" executions in the Parliament House forecourt by this time next week.\n\nAs always, Muslim women feel obligated to respond to these insults by explaining (again) why we do not represent a threat to the safety of the Australian public - while noting the infinitely small proportion of Muslim women who actually cover their faces in Australia.\n\nAnyone who doesn't know this by now has made a deliberate choice not to listen.\n\nThis is all so very, very familiar that it's difficult to generate any shock value. Why, then, has Hanson's little routine made such an impact?\n\nThe shock is not that she mocked Australia's Muslim community. That's absolutely routine. It's difficult to imagine that George \"people have the right to be bigots\" Brandis would have been moved to tears over the offence caused to the Muslim women of Australia.\n\nNo - the shock is that Hanson mocked the national Parliament by using it as a stage for her own alt-right pantomime.\n\nMuslim women are more than used to mockery, to being made the national punching bag at regular intervals.

Yes. Is it getting my message across?

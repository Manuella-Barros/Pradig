They claimed, in a period spanning 2022 and 2023, that Pearson sexually harassed Marmara's chief of staff, Sgt. Roxanne Ludemann and blocked her promotion. He then allegedly used his power in the NYPD and City Hall to dead-end her career and two police colleagues who backed her.\n\nMarmara, now the No. 2 in Patrol Borough Brooklyn North, reveals in his N.Y. Supreme Court lawsuit that despite claims to the contrary from the Adams administration, NYPD brass and top administration officials were aware of Ludemann's allegations and Pearson's alleged retaliation because Marmara documented it.\n\nThe lawsuit also includes allegations that go beyond the conflict inside the MSA. It alleges Pearson was once the subject of a criminal complaint for sexual abuse filed by a female Queens pastor. It also claims without offering a source that he was fired from his job as security director at the Resorts World Casino in Queens for \"sexual improprieties.\"\n\nBut it remains unclear whether City Hall or the NYPD has ever interviewed Pearson about the allegations against him, the lawsuit claims.\n\nMarmara, meanwhile, is portrayed in the suit as a by-the-book commander forced to contend with a ruthless superior who used his power in the NYPD and at City Hall to cripple the careers of his accusers.\n\n\"I love police work, having a positive impact. It's an honorable profession. Honor and integrity are very important to me,\" Marmara told the Daily News. \"I was trying to protect the mayor from an unprofessional person like Pearson and all my people get destroyed.\"\n\nThe suit discloses that the chief also kept the mayor's brother, Bernard Adams, apprised of Pearson's alleged conduct before and after Bernard stepped down as director of the mayor's security in February 2023.\n\n\"Senior officials in both the Mayor's office and the NYPD were aware of Tim Pearson's sexual misconduct but chose to ignore it to avoid displeasing Mayor Adams,\" said Marmara's lawyer John Scola. \"This alarming lack of leadership and systemic failure has jeopardized the safety of all female employees in the city. It has also enabled Pearson to misuse the NYPD as his personal tool of retaliation.\"\n\nAllegations denied\n\nAmaris Cockfield, a spokeswoman for Adams, did not reply to a list of questions from The News but said the lawsuit will be reviewed.\n\n\"Our administration holds employees to the highest ethical standards and we take these allegations seriously,\" she said.\n\nJohn Flannery, a private lawyer hired by the city to represent Pearson, said his client denies all of the \"substantive allegations\" in the now four MSA lawsuits.\n\nFlannery also represent the three other defendants named in the suits - Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey, Chief of Patrol John Chell and Internal Affairs Inspector Joseph Profeta.\n\n\"Facts matter and the facts will show that this individual was removed from his position as a result of his own misconduct, including threatening Mr. Pearson over the speed in which NYPD officers at MSA were being promoted,\" Flannery said.\n\n\"Prior to his removal, neither Deputy Chief Marmara nor the other plaintiffs had ever reported any alleged misconduct by Mr. Pearson to the city or internally to the NYPD as alleged in the complaints,\" he said.\n\n\"Deputy Chief Marmara and the other plaintiffs only reported alleged misconduct after they were the subjects of an NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau investigation into their own misconduct.\"\n\nConflict inside MSA\n\nThe chronology relayed in the lawsuit, however, indicates Marmara was notifying various police and city officials along the way.\n\nMarmara, 55, joined the NYPD in 1992. Over his 32-year career, he rose to commander and led three precincts and a series of borough and special units, earning glowing evaluations and numerous commendations, the suit said. In June 2022, Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Philip Banks hired Marmara as head of MSA, a unit tasked to evaluate the performance of city agencies.\n\nThe hiring was due in part to Marmara's long friendship with Bernard Adams, who was with Banks at the March 2022 job interview for the post, the suit states. The unit worked out of a 16th-floor office at 375 Pearl St. right behind police headquarters.\n\nPearson and Banks, the suit claims, wielded powers long held by the police commissioner. The suit says, for example, Banks controls promotions and assignments for captains and above, while Pearson approved assignments for lieutenants and sergeants.\n\nEvery member of the unit had to sign a nondisclosure agreement which barred them from speaking about its work. Every document was to be stamped with the word \"Draft\" to evade public disclosure laws, according to Marmara's complaint.\n\nAs the month progressed, Ludemann was allegedly fending off advances from Pearson. On Dec. 1, 2022, Marmara saw Pearson rubbing Ludemann's arm during an office party. He notified Bernard Adams one day later saying it was a \"bad look for the mayor,\" and ordered his staff to make sure Pearson was never alone with women in the office, the lawsuit says.\n\nMarmara alleges Bernard Adams told him he had also informed Banks, the suit claims. Bernard told Marmara that Banks didn't want to anger the mayor by providing negative information about Pearson, the lawsuit claims.\n\nMarmara, the lawsuit claims, had been aware of allegations of sexual improprieties against Pearson for at least a decade.\n\nThe most incendiary allegation in the suit involves the female Queens pastor, whose name is being withheld by The News. According to the suit, the pastor told Marmara in 2014 that Pearson -- who had retired from the NYPD by then and was vice president for security at Resorts World Casino in Queens at the time -- was \"overly aggressive and forceful\" with her during a sexual encounter, leading her to file a criminal complaint with police.\n\nMarmara, then head of Queens South Investigations, claims she told him that Pearson manipulated her into bed by claiming he was trying to \"get closer to God.\" Marmara checked his NYPD computer and confirmed she had filed the sexual abuse complaint two days earlier, the lawsuit says.\n\nHis search also showed Pearson had the pastor arrested for allegedly slashing his tires, the lawsuit claims. The pastor denied slashing Pearson's tires and asked for a copy of her sex assault complaint, which Marmara emailed her.\n\nPearson then became aware that Marmara knew of the incident and told him she was \"crazy, abused as a child and has daddy issues,\" the lawsuit alleges.\n\nThe outcome of the pastor's sexual assault claim and Pearson's counter-claim are unclear, the lawsuit says.\n\nThe pastor, who is not identified by name in the lawsuit, did not return messages from The News.\n\nThe lawsuit also claims a factor in Pearson's June 2011 retirement from the NYPD was that he had no chance at promotion to chief because then-Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly had \"shelved\" his career over past sexual misconduct allegations. Kelly did not reply to a text message from The News.\n\nRetired NYPD Chief Wilbur Chapman was a member of the 2011 promotional board. He recalled that Pearson did not perform well in the interview but does not remember any sexual misconduct allegations being raised. The panel recommended against Pearson's promotion and Kelly agreed, Chapman said.\n\nMarmara's lawsuit claims Pearson was actually pushed out of the casino job because of a string of sexual harassment claims filed against him.\n\nThe lawsuit contains no further detail or identifies Marmara's source. A Resorts World spokesperson did not reply to an email from The News.\n\nThe lawsuit also cites the account of a retired female sergeant who claims Pearson repeatedly came on to her in the late 1990s at police headquarters. She filed a harassment complaint against him but nothing came of it, the suit claims.\n\nThe suit also claims Marmara witnessed Pearson make lewd statements or behaving offensively on several occasions, including referring to Asst. Chief Judith Harrison as a \"d -- e b -- h,\" \"howling like a dog\" at women as the chief drove him to Gracie Mansion, and refusing to meet with Finance Commissioner Preston Niblack because Niblack is gay.\n\nAll of these incidents, the lawsuit claims, made Marmara increasingly concerned about Pearson's fitness.\n\nThe conflict between Marmara and Pearson came to a head in March 2023, after Ludemann had been passed over for promotion four times, angering Marmara. He complained repeatedly to Banks and Bernard Adams.\n\nOn April 12, 2023, following a blow-up with Pearson, Marmara was transferred to Brooklyn North. The three cops who have also sued -- Ludemann, retired Sgt. Michael Ferrari, and Lt. George Huang -- were all shunted to lesser uniform posts.\n\nSince then, Marmara alleges he has been targeted for retaliation by Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey and Chief of Patrol John Chell at Pearson's behest.\n\nOn April 13, Marmara was ordered to be \"randomly\" drug tested and called by the head of the office that provides emotional counseling to cops -- both events he paints as retaliatory. He was also called by Oleg Chernyavsky, the police commissioner's chief of staff. Marmara called IAB Chief Miguel Iglesias and informed him.\n\nFrom the end of April into 2024, Maddrey and Chell began accusing him of minor rules breaches, the lawsuit says.\n\nIn November 2023, Marmara was ordered for questioning by Internal Affairs. He texted Investigations Commissioner Jocelyn Stauber to notify her of Pearson's retaliation. His IAB interviewer was Inspector Joseph Profeta, The lawsuit claims Profeta got angry when Marmara attempted to detail Pearson's behavior.\n\nAfter a May 26 police-involved shooting in Brooklyn. Marmara was off duty. But Chell was angry he was not present and complained about borough staffing. Chell then changed Marmara's day tour to nights, the lawsuit says.\n\nMarmara finally filed a retaliation complaint against Maddrey, Chell and Pearson. He texted Police Commissioner Edward Caban, but Caban didn't respond.\n\nOn June 28, Marmara was approached by a lieutenant who claimed Pearson was sexually harassing a female detective, saying she owed Pearson sex for getting her promoted. Marmara reported that as well.\n\nJust 14 days ago, on July 16, Marmara was at a staff meeting chaired by Maddrey. Chell, the lawsuit claims, has evidently learned of the complaint.\n\n\"I don't give a crap about anyone here who filed a complaint against me,\" Chell declared, the suit says. This job is my last spot. If you don't like it you should retire.\"\n\nTwo hours later, Marmara reported that apparent threat.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors":

It has also enabled Pearson to misuse the NYPD as his personal tool of retaliation.\"\n\nAllegations denied\n\nAmaris Cockfield, a spokeswoman for Adams, did not reply to a list of questions from The News but said the lawsuit will be reviewed.\n\n\"Our administration holds employees to the highest ethical standards and we take these allegations seriously,\" she said.\n\nJohn Flannery, a private lawyer hired by the city to represent Pearson, said his client denies all of the \"substantive allegations\" in the now four MSA lawsuits.\n\nFlannery also represent the three other defendants named in the suits - Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey, Chief of Patrol John Chell and Internal Affairs Inspector Joseph Profeta.\n\n\"Facts matter and the facts will show that this individual was removed from his position as a result of his own misconduct, including threatening Mr. Pearson over the speed in which NYPD officers at MSA were being promoted,\" Flannery said.\n\n\"Prior to his removal, neither Deputy Chief Marmara nor the other plaintiffs had ever reported any alleged misconduct by Mr. Pearson to the city or internally to the NYPD as alleged in the complaints,\" he said.\n\n\"Deputy Chief Marmara and the other plaintiffs only reported alleged misconduct after they were the subjects of an NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau investigation into their own misconduct.\"\n\nConflict inside MSA\n\nThe chronology relayed in the lawsuit, however, indicates Marmara was notifying various police and city officials along the way.\n\nMarmara, 55, joined the NYPD in 1992. Over his 32-year career, he rose to commander and led three precincts and a series of borough and special units, earning glowing evaluations and numerous commendations, the suit said. In June 2022, Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Philip Banks hired Marmara as head of MSA, a unit tasked to evaluate the performance of city agencies.\n\nThe hiring was due in part to Marmara's long friendship with Bernard Adams, who was with Banks at the March 2022 job interview for the post, the suit states. The unit worked out of a 16th-floor office at 375 Pearl St. right behind police headquarters.\n\nPearson and Banks, the suit claims, wielded powers long held by the police commissioner. The suit says, for example, Banks controls promotions and assignments for captains and above, while Pearson approved assignments for lieutenants and sergeants.\n\nEvery member of the unit had to sign a nondisclosure agreement which barred them from speaking about its work. Every document was to be stamped with the word \"Draft\" to evade public disclosure laws, according to Marmara's complaint.\n\nAs the month progressed, Ludemann was allegedly fending off advances from Pearson. On Dec. 1, 2022, Marmara saw Pearson rubbing Ludemann's arm during an office party. He notified Bernard Adams one day later saying it was a \"bad look for the mayor,\" and ordered his staff to make sure Pearson was never alone with women in the office, the lawsuit says.\n\nMarmara alleges Bernard Adams told him he had also informed Banks, the suit claims. Bernard told Marmara that Banks didn't want to anger the mayor by providing negative information about Pearson, the lawsuit claims.\n\nMarmara also reached out to Sideya Sherman, the city's chief equity officer, and Wendy Garcia, the NYPD's deputy commissioner for equity and inclusion, the lawsuit says.\n\nPrior claims\n\nMarmara, the lawsuit claims, had been aware of allegations of sexual improprieties against Pearson for at least a decade.\n\nThe most incendiary allegation in the suit involves the female Queens pastor, whose name is being withheld by The News. According to the suit, the pastor told Marmara in 2014 that Pearson -- who had retired from the NYPD by then and was vice president for security at Resorts World Casino in Queens at the time -- was \"overly aggressive and forceful\" with her during a sexual encounter, leading her to file a criminal complaint with police.\n\nMarmara, then head of Queens South Investigations, claims she told him that Pearson manipulated her into bed by claiming he was trying to \"get closer to God.\" Marmara checked his NYPD computer and confirmed she had filed the sexual abuse complaint two days earlier, the lawsuit says.\n\nHis search also showed Pearson had the pastor arrested for allegedly slashing his tires, the lawsuit claims. The pastor denied slashing Pearson's tires and asked for a copy of her sex assault complaint, which Marmara emailed her.\n\nPearson then became aware that Marmara knew of the incident and told him she was \"crazy, abused as a child and has daddy issues,\" the lawsuit alleges.\n\nThe outcome of the pastor's sexual assault claim and Pearson's counter-claim are unclear, the lawsuit says.\n\nThe pastor, who is not identified by name in the lawsuit, did not return messages from The News.\n\nThe lawsuit also claims a factor in Pearson's June 2011 retirement from the NYPD was that he had no chance at promotion to chief because then- Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly had \"shelved\" his career over past sexual misconduct allegations. Kelly did not reply to a text message from The News.\n\nRetired NYPD Chief Wilbur Chapman was a member of the 2011 promotional board. He recalled that Pearson did not perform well in the interview but does not remember any sexual misconduct allegations being raised. The panel recommended against Pearson's promotion and Kelly agreed, Chapman said.\n\nHarassment claims\n\nPearson was then hired at Resorts World. In August 2022, the New York Times reported Pearson was earning salaries from both the city and the casino, a potential conflict of interest. Days later, Pearson gave up the casino job and was eventually put in charge of MSA.\n\nMarmara's lawsuit claims Pearson was actually pushed out of the casino job because of a string of sexual harassment claims filed against him.\n\nThe lawsuit contains no further detail or identifies Marmara's source. A Resorts World spokesperson did not reply to an email from The News.\n\nThe lawsuit also cites the account of a retired female sergeant who claims Pearson repeatedly came on to her in the late 1990s at police headquarters. She filed a harassment complaint against him but nothing came of it, the suit claims.\n\nThe suit also claims Marmara witnessed Pearson make lewd statements or behaving offensively on several occasions, including referring to Asst. Chief Judith Harrison as a \"d -- e b -- h,\" \"howling like a dog\" at women as the chief drove him to Gracie Mansion, and refusing to meet with Finance Commissioner Preston Niblack because Niblack is gay.\n\nAll of these incidents, the lawsuit claims, made Marmara increasingly concerned about Pearson's fitness.\n\nThe conflict between Marmara and Pearson came to a head in March 2023, after Ludemann had been passed over for promotion four times, angering Marmara. He complained repeatedly to Banks and Bernard Adams.\n\nOn April 12, 2023, following a blow-up with Pearson, Marmara was transferred to Brooklyn North. The three cops who have also sued -- Ludemann, retired Sgt. Michael Ferrari, and Lt. George Huang -- were all shunted to lesser uniform posts.\n\nSince then, Marmara alleges he has been targeted for retaliation by Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey and Chief of Patrol John Chell at Pearson's behest.\n\nOn April 13, Marmara was ordered to be \"randomly\" drug tested and called by the head of the office that provides emotional counseling to cops -- both events he paints as retaliatory. He was also called by Oleg Chernyavsky, the police commissioner's chief of staff. Marmara called IAB Chief Miguel Iglesias and informed him.\n\nFrom the end of April into 2024, Maddrey and Chell began accusing him of minor rules breaches, the lawsuit says.\n\nIn November 2023, Marmara was ordered for questioning by Internal Affairs. He texted Investigations Commissioner Jocelyn Stauber to notify her of Pearson's retaliation. His IAB interviewer was Inspector Joseph Profeta, The lawsuit claims Profeta got angry when Marmara attempted to detail Pearson's behavior.\n\nAfter a May 26 police-involved shooting in Brooklyn. Marmara was off duty. But Chell was angry he was not present and complained about borough staffing. Chell then changed Marmara's day tour to nights, the lawsuit says.\n\nMarmara finally filed a retaliation complaint against Maddrey, Chell and Pearson. He texted Police Commissioner Edward Caban, but Caban didn't respond.\n\nOn June 28, Marmara was approached by a lieutenant who claimed Pearson was sexually harassing a female detective, saying she owed Pearson sex for getting her promoted. Marmara reported that as well.\n\nJust 14 days ago, on July 16, Marmara was at a staff meeting chaired by Maddrey. Chell, the lawsuit claims, has evidently learned of the complaint.\n\n\"I don't give a crap about anyone here who filed a complaint against me,\" Chell declared, the suit says. This job is my last spot. If you don't like it you should retire.\"\n\nTwo hours later, Marmara reported that apparent threat.", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.arcamax.com"}, "authors":

Mamara said he had viewed a criminal complaint she made to the department.\n\nA spokesperson for the police department did not respond to an inquiry about the complaint.\n\nThe city\u00b4s Law Department declined to comment.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmara_Region", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marmara Region"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Adams_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eric Adams (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of New York City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebeto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bebeto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief of staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_grooming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child grooming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Complaint"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/31/02/wire-87972479-1722388632-792_636x382.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776929", "eventUri": "eng-9776929", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2013-11-", "textStart": 1211, "textEnd": 1218}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

Like two of the others, it was brought by a male police official who said he was disgusted by Mr. Pearson's treatment of women at a small unit Mr. Adams created to improve government efficiency.\n\nMr. Pearson declined to comment, referring a reporter to a City Hall spokeswoman and a lawyer the city has hired to represent him. That lawyer denied any wrongdoing on Mr. Pearson's behalf and said he would vigorously defend him and the city against the claims.\n\nThe latest complaint, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, was brought by a veteran deputy police chief, Miltiadis Marmara, who has been on the force for more than three decades and who knew Mr. Pearson before Mr. Pearson retired and became head of security at a casino in Queens.\n\nBut Mr. Pearson has not just been accused of wrongdoing in lawsuits. He has also come under scrutiny for apparent conflicts of interest and allegations that he abused the authority of his position in city government. He is the subject of two ongoing investigations by the city's independent anti-corruption agency, people with knowledge of the matter have said. One is examining the sexual harassment allegations and the other his role in a violent melee in October at a city migrant shelter.\n\nStill, despite the drumbeat of sexual harassment and other accusations, Mr. Pearson has continued to occupy a position of extraordinary influence in Mr. Adams's administration, exercising near absolute control over most discretionary N.Y.P.D. promotions while holding no formal role at the department, Chief Marmara's lawsuit said.\n\nThe suit also names the N.Y.P.D.'s highest-ranking uniformed official, Jeffrey B. Maddrey, and its chief of patrol, John M. Chell, as defendants. It accuses Mr. Pearson of using his power to deny a promotion to the female officer who resisted his overtures for the \"quid pro quo sexual relationship.\" The lawsuit calls Mr. Pearson a \"poster boy\" for retaliatory behavior against women who complain of sexual harassment at the N.Y.P.D.\n\n\"It just boggles my mind,\" Chief Marmara, the police official who brought the most recent suit, said in an interview last week. \"He looks at females,\" he said of Mr. Pearson, asking \"what I can get from them, and the first thing he wants to get from them is the sexual, obviously, the sexual quid pro quo.\"\n\nThe mayor himself is a retired police captain, and he and Mr. Pearson have been close for years. In July, when a reporter asked about a security issue at shelters for migrants, Mr. Adams responded by saying that Mr. Pearson was looking into the matter. In May, Mr. Pearson sat on the dais during the mayor's promotion ceremony for public safety employees.\n\nA spokeswoman for the mayor said in a statement on Monday that the administration \"holds employees to the highest ethical standards\" but did not address questions about whether a fourth lawsuit against Mr. Pearson would prompt the city to take action against him.\n\n\"We take these allegations seriously,\" the spokeswoman said. \"We will review the lawsuit.\"\n\nIn a separate statement, John M. Flannery, the lawyer at the firm of Wilson Elser Moskowitz Edelman & Dicker whom the city hired to represent both Mr. Pearson and the city's interests, said that Mr. Pearson and the city had denied the accusations in the earlier lawsuits and planned to \"vigorously defend themselves\" against the one brought by Chief Marmara.\n\nMr. Flannery contended that Chief Marmara was embittered because he lost his position working for Mr. Pearson and added that Chief Marmara and the other plaintiffs had themselves been the subjects of internal investigations.\n\n\"Facts matter, and the facts will show\" that Chief Marmara was removed from his position \"as a result of his own misconduct,\" Mr. Flannery said. He said that included threatening Mr. Pearson over the speed at which N.Y.P.D. officers at a new city office Chief Marmara oversaw were being promoted.\n\nHe also said that neither the chief nor any of the other three people who sued Mr. Pearson and the city \"had ever reported any alleged misconduct by Mr. Pearson to the city or internally to the N.Y.P.D.\" They did so, he said, only after the N.Y.P.D. Internal Affairs Bureau had begun investigating claims of misconduct against them.\n\nBut Chief Marmara's lawsuit says that he complained repeatedly about Mr. Pearson's conduct.\n\nJohn Scola, the lawyer for Chief Marmara and the other three plaintiffs in the suits against Mr. Pearson, has previously described the Internal Affairs investigation as retaliatory. And two of the other suits named the police inspector who led at least part of the inquiry as a defendant.\n\nIndeed, the chief's lawsuit says that Mr. Pearson boasted in April 2023 that he had chosen the chief of Internal Affairs and \"owns\" him.\n\nAside from the new set of allegations, Chief Marmara's suit stands out for who has brought the claim: a senior police official with 30 years' experience who is highly regarded within the department as both a leader and a manager. In 2022, Mr. Adams named him executive director of Municipal Services Assessment, a new office the Adams Administration created to act as a kind of quality assurance unit for the city's agencies.\n\nChief Marmara built and ultimately expanded the office to about 20 employees, including several he said he had carefully selected and recruited from the Police Department because of their skills, intelligence and work ethic.\n\nThey included Roxanne Ludemann, then a police sergeant, who would go on to sue Mr. Pearson in March, accusing him of sexual harassment and retaliation and saying his actions had doomed her career and prompted her to retire. And another sergeant, Michael Ferrari, sued Mr. Pearson in April alleging harassment and retaliation and said that he had also been driven to retire by Mr. Pearson's actions. And George Huang, a lieutenant, sued Mr. Pearson in June, saying he had fostered a hostile work environment.\n\nIn the early days after the creation of the assessment unit, Chief Marmara said he had spoken with the mayor monthly to apprise him of the office's progress.\n\nBut in 2022, The New York Times reported that Mr. Pearson was holding down two jobs, one as a vice president overseeing security at a casino, Resorts World New York City, and the other as a senior adviser to the mayor collecting more than $240,000 in pay. The disclosure of the unusual arrangement, under which he was also able to simultaneously collect his police pension, exposed an apparent conflict of interest, as the casino was seeking the mayor's support to expand its operations.\n\nDays after the report, Mr. Pearson left Resorts World, and Mr. Adams eventually put the Municipal Services Assessment office under his purview.\n\nChief Marmara said he and his colleagues had found Mr. Pearson's behavior peculiar and troubling on several fronts. After complaining in front of Sergeant Ferrari, who has since retired, and Lieutenant Huang about how he was not getting any \"crumbs\" from a particular municipal contract, they speculated that Mr. Pearson was referring to kickbacks and began referring to Mr. Pearson as Crumbs, Chief Marmara's lawsuit says.\n\nThen there was his behavior toward women.\n\nDuring a July 2022 drive to a Hispanic heritage event at Gracie Mansion, the mayor's official residence, Chief Marmara witnessed Mr. Pearson howling \"like a dog\" at the women they passed in the car, according to the suit.\n\nChief Marmara also witnessed Mr. Pearson making \"crude noises\" while staring at the rear end of his assistant.\n\nMr. Pearson used homophobic slurs, Chief Marmara's lawsuit says, toward people including an assistant police chief whom he believed to be a lesbian. And he refused to attend a meeting with Preston Niblack, the commissioner of finance, because he is gay, the suit says. Mr. Niblack declined to comment.\n\nBut it was Mr. Pearson's treatment of Ms. Ludemann that brought tensions at the Municipal Services Assessment office to a head.\n\nAfter witnessing Ms. Ludemann grimace as Mr. Pearson touched her bare shoulder, and learning from Ms. Ludemann that such behavior by Mr. Pearson occurred regularly, Chief Marmara urged her to file a complaint with the office of equal employment opportunity, his lawsuit says.\n\nShe \"vehemently\" declined, fearing retaliation. Chief Marmara backed down but directed his staff never to let a woman be alone in the office with Mr. Pearson, whom he describes in the suit as a \"sexual predator.\"\n\nHe also raised the issue \"on nearly a weekly basis\" with Bernard Adams, Mr. Adams's brother, a retired police sergeant who also worked at City Hall as an adviser on mayoral security.\n\nBernard Adams is said to have brushed off Chief Marmara's concerns, describing Mr. Pearson as \"harmless\" and saying that the behavior was just \"Tim being Tim.\" Ultimately, Bernard Adams relayed Chief Marmara's concerns to Mr. Pearson.\n\nBernard Adams did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter learning of the concerns, Mr. Pearson denied Ms. Ludemann a promotion that she had been promised, Chief Marmara's lawsuit says.\n\nWhen the chief confronted Mr. Pearson about the unfulfilled promise of promotion, according to the suit, Mr. Pearson responded in a lewd voice, saying, \"What is she going to do for me?\" Chief Marmara interpreted that as a proposal for a sexual quid pro quo, the suit says.\n\nUltimately, Mr. Pearson fired Chief Marmara from his position running the new unit.\n\nChief Marmara's lawsuit also contains an account of a sexual encounter Mr. Pearson reportedly had with a female pastor in 2014 or 2015, after he had left the Police Department.\n\nDuring that period, the pastor told Chief Marmara, who was working in Queens, that Mr. Pearson had manipulated her into having sex, which she later described as unnecessarily rough and abusive, the lawsuit says.\n\nShe filed a complaint with the police, according to the suit.\n\nA couple of days later, Mr. Pearson had her arrested, Chief Marmara's suit says, claiming that she had slashed the tires of his BMW. The lawsuit does not detail the outcome of either complaint.\n\nReached by phone last week, the pastor declined to comment.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N.Y.P.D._(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "N.Y.P.D.

I just don't operate that way,\" said Adams, a Democrat. \"I believe in due process and let the process take its course.\"\n\nA lawyer for Pearson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn the most recent lawsuit, Marmara said he observed Pearson harassing multiple female employees when the two worked together at an office created under Adams to monitor other city agencies.\n\nDuring an office party in December 2022, Marmara said he walked into a copy room to find his chief of staff, Sgt. Roxanne Ludemann, grimacing as Pearson rubbed her bare shoulder.\n\nLudemann, who filed her own lawsuit against Pearson earlier this year, told Marmara that the harassment from Pearson was frequent in the office. Soon after, Marmara said he implemented a policy mandating that a supervisor follow Pearson around the office to ensure he wasn't alone with any female employees.\n\nAround the same time, Marmara said he informed the mayor's brother, Bernard Adams, then a deputy police commissioner, about the incident. But Bernard Adams dismissed the claim, saying it was just \"Tim being Tim,\" according to the complaint.\n\nAn emailed message seeking comment from Bernard Adams, sent to his philanthropy project, Angels Helpers NYC, was not immediately returned.\n\nBefore Marmara rejoined the police department this past April, he said he witnessed Pearson sexually harassing other women in the office, at times \"howling\" at them and staring at them.\n\nHe said other officials were concerned by Pearson's behavior but were afraid to cross a high-ranking advisor widely understood to be among the mayor's closest confidantes.\n\n\"Pearson was constantly flaunting his relationship with the mayor,\" Marmara told The Associated Press. \"He'd say 'I destroyed this person's career, I could destroy that person's career.' It's a form of psychological grooming to show that he has power that was totally enabled by the mayor.\"\n\nPearson has no official role within the police department and technically works for the city's Economic Development Corporation, a quasi-public agency. But he wields unusual influence over the department, personally approving nearly all discretionary promotions of officers, according to the lawsuit.\n\nMonths after the copy room incident, Marmara said he learned Pearson was blocking Luddeman's promotion. When Marmara confronted him about it, he said Pearson asked, \"what is she going to do for me?\" He then suggested that Ludemann work as his personal driver, the lawsuit said.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Mamara also said that a female pastor who he was friendly with had once come to him with a complaint that Pearson had sexually abused her in either 2014 or 2015. Mamara said he had viewed a criminal complaint she made to the department.\n\nA spokesperson for the police department did not respond to an inquiry about the complaint.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_offenhartz@seattletimes.com", "name": "Jake Offenhartz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Adams_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eric Adams (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmara_Region", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marmara Region"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of New York City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief of staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Complaint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexual_Dysfunctions", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexual Dysfunctions", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776929", "eventUri": "eng-9776929", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

I just don't operate that way,\" Adams said.\n\nThe mayor declined to answer questions about when he learned of the allegations, initially made by Sgt. Roxanne Ludemann in December 2022. Her claims have been bolstered by two other cops who filed lawsuits -- retired Sgt. Michael Ferrari and Lt. George Huang and now Marmara. Adams also declined to say whether he knew of sexual misconduct accusations against Pearson before he hired him.\n\nIn addition to issues at the MSA, Marmara's lawsuit accuses Pearson of abusing a female Queens pastor during sex, being fired from his job at a Queens casino over sexual improprieties and being the subject of a series of complaints while in the NYPD.\n\nJohn Scola, who represents Marmara and other three plaintiffs, said he was puzzled by the mayor's comments and called for public hearings to air out the allegations.\n\n\"My clients have told both City Hall and NYPD investigators repeatedly about the sexual misconduct of Pearson and the retaliation that followed,\" he said. \"This tactic is meant to distract the public from the veracity of the allegations against Pearson so Mayor Adams can continue to employ his friend.\"\n\nThe mayor said Pearson is \"well respected in the law enforcement community\" and disputed the idea that he has \"vast powers\" over the NYPD.\n\nMarmara has alleged Pearson controls promotions and assignments of sergeants and lieutenants and that Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Philip Banks control promotions and assignments of

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nIt is the fourth lawsuit in the last year against Pearson, who is currently being investigated by another city agency for his role in a brawl at a shelter for homeless migrants.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAt a press briefing Tuesday, Adams described Pearson as a \"good friend\" and said his role in the administration had not changed as a result of the allegations.\n\n\"People have a tendency when accusations are made to say, 'You know what, the pressure is hot, you need to just get rid of a person.' I just don't operate that way,\" said Adams, a Democrat. \"I believe in due process and let the process take its course.\"\n\nA lawyer for Pearson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn the most recent lawsuit, Marmara said he observed Pearson harassing multiple female employees when the two worked together at an office created under Adams to monitor other city agencies.\n\nDuring an office party in December 2022, Marmara said he walked into a copy room to find his chief of staff, Sgt. Roxanne Ludemann, grimacing as Pearson rubbed her bare shoulder.\n\nLudemann, who filed her own lawsuit against Pearson earlier this year, told Marmara that the harassment from Pearson was frequent in the office. Soon after, Marmara said he implemented a policy mandating that a supervisor follow Pearson around the office to ensure he wasn't alone with any female employees.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAround the same time, Marmara said he informed the mayor's brother, Bernard Adams, then a deputy police commissioner, about the incident. But Bernard Adams dismissed the claim, saying it was just \"Tim being Tim,\" according to the complaint.\n\nAn emailed message seeking comment from Bernard Adams, sent to his philanthropy project, Angels Helpers NYC, was not immediately returned.\n\nBefore Marmara rejoined the police department this past April, he said he witnessed Pearson sexually harassing other women in the office, at times \"howling\" at them and staring at them.\n\nHe said other officials were concerned by Pearson's behavior but were afraid to cross a high-ranking advisor widely understood to be among the mayor's closest confidantes.\n\n\"Pearson was constantly flaunting his relationship with the mayor,\" Marmara told The Associated Press. \"He'd say 'I destroyed this person's career, I could destroy that person's career.' It's a form of psychological grooming to show that he has power that was totally enabled by the mayor.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nPearson has no official role within the police department and technically works for the city's Economic Development Corporation, a quasi-public agency.

Again.", "body": "NEW YORK -- Mayor Eric Adams defended his close friend and adviser Timothy Pearson Tuesday after a fourth lawsuit accused the retired NYPD inspector of sexual misconduct and retaliation.\n\nThe 91-page suit, filed by a deputy police chief in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, accused Pearson of sexually harassing a former NYPD sergeant last year and the year prior, when he ran a clandestine mayoral office while pulling in $242,600 from the unrelated city's Economic Development Corp.\n\nIt also said Pearson had a history of sexual harassment complaints dating back decades to his time in the NYPD -- including an allegation that he abused a Queens pastor and subsequently sought to intimidate her. And the plaintiff argued that Adams should have been aware of Pearson's alleged checkered past before hiring him.\n\nTuesday's suit is the latest in a series of negative headlines that make Pearson a growing liability for Adams as he runs for reelection.\n\nThe mayor said he would not alter Pearson's high-powered but nebulous duties, despite fresh allegations that the top aide engaged in a pattern of sexual harassment before tanking the careers of underlings who raised objections to his behavior.\n\n\"People have a tendency when accusations are made to say: You know what, the pressure is hot, you need to just get rid of a person,\" Adams said at a press conference. \"I just don't operate that way. I believe in a system of due process.\"\n\nAdams has a penchant for sticking with his allies, no matter how grave the accusations against them or the political peril it presents for him.\n\nWhen asked repeatedly whether he knew about the allegations against Pearson before hiring him two years ago, the mayor grew testy. He even mused aloud about calling security on the reporter asking the questions, as he declined to answer them.\n\nPearson's city-funded attorney, John Flannery of Wilson Elser, told the Daily News that Pearson denies the allegations in all of the lawsuits against him.\n\n\"Facts matter and the facts will show that [the plaintiff] was removed from his position as a result of his own misconduct, including threatening Mr. Pearson over the speed in which NYPD officers at [the mayoral unit] were being promoted,\" Flannery told the News.\n\nHe added that neither the deputy chief nor the staffers had complained about Pearson before they were shifted out of the unit.\n\nIt is not the first time Adams has defended his longtime confidant.\n\nIn addition to previous lawsuits with similar allegations, which Pearson's city-funded attorneys have denied, he is the subject of a probe by the Department of Investigation. The city entity is focused on allegations of retaliation and a scuffle Pearson was involved in at a city-run migrant shelter earlier this year, when he allegedly attacked female security guards for asking for his ID card.\n\nAnd as POLITICO has previously reported, Pearson delayed the opening of a migrant facility in the hopes of steering a lucrative security contract to Bo Dietl, another longtime friend and supporter of the mayor.\n\nAdams' previous corporation counsel, onetime Brooklyn jurist Sylvia Hinds-Radix, was pushed out of her position in part because she did not want the city's Law Department to defend Pearson against sexual misconduct allegations -- a point of conflict that the mayor's chief counsel, Lisa Zornberg, denied on Tuesday.\n\nThe mayor's foes have taken notice.\n\nCity Council Member Lincoln Restler invoked the allegations swirling around Pearson during a hearing involving questions about how the administration handled complaints against the powerful aide.\n\nAnd his progressive challengers in the upcoming Democratic primary are focusing on issues of competence and management, which could make the constant drip of Pearson news an even bigger liability.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label":

And the plaintiff argued that Adams should have been aware of Pearson's alleged checkered past before hiring him.\n\nTuesday's suit is the latest in a series of negative headlines that make Pearson a growing liability for Adams as he runs for reelection.\n\nThe mayor said he would not alter Pearson's high-powered but nebulous duties, despite fresh allegations that the top aide engaged in a pattern of sexual harassment before tanking the careers of underlings who raised objections to his behavior.\n\n\"People have a tendency when accusations are made to say: You know what, the pressure is hot, you need to just get rid of a person,\" Adams said at a press conference. \"I just don't operate that way. I believe in a system of due process.\"\n\nAdams has a penchant for sticking with his allies, no matter how grave the accusations against them or the political peril it presents for him.\n\nWhen asked repeatedly whether he knew about the allegations against Pearson before hiring him two years ago, the mayor grew testy. He even mused aloud about calling security on the reporter asking the questions, as he declined to answer them.\n\nPearson's city-funded attorney, John Flannery of Wilson Elser, told the Daily News that Pearson denies the allegations in all of the lawsuits against him.\n\n\"Facts matter and the facts will show that [the plaintiff] was removed from his position as a result of his own misconduct, including threatening Mr. Pearson over the speed in which NYPD officers at [the mayoral unit] were being promoted,\" Flannery told the News.\n\nHe added that neither the deputy chief nor the staffers had complained about Pearson before they were shifted out of the unit.\n\nIt is not the first time Adams has defended his longtime confidant.\n\nIn addition to previous lawsuits with similar allegations, which Pearson's city-funded attorneys have denied, he is the subject of a probe by the Department of Investigation. The city entity is focused on allegations of retaliation and a scuffle Pearson was involved in at a city-run migrant shelter earlier this year, when he allegedly attacked female security guards for asking for his ID card.\n\nAnd as POLITICO has previously reported, Pearson delayed the opening of a migrant facility in the hopes of steering a lucrative security contract to Bo Dietl, another longtime friend and supporter of the mayor.\n\nAdams' previous corporation counsel, onetime Brooklyn jurist Sylvia Hinds-Radix, was pushed out of her position in part because she did not want the city's Law Department to defend Pearson against sexual misconduct allegations -- a point of conflict that the mayor's chief counsel, Lisa Zornberg, denied on Tuesday.\n\nThe mayor's foes have taken notice.\n\nCity Council Member Lincoln Restler invoked the allegations swirling around Pearson during a hearing involving questions about how the administration handled complaints against the powerful aide.\n\nAnd his progressive challengers in the upcoming Democratic primary are focusing on issues of competence and management, which could make the constant drip of Pearson news an even bigger liability.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 5,

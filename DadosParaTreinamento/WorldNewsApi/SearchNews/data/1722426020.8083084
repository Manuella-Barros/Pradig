(Spoilers ahead!) The actor\u2019s role was introduced at the end of season two as a guest star. He became a regular character in season three after he received positive feedback for his initial appearance. Over the course of the following seasons, Sloan became a fan-favorite character, but after a plane crash in the season eight finale, it was revealed he would succumb to his injuries, dying at the beginning of season nine. Dane returned to the show briefly in season 17 when Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) was in a COVID-induced coma and was visited on an imaginary beach by Sloan, sister Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), husband Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), George O\u2019Malley (T.R. Knight) and Andrew DeLuca (Giacomo Gianniotti). The Euphoria actor stopped by Dax Shepard\u2019s Armchair Podcast earlier this week, where he revealed that he didn\u2019t exactly choose to leave Grey\u2019s Anatomy when he was written off. \u201cI think I was let go,\u201d he told the host, explaining that he was struggling with addiction at the time. \u201cThey didn\u2019t let me go because of that, although it definitely didn\u2019t help. I was starting to become, as most of these actors who have spent significant time on a show, you start to become very expensive for the network. And the network knows that the show is going to do what it\u2019s going to do irrespective of who they keep on it. As long as they have their Grey, they\u2019re fine.\u201d He continued, \u201cI wasn\u2019t the same guy they had hired. So I had understood when I was let go. And Shonda [Rhimes] was really great. She protected us fiercely. She protected us publicly. She protected us privately. \u2026 But I was probably fired. It wasn\u2019t ceremoniously like, \u2018You\u2019re fired,\u2019 it was just like, \u2018You\u2019re not coming back.'\u201d During the height of his fame while on Grey\u2018s, Dane checked himself into rehab for an addiction to painkillers and has struggled with depression over the years. He shared that when he joined the show, he had been sober for three or four years, so he was able to distinguish between what was reality and what wasn\u2019t, but overall, he doesn\u2019t think he handled the fame that came with it very well. \u201cIf you take the whole eight years on Grey\u2019s Anatomy, I was fucked up longer than I was sober. And that\u2019s when things started going sideways for me,\u201d he revealed, adding that the sudden popularity may have played a part in why he relapsed. \u201cIt was overwhelming, and I think I just wanted to pretend that it wasn\u2019t and that I was comfortable with it. Act like you\u2019ve been there, but you haven\u2019t been there.\u201d Dane currently portrays Cal Jacobs on Euphoria, the father of Nate Jacobs (Jacob Elordi), and one of the show\u2019s few adult characters.", "summary": "Eric Dane is opening up about being written off Grey&#8217;s Anatomy after six seasons of playing Dr. Mark Sloan, aka McSteamy, on the hit ABC series.

Two-time Oscar winner De Niro and New York residents appeared streetside near the courthouse where Trump\u2019s criminal hush money trial is taking place and warned of dire consequences if Trump wins the election. \u201cWhen Trump ran in 2016 it was like a joke -- this buffoon running for president. \u2018No, never could happen,\u2019\u201c De Niro said. \u201cWe\u2019d forgotten the lessons of history that showed us that other clowns who weren\u2019t taken seriously until they became vicious dictators. \u201cWith Trump, we have a second chance, and no one is laughing now. This is the time to stop him, by voting him out, once and for all,\u201d he told bystanders. Two former Washington, D.C., police officers accompanied De Niro and talked about their experiences, and injuries, from the riot Jan. 6 at the U.S Capitol, a riot they blame Trump for instigating in an attempt to thwart Biden from taking office, The Associated Press said. \u201cAmericans need to wake up. This is not a drill,\u201d former officer Harry Dunn said. Trump faces nearly three dozen felony charges centered on claims that he and his allies conspired to stifle potentially embarrassing stories during the 2016 presidential campaign through hush money payments \u2014 including to a porn actor who claimed that she and Trump had sex a decade earlier \u2013 and falsified business records to hide those payments. Closing arguments in the trial were heard Tuesday. For weeks surrogates of the former president have appeared at the courthouse to show support for Trump. Those surrogates have included several members of Congress, including Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, as well as Mike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives. Biden\u2019s campaign told MSNBC on Tuesday that De Niro and the officers were not there to talk about the trial itself, but to take advantage of the large media presence to push their campaign message. \u201cWe\u2019re not here today because of what\u2019s going on over there,\u201d Biden campaign communication director Michael Tyler told reporters, gesturing toward the courthouse. \u201cWe\u2019re here today because you all are here,\u201d The AP reported. Trump advisers said the Biden team\u2019s presence validated Trump\u2019s complaint that his prosecutions are being driven by politics. The campaign described De Niro as a \u201cwashed up actor\u201d and said the event shows Biden\u2019s desperation, Reuters said. De Niro, who won Oscars for his roles in \u201cThe Godfather II\u201d and \u201cRaging Bull,\u201d last week narrated an ad for the Biden campaign that sharply criticized Trump\u2019s presidency and plans if he\u2019s re-elected. On Tuesday, he said he joined the campaign because it was the only way to \u201cpreserve our freedoms.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t mean to scare you. No, wait, maybe I do mean to scare you,\u201d De Niro told reporters. \u201cIf Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\u201d", "summary": "Two-time Oscar winner Robert De Niro, appearing with two former Washington police officers who fought a rioting mob on Jan. 6 at the U.S. Capitol, appeared streetside in New York on Tuesday to warn against election of Donald Trump.", "url": "https://www.cleveland.com/nation/2024/05/legendary-actor-issues-dire-warning-on-re-election-of-donald-trump.html", "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/3BEURWSMY5ARXBGHQCOTJ7O4NE.jpg?auth=6cf7b8f72bc3e94f5498029e5cc89853fa6c9b42981bd6f99c4e8df8ba611512&width=1280&quality=90", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:56:20", "author": "Robert Higgs", "authors": ["Robert Higgs"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.377}

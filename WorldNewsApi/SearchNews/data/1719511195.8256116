{"id": 223745852, "title": "ITV Big Brother star Yinrun Huang addresses The 1% Club's 'offensive' and 'disrespectful' decision", "text": "The 1% Club contestant Yinrun Huang has addressed a controversial decision related to her time on the show, which fans have said was \"offensive\" and \"disrespectful\". The latest episode of the ITV show aired on Saturday night and Yinrun, 26, was among the contestants. She's known for having been a finalist on Big Brother last year, which is said to have been filmed months after she did the 1% Club. Yinrun was introduced by Lee Mack, 55, on the quiz show but she was referred to as Runrun. Prior to the episode's broadcast this weekend, she had told fans on Instagram: \"They gave me [that name] because it was easier to say.\" She appeared in the episode of a few occasions, including when she incorrectly answered a question. Lee said: \"I've so sorry to say that we've lost Runrun.\" He added: \"Runrun, I'm so sorry. You should have changed your name to Staystay.\" Some viewers have criticised the decision, with one person tweeting: \"It is stupid she had to be named 'Runrun' for pronunciation reasons.\" Whilst another commented on X, formerly known as Twitter: \"I'm sorry that is so offensive.\" One viewer said it was \"downright disgusting\" and \"offensive,\" adding: \"Then using stay stay as a joke, just bang out of order all of this!\" Sharing their thoughts, a fourth person tweeted: \"That's just not right. So disrespectful.\" Another said: \"Yinrun is easy to pronounce though, I don't get why they needed to give her a different name. Even if it was, it's respectful to say contestants' names properly and if Lee was likely to struggle with it, give him a phonetical spelling.\" There had already been criticism following Yinrun's post about the experience prior to the episode airing. One person wrote: \"Totally not okay they changed your name because it's 'easier to pronounce'. Yinrun is very easy to say and even if it wasn't, it still needs to be learnt and said!\" And responding to that comment, someone else said: \"Same here, definitely not right.\" Whilst a third person wrote at the time: \"Cannot see how Yinrun could be difficult for anyone to pronounce. Even if it was, they should learn it.\" Yinrun addressed the situation in a Q&A video on Sunday. She said: \"This was a name I was given on my tablet and because it was about to start filming, they asked if it was okay for me to keep it as it was - which I didn't mind. So please don't worry everyone. I'm fine with Runrun.\" She had announced that she would be on the 1% Club hours before the episode aired. She shared the news on Instagram and warned her followers on the platform that she would be referred to by a different name on the show. She wrote: \"I'm on the 1% Club Tonight! This was filmed at the start of 2023 so I've had to keep my participation a secret for so long! But it's finally here and I can't wait to watch it back!! (This is one of my favourite series).\" Yinrun further commented: \"Thanks to the show for having me as a player, I had the best time and lots of laughs, plus [Lee] is so charming.\" She continued: \"Please tune in on ITV1 at 20:55 pm to watch the episode, and see how powerful my brain really is!! Can you get the 1% question? Good luck.\" She had also warned fans that she would appear under a different name on the show. Alongside an emoji depicting a grinning face with sweat, she said: \"P.S They gave me the name 'Runrun' because it was easier to say, but it's still me.\" The recent post included a series of photos related to the production and Yinrun further discussed her experience in captions on them. Alongside one photo, which appeared to show the TV studio, she wrote: \"This was filmed over a year ago, so I'm really excited to finally watch it back.\" She also told her followers: \"I was a bit nervous but it was definitely one of the most fun experiences I've ever had, you'll see I laughed a lot.\" Yinrun later added: \"I think you're gonna be VERY impressed with my performance.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "summary": "The latest episode of the 1% Club featured former Big Brother finalist Yinrun Huang, though a decision related to her appearance on the show has prompted a backlash", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/itv-big-brother-star-yinrun-32896706", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32896870.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_MAIN-1pc-club-viewers-fume-over-unacceptable-decision.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:47:39", "author": "Joel Leaver,Joel-leaver", "authors": ["Joel Leaver", "Joel-leaver"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.072}

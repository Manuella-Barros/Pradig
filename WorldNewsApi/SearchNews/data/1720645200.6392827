The bully's accomplice filmed the assault on Aliyah Konton at Mashpee High School and ensured the degrading video was widely shared on Snapchat. According to a fellow student, 15-year-old Aliyah had recently transferred to the Cape Cod school and attempted to 'fit in.' The police were alerted and the missing girl was eventually found safe. \"The town of Mashpee came together for one of its own, and again, I am happy to report she has been found safe,\" the police stated.

Patricia DeBoer, the superintendent of Mashpee schools, refrained from commenting to the press during a school committee meeting that evening. On May 25, a school resource officer discovered the video and notified the police, but parents were not informed about the incident until Aliyah disappeared eight days later. One mother of three students at the school expressed her fury, stating: \"The lack of communication and the complete lack of accountability and consequences for the perpetrators in the school system are beyond disgraceful.\" Another parent, Jessica Valois, was upset that she found out about the horrific incident on Facebook a week later, rather than from the school itself. Corinne Shea demanded an explanation as to why the Mashpee school system had not informed parents about the situation, according to the Daily Mail. For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US Courtney Negron added, \"Mashpee has always been one to turn their heads when something is going on, if it looks bad on them then they don't wanna talk about it.\" Residents of the small town began discussing organizing search parties and, as the video of the incident spread, many started reaching out to Aliyah herself. \"Aliyah you are loved and cared about by people who have never met you,\" Heather Morel penned. \"Please go somewhere safe, message anyone on this thread, we will help you. Our world needs you in it.\" Corine Shea chimed in with, \"My first thought was please let this girl know that life gets better after high school. What happened to her is messed up and absolutely NO ONE is laughing with those mean girls.\" One of Aliyah's classmates, Leah Holtz, revealed that Aliyah had only recently joined the school. \"She just seems like she was trying to fit in and just trying to make friends with everybody,\" she shared with WCVB. \"No student, no person, should ever be harmed in that way,\" she continued. \"I just feel very sick to my stomach because I just want her to be found.\" Michael DiMaggio wrote on Tuesday, \"Still not a peep from the school. They are promoting Spirit Day? We, as parents of a 6-year-old in this school system, are seriously contemplating whether we should keep our child in a school system that lets this happen.\" However, two boys visiting Planet Fitness in nearby Barnstable the following day spotted a girl they believed they recognized from police missing posters and informed the manager. Despite the news of Aliyah's rescue, the residents of the town of Massachusetts remain outraged. \"What are the consequences for the ones who, in the video, dragged her by their hair into the school bathroom and hit her, and made her lick the floor? \" Selma Parker demanded to know. \"May us parents get some answers? \" \"The schools need to do a better job,\" Matt Bollinder penned. \"They are all talk with this stuff, and when it comes time to actually protect kids from bullies, they turn the other way.\"", "summary": "A 15-year-old girl from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, vanished after she was brutally attacked by a school bully who slapped her and forced her to lick the bathroom floor", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/girl-15-vanishes-after-cruel-32989666", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32989816.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_couk-Cape-Cod-girl-15-vanished-after-cruel-school-bully-was-filmed-slapping-her-dragging-her-by.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:33:40", "author": "Yelena Mandenberg,Yelena-Mandenberg", "authors": ["Yelena Mandenberg", "Yelena-Mandenberg"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.175}

A comfortbale 4-0 win on the day meant a 6-1 win on aggregate, ensuring the Staggies will remain in the top flight next season. Club chairman Roy MacGregor confirmed after the full-time whistle that Don Cowie would be the man to lead County forward on a permanent basis, revealing: \u201cDon was told before he got the job that it was his no matter what happened. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the interruption of speaking to his agent and all that during an important time, so we just left it the way it was. \u201cI have known him for a long time, since he was nine years old, so to watch his journey, being a local boy, going away to play for Scotland then coming back, it has been fabulous. \u201cI made a mistake because he wanted the job when Malky left but I didn\u2019t think it was fair to put him into that at the time. I got it wrong. So I am delighted for him. \u201cHe has a bond with the players, him being a local boy has been important for Ross County.\" Cowie himself commented: \u201cWhat was said was that the chairman saw me as the person to take this club forward. \u201cWe were aligned in not thinking that needed to be the focus, because we didn\u2019t need any distractions. \u201cThe chairman has shown a lot of belief in me, and he has stated that he sees me being the person to take the club forward. \u201cAt any club you need to have a bigger conversation about how that looks going forward, and we\u2019ll have that. \u201cI\u2019ve said all along that I want to be a manager, and I felt I was ready three months ago. Since then that belief I have in myself has only strengthened, and this is a club I have a lot of affection for, so I don\u2019t see any issues there.\u201d Simon Murray was once again the star man against Raith, scoring twice to help the Staggies over the line. That brought his personal tally to 22 goals for the season across all competitions, and Cowie hailed the talisman as having one of the best seasons of his career. \u201cHe\u2019s been impressive the whole season, but it\u2019s about the whole group,\u201d Cowie said. \u201cI said when I came into this role that it\u2019s about the collective, and Simon will be the first to admit what he has done this year has been down to his teammates. \u201cI see no reason why he won\u2019t be at this club next season. He has had probably the best season of his career and he\u2019s enjoying being at this football club.\u201d Reflecting on the situation County found themselves in, Cowie pointed to the calmness that has been instilled in Dingwall over recent months as a big reason they stayed up \u2013 but admits they cannot afford to find themselves fighting relegation for a third year in-a-row. \u201cWe understand the fight that we have every year,\u201d Cowie added. \u201cWe punch above our weight to be in the top league in Scotland, and we embrace that. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging, so there are times you find yourself in the play-of spot, but we need to improve. \u201cThe more you\u2019re down there, eventually you will fall, and it\u2019s up to me now to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. \u201cWe were in a very precarious position when I came in to this role. \u201cThe spotlight was on us, and early on we played Livingston where if they beat us we would have been level on points. \u201cI needed calmness, and the football club to come together, and ultimately that\u2019s what has happened. \u201cWe could have missed the play-off, but it wasn\u2019t to be, and the character the players have shown over the last two games makes me really proud.\u201d Do you want to respond to this article?

Tokyo hopes a dating app can turn that around", "text": "Tokyo CNN \u2014 Japan\u2019s fertility rate, which has seen a precipitous fall for many years, has reached another record low as the government ramps up efforts to encourage young people to get married and start families \u2014 even launching its own dating app. The nation of 123.9 million people only recorded 727,277 births last year, according to new data released by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare on Friday. The fertility rate \u2013 defined as the total number of births a woman has in her lifetime \u2013 dropped from 1.26 to 1.20. For a population to remain stable, it needs a fertility rate of 2.1. Anything above that will see a population expand, with a large proportion of children and young adults, as seen in India and many African nations. But in Japan, the fertility rate has been well below that stable marker of 2.1 for half a century, experts say \u2013 it fell below that level after the 1973 global oil crisis pushed economies into recession, and never recovered. The downward trend has accelerated in recent years, with the number of deaths overtaking births each year and causing the total population to shrink \u2013 with far-reaching consequences for Japan\u2019s workforce, economy, welfare system and social fabric. In 2023, the country recorded 1.57 million deaths, according to the Health Ministry \u2013 more than double the number of births. And Japan\u2019s not having much matrimonial luck, either \u2013 the number of marriages fell by 30,000 last year, while the number of divorces rose. Experts say the decline is expected to continue for at least several decades and is to some extent irreversible due to the country\u2019s population structure. Even if Japan were to boost its fertility rate tomorrow, its population will keep falling until the skewed ratio of young people to older adults balances out. Still, the government is now racing to soften the impact, launching new government agencies to focus specifically on this problem. It has launched initiatives such as expanding child care facilities, offering housing subsidies to parents, and in some towns, even paying couples to have children. In the capital Tokyo, local officials are trying a new tack: launching a government-run dating app, which is in early testing phases and will be fully operational later this year. \u201cPlease use it as \u2018the first step\u2019 to begin marriage hunting,\u201d the app\u2019s website says, adding that the AI-matchmaking system is provided by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Users are asked to take a \u201cvalues diagnostic test\u201d but there\u2019s also an option to put in the desired traits of a future partner. \u201cBased on your values and the values you seek in a partner, which can be determined by taking a diagnostic test, AI will introduce you to a compatible person,\u201d it said. \u201cWhat cannot be measured by appearance or conditions alone may lead to unexpected encounters.\u201d The app even caught the eye of billionaire Elon Musk, who wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \u201cI\u2019m glad the government of Japan recognizes the importance of this matter. If radical action isn\u2019t taken, Japan (and many other countries) will disappear!\u201d Experts have told CNN this scenario is unlikely \u2013 the fertility rate is expected to even out at some point, and the country will adjust. Japan may look very different at that point, from its demographic makeup to its economy and domestic policies, but it won\u2019t simply vanish. \u201cMarriage is a decision based on one\u2019s own values, but the Tokyo Metropolitan Government is working to build momentum for marriage so that those who think they \u2018intend to get married eventually\u2019 can take that first step,\u201d says the dating app\u2019s website. Users must be single, over 18 years old \u201cwith a desire to get married,\u201d and be living or working in Tokyo, the website says. It also lists the government\u2019s other measures to support couples \u2013 such as providing information on work-life balance, child care and housing support, men\u2019s participation in housework and child-rearing, and career counseling. \u201cWe hope that every single one of you who wishes to get married will think about what being in a \u2018couple\u2019 means to you,\u201d it says.", "summary": "<p>Tokyo CNN \u00a0\u2014\u00a0 Japan\u2019s fertility rate, which has seen a precipitous fall for many years, has reached another record low as the government ramps up efforts to encourage young people to get married and start families\u00a0\u2014\u00a0even launching its own dating app. The nation of 123.9 million people only recorded 727,277 births last year, according to &#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.egyptindependent.com/japans-births-just-fell-to-a-new-record-low-tokyo-hopes-a-dating-app-can-turn-that-around/\">Japan\u2019s births just fell to a new record low.

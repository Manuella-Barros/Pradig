The deceased doctor, identified as Krushnaprasad Chinnara, had traveled to Wayanad for a vacation with his wife Priyadarshini Pal and two other doctors on July 29.\n\nWhile Priyadarshini and Swikruti Mohapatra have been rescued and are undergoing treatment at a hospital, the third doctor, Swadheen Panda, is still missing. Minister Pujari stated earlier that two families from Cuttack district's Choudwar were trapped in the landslide. The two women have been found and admitted to a hospital, while two men remain missing.\n\n\"We hope all of them will return safely. We are in discussions with the Kerala government and perhaps sending officials to assist in the search operation for the missing people from Odisha,\" the state's Minister for Revenue and Disaster Management said. Pujari added that the Special Relief Commissioner of Odisha is in contact with his Kerala counterpart.\n\nThe Odisha government has dispatched a team including Director of Mo Parivar, Dilip Routray, to Kerala. Minister Pujari expressed hope for further rescues, stating that many people are still trapped. The Government of India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have deployed NDRF, Air Force, and Navy for rescue operations. Landslides in Wayanad's Mepaddi and Chooramala areas have left at least 158 people dead and flooded several localities.\n\nEarlier today, the Indian Army intensified its rescue operations, successfully evacuating more than 1,000 people to safety. The Army's Southern Command stated that around 1,000 personnel have been rescued using man-made bridges and concerted human effort.\n\nDespite adverse weather conditions and poor visibility, Indian Air Force helicopters conducted search and rescue missions in Wayanad, rescuing stranded individuals from a narrow strip of land. The initial landslide occurred in Mundakkai, followed by a second in Chooralmala. These massive landslides have damaged homes, roads, and uprooted trees, complicating rescue operations. Efforts are currently underway to provide relief and continue rescue operations.\n\nThe first landslide struck at 2 a.m. on July 30, followed by another at 4:01 a.m., causing significant damage to homes and livelihoods.

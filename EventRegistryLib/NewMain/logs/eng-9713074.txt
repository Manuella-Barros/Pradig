However, the Phillies outfield could use a boost before a potential deep postseason run. The team \"is keeping a close eye\" on All-Star Brent Rooker of the Oakland A's ahead of the July 30 trade deadline, according to USA TODAY's Bob Nightengale.\n\n\"The Philadelphia Phillies are keeping a close eye on Oakland A's left fielder Brent Rooker. The Phillies rank 26th in OPS among left fielders this season,\" wrote Nightengale.\n\nThe Phillies' primary left fielder has been Brandon Marsh. Marsh has been one of the few bright spots in the team's outfield. He is slashing .265/.346/.414. His numbers are not far off from his 2023 season. However, Rooker could allow Marsh to move to centerfield or right field.\n\nThe Phillies have not seen the production they had hoped for from their primary outfielders. Nick Castellanos and Johan Rojas have struggled this season with batting averages of .238 and .232, respectively.\n\nCastellanos has failed to match the numbers he put up as an All-Star in 2023. Rojas played in just 59 games last season but held a .302 average. The Phillies could definitely use an upgrade at either one of their spots.\n\nMarsh has a 116 OPS+ this season, leading the way for the Phillies outfield. Rooker has a 155 OPS+ with 18 home runs. He would immediately become the best offensive outfielder for the Phillies.\n\nAs Nightengale noted, the Phillies rank 26th in OPS from their left fielders. Rooker has served primarily as a DH this season, but the Phillies have Kyle Schwarber in that spot.\n\nRooker was named an All-Star in 2023 with 30 home runs, a .817 OPS and 69 RBIs. Last season he had a .246 batting average and a 127 OPS+ in 137 games. This season he has raised his average to .277 and already has 54 RBIs.\n\nRooker could bring another big bat to Philadelphia and play for a winning organization for the first time in his career. Dave Dombrowski, president of baseball operations, has shown he is not scared to make some big trades. This season may be another opportunity to add to that list of deals.\n\nWith Rooker, Marsh would likely move to centerfield. He has made 225 starts at the position. That would leave Castellanos in right field. The Phillies could remain patient there, or potentially trade for multiple outfielders.\n\nThe team has an interest in Chicago White Sox star Luis Robert Jr., according to the Athletic's Jim Bowden. Robert is also a center fielder. Marsh's ability to play all three outfield positions gives them some more options when looking at outfielders at the trade deadline.\n\nRooker's .891 OPS would rank second on the Phillies star-studded roster, behind only Bryce Harper. He would join a lineup with Harper, Trea Turner, and Alec Bohm, all named All-Star starters this season.\n\nHarper and Schwarber are among Phillies stars currently on the injured list. Rooker could bring some thump to the lineup while they work to return. J.T. Realmuto will not be back until after the All-Star break. Harper and Schwarber are not far from returning, according to MLB.com.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aaliyan_mohammed@heavy.com", "name": "Aaliyan Mohammed", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Rooker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brent Rooker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Castellanos", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Castellanos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Marsh_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Marsh (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Schwarber", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Schwarber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Bohm", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alec Bohm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._T._Realmuto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

The Phillies lost Wheeler on a steamy night with left low back tightness after five innings.\n\nA 2024 All-Star, Wheeler (10-4) joined Aaron Nola and Ranger Su\u00e1rez as a trio of Phillies pitchers with 10 wins before the All-Star break. It's the first time in franchise history the Phillies have three pitchers with 10 wins before the break.\n\nThomson and Wheeler both said the pitcher should make his next scheduled start Sunday against Oakland.\n\n\"Just playing it safe and we'll go from there,\" Wheeler said.\n\nAfter a modest 5-4 mark with Harper and Schwarber sidelined -- that included dropping two of three over the weekend in Atlanta -- the Phillies flexed their muscle early against the Dodgers in a matchup of NL division leaders.\n\n\"It was just another good win against a really good team,\" Turner said. \"It's another game, but at the same time you kind of want to see where you stack up at. Great ballclub and we've been playing some good baseball ourselves. To come out and win the way we want was pretty refreshing and kind of gives that confidence moving forward.\"\n\nThe Phillies busted the game open with a six-run fourth off Dodgers starter Bobby Miller (1-2) that saw the right-hander's ERA balloon from 6.12 to a 8.07. The Phillies led 4-0 when Turner -- who left the Dodgers for Philadelphia on a $300 million, 11-year contract ahead of the 2023 season -- drove an 86 mph slider into the left field seats.\n\n\"I think I stink with the bases loaded,\" Turner said.\n\nNo need for Phillies fans to manufacture a standing ovation for Turner this season. A 2024 NL All-Star, Turner has five homers in his last seven games.\n\nStott added a solo shot off Miller later in the fourth, his first since May 18.\n\n\"I'll just use all this failure as motivation going into my next outing,\" Miller said.\n\nHarper went 0 for 4. Schwarber hit a two-RBI single in the second inning for a 3-0 lead. Harper strained his left hamstring running the bases in the ninth inning, and Schwarber strained his left groin while making a throw from left field in the eighth of a June 27 loss against Miami.\n\nWheeler threw 76 pitches -- he struck out Dodgers leadoff hitter Shohei Ohtani on three pitches to open the game -- and left with the Phillies holding a 9-1 lead. He allowed three hits, struck out seven and walked two. Wheeler allowed a solo home run to Cavan Biggio in the fifth inning.\n\nHe won't be available for the National League staff in next week's All-Star game. Wheeler and the Phillies agreed in March on a $126 million, three-year deal for 2025-27 that has the fourth-highest average salary in baseball history at $42 million.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nDodgers placed All-Star right-hander Tyler Glasnow on the 15-day injured list with back tightness, retroactive to July 6.\n\nThe 30-year-old Glasnow is 8-5 with a 3.47 ERA in his first season with the Dodgers. He was acquired in a December trade with Tampa Bay and received a $136.5 million, five-year contract to return to Southern California.\n\nPhillies CF Johan Rojas was hit by a pitch near his wrist in the seventh. The Dodgers then brought in position player Kik\u00e9 Hernandez to pitch and he retired Schwarber to end the inning. Hernandez retired all four batters in his second career pitching apperance -- both times at Citizens Bank Park (2018).\n\nNEXT START\n\nPhillies RHP Tyler Phillips gets the start Saturday against Oakland. He made his big league debut out of the bullpen Sunday in Atlanta and allowed one run in four innings. He struck out the first four he faced.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Dodgers send RHP Gavin Stone (9-2, 3.03 ERA) to the mound against Phillies LHP Cristopher S\u00e1nchez (6-4, 2.96 ERA).\n\nAP MLB:

A 2024 All-Star, Wheeler (10-4) joined Aaron Nola and Ranger Su\u00e1rez as a trio of Phillies pitchers with 10 wins before the All-Star break. It's the first time in franchise history the Phillies have three pitchers with 10 wins before the break.\n\nAfter a modest 5-4 mark with Harper and Schwarber sidelined -- that included dropping two of three over the weekend in Atlanta -- the Phillies flexed their muscle early against the Dodgers in a matchup of NL division leaders.\n\nSchwarber hit a two-RBI single in the second inning for a 3-0 lead.\n\nThe Phillies busted the game open with a six-run fourth off Dodgers starter Bobby Miller (1-2) that saw the right-hander's ERA balloon from 6.12 to a 8.07. The Phillies led 4-0 when Turner -- who left the Dodgers for Philadelphia on a $300 million, 11-year contract ahead of the 2023 season -- drove an 86 mph slider into the left field seats.\n\nNo need for Phillies fans to manufacture a standing ovation for Turner this season. A 2024 NL All-Star, Turner has five homers in his last seven games.\n\nStott added a solo shot off Miller later in the fourth, his first since May 18.\n\nHarper went 0 for 4. Harper strained his left hamstring running the bases in the ninth inning, and Schwarber strained his left groin while making a throw from left field in the eighth of a June 27 loss against Miami.\n\nWheeler threw 76 pitches -- he struck out Dodgers leadoff hitter Shohei Ohtani on three pitches to open the game -- and left with the Phillies holding a 9-1 lead. He allowed three hits, struck out seven and walked two. Wheeler allowed a solo home run to Cavan Biggio in the fifth inning.\n\nHe won't be available for the National League staff in next week's All-Star game. Wheeler and the Phillies agreed in March on a $126 million, three-year deal for 2025-27 that has the fourth-highest average salary in baseball history at $42 million.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nDodgers placed All-Star right-hander Tyler Glasnow on the 15-day injured list with back tightness, retroactive to July 6.\n\nThe 30-year-old Glasnow is 8-5 with a 3.47 ERA in his first season with the Dodgers. He was acquired in a December trade with Tampa Bay and received a $136.5 million, five-year contract to return to Southern California.\n\nPhillies CF Johan Rojas was hit by a pitch near his wrist in the seventh. The Dodgers then brought in position player Kik\u00e9 Hernandez to pitch and he retired Schwarber to end the inning.\n\nNEXT START\n\nPhillies RHP Tyler Phillips gets the start Saturday against Oakland. He made his big league debut out of the bullpen Sunday in Atlanta and allowed one run in four innings. He struck out the first four he faced.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Dodgers send RHP Gavin Stone (9-2, 3.03 ERA) to the mound against Phillies LHP Cristopher S\u00e1nchez (6-4, 2.96 ERA).\n\n___\n\nAP MLB:

However, amid ongoing issues with the Phillies lineup, there's another position and specific player reportedly being eyed.\n\nWhile the Phillies are near the top of the MLB standings, they've experienced some turbulent play as of late. Injuries are largely to blame with Bryce Harper, Kyle Schwarber and J.T. Realmuto all on the injured list. However, it's also emphasized weaknesses in the Phillies lineup.\n\nRelated: 10 bold MLB predictions for second half of the season\n\nPhiladelphia has one of the best records in baseball despite receiving sub-par production from multiple players. Nick Castellanos (.689 OPS), Johan Rohas (.557 OPS) and David Dahl (.638 OPS) have all struggled this season. Even when Harper, Realmuto and Schwarber return, Philadelphia knows improvements are necessary.\n\nRelated: 10 MLB trades we'd love to see in July, including Philadelphia Phillies' deal\n\nAccording to USA Today's Bob Nightengale, the Phillies are \"keeping a close eye on\" Oakland Athletics outfielder Brent Rooker ahead of the MLB trade deadline.\n\nRooker - .277/.351/.540, .891 OPS - would add an excellent right-handed bat to the Phillies lineup. Entering MLB games today, Rooker has slashed .258/.337/.507 with a .845 OPS and 48 home runs in his last 741 at-bats. He's also under contract through 2027, under arbitration control through his age-32 season.\n\nRelated: MLB power rankings, see where Philadelphia Phillies land\n\nWhile Rooker is bad defensively (-2 Outs Above Average), he would add significant pop for Philadelphia and could be a long-term solution to the problem in the corner outfield. Plus, with the Athletics in a rebuild and Rooker already 29 years old, there is a higher likelihood of him being moved.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnaut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnaut.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_johnson@sportsnaut.com", "name": "Matt Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._T._Realmuto", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

The Phillies lost Wheeler on a steamy night with left low back tightness after five innings.\n\nA 2024 All-Star, Wheeler (10-4) joined Aaron Nola and Ranger Su\u00e1rez as a trio of Phillies pitchers with 10 wins before the All-Star break. It's the first time in franchise history the Phillies have three pitchers with 10 wins before the break.\n\nThomson and Wheeler both said the pitcher should make his next scheduled start Sunday against Oakland.\n\n\"Just playing it safe and we'll go from there,\" Wheeler said.\n\nAfter a modest 5-4 mark with Harper and Schwarber sidelined -- that included dropping two of three over the weekend in Atlanta -- the Phillies flexed their muscle early against the Dodgers in a matchup of NL division leaders.\n\n\"It was just another good win against a really good team,\" Turner said. \"It's another game, but at the same time you kind of want to see where you stack up at. Great ballclub and we've been playing some good baseball ourselves. To come out and win the way we want was pretty refreshing and kind of gives that confidence moving forward.\"\n\nThe Phillies busted the game open with a six-run fourth off Dodgers starter Bobby Miller (1-2) that saw the right-hander's ERA balloon from 6.12 to a 8.07. The Phillies led 4-0 when Turner -- who left the Dodgers for Philadelphia on a $300 million, 11-year contract ahead of the 2023 season -- drove an 86 mph slider into the left field seats.\n\n\"I think I stink with the bases loaded,\" Turner said.\n\nNo need for Phillies fans to manufacture a standing ovation for Turner this season. A 2024 NL All-Star, Turner has five homers in his last seven games.\n\nStott added a solo shot off Miller later in the fourth, his first since May 18.\n\n\"I'll just use all this failure as motivation going into my next outing,\" Miller said.\n\nHarper went 0 for 4. Schwarber hit a two-RBI single in the second inning for a 3-0 lead. Harper strained his left hamstring running the bases in the ninth inning, and Schwarber strained his left groin while making a throw from left field in the eighth of a June 27 loss against Miami.\n\nWheeler threw 76 pitches -- he struck out Dodgers leadoff hitter Shohei Ohtani on three pitches to open the game -- and left with the Phillies holding a 9-1 lead. He allowed three hits, struck out seven and walked two. Wheeler allowed a solo home run to Cavan Biggio in the fifth inning.\n\nHe won't be available for the National League staff in next week's All-Star game. Wheeler and the Phillies agreed in March on a $126 million, three-year deal for 2025-27 that has the fourth-highest average salary in baseball history at $42 million.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nDodgers placed All-Star right-hander Tyler Glasnow on the 15-day injured list with back tightness, retroactive to July 6.\n\nThe 30-year-old Glasnow is 8-5 with a 3.47 ERA in his first season with the Dodgers. He was acquired in a December trade with Tampa Bay and received a $136.5 million, five-year contract to return to Southern California.\n\nPhillies CF Johan Rojas was hit by a pitch near his wrist in the seventh. The Dodgers then brought in position player Kik\u00e9 Hernandez to pitch and he retired Schwarber to end the inning. Hernandez retired all four batters in his second career pitching apperance -- both times at Citizens Bank Park (2018).\n\nNEXT START\n\nPhillies RHP Tyler Phillips gets the start Saturday against Oakland. He made his big league debut out of the bullpen Sunday in Atlanta and allowed one run in four innings. He struck out the first four he faced.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Dodgers send RHP Gavin Stone (9-2, 3.03 ERA) to the mound against Phillies LHP Cristopher S\u00e1nchez (6-4, 2.96 ERA).", "source": {"uri":

It's the first time in franchise history the Phillies have three pitchers with 10 wins before the break.\n\nAfter a modest 5-4 mark with Harper and Schwarber sidelined -- that included dropping two of three over the weekend in Atlanta -- the Phillies flexed their muscle early against the Dodgers in a matchup of NL division leaders.\n\nSchwarber hit a two-RBI single in the second inning for a 3-0 lead.\n\nThe Phillies busted the game open with a six-run fourth off Dodgers starter Bobby Miller (1-2) that saw the right-hander's ERA balloon from 6.12 to a 8.07. The Phillies led 4-0 when Turner -- who left the Dodgers for Philadelphia on a $300 million, 11-year contract ahead of the 2023 season -- drove an 86 mph slider into the left field seats.\n\nNo need for Phillies fans to manufacture a standing ovation for Turner this season. A 2024 NL All-Star, Turner has five homers in his last seven games.\n\nStott added a solo shot off Miller later in the fourth, his first since May 18.\n\nHarper went 0 for 4. Harper strained his left hamstring running the bases in the ninth inning, and Schwarber strained his left groin while making a throw from left field in the eighth of a June 27 loss against Miami.\n\nWheeler threw 76 pitches -- he struck out Dodgers leadoff hitter Shohei Ohtani on three pitches to open the game -- and left with the Phillies holding a 9-1 lead. He allowed three hits, struck out seven and walked two. Wheeler allowed a solo home run to Cavan Biggio in the fifth inning.\n\nHe won't be available for the National League staff in next week's All-Star game. Wheeler and the Phillies agreed in March on a $126 million, three-year deal for 2025-27 that has the fourth-highest average salary in baseball history at $42 million.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nDodgers placed All-Star right-hander Tyler Glasnow on the 15-day injured list with back tightness, retroactive to July 6.\n\nThe 30-year-old Glasnow is 8-5 with a 3.47 ERA in his first season with the Dodgers. He was acquired in a December trade with Tampa Bay and received a $136.5 million, five-year contract to return to Southern California.\n\nPhillies CF Johan Rojas was hit by a pitch near his wrist in the seventh. The Dodgers then brought in position player Kik\u00e9 Hernandez to pitch and he retired Schwarber to end the inning.\n\nNEXT START\n\nPhillies RHP Tyler Phillips gets the start Saturday against Oakland. He made his big league debut out of the bullpen Sunday in Atlanta and allowed one run in four innings. He struck out the first four he faced.", "source": {"uri": "tsn.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "TSN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki",

Their leftfielders rank 26th in weighted on-base average (.284) and weighted runs created plus (82) this season.\n\nLeft field is about the only position that has been a disappointment for the Phillies in 2024.

The 29-year-old is hitting .277/.351/.540 with 18 homers in 76 games.\n\nThe cost for Rooker could be steep because he's only making $750,000 this season and is under team control through 2027.\n\nThe Phillies don't have a great farm system, but president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski won't hesitate to move his best prospects if he has the chance to add a player who can help the MLB club win a World Series title.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_wells@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Adam Wells", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Rooker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brent Rooker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Schwarber", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Schwarber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(injury)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strain (injury)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Thomson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Thomson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Dombrowski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dave Dombrowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Farm team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1720362841/jqtamx1inedibeavaqde.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713074", "eventUri": "eng-9713074", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 168, "textEnd": 175}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 381, "textEnd": 388}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

The Phillies are then set to play the Oakland A's before the All-Star break.\n\nSchwarber and Harper are back in their customary spots in the lineup, with Schwarber leading off and Harper batting third.\n\nBut Harper, for one, said he plans to play it \"safe\" this week, and not be overly aggressive. He's coming back from a pulled hamstring suffered as he ran to first base in the ninth inning of a loss to the Miami Marlins on June 27. Schwarber hurt his groin in the eighth inning of that game.\n\nBoth missed only the minimum of 10 days.\n\nWhile Schwarber said he's back to 100%, and probably could have played last weekend in Atlanta if he wasn't on the IL, Harper wasn't as certain, saying, \"probably not.\"\n\nBut the Phillies had an off day Monday, and Harper said Tuesday that he felt good enough to play, but with a caveat.\n\n\"I'm not throwing the cloak on,\" Harper said. \"Just understanding what I need to do to stay in the lineup.\"\n\nOf course, Harper is known for doing anything but playing it safe, especially on the basepaths.\n\n\"We haven't said anything to him (about being cautious),\" Phillies manager Rob Thomson said. \"But he really, in our mind, can go 100% or he wouldn't be playing. But if he's going to be cautious, I'm OK with that.\"\n\nMLB All-Star Game: Phillies star Alec Bohm to participate in Home Run Derby\n\nArlington bound: 3 Phillies named National League starters for 2024 All-Star Game\n\nBoth players said they wanted to get back before the All-Star break, which begins next week. The Phillies were 5-4 without both Schwarber, who has 17 homers and 49 RBIs, and Harper, who leads the team with 20 homers and also has 58 RBIs to go along with a .303 batting average.\n\nHarper, who said he plans to play in the All-Star game next Tuesday, said that coming back to face the Dodgers and their star Shohei Ohtani, wasn't his motivation.\n\nThen again, Harper has always been known for performing at his best in the biggest moments. And few regular season matchups are bigger than this one. The Phillies have the best record in baseball at 58-32, and the Dodgers aren't far behind at 55-36.\n\nClearly, these two teams could see each other in late October in the NLCS.\n\n\"Obviously, you guys know the type of player that I am, and how I go about it,\" Harper said when asked if he can really play it safe. \"But obviously, for the long haul, I need to play smart this week.\"\n\nWe'll see.\n\nPhillies make roster moves for Harper, Schwarber return\n\nTo make room for Schwarber and Harper, outfielder David Dahl was designated for assignment and infielder Kody Clemens was optioned to triple-A Lehigh Valley.\n\nSouth Jersey native making first career MLB start\n\nTyler Phillips, who made his major league debut in relief during the Phillies' 6-0 loss to the Atlanta Braves, will make his first career start Saturday against the Oakland A's at Citizens Bank Park.\n\nPhillips, who grew up a Phillies fan in Lumberton, New Jersey, pitched the final four innings in relief of Michael Mercado on Sunday. Phillips struck out the first four batters he faced. He allowed a run on three hits in his four innings, striking out 7.\n\nThe 7 strikeouts broke a Phillies record that stood for 123 years for most strikeouts by a reliever. The previous record was held by Bill Duggleby, who had 6 strikeouts in relief in 1901.\n\nThomson said the plan all along was for Phillips to become a starter when he was called up to replace Spencer Turnbull on the roster when Turnbull went on the IL on June 26. But Michael Mercado got the start Sunday because Phillips wasn't on his regular turn.\n\nMercado was pulled after allowing five runs in 1 2/3 innings. Phillips will have six days of rest before his start Saturday, no doubt in front of several friends and family members.\n\n\"He was pretty excited when I told him, no doubt about it,\" Thomson said. \"I think he'll be excited on Saturday.\"", "source": {"uri": "courierpostonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Courier-Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Suarez didn't quite resemble the pitcher who lit up the Braves in the last two postseason series between the two teams, instead giving up five earned runs on two home runs on Saturday evening, making that eleven runs he's given up in his last two starts combined for the Phillies.\n\nThe Phillies have cooled off just a tad from their red hot start lately, a lot of which can be attributed to the insane amount of injuries that the team is currently experiencing.\n\nWith the MLB deadline fast approaching, and with Philadelphia not getting any healthier, it would make sense that the team would be interested in adding some depth reinforcements to their roster, and if the latest reports are any indication, one area where the team could be looking to do just that is in their outfield.\n\n\"The Philadelphia Phillies are keeping a close eye on Oakland A's left fielder Brent Rooker,\" reported MLB insider Bob Nightengale of USA Today Sports recently. \"The Phillies rank 26th in OPS among left fielders this season.\"\n\nAs previously mentioned, the Phillies are currently dealing with a bad case of the injury bug. Both Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber went on the injured list on June 28 after getting injured in the same game, with Harper injuring his hamstring and Schwarber his groin.\n\nAs for the potential interest in Rooker, left field is about the only area of defense where the Phillies haven't been stellar thus far this year, making it reasonable that the team could look to add some reinforcements in that area.\n\nIs this the year?\n\nSo far, the 2024 season has followed quite a different script for the Phillies than the last two have, even those two resulted in deep playoff runs. In 2022 and 2023, the Phillies struggled at times throughout the regular season, backdooring their way into the Wild Card round, winning that, and then upsetting the Atlanta Braves in the NLDS before setting their sites on championship contention.\n\nIn 2022, the team rode that wave all the way to the World Series, finally bowing out to the Houston Astros in six games. However, in 2023, the team fell to the Arizona Diamondbacks in the NLCS despite going up two games to zero and having two different chances to close out the series in front of their home fans.\n\nIn 2024, however, the Phillies have been dominant so far in the regular season, cruising to the best record in the league and looking the part of legitimate championship favorites at this juncture. It remains to be seen whether that expectation will get to them come postseason time or whether they thrive off of the underdog energy they have embraced over the last two years in order to be the best version of themselves.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jackson_stone@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jackson Stone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truist_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truist Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Schwarber", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Schwarber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Division_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League Division Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Arena_and_Indoor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Arena and Indoor", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/7580818102.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713074", "eventUri": "eng-9713074", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 1406, "textEnd": 1413}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The Phillies lost their two biggest sluggers, their clubhouse leaders and even a few games -- the NL East leaders went 5-4 without them -- while they recovered from their injuries. Harper strained his left hamstring running the bases in the ninth inning, and Schwarber strained his left groin while making a throw from left field in the eighth.\n\nSchwarber was the designated hitter and leading off Tuesday against the Dodgers and Harper was hitting third and playing first base.\n\n\"I want to play smart, I want to do it the right way, just have a good week,\" Harper said ahead of the opener against the Dodgers.\n\nA two-time NL MVP, Harper was hitting .303 with 20 doubles, 20 homers and 58 RBIs and was named National League player of the month for May and June. He is near the top of the NL in several categories, including average, homers, RBIs, on-base percentage, slugging percentage and on-base plus slugging percentage.\n\nHarper also said he would play in the July 16 All-Star Game at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas.\n\nHarper topped the NL and was second in the big leagues behind New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge with 3,277,920 votes. He was chosen for his eighth All-Star Game, his seventh as a starter. His previous All-Star appearances came as an outfielder and designated hitter.\n\n\"I'm not throwing the cloak on,\" Harper said.\n\nSchwarber was batting .250 with 17 homers and 49 RBIs and was leading the NL in walks before he was injured while playing the outfield for just the third time this season.\n\n\"I'm 100% and that was kind of the the biggest thing,\" Schwarber said. \"Just making sure it's going to be 100% and not grinding through it and trying to just play and work on getting healthy. It was just, getting healthy first and being able to play.\"\n\nThe Phillies designated outfielder David Dahl for assignment and optioned infielder Kody Clemens to Triple-A Lehigh Valley ahead of the three-game series. Clemens hit .242 in 24 games with the Phillies, while Dahl batted .207 in 19 games.\n\nThe Phillies are still playing without catcher J.T. Realmuto after he underwent surgery in June to remove cartilage in his right knee. The three-time All-Star had seven homers and his 17-game hitting streak in May was the longest for a Phillies catcher in baseball's modern era.\n\n\"Once you get J.T. back,\" Schwarber said, \"hopefully that's kind of that last little speed bump that we hit where we can finish this thing out healthy and strong and see where we go.\"\n\nThe Phillies are 13-12 since Realmuto was placed on the 10-day IL on June 10. In Realmuto's absence, Harper leads the club in OPS (1.185), Schwarber ranks second (1.096) and shortstop Trea Turner ranks third (.926).\n\nThe Phillies entered Tuesday night with the best record in baseball at 58-32 and the Dodgers led the NL West at 55-36. The Phillies expected another packed house at Citizens Bank Park -- their season attendance of 1,919,133 is behind only the Dodgers and Yankees -- in the first visit of the season from Shohei Ohtani.\n\n\"It's always fun when you can walk into a place, especially at home, and you know that you're going to get an electric atmosphere,\" Schwarber said.\n\nIt's the seventh game in which Harper and Ohtani have faced off against each other. Harper and Ohtani are two of only three active players in MLB with multiple MVPs.

The Phillies have reinstated first baseman Bryce Harper and designated hitter Kyle Schwarber from the 10-day injured list and could have both key players as they face the Los Angeles Dodgers in a matchup of division leaders.\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber are back in the lineup for the Philadelphia Phillies -- count Harper in for the All-Star Game, too -- just in time for a series against Los Angeles in a matchup of National League division leaders.\n\nHarper and Schwarber were both injured late in a June 27 loss against Miami. The Phillies lost their two biggest sluggers, their clubhouse leaders and even a few games -- the NL East leaders went 5-4 without them -- while they recovered from their injuries. Harper strained his left hamstring running the bases in the ninth inning, and Schwarber strained his left groin while making a throw from left field in the eighth.\n\nSchwarber was the designated hitter and leading off Tuesday against the Dodgers and Harper was hitting third and playing first base.\n\n\"I want to play smart, I want to do it the right way, just have a good week,\" Harper said ahead of the opener against the Dodgers.\n\nA two-time NL MVP, Harper was hitting .303 with 20 doubles, 20 homers and 58 RBIs and was named National League player of the month for May and June. He is near the top of the NL in several categories, including average, homers, RBIs, on-base percentage, slugging percentage and on-base plus slugging percentage.\n\nHarper also said he would play in the July 16 All-Star Game at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas.\n\nHarper topped the NL and was second in the big leagues behind New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge with 3,277,920 votes. He was chosen for his eighth All-Star Game, his seventh as a starter. His previous All-Star appearances came as an outfielder and designated hitter.\n\n\"I'm not throwing the cloak on,\" Harper said.\n\nSchwarber was batting .250 with 17 homers and 49 RBIs and was leading the NL in walks before he was injured while playing the outfield for just the third time this season.\n\n\"I'm 100% and that was kind of the the biggest thing,\" Schwarber said. \"Just making sure it's going to be 100% and not grinding through it and trying to just play and work on getting healthy. It was just, getting healthy first and being able to play.\"\n\nThe Phillies designated outfielder David Dahl for assignment and optioned infielder Kody Clemens to Triple-A Lehigh Valley ahead of the three-game series. Clemens hit .242 in 24 games with the Phillies, while Dahl batted .207 in 19 games.\n\nThe Phillies are still playing without catcher J.T. Realmuto after he underwent surgery in June to remove cartilage in his right knee. The three-time All-Star had seven homers and his 17-game hitting streak in May was the longest for a Phillies catcher in baseball's modern era.\n\n\"Once you get J.T. back,\" Schwarber said, \"hopefully that's kind of that last little speed bump that we hit where we can finish this thing out healthy and strong and see where we go.\"\n\nThe Phillies are 13-12 since Realmuto was placed on the 10-day IL on June 10. In Realmuto's absence, Harper leads the club in OPS (1.185), Schwarber ranks second (1.096) and shortstop Trea Turner ranks third (.926).\n\nThe Phillies entered Tuesday night with the best record in baseball at 58-32 and the Dodgers led the NL West at 55-36. The Phillies expected another packed house at Citizens Bank Park -- their season attendance of 1,919,133 is behind only the Dodgers and Yankees -- in the first visit of the season from Shohei Ohtani.\n\n\"It's always fun when you can walk into a place, especially at home, and you know that you're going to get an electric atmosphere,\" Schwarber said.\n\nIt's the seventh game in which Harper and Ohtani have faced off against each other. Harper and Ohtani are two of only three active players in MLB with multiple MVPs. Los Angeles Angels slugger Mike Trout has three.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_gelston@register-herald.com", "name": "Dan Gelston", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Schwarber", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Schwarber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globe_Life_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Globe Life Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Clemens", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roger Clemens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._T._Realmuto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

The Phillies are 58-32 on the season, while the Dodgers are 55-36. They hold the top two spots in the NL playoff picture heading into the final week before the All-Star break. Zack Wheeler (9-4, 2.74 ERA) is on the hill for the Phillies, while Bobby Miller (1-1, 6.12 ERA) is scheduled to get the start for L.A.\n\nFirst pitch is 6:40 p.m. ET at Citizens Bank Park. The latest Dodgers vs. Phillies odds list Philadelphia as the -141 favorite (risk $141 to win $100). The over/under is 9. Before making any Phillies vs. Dodgers picks, be sure to check out the MLB predictions and betting advice from SportsLine's proven computer model.\n\nThe SportsLine Projection Model simulates every MLB game 10,000 times. It entered Week 16 of the 2024 MLB season a profitable 49-37 on all-top rated MLB picks this season. Dating back to last season, it is on a 24-9 roll on top-rated run-line picks (+1077). Anybody following has seen strong returns.\n\nNow, the model has set its sights on Dodgers vs. Phillies and just locked in its picks and MLB predictions. You can head to SportsLine now to see the model's picks. Now, here are several MLB odds and betting lines for Phillies vs. Dodgers:\n\nDodgers vs. Phillies money line: Phillies -141, Dodgers +120 Dodgers vs. Phillies run line: Phillies -1.5 (+142) Dodgers vs. Phillies over/under: 9 runsDodgers vs. Phillies picks: See picks at SportsLineWhy you should back the Dodgers\n\nThe upcoming break is coming at a great time for the Phillies because they are dealing with several injuries. Bryce Harper (hamstring), Kyle Schwarber (groin) and J.T. Realmuto (knee) have all been out of the lineup recently. The Phillies dropped two of three against the Braves over the weekend and have now lost three out of their last four total.\n\nLos Angeles, meanwhile, took two of three against a strong Milwaukee squad over the weekend. Miller's season-long numbers aren't impressive, but it's been a relatively small sample size. He was sharper last time out, scattering four hits and two earned runs in five innings in a win over the Diamondbacks on July 2. Los Angeles is rarely a money-line underdog, giving bettors an opportunity to get a plus-money return with just a win. See which team to pick here.\n\nWhy you should back the Phillies\n\nThe pitching matchup certainly slants in Philly's favor with Wheeler on the hill. The veteran enters this matchup pitching extremely well, giving up just five earned runs over 19.2 innings in his last three starters. He's struck out 20 during that span. He'll also face a lineup that's missing Mookie Betts (wrist).\n\nWhile bettors backing Los Angeles this season have seen a negative return on the money line, the Phillies have returned +582 combined on the money line in all games. They're also +476 at home and +423 when favored, so several betting trends are working in their favor. See which team to pick here.\n\nHow to make Phillies vs. Dodgers picks\n\nSportsLine's model is leaning Over on the run total, projecting 9.6 combined runs. It also says one side of the money line has all the value. You can only get the MLB model's picks and analysis at SportsLine.\n\nSo who wins Dodgers vs. Phillies, and which side has all the value?

A 2024 All-Star, Wheeler (10-4) joined Aaron Nola and Ranger Su\u00e1rez as a trio of Phillies pitchers with 10 wins before the All-Star break. It's the first time in franchise history the Phillies have three pitchers with 10 wins before the break.\n\nAfter a modest 5-4 mark with Harper and Schwarber sidelined -- that included dropping two of three over the weekend in Atlanta -- the Phillies flexed their muscle early against the Dodgers in a matchup of NL division leaders.\n\nSchwarber hit a two-RBI single in the second inning for a 3-0 lead.\n\nThe Phillies busted the game open with a six-run fourth off Dodgers starter Bobby Miller (1-2) that saw the right-hander's ERA balloon from 6.12 to a 8.07. The Phillies led 4-0 when Turner -- who left the Dodgers for Philadelphia on a $300 million, 11-year contract ahead of the 2023 season -- drove an 86 mph slider into the left field seats.\n\nNo need for Phillies fans to manufacture a standing ovation for Turner this season. A 2024 NL All-Star, Turner has five homers in his last seven games.\n\nStott added a solo shot off Miller later in the fourth, his first since May 18.\n\nHarper went 0 for 4. Harper strained his left hamstring running the bases in the ninth inning, and Schwarber strained his left groin while making a throw from left field in the eighth of a June 27 loss against Miami.\n\nWheeler threw 76 pitches -- he struck out Dodgers leadoff hitter Shohei Ohtani on three pitches to open the game -- and left with the Phillies holding a 9-1 lead. He allowed three hits, struck out seven and walked two. Wheeler allowed a solo home run to Cavan Biggio in the fifth inning.\n\nHe won't be available for the National League staff in next week's All-Star game. Wheeler and the Phillies agreed in March on a $126 million, three-year deal for 2025-27 that has the fourth-highest average salary in baseball history at $42 million.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nDodgers placed All-Star right-hander Tyler Glasnow on the 15-day injured list with back tightness, retroactive to July 6.\n\nThe 30-year-old Glasnow is 8-5 with a 3.47 ERA in his first season with the Dodgers. He was acquired in a December trade with Tampa Bay and received a $136.5 million, five-year contract to return to Southern California.\n\nPhillies CF Johan Rojas was hit by a pitch near his wrist in the seventh. The Dodgers then brought in position player Kik\u00e9 Hernandez to pitch and he retired Schwarber to end the inning.\n\nNEXT START\n\nPhillies RHP Tyler Phillips gets the start Saturday against Oakland.

The 25-year-old fireballer has also struggled on the road (15 ER in 14 IP) as opposed to at home (2 ER in 11 IP), and some of that damage has been due to allowing four home runs in four starts on the road.\n\nThe Phillies are also one of the best F5 ML teams in the league, boasting a 56-27-7 mark overall and a 33-10-4 record at home. Kyle Schwarber and Bryce Harper are also expected to be activated before tonight's game, and there's currently a heat wave affecting the city of Philadelphia.\n\nThe ball should be flying off the Phillies' big bats while Wheeler keeps the Dodgers quiet through at least five.\n\nDodgers vs Phillies same-game parlay (SGP)\n\nI'm expecting the Phillies to get to Bobby Miller early and often, and the return of Harper and Schwarber should help them get off the schneid and get their lineup back into the swing of things.\n\nHarper was on fire before hitting the injured list, recording 2+ total bases in eight of his last 10 contests and five straight at home.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nDodgers vs Phillies spread and Over/Under analysis\n\nDodgers vs Phillies trend\n\nPhiladelphia has hit the F5 moneyline in 49 of their last 75 games (+21.10 Units / 16% ROI).

The Phillies lost their two biggest sluggers, their clubhouse leaders and even a few games - the NL East leaders went 5-4 without them - while they recovered from their injuries. Harper strained his left hamstring running the bases in the ninth inning, and Schwarber strained his left groin while making a throw from left field in the eighth.\n\nSchwarber was the designated hitter and leading off Tuesday against the Dodgers and Harper was hitting third and playing first base.\n\n\"I want to play smart, I want to do it the right way, just have a good week,\" Harper said ahead of the opener against the Dodgers.\n\nA two-time NL MVP, Harper was hitting .303 with 20 doubles, 20 homers and 58 RBIs and was named National League player of the month for May and June. He is near the top of the NL in several categories, including average, homers, RBIs, on-base percentage, slugging percentage and on-base plus slugging percentage.\n\nHarper also said he would play in the July 16 All-Star Game at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas.\n\nHarper topped the NL and was second in the big leagues behind New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge with 3,277,920 votes. He was chosen for his eighth All-Star Game, his seventh as a starter. His previous All-Star appearances came as an outfielder and designated hitter.\n\n\"I'm not throwing the cloak on,\" Harper said.\n\nSchwarber was batting .250 with 17 homers and 49 RBIs and was leading the NL in walks before he was injured while playing the outfield for just the third time this season.\n\n\"I'm 100% and that was kind of the the biggest thing,\" Schwarber said. \"Just making sure it's going to be 100% and not grinding through it and trying to just play and work on getting healthy. It was just, getting healthy first and being able to play.\"\n\nThe Phillies designated outfielder David Dahl for assignment and optioned infielder Kody Clemens to Triple-A Lehigh Valley ahead of the three-game series. Clemens hit .242 in 24 games with the Phillies, while Dahl batted .207 in 19 games.\n\nThe Phillies are still playing without catcher J.T. Realmuto after he underwent surgery in June to remove cartilage in his right knee. The three-time All-Star had seven homers and his 17-game hitting streak in May was the longest for a Phillies catcher in baseball's modern era.\n\n\"Once you get J.T. back,\" Schwarber said, \"hopefully that's kind of that last little speed bump that we hit where we can finish this thing out healthy and strong and see where we go.\"\n\nThe Phillies are 13-12 since Realmuto was placed on the 10-day IL on June 10. In Realmuto's absence, Harper leads the club in OPS (1.185), Schwarber ranks second (1.096) and shortstop Trea Turner ranks third (.926).\n\nThe Phillies entered Tuesday night with the best record in baseball at 58-32 and the Dodgers led the NL West at 55-36. The Phillies expected another packed house at Citizens Bank Park - their season attendance of 1,919,133 is behind only the Dodgers and Yankees - in the first visit of the season from Shohei Ohtani.\n\n\"It's always fun when you can walk into a place, especially at home, and you know that you're going to get an electric atmosphere,\" Schwarber said.\n\nIt's the seventh game in which Harper and Ohtani have faced off against each other. Harper and Ohtani are two of only three active players in MLB with multiple MVPs. Los Angeles Angels slugger Mike Trout has three.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_gelston@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Dan Gelston", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Schwarber", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Schwarber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globe_Life_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Globe Life Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Clemens", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roger Clemens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._T._Realmuto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

This is old hat for L.AA, a team built around stars that is chugging through another relatively easy regular season. They are always sending a minibus full of guys to the All-Star Game. They've sent at least five players every year since 2019, and at least four in seven of the last 10 years. The Dodgers are good.\n\nThis week, however, they will play in Philadelphia. The three-game set at Citizens Bank Park will begin Tuesday night, and eyes across baseball will be watching as the National League's top two teams square off. The results will fuel analysis, trade rumors and trash talk, disregarding just about every game each team has played previously this season.\n\nWhat those games have shown, though, is that the Phillies (58-32) are better than the Dodgers (55-36), record-wise. They are also better than the Dodgers All-Star-wise, because while the Dodgers are sending six players again, the Phillies are sending seven -- a franchise record and the most of any team this year.\n\nThe NL's starting infield (selected by fan vote) will feature Bryce Harper (should he return from injury), Alec Bohm and Trea Turner, and the NL pitching staff (selected by MLB player vote) will have Zack Wheeler, Ranger Suarez, Matt Strahm, and Jeff Hoffman. Wheeler may not pitch, as he's scheduled to make a start two days before the All-Star Game, so he likely won't become more familiar to the media -- FOX Sports spelled his name wrong when they announced the pitching staff.\n\nWhat's immediately cool about this particular group of All-Stars is that four of the seven are making the team for the first time. Bohm's big league accolades to this point include being the runner-up for the 2020 NL Rookie of the Year award, and leading the league in sac flies (2022) and in grounding into double plays (2023). Strahm and Hoffman are both seasoned hurlers who escaped from struggling teams and came into their own in their early thirties, after the Phillies had determined them worthy of signing. And Suarez, when asked about his All-Star chances after a recent rough outing against the Braves after a dominant start to the year, shook his head sadly.\n\nBut these are four huge success stories, both for the players personally and for the Phillies organization. This was not a team where players came to become All-Stars. It was a place where All-Stars were traded for a handful of minor leaguers who wouldn't work out. Like today's Rockies, who are trying to frame \"fan favorite\" Jake Cave as a trade chip because he has seven hits in five July starts and finally got the ball over the fence the other day (in Denver, no less, where it's supposed to be even easier to do that).\n\nThat used to be the Phillies -- literally, in Cave's case, since he played for them last year -- but also historically. The Phillies squeezed all the innings they could out of Terry Mulholland, then hosted the All-Star Game in 1996 and traded him to Seattle for Desi Relaford two weeks later.\n\nNow, the Phillies are seeing All-Stars everywhere. There will be haters, of course. They'll say things like, \"Francisco Lindor should be starting over Trea Turner at shortstop,\" and \"Seriously, Lindor has more hits, home runs, RBI and stolen bases than Turner. What is happening?!?\"\n\nThese people are Mets fans, and can generally be silenced by securely fastening the manhole cover back on the sewer drain. But their point, while ignorable, has merit.\n\nWhat's happening is:\n\nWhat's perfect about the current All-Star selection system is that it really opens the door for the unhinged and chronically online to make their mark on baseball, though, thankfully, they can't repeatedly click \"submit ballot\" like back in the old internet days.\n\nAnd yet, allowing fans to vote is an instant advantage.Turner being named the starting shortstop for the NL All-Star team isn't because he is literally the best shortstop in the National League. It's because the Phillies are the best team in the NL and Turner is their shortstop. People are excited about the Phillies. Well, Phillies fans. Phillies fans are excited about the Phillies. And when Phillies fans get excited about the Phillies, they find outlets for their emotions.\n\nYelling at sports radio is one. Starting a podcast is another. There's the old standard of weaponizing social media to taunt rival fans or threatening to decapitate and eat the Braves' mascot. By that standard, All-Star voting is probably the most wholesome way to learn that this city is frantic about its Phillies again, and you see it when every Phillies player, whether he is having an All-Star season or not, is getting votes to appear in the All-Star game.\n\nEven with most Phillies getting significant numbers of votes this year, you'll be shocked to learn that not every Phillies player got in. Bryce Harper wakes up an All-Star every morning, and Alec Bohm is having the best season of his career. They would have gotten votes from non-Phillies supporters and fans of great hair regardless. Turner is an established star having a fantastic year who missed a month with an injury. But according to voting updates before the selections were finalized, there were Phillies in the mix for just about every position for a while, from free-swinging-and-missing Nick Castellanos to can't-hit-lefties Brandon Marsh to at-one-point-demoted-to-the-minors Johan Rojas.\n\nThe reason that you saw such a great turnout for Phillies players, from the struggling to the elite, is because the Phillies are back. They've made the postseason the last two years, they are an established postseason contender, and the fans reflect that in their voting for, say, Kyle Schwarber over Shohei Ohtani.\n\nAs the Phillies send a record number of league-best players to Texas for the Midsummer Classic, we'll obviously enjoy it. We'll enjoy it even if Wheeler and Harper don't play. We'll enjoy seeing how Marsh finds a way to be around and how Bohm fares in the Home Run Derby. But beyond all of that is the general enjoyment of this summer, this season, and this team, because the All-Star Game is another reflection of how good they are -- and how beloved they've become.",

They can close that gap with a series win, starting with tonight's opening game in Philadelphia.\n\nLet's dive into everything you need to know to bet on this National League showdown.\n\nBobby Miller: The Dodgers pitcher makes his fourth start since returning from injury and hasn't had his best stuff. He has a 6.75 ERA in 13.1 innings pitched in those games and now he has to face a potent Phillies lineup. Him rounding into form tonight is going to be the key to the Dodgers' success.\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies\n\nBryce Harper: The Phillies' star is eligible to come off the IL today and while he has yet to be confirmed as starting tonight, whether or not he plays is going to be the key to tonight's game. He's batting .303 on the season with 20 home runs and 58 RBIs. If he plays, the Dodgers could be in trouble.\n\nDodgers vs. Phillies Prediction and Pick\n\nI'm a Bobby Miller fan, but I simply can't back the Dodgers when he starts until he has proven he has rounded back into form. After a rough first three starts since his return, a game against the Phillies offense is not an easy time to lock things in.\n\nEven if Miller does have a strong start, he has to try to outduel Zack Wheeler, the betting favorite to win the NL Cy Young.\n\nThe key to tonight's game is the potential return of Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber. If they both hit the starting lineups tonight, the Dodgers could be in trouble with Miller on the mound.\n\nI'll back the Phillies as home favorites in tonight's NL showdown.\n\nPick: Phillies -142\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.\n\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, call 1-800-GAMBLER.\n\nYou can check out all of Iain's bets here!\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Dodgers vs. Phillies Prediction, Odds, Probable Pitchers for Tuesday, July 9.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Schwarber", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Schwarber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Wheeler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zack Wheeler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young Award"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/9kpwlo/picture289882199/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/23ab3180-3810-47f7-af5b-739f91b2ee18", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713074", "eventUri": "eng-9713074", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 2145, "textEnd": 2151}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The Phillies lost their two biggest sluggers, their clubhouse leaders and even a few games -- the NL East leaders went 5-4 without them -- while they recovered from their injuries. Harper strained his left hamstring running the bases in the ninth inning, and Schwarber strained his left groin while making a throw from left field in the eighth.\n\nSchwarber was the designated hitter and leading off Tuesday against the Dodgers and Harper was hitting third and playing first base.\n\n\"I want to play smart, I want to do it the right way, just have a good week,\" Harper said ahead of the opener against the Dodgers.\n\nA two-time NL MVP, Harper was hitting .303 with 20 doubles, 20 homers and 58 RBIs and was named National League player of the month for May and June. He is near the top of the NL in several categories, including average, homers, RBIs, on-base percentage, slugging percentage and on-base plus slugging percentage.\n\nHarper also said he would play in the July 16 All-Star Game at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas.\n\nHarper topped the NL and was second in the big leagues behind New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge with 3,277,920 votes. He was chosen for his eighth All-Star Game, his seventh as a starter. His previous All-Star appearances came as an outfielder and designated hitter.\n\n\"I'm not throwing the cloak on,\" Harper said.\n\nSchwarber was batting .250 with 17 homers and 49 RBIs and was leading the NL in walks before he was injured while playing the outfield for just the third time this season.\n\n\"I'm 100% and that was kind of the the biggest thing,\" Schwarber said. \"Just making sure it's going to be 100% and not grinding through it and trying to just play and work on getting healthy. It was just, getting healthy first and being able to play.\"\n\nThe Phillies designated outfielder David Dahl for assignment and optioned infielder Kody Clemens to Triple-A Lehigh Valley ahead of the three-game series. Clemens hit .242 in 24 games with the Phillies, while Dahl batted .207 in 19 games.\n\nThe Phillies are still playing without catcher J.T. Realmuto after he underwent surgery in June to remove cartilage in his right knee. The three-time All-Star had seven homers and his 17-game hitting streak in May was the longest for a Phillies catcher in baseball's modern era.\n\n\"Once you get J.T. back,\" Schwarber said, \"hopefully that's kind of that last little speed bump that we hit where we can finish this thing out healthy and strong and see where we go.\"\n\nThe Phillies are 13-12 since Realmuto was placed on the 10-day IL on June 10. In Realmuto's absence, Harper leads the club in OPS (1.185), Schwarber ranks second (1.096) and shortstop Trea Turner ranks third (.926).\n\nThe Phillies entered Tuesday night with the best record in baseball at 58-32 and the Dodgers led the NL West at 55-36. The Phillies expected another packed house at Citizens Bank Park -- their season attendance of 1,919,133 is behind only the Dodgers and Yankees -- in the first visit of the season from Shohei Ohtani.\n\n\"It's always fun when you can walk into a place, especially at home, and you know that you're going to get an electric atmosphere,\" Schwarber said.\n\nIt's the seventh game in which Harper and Ohtani have faced off against each other. Harper and Ohtani are two of only three active players in MLB with multiple MVPs. Los Angeles Angels slugger Mike Trout has three.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Wheeler will join Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, Alec Bohm, Ranger Suarez, Jeff Hoffman and Matt Strahm at the Midsummer Classic on July 16 in Arlington, Texas.\n\n\"It could be more than that,\" Wheeler said of the Phillies' All-Star contingent. \"It shows how well we've been playing as a group. Everybody on the roster is a part of every game and winning.\"\n\nIn Wheeler's last start against the Chicago Cubs on Wednesday, the right-hander allowed five hits and two runs over six innings in a no-decision.\n\nWheeler is 2-2 with a 4.72 ERA in six career starts against the Dodgers.\n\nThe Phillies will look for a bounce-back performance after a 6-0 road loss against the Atlanta Braves, who trimmed the Phillies' National League East lead to eight games.\n\nWhit Merrifield had two hits but the Phillies managed only five overall.\n\nThe Phillies should receive major boosts with the returns of Harper (strained left hamstring) and Kyle Schwarber (strained left groin) from the 10-day injured list in time for Tuesday. Harper ran the bases before Sunday's game at about 100 percent intensity and didn't experience any setbacks, saying he felt good.\n\nSchwarber also ran the bases and manager Rob Thomson had intimated that the veteran slugger was expected to be activated on Tuesday. In corresponding moves, the Phillies optioned infielder Kody Clemens to Triple-A Lehigh Valley and designated outfielder David Dahl for assignment.\n\nThe Dodgers will arrive in Philadelphia having won two of three against the NL Central-leading Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nHowever, the Dodgers fell flat on Sunday and lost 9-2.\n\nChris Taylor hit a two-run home run to provide the Dodgers' offense. The team went 1-for-9 with runners in scoring position and left 11 on base.\n\nShohei Ohtani, one of six Dodgers' All-Stars, stole two bases and has 28 home runs and 20 stolen bases this year. Ohtani joins Davey Lopes (1979) and Matt Kemp (2011) as the only Dodgers to accumulate at least 20 homers and 20 steals before the All-Star break.\n\nLos Angeles' other All-Stars are Will Smith, Teoscar Hernandez, Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman and Tyler Glasnow.\n\nBetts is on the injured list with a fractured left hand and will miss this series and the All-Star Game.\n\n\"I think there's six of us, that's pretty special,\" Freeman said. \"When you've got over 20 percent of your team going to an All-Star Game, that means you've got a pretty good team. So it's going to be fun. Great group of guys.\"\n\nDespite missing Betts, the Dodgers entered Monday with a 7 1/2-game cushion in the NL West.\n\n\"I think we've done a nice job of sort of trying to weather it and still winning baseball games,\" manager Dave Roberts said. \"We won a series against a good ballclub over there.\"\n\nThe Dodgers will hand the ball to Bobby Miller (1-1, 6.12). In a no-decision against the Arizona Diamondbacks last Tuesday, the right-hander gave up four hits and two runs in five innings. He struck out four and walked three.\n\nMiller is 1-0 in one career start against the Phillies, tossing six scoreless innings on June 10, 2023.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri":

The Phils are once again home favorites following Tuesday night's win.\n\nPhiladelphia took it to Los Angeles last night with a big 10-1 victory to move to 34-14 at home on the season. The Dodgers have now lost four of their last six games.\n\nCan the Phillies keep it up tonight? Read on for our Dodgers vs. Phillies prediction and MLB picks for Wednesday, July 10th.\n\nCristopher Sanchez has emerged as a stud starting pitcher for the Philadelphia Phillies this season. The reigning NL pitcher of the month hit a bump in the road in his last start but should see some success back at home tonight.\n\nSanchez is 6-4 with a 2.96 ERA and 1.24 overall this season, including 5-1 with a 1.35 ERA (9 ER in 60 IP) and 0.90 WHIP at home. He's allowed fewer than three earned runs in 12 of 17 starts this season and all five of those poor outings came on the road.\n\nIt's also encouraging that Sanchez hasn't allowed more than two earned runs in back-to-back starts. The Cubs tagged him for seven runs through four innings last time out following a complete-game shutout at home to end June.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers are also struggling a bit as of late. They've scored just three runs total in their last two games and a total of 23 runs in their last six games (3.83 per game). On the season, they're averaging 5.1 runs per nine innings and 4.9 against left-handed starters.\n\nDodgers vs Phillies same-game parlay (SGP)\n\nThe Phillies are the best team in baseball at 59-32 (.648 PCT) and even better at home with a 34-14 record (.708 PCT). Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber returned from the IL on Tuesday and the Phillies scored 10 runs without them making much of an impact.\n\nI'm expecting the Phillies to stay hot here but not necessarily put up a crooked number again. Gavin Stone has been strong for the Dodgers at 9-2 with a 3.03 ERA and 1.19 WHIP. He's typically gone six or seven innings while allowing three runs or fewer.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nDodgers vs Phillies spread and Over/Under analysis\n\nDodgers vs Phillies trend\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies have hit the Moneyline in 30 of their last 38 games at home (+15.50 Units / 21% ROI).

Through 19 starts and 116.2 innings, Wheeler is 10-4 and has 126 strikeouts with a 2.70 ERA.\n\nThe Phillies had just received some positive injury news earlier in the day when designated hitter Kyle Schwarber (groin) and first baseman Bryce Harper (hamstring) were activated off of the 10-day injured list before losing Wheeler.\n\nSchwarber made his return to the lineup known early, roping a two-run single to center in the second to give the Phillies a 3-0 lead. Schwarber also scored a run in the fourth, crossing home plate after shortstop Trea Turner's home run.\n\nThe Phillies continued to show why they are the best team in baseball after Tuesday's win, as their MLB-best record climbed to 59-32 and their lead over the Atlanta Braves increased to eight games.\n\nWith the Phillies having such a big lead over the Braves in the NL East, it may be smart for them to exercise as much caution as possible with Wheeler.\n\nIf the Phillies decide to go that route, they could hold Wheeler out until after the All-Star break. With the All-Star game on Tuesday July 16, The Phillies' next game after the four-day break is on Friday July 19 against the Pittsburgh Pirates, giving them the ability to give Wheeler up to two weeks off while only skipping one of his starts in the rotation, having him return on Tuesday, July 23 against the Minnesota Twins.\n\nWhatever the Phillies' plan is, they have to be thrilled that Wheeler's injury doesn't seem serious. Even though they have plenty of depth in the rotation, with fellow All-Star Ranger Suarez, Aaron Nola, and newly-extended Cristopher Sanchez all having excellent seasons, Wheeler is the Phillies' unquestioned ace.

His .303 batting average, 20 home runs, 58 RBIs and .981 OPS make him a legitimate MVP candidate, so this setback is certainly disappointing on an individual level.\n\nOf course, the long-term health of Schwarber (mild groin strain) cannot merely be glossed over. The 31-year-old is quietly putting together one of his most complete MLB campaigns. As expected, the power numbers are there - 17 homers, .447 slugging percentage and .820 OPS - but his batting average is much higher than anticipated at .250.\n\nAlthough Schwarber has been dubbed 'Mr. June,' he is another difference-maker Phillies manager Rob Thomson will rely on in October.\n\nWhile neither injury was considered serious, it's good news for the Phillies that both players returned after brief stays on the IL. While the team still holds a 7.5 game lead on the division rival Atlanta Braves, that lead has shrunk in the last week after Philadelphia lost two of three to Atlanta. Getting a pair of key bats back in the lineup for the stretch run is just what the doctor ordered.\n\nThe Phillies (58-32) and the Dodgers (55-36) have the two best records in the National League. This should be an exciting three-game series to watch as it's possible that this series ends up determining home-field advantage in the NLCS with the World Series on the line.\n\nWhile the Dodgers have an impressive lineup of their own with Shohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman, and Teoscar Hernandez all capable of doing damage (Mookie Betts is out with a broken hand), the Phillies' pitching staff is one of the better groups in baseball. On Tuesday, Philadelphia ace Zach Wheeler takes on Bobby Miller in a game where the Phillies surely have the upper hand on the mound.\n\nWednesday's pitching matchup between Cristopher Sanchez and Gavin Stone evens things out a bit. Stone is having a stellar season for the Dodgers, going 9-2 with a 3.03 ERA. On Thursday, the series wraps with Aaron Nola squaring off against Landon Knack.\n\nWith Harper and Schwarber back in the lineup, it will be good to see the Phillies testing themselves against the other elite team in the National League.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_sampson@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Peter

In the first game of the season between the NL's two best teams, the Phillies improved their MLB-best record (59-32) and delivered a loud message to their potential future postseason opponent.\n\nHarper (hamstring) and Schwarber (groin) had both been sidelined since June 27. They were both activated from the injured list and back in their usual spots in the lineup on Tuesday.\n\nIt was a slow night for Harper, who finished 0-for-4 at the plate and didn't account for a run. His teammates more than made up for his lack of production.\n\nSchwarber knocked in two runs with a two-out single in the bottom of the second inning to extend a 1-0 Phillies lead to 3-0.\n\nHe then walked in the fourth to set Turner up to blow the game open. With the bases loaded and no outs in a 4-0 game, Turner launched a Miller slider that hung over the middle of the plate into the left-field bleachers for a grand slam.\n\nThree batters later, Bryson Stott sent a solo shot over the right-field wall to extend the lead to 9-0.\n\nBy the time the fourth inning was over, each Phillies batter had taken a turn at the plate. Philadelphia plated six runs in the inning, and Miller's night was done. He allowed nine earned runs on 10 hits including two home runs and three walks. He recorded two strikeouts.\n\nFrom there, the Dodgers managed to get on the board with a Cavan Biggio solo home run. But that was all the damage done against Phillies starter Zack Wheeler. Shortstop Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez was on the mound by seventh inning to spare the Dodgers bullpen as the Phillies cruised to victory.\n\nTurner finished the night 3-for-4 at the plate with the grand slam. His was one of three Phillies home runs alongside Stott's solo shot and a Brandon Marsh solo home run in the seventh.\n\nThe only bad news of the night for the Phillies arrived after Wheeler left the game. He was done after six innings and a season-low pitch count of 76, seemingly due to the blowout nature of the game. But the Phillies revealed mid-game that Wheeler experienced back tightness on the mound.\n\nHis long-term status wasn't immediately clear, but his scheduled date for Philadelphia's first-half finale against the Oakland A's on Sunday was certainly in jeopardy.\n\nThe Phillies and Dodgers are scheduled to play the second of their three-game series Wednesday night.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Schwarber", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Schwarber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trea_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trea Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_Stott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryson Stott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Wheeler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zack Wheeler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavan_Biggio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cavan Biggio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrique_Hern\u00e1ndez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enrique Hern\u00e1ndez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/xOMte8zLf.XjlUc93diGDw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-07/e609a6c0-3e51-11ef-bff3-d56daa7c7680", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713074", "eventUri": "eng-9713074", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 563, "textEnd": 570}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Our MLB odds series has our Dodgers-Phillies prediction, odds, and pick for Tuesday.\n\nThe Dodgers make the trip to Philadelphia to face the Phillies! These two teams are two of the best in the MLB, not just in the NL. The Phillies come into this series spiraling compared to the Dodgers. Our MLB odds series has our Dodgers-Phillies prediction, odds, and pick for Tuesday.\n\nLast Start: Pitched five innings and gave up two runs on four hits with three walks and four strikeouts in a Dodgers win.\n\nLast Start: Pitched six innings and gave up two runs on five hits with two walks and seven strikeouts in a Phillies win.\n\nThe Dodgers were the team with the biggest expectations heading into this season and are living up to them. They have a 55-36 record so far. They are coming off a loss that broke a two-game winning streak leading into this matchup. Their offense is a top-three unit, while their pitching is a top-five unit in the MLB. On offense, there are stars with Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts, Teoscar Hernandez, Freddie Freeman, Will Smith, and Max Muncy. Their pitching is then led by Tyler Glasnow, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, and Gavin Stone on the mound.\n\nThe Dodgers are starting Bobby Miller on the mound where he has a 1-1 record, a 6.12 ERA, and a 1.60 WHIP. Through 25 innings, Miller has allowed 17 runs on 25 hits with 15 walks and 25 strikeouts. The Dodgers are 3-3 in the six games he has started this season. Miller has struggled to find consistency this year after having a solid year last season as a rookie. He gets a huge challenge against the Phillies and their offense.\n\nThe Dodgers have the most talent on offense in the MLB, and they are sitting with a .255 batting average, which is seventh in the MLB. This is after they finished with a .257 batting average last year. Shohei Ohtani and Freddie Freeman lead the way in the important batting categories. Ohtani leads in batting average at .314, in home runs at 28, in RBI at 65, and in total hits at 109. Finally, Freeman leads in OBP at .406. The Dodgers get a difficult matchup in this game against Wheeler for the Dodgers. This offense has so much talent and can match up with anyone, but Wheeler is one of the best pitchers in the MLB this season.\n\nWhy The Phillies Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Phillies are one of the best teams in the MLB and currently have a 58-32 record. They have lost three out of their last four games. The offense is the third-best in the MLB, while their pitching is the best in the MLB. On offense, Trea Turner, Kyle Schwarber, JT Realmuto, Bryce Harper, Brandon Marsh, Nick Castellanos, and Alec Bohm have been the big standouts on a great offense. The pitching of Ranger Suarez, Aaron Nola, Zack Wheeler, Cristopher Sanchez, and Spencer Turnbull have made up one great pitching staff. The Phillies have been a force this season and have shown no signs of slowing down even with their latest slump.\n\nThe Phillies are starting Zack Wheeler on the mound where he has a 9-4 record, a 2.74 ERA, and a 0.99 WHIP. He has allowed 38 runs on 78 hits with 33 walks and 119 strikeouts through 111.2 innings this season. In the 18 games he has started this season, the Phillies have gone 10-8. Wheeler has had a career year this season and is in the running for the Cy Young this season. He has been great but gets a massive challenge against the Dodgers behind the plate.\n\nThe offense for the Phillies has been one of the best this season. The Phillies are third in the MLB in team batting average at .258 after finishing last season at .256. Alec Bohm and Bryce Harper lead the way for the Phillies behind the plate in most of the batting categories. Harper leads in batting average at .303, in home runs at 20, and in OBP at .399. Then, Bohm leads in RBI at 70 and total hits at 101. This offense gets a favorable matchup against Miller on the mound for the Dodgers because he has been struggling on the mound this season.\n\nFinal Dodgers-Phillies Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Dodgers are playing better than the Phillies because the Phillies are stumbling leading into this series. However, they have the advantages elsewhere across the board. Wheeler is much better than Miller as a pitcher and they have the slightly better offense. This game should be close at first, but the Phillies should win and cover thanks to their home-field advantage.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri":

A 2024 All-Star, Wheeler (10-4) joined Aaron Nola and Ranger Su\u00e1rez as a trio of Phillies pitchers with 10 wins before the All-Star break. It's the first time in franchise history the Phillies have three pitchers with 10 wins before the break.\n\nAfter a modest 5-4 mark with Harper and Schwarber sidelined - that included dropping two of three over the weekend in Atlanta - the Phillies flexed their muscle early against the Dodgers in a matchup of NL division leaders.\n\nSchwarber hit a two-RBI single in the second inning for a 3-0 lead.\n\nThe Phillies busted the game open with a six-run fourth off Dodgers starter Bobby Miller (1-2) that saw the right-hander's ERA balloon from 6.12 to a 8.07. The Phillies led 4-0 when Turner - who left the Dodgers for Philadelphia on a $300 million, 11-year contract ahead of the 2023 season - drove an 86 mph slider into the left field seats.\n\nNo need for Phillies fans to manufacture a standing ovation for Turner this season. A 2024 NL All-Star, Turner has five homers in his last seven games.\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies' Trea Turner, right, and Rafael March\u00e1n celebrate after Turner's grand slam against Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Bobby Miller during the fourth inning of a baseball game, Tuesday, July 9, 2024, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)\n\nStott added a solo shot off Miller later in the fourth, his first since May 18.\n\nHarper went 0 for 4. Harper strained his left hamstring running the bases in the ninth inning, and Schwarber strained his left groin while making a throw from left field in the eighth of a June 27 loss against Miami.\n\nWheeler threw 76 pitches - he struck out Dodgers leadoff hitter Shohei Ohtani on three pitches to open the game -and left with the Phillies holding a 9-1 lead. He allowed three hits, struck out seven and walked two. Wheeler allowed a solo home run to Cavan Biggio in the fifth inning.\n\nHe won\u00b4t be available for the National League staff in next week\u00b4s All-Star game. Wheeler and the Phillies agreed in March on a $126 million, three-year deal for 2025-27 that has the fourth-highest average salary in baseball history at $42 million.\n\nDodgers placed All-Star right-hander Tyler Glasnow on the 15-day injured list with back tightness, retroactive to July 6.\n\nThe 30-year-old Glasnow is 8-5 with a 3.47 ERA in his first season with the Dodgers. He was acquired in a December trade with Tampa Bay and received a $136.5 million, five-year contract to return to Southern California.\n\nPhillies CF Johan Rojas was hit by a pitch near his wrist in the seventh. The Dodgers then brought in position player Kik\u00e9 Hernandez to pitch and he retired Schwarber to end the inning.\n\nNEXT START\n\nPhillies RHP Tyler Phillips gets the start Saturday against Oakland. He made his big league debut out of the bullpen Sunday in Atlanta and allowed one run in four innings. He struck out the first four he faced.\n\nThe Dodgers send RHP Gavin Stone (9-2, 3.03 ERA) to the mound against Phillies LHP Cristopher S\u00e1nchez (6-4, 2.96 ERA).\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies' Trea Turner follows through after hitting a grand slam against Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Bobby Miller during the fourth inning of a baseball game, Tuesday, July 9, 2024, in Philadelphia.

Bobby Miller will be on the mound for the Dodgers as the Phillies hand the ball to Zack Wheeler. Tonight's game is set for first pitch at 6:40 p.m. ET.\n\nThe 2 top teams in the National League are sort of limping into the station here in terms of injury and recent play, but things are looking up on the Phillies' side. Kyle Schwarber and Bryce Harper are both likely to return tonight after missing the last few weeks each.\n\nThe Phillies lost their last series against the Braves while the Dodgers snapped a 2-series losing streak with a win over the Brewers.\n\nKeep scrolling for a prediction, top odds and the best available player prop picks for tonight's matchup.\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers vs. Philadelphia Phillies Prediction\n\nA look at the pitcher vs. batter stats would tell you plainly that the Dodgers have the advantage tonight, but that's just not the case. I know it's not exactly breaking news for me to tell you Zack Wheeler may be the better pitcher than Bobby Miller, but Miller has significantly better numbers against the Phillies lineup compared to Wheeler against the Dodgers.\n\nBut the numbers don't tell the whole story. While the Phillies lineup may be batting .231 against Miller, it came in starts last season when he was much, much more effective. Miller's ERA is hovering north of 6 right now and he's allowed at least a pair of earned runs and a home run in each of his last 5 starts. And for all that, he's been worse on the road - 14 IP, 19 hits and 15 earned runs across his 4 road starts this season.\n\nThe Phillies and Dodgers are evenly matched as it is, especially from the batters box. If the Phillies can jump on Miller early - and I think they will - they'll be in good shape to take Game 1.\n\nPhillies vs. Dodgers Odds\n\nOdds above via Caesars Sportsbook. Check out our Caesars Promo Code for a look at one of the best welcome offers in the business.\n\nThe Phillies are respectable favorites for tonight's matchup in Philadelphia where they already hold the last batter advantage. Philly sits at -140 ML while the Dodgers come in at +118 on Caesars.\n\nThe Dodgers, as usual, have the advantage at -170 to win or keep the game within a run while Philadelphia is +143 to win by 2 or more runs.\n\nThe over/under for this matchup has been set at 9 by Caesars, a high total for 2 of the best batting teams in the Majors. We've already talked about the Phillies' advantage against Miller tonight, but the Dodgers are hitting a smooth .343 against Wheeler and will be able to score runs tonight. Despite the over personally seeming like the favorite, the odds are even at -110.\n\nPhillies vs. Dodgers Best Value Player Props (July 9)\n\nAll odds above via DraftKings Sportsbook.\n\nI understand this seems hypocritical, but in reality Miller has only allowed above this total once this season. I still think the Phillies will jump on Miller early, but with this being such a high profile matchup I doubt the Dodgers would keep him out there long enough to see 6 hits.\n\nWheeler's strikeout numbers have subsided since the start of the year and he's fresh off a 7-K game against the Cubs. The Dodgers lineup has seen success in the past against Wheeler so I think he'll be hovering around 4 or 5 Ks by the time he leaves the mound today.\n\nThese odds are really high for a guy that has totaled 2 or more hits in 4 of his last 7 and faces a pitcher that he's performed well against in the past. I like it for that reason alone.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Betting Dime"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ethan_stone@sportsbettingdime.com", "name": "Ethan Stone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Wheeler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zack Wheeler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Schwarber", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Schwarber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn.sportsbettingdime.com/app/uploads/media/4/USATSI_23697964.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713074", "eventUri": "eng-9713074", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 2747, "textEnd": 2753}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The Phillies lost Wheeler on a steamy night with left low back tightness after five innings.\n\nA 2024 All-Star, Wheeler (10-4) joined Aaron Nola and Ranger Suarez as a trio of Phillies pitchers with 10 wins before the All-Star break. It's the first time in franchise history the Phillies have three pitchers with 10 wins before the break.\n\nThomson and Wheeler both said the pitcher should make his next scheduled start Sunday against Oakland.\n\n\"Just playing it safe and we'll go from there,\" Wheeler said.\n\nAfter a modest 5-4 mark with Harper and Schwarber sidelined -- that included dropping two of three over the weekend in Atlanta -- the Phillies flexed their muscle early against the Dodgers in a matchup of National League division leaders.\n\n\"It was just another good win against a really good team,\" Turner said. \"It's another game, but at the same time you kind of want to see where you stack up at. Great ballclub and we've been playing some good baseball ourselves. To come out and win the way we want was pretty refreshing and kind of gives that confidence moving forward.\"\n\nThe Phillies busted the game open with a six-run fourth off Dodgers starter Bobby Miller (1-2) that saw the right-hander's ERA balloon from 6.12 to a 8.07. The Phillies led 4-0 when Turner -- who left the Dodgers for Philadelphia on an 11-year, $300 million contract ahead of the 2023 season -- drove an 86 mph slider into the left-field seats.\n\n\"I think I stink with the bases loaded,\" Turner said.\n\nNo need for Phillies fans to manufacture a standing ovation for Turner this season. A 2024 NL All-Star, Turner has five homers in his last seven games.\n\nStott added a solo shot off Miller later in the fourth, his first since May 18.\n\n\"I'll just use all this failure as motivation going into my next outing,\" Miller said.\n\nHarper went 0 for 4. Schwarber hit a two-RBI single in the second inning for a 3-0 lead. Harper strained his left hamstring running the bases in the ninth inning, and Schwarber strained his left groin while making a throw from left field in the eighth of a June 27 loss against Miami.\n\nWheeler threw 76 pitches -- he struck out Dodgers leadoff hitter Shohei Ohtani on three pitches to open the game --and left with the Phillies holding a 9-1 lead. He allowed 3 hits, struck out 7 and walked 2. Wheeler allowed a solo home run to Cavan Biggio in the fifth inning.\n\nHe won't be available for the National League staff in next week's All-Star game. Wheeler and the Phillies agreed in March on a three-year, $126 million deal for 2025-27 that has the fourth-highest average salary in baseball history at $42 million.\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies' Trea Turner, right, and Rafael March\u00e1n celebrate after Turner's grand slam against Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Bobby Miller during the fourth inning of a baseball game, Tuesday, July 9, 2024, in Philadelphia.

Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber stepped on the dirt and ran the bases with intent under the watchful eyes of four Phillies officials. Everyone was encouraged. Both sluggers could return on Tuesday.\n\nThen, they all went inside for a 12:25 p.m. clubhouse meeting. Manager Rob Thomson revealed that this team has more All-Stars than any Phillies team before it. A quarter of the roster -- seven players -- received the honor. Four of them are first-time All-Stars. There was cheering and hugging.\n\nAnd, after that, they slogged through a 6-0 loss to the Atlanta Braves that was over soon after it began.\n\nMichael Mercado, a rookie making his second start, could not throw strikes or keep the ball in the yard. It happens. The Phillies left here eight games ahead of Atlanta and feeling as if they survived the time without Harper and Schwarber.\n\nThey are 5-4 without them. Schwarber will be in Tuesday's lineup against the mighty Los Angeles Dodgers. Harper is trending toward it.\n\n\"I feel good,\" he said. \"We'll see what happens.\"\n\nThe Phillies could use them. They are seeing the limits of a depleted lineup. They did not have an extra-base hit in Saturday's loss. They were held scoreless Sunday for only the third time this season. A compromised roster had to avoid being swept at Truist Park, and the Phillies accomplished that. They will look different the next time they come here in late August.\n\nThis is a team built on its stars, but somehow the All-Star announcements showed how complete a roster the Phillies have built. The seven All-Stars are a club record. The Phillies have had five All-Stars six times -- 2011, 2009, 1995, 1981, 1979 and 1976. The National League record for most players sent by one club is eight -- done by the 2023 Braves. The Phillies fell just short.\n\nMatt Strahm and Jeff Hoffman, who have formed one of the best bullpen duos in baseball, were voted into the game via the player ballot. Neither is a traditional closer. It was a satisfying feeling for both pitchers, who are first-time All-Stars.\n\n\"The way the game's going,\" Strahm said, \"I think guys are starting to see that you win ballgames not only in the ninth inning. So it's good to see. It's good for the game.\"\n\nThe two relievers have become close friends and have elevated their games through a religious daily game of catch. Thomson, during Sunday morning's meeting, called Strahm's name first.\n\n\"That probably took more of a weight off my shoulders,\" Hoffman said, \"than hearing my own name called.\"\n\n\"I wasn't expecting much,\" Strahm said. \"I was hoping Jeff would get the nod. ... He's done an unbelievable job with how he's turned his career around. He's so deserving of it.\"\n\nRanger Su\u00e1rez, who ranks second in the National League in ERA, is a candidate to start the midsummer classic. The Phillies believe he could use a break to manage a mounting workload, but they will defer to Su\u00e1rez's wishes.\n\n\"If I'm going, I want to pitch,\" Su\u00e1rez said. \"I mean, it's my first All-Star Game. I want to have that feeling of my first All-Star appearance.\"\n\n\"I want him to do what he wants to do,\" Thomson said. \"I'm pretty comfortable with it.\"\n\nZack Wheeler is not eligible to pitch; he will start on the final day before the All-Star break. Harper said he intends to play in the All-Star Game. \"For sure,\" Harper said. It'll be the first time Harper appears in an All-Star Game as a Phillie.\n\nThe Phillies are more excited to see him back in the lineup, and that could happen Tuesday. They have six more games before the break. A strong push would help.\n\nThey have pitching decisions to make in the wake of Sunday's loss. The Phillies will consider various options for the fifth spot in the rotation. Mercado is slated to pitch one more time before the break: Friday against the Oakland A's. He could still make that start. Or Tyler Phillips, who logged some innings as a mop-up man Sunday in his debut, could slide into the rotation.\n\n\"We have to discuss some things,\" Thomson said.\n\nPhillips struck out the side -- Matt Olson, Marcell Ozuna and Travis d'Arnaud -- on 12 pitches to begin his big-league career. He looked sharp in four innings. The South Jersey native was raised a Phillies fan; this accomplishment meant a lot to generations of Phillipses. Tyler's father, Dan, was at Truist Park. So was Tyler's 3-year-old son, Frank, who is named after his late grandfather who taught him to love the Phillies.\n\nThe 26-year-old righty became the first Phillies pitcher with seven strikeouts in his big-league debut since Cole Hamels in 2006. Hamels was one of Phillips' favorite Phillies growing up. Phillips showed the Phillies something.\n\n\"I hope so,\" he said. \"I knew I had a role today. I had a job. I just want the ball. Give me the ball, and I'm going to go out there and do everything I can to go as deep as I can. Obviously, in my past, I've never been a strikeout pitcher. I had a few more strikeouts today. I'm going to chalk that up to some adrenaline. Hopefully, we can just keep that going.\"\n\nPhillips and Mercado are auditioning for now and later, when the Phillies will need spot starters throughout the summer. They want to protect others in the rotation.\n\nTaijuan Walker (blister) has been rehabbing with the team. He will throw a bullpen session Wednesday at Citizens Bank Park and could progress to face hitters in a controlled session over the weekend. He could need a minor-league start at some point, but the Phillies might have to accelerate his ramp-up if they want Walker in the rotation soon after the All-Star break ends.\n\nThat All-Star Game will have a distinct Phillies slant. It's a reflection of what the Phillies have accomplished so far. They have bigger goals. Two unproductive days in Atlanta were disappointing but not derailing. That is a testament to how good it is right now.\n\n\"The front office has built a really good roster,\" Thomson said. \"And I'm proud of the seven guys.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com",

What should be on Phillies' fans minds right now during a somewhat confusing stretch?\n\nWith injuries to superstars, All-Star selections and division battles eating the headlines, there are no shortage of things to muse about. Which is where we'll dive in for the latest five thoughts we have about the Phillies right now:\n\nYes, they dropped two of three games against Atlanta this weekend. That's never a good thing, and we're not saying that it was. But the Phillies entered the three-game set with a nine-game lead for the division and left it with an eight-game lead. That's the biggest lead for any team in baseball right now. The squad didn't do much real damage to themselves.\n\nEveryone knew if the Phils lost the series -- which they did -- it would be easy to cite their legitimate injury issues. They played the Braves without Bryce Harper, Kyle Schwarber or J.T. Realmuto. They also trotted unproven Michael Mercado out there with two fifth starters on the injured list. It's not like the two teams dueled at full strength and the Phillies were pummeled. It was going to be an uphill battle with Kody Clemens as the sixth best hitter. No major reasons for concern are coming from this weekend.\n\nThe 2024 Phillies have a chance to set a franchise record for regular season wins, and post a bunch of other all-time great statistics this season. More importantly, they're among the front-runners for a World Series trip. They have seven All-Stars, the most in team history. That made us curious, is this the best group of All-Stars in team history?\n\nHere's a look at a handful of the best Midsummer Classic contributions the Phillies have made:\n\nSchwarber will be back Tuesday to face the Dodgers. Harper will be back then too, most likely. Realmuto should be back sometime after next week's All-Star break. There could be some moves made on the trade market ahead of the July 30th deadline. The timing couldn't be better.\n\nAfter the NL West leading Dodgers this week, the Phillies have two cakewalk series against the Athletics and Pirates sandwiching next week's break. They also will be assisted by having six days off in the next 23, which could go a long way in helping them avoid needing a fifth starter all that much.\n\nAfter facing the Pirates to start the \"second half,\" things will get tough:\n\nWith 12 games against four of the best teams in baseball over a two and a half week span, you won't hear anymore soft schedule criticisms.\n\nEven after allowing 17 runs in three games to the Braves, the Phillies still have the best pitching staff in baseball by most metrics and it's not close.\n\nPhiladelphia's 3.26 ERA is the lowest mark across 30 teams -- the Braves are in second at 3.43. Philly's arms have allowed the second fewest home runs, the fourth fewest walks, have the second lowest WHIP and have struck out more hitters than any other staff.\n\nWill the team be able to keep it up? Four hurlers are going to the All-Star game, among them Ranger Su\u00e1rez who has been pretty bad over his last few starts after starting the year like a Cy Young winner. They have some really tough offenses ahead as we just detailed. Keep an eye on those pitching stats.\n\nOf the top 16 players you can bet on to win the NL MVP award, five of them are Phillies. That's insane. Via FOX Sports, Bryce Harper is 2nd, Alec Bohm 9th, Trea Turner 13th, Zack Wheeler 14th and Ranger Su\u00e1rez 16th by way of betting odds (all behind Shohei Ohtani). The Dodgers have three players in the top 20, while the Braves and Brewers have two apiece.\n\nWill the Phillies' top stars make a real MVP case despite time missed to injury, in the cases of Harper and red hot Turner? Individual performances could be the legacy of this memorable team if this kind of play continues.", "source": {"uri": "phillyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PhillyVoice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._T._Realmuto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

With the Los Angeles Dodgers in town to open a three-game series, the Phillies have activated designated hitter Kyle Schwarber and first baseman Bryce Harper.\n\nThe news is music to Phillies fans' ears. Manager Rob Thomson previously confirmed on Sunday while the team was still in Atlanta that Schwarber would definitely be returning tonight, but Harper's return was still up in the air at that time.\n\nPhillies finally cut slumping outfielder to make room for Schwarber, Harper off IL\n\nIn the corresponding roster moves, the team announced that struggling outfielder David Dahl has been designated for assignment and infielder Kody Clemens has been optioned back to Triple-A Lehigh Valley. Neither move comes as much of a surprise.\n\nDahl started out hot in his initial 15 plate appearances after being called up from Triple-A on June 3, slashing .333/.333/.867 with two home runs and three RBI. Since then, he has cratered into a massive slump, hitting .163 with a .446 OPS in 47 plate appearances.\n\nClemens did what the team hoped for, filling in for Harper at first against right-handed pitching. He only slashed .217/.250/.304 in his seven games during this stint with the big club, but with a .242/.277/.500 line on the season is sure to get another shot when a space opens up again.\n\nSchwarber and Harper returning to lineup after minimum stay on IL\n\nWhile the team has only been without the two star hitters since June 28, losing two top-of-the-order bats like Schwarber and Harper impacted the overall offense. There's no way it couldn't. The team still managed to go 5-4 in their absence and maintain their 8.0-game lead in the division.\n\nBoth players landed on the 10-day injured list on the same day, Schwarber with a mild groin strain and Harper with a left hamstring strain. The Phillies were lucky and dodged a bullet, with both players spending the minimum time on the injured list.\n\nIn 79 games this season, Schwarber is slashing .250/.373/.447 with 17 home runs, 49 RBI and 60 runs scored out of the lead-off spot.\n\nHarper, who was voted in as the starting NL first baseman for the upcoming All-Star Game while on the shelf, is putting up MVP-caliber numbers this year. He's slashing .303/.399/.582 with 20 homers and 58 RBI in 76 games.", "source": {"uri": "thatballsouttahere.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "That Balls Outta Here"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_fisher@thatballsouttahere.com", "name": "Michael Fisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Schwarber", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Schwarber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dahl_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Dahl (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Thomson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Thomson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Clemens", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Clemens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plate appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_transactions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball transactions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_for_assignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Designated for assignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(injury)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strain (injury)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5063,h_2847,x_0,y_27/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/6/01j2brt8tc8jhqazy9kk.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713074", "eventUri": "eng-9713074", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 1096, "textEnd": 1102}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 1687, "textEnd": 1694}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

These two teams both have potential to win the World Series. But only one of them can come out on top in the division and only one can come out of the National League with the pennant.\n\nThe Phillies have held firm control over the division for most of the season, and they're still in control of it now, but after dropping two straight games to the Braves, they've given Atlanta life at the worst possible time. Right before the All-Star break and right before the trade deadline.\n\nThere's plenty of blame to go around the Phillies too.\n\n3. Johan Rojas should take some of the blame for the Phillies losses\n\nThe Phillies have been in the market for an outfielder for the entire season with them drawing connections to names like Luis Robert and Cody Bellinger recently. While nothing has come of this, the Phillies have been left with a bit of a lackluster outfield, with the 23-year-old Johan Rojas at the forefront of their struggling outfield.\n\nRojas has been horrible at the plate this season. The young Phillies outfielder is slashing .232/.267/.290 on the season, good for an OPS+ near 50. According to Baseball Savant, he's worth -7 batting run value and he's in the bottom 10 percent in key stats like xSLG, average exit velocity and barrel percentage.\n\nDespite his offensive woes, he's been good defensively, which is the key reason that he's remained in the lineup. He's one of the faster players in all of baseball, recoridng sprint speeds north of 30 MPH. His fielding run value is in the 86th percentile of the league thanks to his 4 OAA and his elite arm strength.\n\nBut the Phillies need to make a move for a bat to take his spot until Rojas can get going. It's hard to win a World Series with an offensive liability in the lineup. But, Rojas is still just 23 and he has a ton of potential. He will be fine in the long run, but he can take some of the blame for why Philadelphia hasn't run away with the division.\n\n2. Ranger Suarez is to blame following three consecutive uncharacteristic starts\n\nRanger Suarez began the season pitching like one of the best pitchers in the entire league. He got off to a 10-1 start holding a 1.75 ERA. But, over his last three starts, Suarez has been bad. Not just saying that he's struggled, but he's been downright bad for the Phillies.\n\nIn those three starts, Suarez is 0-2 with a no decision. He's thrown 15.2 innings in those three starts, allowing 24 hits and 15 runs, with 13 of those runs being earned. He's seen his ERA rise from 1.75 to 2.58 in that span.\n\nTo put it into perspective, Suarez allowed just 21 runs in his first 90+ innings of the season. That's almost as many runs as he's allowed in the last two weeks. Rob Thomson needs his former Cy Young candidate to start pitching like his former self or else the Phillies are going to continue to lose games that they should have been winning.\n\nWith the Phillies missing JT Realmuto, Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber on the injured list right now, they need their dominant pitching staff to be dominant. Suarez hasn't been that recently and it's shown. There's no reason to be concerned about him just yet, but it's definitely something to keep an eye on.\n\n1. Dave Dombrowski and the front office are to blame for not making trade upgrades yet\n\nThe Phillies have plenty of holes in their talented roster that need tended to. Their rotation and lineup as a whole have been so talented and performing so well that these holes are hard to find, but they're still there.\n\nNotably, the holes in center field, even in right field, the starting rotation and in the backend of the bullpen are where the Phillies need to address.\n\nTheir first four starters have been so good for their pitching staff this year that many haven't noticed how much of a let down the fifth spot has been. While this is usually to be expected from the fifth starter, it's still a place the Phillies could look to acquire a cheap, rental arm to fill that void. They haven't.\n\nPhiladelphia could also use another outfielder to replace the struggling Johan Rojas. They haven't done that either. Rojas has been incredible defensively, but his offense has been so bad that it almost doesn't matter.\n\nWith all the injuries that Philadelphia has been through this season, they need to add all the talent they can in order to have the quality depth that it takes to win the World Series. This falls back on the front office for not being aggressive just yet. They still have time to go after these trade pieces, but they've found themselves losing a few games that they should have won because of these holes.", "source": {"uri": "fansided.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FanSided"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zach_pressnell@fansided.com", "name": "Zach Pressnell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennant_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennant (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Bellinger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cody Bellinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_velocity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exit velocity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win\u2013loss_record_(pitching)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Win\u2013loss record (pitching)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Schwarber", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Schwarber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Thomson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Thomson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Dombrowski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dave Dombrowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5465,h_3074,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/229/01j27cjpk40hdaht6qbj.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713074", "eventUri": "eng-9713074", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Chief among them: Assessing their needs in the outfield.\n\nNever mind that the Phillies led by only two runs in the ninth inning last Wednesday night. Or that the sinking line drive heading in Johan Rojas' direction might have tied the game if it skipped past him and rolled to the wall.\n\nRojas' job is to cover the outfield like a tarp, not to play it safe.\n\nSo, the 23-year-old dove to his left, after racing halfway across center field, and turned a surefire hit (expected batting average: .780, according to Statcast) into the second-to-last out of a 5-3 victory at Wrigley Field.\n\nRight. But is it enough to keep Rojas around for the rest of the season?\n\nThree weeks from the trade deadline -- July 30 at 6 p.m., in case you'd like to set a calendar reminder -- the Phillies have internal decisions to make before choosing what to do. Chief among them: Assessing their needs in the outfield.\n\n\" READ MORE: How aggressive will the Phillies be at the trade deadline? Let's look at Dave Dombrowski's history for clues.\n\nEntering the week, the Phillies ranked 27th in OPS in center field (.589) and 25th in left field (.645). But it wasn't merely an offensive shortfall at those positions. They were tied for 22nd in wins above replacement in center field (1.1) and tied for 27th in left (0.5), as measured by Fangraphs.\n\nNo wonder the Phillies are rumored to be interested in every outfielder who might be available -- and a few who probably aren't.\n\nBut the market is still taking shape -- through Monday, 22 of 30 teams were in possession of a playoff spot or within 5\u00bd games -- giving the Phillies time to answer a few internal questions.\n\nA year ago, the Phillies scouted several righty-hitting outfielders before the deadline. But after calling up Rojas from double A last July 15 as an injury fill-in, they decided their best alignment included his elite defense in center field.\n\nWhat has changed?\n\nFor one thing, Rojas' defense isn't nearly as elite. He has recorded four outs above average and prevented three runs in 66 games, according to Statcast. In 59 games last year, he recorded nine outs above average and prevented eight runs.\n\n\" READ MORE: What if the Phillies' outfield production doesn't improve? Here are a few trade options to watch.\n\nRojas' hitting remains a weakness. Among 223 players who began the week with at least 225 plate appearances, he ranked 219th with a .547 OPS, 44% worse than league average.\n\nWhen the Phillies optioned Rojas to triple A on June 17, they didn't intend to bring him back so quickly. But Kyle Schwarber (groin) and Bryce Harper (hamstring) went on the injured list 11 days later. Rojas started eight of nine games through Sunday and went 5-for-28 (.179) with nine strikeouts and one walk.\n\nRojas is being encouraged to use his speed, and he did leg out a pair of infield hits last Friday night in Atlanta. If he's able drop down a bunt more often, even better. But it's all predicated on difference-making defense, such as his clutch catch last week in Chicago.\n\nOtherwise, the Phillies could more seriously consider a prospect-laden offer for Luis Robert Jr. of the White Sox or the Marlins' Jazz Chisholm Jr. -- unless they suddenly have a different answer to this common question:\n\nPublicly, Thomson continues to express confidence that Marsh will hit lefties. But the manager's actions indicate otherwise. Marsh hasn't been in the lineup against a lefty starter (non-opener) since May 16.\n\nAnd here's the thing: It's difficult to fault Thomson.\n\nIt has been argued, in this space and elsewhere, that the Phillies should play Marsh every day for the time being. But he's 7-for-46 (.152) with 25 strikeouts against lefties this season after going 22-for-96 (.229) with 49 strikeouts against them last year.\n\nFor now, Marsh's opportunities to face lefties come against relievers, and usually when the Phillies have a lead.\n\n\" READ MORE: Building the Perfect Phillies Pitcher: The signature pitch from each starter, and what makes it special\n\n\"It's baby steps,\" Thomson said recently. \"Eventually, I think he's going to be not a platoon. I think he's going to get the bulk of left-handed pitching.\"\n\nMaybe. But it won't happen in the next three weeks, so Marsh can't be regarded as a full-time center-field alternative. He's a better defender in left field anyway. But regardless of his position in the outfield, the Phillies must find him a righty-hitting platoon mate.\n\nWhit Merrifield was expected to fill that role, but the veteran utilityman entered the week batting .197/.278/.283 with one RBI since June 13, no extra-base hits since June 8, and the third-lowest hard-hit rate of any player with at least 100 plate appearances. Cristian Pache, two years older than Rojas with a similar skill set, is batting .196/.292/.261.\n\nDepending on recent usage, Thomson appears to trust at least a half-dozen relievers to get important late-inning outs. Five Phillies relievers have at least one save, a club that doesn't include Orion Kerkering and All-Star Matt Strahm, who have a 1.59 and 1.38 ERA, respectively.\n\nBut Thomson's tendency is to lean even harder on the bullpen in the postseason. It's possible, then, that adding another late-game reliever will be the Phillies' top deadline priority.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Phillies pivoted away from the free-agent market after coming up empty in their pursuits of hard-throwing righties Jordan Hicks and Robert Stephenson, preferring to stick with what they have and save up for an in-season move.\n\n\" READ MORE: The Phillies' bullpen isn't a weakness, but that doesn't mean they should pass on upgrading at the trade deadline\n\nIn president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski's three previous seasons with the Phillies, he has mostly supplemented the roster around the edges with deadline deals for Kyle Gibson, Noah Syndergaard, David Robertson, Marsh, and Michael Lorenzen. Going back further in the expanded wild-card era (since 2012), he often took a similar approach with the Tigers and Red Sox. It's his likeliest course again this year.\n\nBut one season stands apart in Dombrowski's recent history. After the Tigers lost in the World Series in 2012 and the ALCS in 2013, he went all-in at the deadline in 2014 and pulled off a blockbuster for David Price.\n\nCould Dombrowski go for it again now in an analogous situation?\n\nThe answer may depend on how the Phillies sort through their internal questions.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia

But what happened next was more out of the ordinary than even a trouncing of the mighty Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nBryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber were mostly immaterial to the victory.\n\nCrazy, isn't it? Upon welcoming back the star sluggers who account for more than one-quarter of the team's scoring output, the Phillies leveled a 10-1 shellacking Tuesday night because the bottom of the order -- Brandon Marsh, Rafael March\u00e1n, and Johan Rojas -- went 7-for-9 with a homer (from Marsh), two doubles (from March\u00e1n), seven runs, three RBIs, and two stolen bases.\n\nOK, so Trea Turner did smash a grand slam to crack open the game like a pi\u00f1ata at an 8-year-old birthday party before struggling Bryson Stott banged a solo shot off the facing of the second deck. And the Dodgers aren't the Dodgers with three regulars, including Mookie Betts, three starting pitchers, and much of their bullpen jamming up on the injured list like a Los Angeles freeway.\n\n\" READ MORE: Zack Wheeler exits start against the Dodgers with lower back tightness\n\nIt wasn't all knee-slapping laughs, either, before 43,065 patrons, another sold-out crowd at Citizens Bank Park. Zack Wheeler dominated for five innings, then exited before the sixth with what the Phillies characterized as \"left low back tightness.\"\n\nStay tuned for more on that ominous in-game update.\n\nBut it was a testament to the depth of the roster that the Phillies went 5-4 while Harper and Schwarber were convalescing from a hamstring and groin strain, respectively. Before that, they overcame a six-week stretch without Turner. Heck, they're even 14-12 since irreplaceable catcher J.T. Realmuto had torn cartilage removed from his right knee.\n\n\"They did a fantastic job,\" Schwarber said. \"I feel like that's kind of been the M.O. of the team over the last couple years that when someone goes down, someone steps right up to the challenge and take it by the reins and they run with it.\"\n\nSo, when Harper vowed not to push it too hard in his return from the first hamstring injury of his career -- \"I'm not throwing the cloak on,\" he said before the game -- the rest of the lineup predictably had his back.\n\nThe Phillies raised their best-in-baseball record to 59-32 by pouncing on the 55-37 Dodgers with a two-out rally in the second inning. Marsh drew a walk against starter Bobby Miller, stole second base, went to third on March\u00e1n's single, and scored when Rojas beat out a chopper past the mound to second base. March\u00e1n and Rojas raced home on a two-run single by Schwarber.\n\n\" READ MORE: Phillies' Bryce Harper will try to 'play smart' as he returns from the injured list with Kyle Schwarber\n\nIt was the bottom of the order that kick-started a six-run fourth inning against Miller. Marsh singled, went to third on March\u00e1n's double, and scored on Rojas' single that hopped past third baseman Cavan Biggio. Schwarber walked to load the bases, and Turner unloaded his sixth career grand slam.\n\nTurn out the lights.\n\nWheeler, meanwhile, allowed three hits through five innings, the only real blemish against him coming on a homer by Biggio in the fifth. The All-Star ace racked up seven strikeouts and leaned heavily on his heater, which topped out at 97.6 mph.\n\nThere weren't overt signs that Wheeler was dealing with a physical issue. He issued back-to-back two-out walks in the fifth inning, but his last pitch of the game registered 96.1 mph and induced a soft groundout from Dodgers star first baseman Freddie Freeman.\n\nWheeler was likely headed for further examination. He's scheduled to start Sunday against the A's in the final game before the All-Star break, which will make him ineligible to pitch next Tuesday night in Texas.\n\nNow, that start might be in flux.\n\nThe Phillies have been fortunate to avoid injuries to the top four starters in their rotation. The Dodgers can't say the same. They entered a three-game showdown in Philadelphia without Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Walker Buehler, and Clayton Kershaw, all of whom are out for another few weeks. They also don't have Betts and injured third baseman Max Muncy and outfielder Jayson Heyward.\n\nSo, this is less of a measuring-stick series that it initially appeared. But the nine-run margin -- the Dodgers' most lopsided loss of the season -- as Schwarber and Harper ease their way back into the lineup also reinforced why the Phillies have been baseball's best team through the first half of the season.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_lauber@inquirer.com", "name": "Scott Lauber", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Wheeler", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zack Wheeler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_Stott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryson Stott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Marsh_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Marsh (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Schwarber", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Schwarber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trea_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trea Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._T._Realmuto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

They truly look the part of a team that could win a World Series.\n\nKeeping that in mind, the Phillies have an opportunity to get even better. The MLB trade deadline is just a few short weeks away and there have been many different options thrown out as potential targets for the team.\n\nPhiladelphia appears to be a team primed to make a move or two. In fact, they have received a big-time prediction about the trade deadline.\n\nBob Nightengale of USA Today has reported that GM's and executives around the league are expecting the Phillies to be one of the most aggressive teams in trade discussions.\n\nHere is the list of teams that he named who are expected to be busy ahead of the deadline.\n\n\"The Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees, Seattle Mariners, Philadelphia Phillies, San Diego Padres and Atlanta.\"\n\nThis should come as no surprise. Philadelphia knows just how close they are to winning a World Series. Being aggressive is a must if they want to turn that goal into reality.\n\nAmong the potential needs that could be addressed are another outfielder and bullpen help. On both of those fronts, there are plenty of talented players available on the trade market.\n\nThe bullpen seems like the most likely option. Right now, the Phillies have one of the more dangerous offenses in baseball. Even with Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber missing time recently due to injury, they have remained productive.\n\nPitching wins championships in most situations. Philadelphia has a good bullpen, but it isn't elite. Pursuing a player like Miami Marlins star Tanner Scott would make a ton of sense for the Phillies.\n\nAll of that being said, it will be interesting to see what the franchise ends up doing at the deadline. Will they live up to the hype and be aggressive? Or, will they stand pat and roll the dice with their current roster?\n\nExpect to hear a lot of rumors over the next few weeks. Philadelphia seems like a team that will try to make a move, but what size of move they'll make is the biggest question.\n\nStay tuned, as trade talks are expected to begin heating up in the very near future.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truist_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truist Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Thomson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Thomson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tanner Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Schwarber", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Schwarber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5465,h_3074,x_0,y_96/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_phillies/01j289v48y7pkt5amv2a.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713074", "eventUri": "eng-9713074", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

The All-Star right-hander was cruising before giving up a home run and walking two batters before escaping the fifth inning without allowing another run.\n\nBut he departed the game at that point, in line for the win with a 9-1 lead, having given up three hits and striking out seven.\n\nPhillies center fielder Johan Rojas also left the game after being hit by a pitch on his right arm as part of a wave of substitutions in the eighth inning.\n\nWhile Harper was quiet in his first game since pulling a hamstring on June 27, Schwarber's two-run, second-inning single pushed the Phillies ahead 3-0 and he drew a walk and scored a run in the six-run fourth.

Turner was 3-for-4 and Brandon Marsh, Rafael Marchan and Johan Rojas were a combined 7-for-9 with seven runs scored and three RBI out of the 7-8-9 spots in the Phillies' order.\n\nTurner's grand slam was part of the big fourth inning which all came at the expense of starting pitcher Bobby MIller, who gave up nine runs and saw his ERA balloon to 8.07.\n\nThe three-game series matched up the top two teams in the National League.\n\nNEXT: The Phillies' Cristopher Sanchez (6-4, 2.96) takes on Gavin Stone (9-2, 3.03) at 7:05 Wednesday, while Aaron Nola (10-4, 3.48) faces Landon Knack (1-2, 2.86) at

That's not to say the Phillies won't make any additions outside of relief help this summer, however. The club's 58-31 record entering play today affords them the best winning percentage in baseball, leaving them well-positioned to push for the club's first World Series championship since 2008 this October.\n\nThat doesn't mean the club lacks holes, however, and outfield production is arguably one of the biggest. With Bryce Harper having moved to first base on a full-time basis and Kyle Schwarber now in an everyday DH role, the lefty sluggers that have worked the outfield corners for the Phillies in recent years have now vacated the outfield grass. Brandon Marsh has performed well when healthy, slashing .265/.346/.414 with a 116 wRC+ while splitting time between all three outfield spots, and veteran slugger Nick Castellanos has begun to heat up in recent weeks and figures to continue acting as the club's everyday right fielder.\n\nWith that being said, each of Johan Rojas, Cristian Pache, and Whit Merrifield have all disappointed offensively this season. While Rojas and Pache both offer valuable defensive in center field and Merrifield's versatility makes him a useful bench player, none have posted a wRC+ higher than 60 this year despite taking nearly 500 combined at-bats for the Phillies. That's led the club to resort to using journeyman David Dahl as a left-handed complement to the trio of righties, but while he got off to a hot start in a Phillies uniform earlier this year he's fallen back to Earth and now sports a meager .207/.242/.397 (75 wRC+) slash line in 19 games with Philadelphia.\n\nIt's easy to see how Rooker would be a perfect fit for the club's outfield mix. The 29-year-old first broke out with the A's last year with a 127 wRC+ in 137 games, but he's taken his offense to another level so far in the 2024 campaign. In 313 trips to the plate with the club this year, Rooker has slashed a fantastic .277/.351/.540 with a wRC+ of 153. While that production has come with a troublesome 32.9% strikeout rate, Rooker has made up for it with a strong 9.9% walk rate and the seventh-highest isolated slugging percentage in the majors.\n\nWhile .371 BABIP this season is likely too high to be entirely sustainable, advanced metrics are generally buying in on his overall production as his .378 xwOBA is a near match for his .380 wOBA, suggesting that any regression in BABIP should be made up for by his eye-popping 16.4% barrel rate so long as he manages to keep his elite contact quality up going forward. That's particularly important for Rooker given that the breakout journeyman entered the year with just over two years of service time under his belt. He's making just over the league minimum this year and would come with three more seasons of team control after this one before becoming a free agent following the 2027 season.\n\nThat's a timeline that lines up nicely with the current window in Philadelphia. Veteran ace Zack Wheeler just signed an extension that will also end following the 2027 season, and youngsters Brandon Marsh and Bryson Stott are both also slated to hit free agency following that campaign. Meanwhile stars Bryce Harper, Aaron Nola, and Trea Turner will all be entering this mid-30's at that point and complementary pieces of the current core like Schwarber, Castellanos, and J.T. Realmuto will have seen their contracts expire. That Rooker's years of control line up so cleanly with Philadelphia's current window of contention could make him all the more attractive to the Phillies.\n\nWith that being said, it's worth pointing out that the club may have other prioritizes ahead of the trade deadline this year. As previously mentioned, Dombrowski has highlighted a desire to improve the club's bullpen this summer in the past, and he also cautioned last month that the club wasn't likely to pursue the sort of blockbuster trade where the club would have to \"trade three top prospects\" to acquire a player.\n\nRelief help isn't the only other need the club may look to address this summer, either. The club entered the summer with something of an embarrassment of riches in the rotation that forced Spencer Turnbull into a bullpen role despite a 1.67 ERA in six starts back in April, but since then both Taijuan Walker and Turnbull have hit the injured list, leaving the club to rely on rookie Michael Mercado to fill out the club's rotation behind Wheeler, Nola, Ranger Suarez and Cristopher Sanchez. With Turnbull not expected back until late August at the earliest and Walker lacking a specific timeline for return, it's possible the Phillies could look to add a pitcher capable of helping the club either out of the rotation or bullpen depending on their needs at that moment.\n\nRooker also isn't the only outfielder expected to be available at the deadline this year, with White Sox veteran Tommy Pham standing out as a rental option who would likely prove cheaper to acquire than Rooker if the Phillies are concerned with the prospect cost involved in acquiring the A's outfielder. Kevin Pillar of the Angels, Mark Canha of the Tigers, and Jesse Winker of the Nationals are among the other rental veterans playing for teams who could consider selling this summer and would likely cost the Phillies less than a controllable asset like Rooker.", "source": {"uri": "mlbtraderumors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MLB Trade Rumors"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_deeds@mlbtraderumors.com", "name": "Nick Deeds", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Marsh_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Marsh (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristian_Pache", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cristian Pache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Schwarber", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Schwarber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whit_Merrifield", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whit Merrifield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Castellanos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Castellanos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winning percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Dombrowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dave Dombrowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_on_balls_in_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average on balls in play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dahl_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Dahl (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WOBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WOBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Wheeler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zack Wheeler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_Stott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryson Stott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Turnbull", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spencer Turnbull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Pillar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Pillar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Canha", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Canha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._T._Realmuto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

But what happened next was more out of the ordinary than even a trouncing of the mighty Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nBryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber were mostly immaterial to the victory.\n\nCrazy, isn't it? Upon welcoming back the star sluggers who account for more than one-quarter of the team's scoring output, the Phillies leveled a 10-1 shellacking Tuesday night because the bottom of the order - Brandon Marsh, Rafael March\u00e1n and Johan Rojas - went 7 for 9 with a homer (from Marsh), two doubles (from March\u00e1n), seven runs, three RBIs and two stolen bases.\n\nOK, so Trea Turner did smash a grand slam to crack open the game like a pi\u00f1ata at an 8-year-old birthday party before struggling Bryson Stott banged a solo shot off the facing of the second deck. And the Dodgers aren't the Dodgers with three regulars, including Mookie Betts, three starting pitchers, and much of their bullpen jamming up on the injured list like a Los Angeles freeway.\n\nIt wasn't all knee-slapping laughs, either, before 43,065 patrons, another sold-out crowd at Citizens Bank Park. Zack Wheeler dominated for five innings, then exited before the sixth with what the Phillies characterized as \"left low back tightness.\"\n\nStay tuned for more on that ominous in-game update.\n\nBut it was a testament to the depth of the roster that the Phillies went 5-4 while Harper and Schwarber were convalescing from a hamstring and groin strain, respectively. Before that, they overcame a six-week stretch without Turner. Heck, they're even 14-12 since irreplaceable catcher J.T. Realmuto had torn cartilage removed from his right knee.\n\n\"They did a fantastic job,\" Schwarber said. \"I feel like that's kind of been the M.O. of the team over the last couple years that when someone goes down, someone steps right up to the challenge and take it by the reins and they run with it.\"\n\nSo, when Harper vowed not to push it too hard in his return from the first hamstring injury of his career - \"I'm not throwing the cloak on,\" he said before the game - the rest of the lineup predictably had his back.\n\nThe Phillies raised their best-in-baseball record to 59-32 by pouncing on the 55-37 Dodgers with a two-out rally in the second inning. Marsh drew a walk against starter Bobby Miller, stole second base, went to third on March\u00e1n's single, and scored when Rojas beat out a chopper past the mound to second base. March\u00e1n and Rojas raced home on a two-run single by Schwarber.\n\nIt was the bottom of the order that kick-started a six-run fourth inning against Miller. Marsh singled, went to third on March\u00e1n's double, and scored on Rojas' single that hopped past third baseman Cavan Biggio. Schwarber walked to load the bases, and Turner unloaded his sixth career grand slam.\n\nTurn out the lights.\n\nWheeler, meanwhile, allowed three hits through five innings, the only real blemish against him coming on a homer by Biggio in the fifth. The All-Star ace racked up seven strikeouts and leaned heavily on his heater, which topped out at 97.6 mph.\n\nThere weren't overt signs that Wheeler was dealing with a physical issue. He issued back-to-back two-out walks in the fifth inning, but his last pitch of the game registered 96.1 mph and induced a soft groundout from Dodgers star first baseman Freddie Freeman.\n\nWheeler was likely headed for further examination. He's scheduled to start Sunday against the A's in the final game before the All-Star break, which will make him ineligible to pitch next Tuesday night in Texas.\n\nNow, that start might be in flux.\n\nThe Phillies have been fortunate to avoid injuries to the top four starters in their rotation. The Dodgers can't say the same. They entered a three-game showdown in Philadelphia without Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Walker Buehler and Clayton Kershaw, all of whom are out for another few weeks. They also don't have Betts and injured third baseman Max Muncy and outfielder Jayson Heyward.\n\nSo, this is less of a measuring-stick series than it initially appeared.

But the Phillies wouldn't really mind that much if there was some pretty intense traffic around the Sports Complex on Sunday, October 13.\n\nSee, that's when the League Championship Series get underway. And from their perspective, playing at Citizens Bank Park would be well worth the inconvenience of whatever gridlock would result from the fact that the Eagles are hosting the Browns right across the street earlier that day.\n\nIt would mean that they were one step away from the World Series. Just as importantly, it would mean they'd locked down homefield advantage, at least for that critical round and possibly throughout. Those are the spoils that go to the victor of the most regular season games.\n\n(Before anybody's blood pressure starts to go up, the Phillies could still secure the whip hand without the additional access-egress headaches. Major League Baseball has yet to announce which league would go first. If it's the AL, the Phillies would play the following night which would figure to lower the stress for motorists and SEPTA alike.)\n\nThe point of this little crystal baseball gazing experiment is that the Phillies would very much like to win more games than anybody else this year. Of course they would. They're 32-13 (.711) at CBP this season and 26-19 (.577) everywhere else.\n\nWhich is why Tuesday night's 10-1 win over the Dodgers before a sellout crowd of 43,065 Tuesday night had just a little extra pizzazz. And, remember, this was match-up that already featured the two best teams in the league. Plus, as a bonus, the opportunity to see the leading contenders for NL Most Valuable Player, Shohei Ohtani of Los Angeles and Bryce Harper of Philadelphia, on the same field.\n\n\"It's another game,\" said shortstop Trea Turner, whose grand slam in the fourth put the Phillies up by eight. \"But, at the same time, you like to see where you stack up. That's the first time we've played them this year. We haven't been out there yet. The way we won I think is pretty refreshing and gives us confidence moving forward.\"\n\nThe Phillies now hold a 4 \u00bd game lead over the Dodgers. And while making predictions at this point of the season is even more dicey than long term weather forecasts, it wouldn't be a shock to see L.A. back in just over three months.\n\nDodgers manager Dave Roberts started clearing his bench shortly after the Phillies scored three in the second and sixth in the fourth. Phillies manager Rob Thomson followed suit shortly after. Position player Kike Hernandez came in to pitch in the seventh for the Dodgers and recorded the last four outs.\n\nStill, it would be foolish to read too much into this romp or to assume that the offense erupted just because Harper and designated hitter Kyle Schwarber were both back in the lineup for the first time since June 27.\n\n\"It felt like the squad is coming back together,\" said leftfielder Brandon Marsh. \"It's a great feeling to get those guys back in the lineup. They're such huge pieces to our team. We go nowhere without them. They lead the way and we follow. It's good to have them back. They're the face of our team.\n\n\"It was good to come out and make a statement, but now we've got to come out and do it again.\"\n\nMost of the damage came against Dodgers righthander Bobby Miller, who gave up nine earned runs on 10 hits and 3 walks in four innings. It was his third start since missing two months due to shoulder inflammation and raised his earned run average to 8.07.\n\nIt's a safe bet he won't be part of their postseason rotation unless he executes a dramatic U-turn between now and then.\n\nAlso, most of the damage came from Marsh, catcher Rafael Marchan and centerfielder Johan Rojas. The 7-8-9 hitters went a combined 7-for-9 with seven runs scored and three RBI. That included two doubles by Marchan and a homer by Marsh, who also walked and stole a base. Rojas reached in the seventh when hit on the hand by a pitch.\n\nRojas appeared as if he might be seriously injured by Thomson said after the game that he didn't even need x-rays.\n\nPostgame reports on starter Zack Wheeler, who left the game with tightness in his lower left back, were also encouraging.\n\nAnd, in case you were wondering, the Eagles don't have any home games scheduled during the World Series.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type":

Tuesday marks the opener of a three-game series against the NL and MLB-leading Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nPhiladelphia holds a record of 58-32 on the season and they have been especially good at home. The Phillies are 33-14 at Citizens Bank Park.\n\nAs the team gets ready for the big matchup with Los Angeles, Philadelphia is getting some needed reinforcements. Slugger Kyle Schwarber and star first baseman Bryce Harper were activated from the injured list in advance of Tuesday's game.\n\nSchwarber has been out since June 27 with a groin injury. He has hit .250 with 17 home runs and 49 runs batted in this season. The leading vote-getter for the National League All-Star team, Harper has also been out since June 27 and is hitting .303 with 20 home runs and 58 runs batted in.\n\nThe Phillies would have already been a tough test for the Dodgers without the two players. Adding them into the lineup makes things even harder for Bobby Miller, who starts Tuesday's series opener. The Dodgers' pitching staff is going to have their work cut out for them in this series, particularly with Tyler Glasnow landing on the injured list.\n\nThe Dodgers have shown the ability to score runs at a premium, making this the biggest series to watch over the next few days in baseball. Shohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman, and Will Smith headline the star power for the Dodgers heading into this matchup. Los Angeles holds a record of 55-36 on the season, setting up a showdown between the two best teams in the NL.\n\nPhoto Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports", "source": {"uri": "dodgersnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dodgers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_levine@dodgersnation.com", "name": "Matt Levine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Bank_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizens Bank Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Schwarber", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Schwarber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Glasnow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Glasnow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://dodgersnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/USATSI_20868068_168396005_lowres.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713074", "eventUri": "eng-9713074", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 675, "textEnd": 682, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The decision to hold him out was made after he took swings in the indoor batting cage at Citizens Bank Park.\n\n\"Just got to make sure he can swing efficiently,\" manager Rob Thomson said before a verdict was rendered to move Alec Bohm to first base, start Edmundo Sosa at third, and keep Harper on the bench.\n\n\" READ MORE: Three questions the Phillies must answer before they decide what to do at the trade deadline\n\nHarper didn't make himself available to the media before the game.\n\nAfter a nine-game absence because of a strained left hamstring, Harper returned to the lineup Tuesday night but was nicked up in the first inning when a Freddie Freeman grounder hit him under the glove as he backhanded the ball.\n\nHarper looked at his hand after the play, but remained in the game. He exited after the sixth inning, but Thomson said it was because the Phillies had a 9-1 lead, not because Harper was complaining of an injury.\n\n\"He said he was fine,\" Thomson said. \"Really, when I took him out of the lineup, it wasn't because of his hand or his legs or anything. We were up so many runs, I thought I'd get him off his feet.\"\n\nThomson said Harper showed up \"bruised and sore\" a day later.\n\nThe Phillies entered play Wednesday with the best record in baseball (59-32) and a 7\u00bd-game lead in the National League East. They can afford, then, to be extra cautious with Harper -- and any other player, for that matter, who is dealing with even a minor injury.\n\nIt's possible Harper could return Thursday night. He has said he intends to play in the All-Star Game next week in Arlington, Texas.\n\nHarper was cleared by the Phillies' medical team to return after ramping up his running last week. But he also said he would take care to \"play smart\" in the final week before the All-Star break to assure that he didn't push too hard before he was ready.\n\n\"Not throwing the cloak on, you know?\" he said before the game. \"Just understanding what I need to do to stay in the lineup.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: How aggressive will the Phillies be at the trade deadline? Let's look at Dave Dombrowski's history for clues.\n\nBut Harper also couldn't help himself in his first at-bat back against the Dodgers. He hit a line drive to Freeman at first base and sprinted down the line at 29.1 feet per second, according to Statcast.\n\n\"That was the fastest he ran all year down there,\" Thomson said, smiling.\n\nActually, according to MLB.com, it was the fastest Harper ran down the line since July 15, 2023.\n\nA day later, he was back on the bench.\n\nCenter fielder Johan Rojas also wasn't in the lineup after getting plunked on the right wrist in the seventh inning Tuesday night. But X-rays were deemed unnecessary, and Rojas' absence was largely precautionary, according to Thomson.\n\n\"If this was a playoff game or anything like that,\" Thomson said, \"he'd be able to play.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: The Phillies' bullpen isn't a weakness, but that doesn't mean they should pass on upgrading at the trade deadline\n\nRojas is 7-for-31 (.226) with 10 strikeouts, one walk, three stolen bases, and a .531 OPS in 10 games since returning from triple A. The Phillies must determine if Rojas is the answer in center field before choosing what to do at the July 30 trade deadline.\n\n\"He's been getting on base a little more and stealing bases and creating some runs,\" Thomson said. \"Still a little bit of an overswing a little bit and chasing [pitches out of the strike zone] at times, but not as much as he was before. I feel pretty good about him.\"\n\nFor the second consecutive year, the Phillies will have the 27th overall pick in the draft, which begins Sunday night.\n\n\"One of the things that we learned last year is that anybody can fall to you,\" director of amateur scouting Brian Barber said. \"You have to be prepared that you're picking the 27th-best player on the board with the hope that someone you have evaluated at a higher level happens to fall down to you. And if they do, then you have to be prepared to take that player and you've done all the work there as well.\"\n\nLast year, for instance, infielder Aidan Miller might have been off the board earlier if not for a broken hand that caused him to miss much of his senior season in high school and fall into the Phillies' lap at No. 27.\n\nThe Phillies will also have a second-round pick (63rd overall) for the first time since 2021.\n\n\" READ MORE: Building the Perfect Phillies Pitcher: The signature pitch from each starter, and what makes it special\n\nTaijuan Walker (finger) threw a bullpen session and \"looked good to me,\" according to Thomson. The veteran righty will throw in the bullpen again or pitch live batting practice Saturday. Thomson estimated that he will need four or five minor-league rehab starts before rejoining the Phillies' rotation, likely in August. ...

We go nowhere without them. They lead the way, and we follow.\"\n\nThe only concern for the Phillies on Tuesday was the condition of starting pitcher Zack Wheeler, who threw five stellar innings.

Wheeler said he expects to make his next start Sunday against the Oakland A's in the final game before the All-Star break.\n\n\"It just tightened up on me a little bit, and we were up,\" Wheeler said. \"Just playing it safe.

Marsh, who was 2 for 3 with three runs scored and a home run, batted cleanup with Schwarber and Harper missing.\n\n\"It's definitely a comfort having those two guys back in the lineup and things going back to normal,\" Marsh said. \"I just think we had a good plan tonight. We just kept following each other, passing the baton. It was a big collective group effort.\"\n\nThe Phillies broke Tuesday's game open with six runs in the bottom of the fourth to take a 9-0 lead. Trea Turner had the inning's big hit when he pulled a slider from Dodgers starter Bobby Miller 356 feet into the left field stands for a grand slam.\n\nWith the win, the Phillies ended their two game losing streak and assured themselves of having at least a 7.5 game lead over the second-place Atlanta Braves in the NL East.\n\n\"It was big for us to come out and make a statement tonight,\" Marsh said. \"It doesn't matter anymore. We have to come out and do it again tomorrow.\"\n\nContact: 609-272-7209\n\nMMcGarry@PressofAC.com\n\nTwitter @ACPressMcGarry\n\nCan't get enough High School sports?

L.A. is 5-5 straight up in their last 10 games. The Dodgers are 45-46 ATS this season.\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies are 58-32 straight up this year.

Please note that these numbers are subject to change all the way up to game time, so be sure to check the link to ensure that you're receiving the most up-to-date public betting data.\n\nDodgers shortstop Miguel Rojas had a team-high 2 hits in his team's 9-2 loss to the Brewers on Sunday. In that contest, the 35-year-old from Venezuela went 2 for 2 with 2 doubles, a run scored, and a walk. Rojas is having a solid season as he's slashing .291/.337/.442 in 179 plate appearances. Rojas is hitting .341 with an OPS of .834 on the road this season, making him an appealing option in DFS on Tuesday.\n\nPhillies left fielder Whit Merrifield was the only player on his team to record multiple hits in their 6-0 loss to the Braves on Sunday. In that contest, the veteran from Florence, South Carolina went 2 for 4 with 2 singles and a stolen base. Merrifield is only hitting .197 this year, but he's picking it up of late. In the last 7 days, Whit Merrifield is batting .286 with 4 hits and 4 stolen bases across 14 at-bats. If Merrifield draws another start, he might be a nice cheaper option in DFS against the Dodgers on Tuesday.\n\nLos Angeles is 7-3 straight up in their last 10 games against Philadelphia.\n\nLos Angeles is 23-12 straight up after a loss this season.\n\nThe Dodgers have the fourth-best road record in the league at 27-17 this year. Los Angeles is also 22-14 straight up since May 27th. As a team, Los Angeles ranks third in MLB in home runs, third in RBIs, second in total bases, sixth in hits, first in on-base percentage, second in slugging percentage, and second in OPS this season. The Dodgers are facing Phillies ace Zack Wheeler on Tuesday, but he hasn't gone more than 7 innings in a game this season, and I'm not sure anyone can hold this potent Dodgers lineup completely in check over 9 innings. It's not often you get to bet on the Dodgers as an underdog, so that's what I'm going to do here. I'm taking L.A. on the money on the road in Philly on Tuesday night.", "source": {"uri": "thespread.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheSpread.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

There isn't a better team in baseball, at least not in terms of win percentage. We generally toss the regular season out the window once the playoffs arrive, but Philadelphia's postseason track record is rock solid. This group feels like it is destined for a deep run.\n\nThat said, no team is perfect. In addition to injuries, the Phils have a few noteworthy holes to plug in their depth chart. Luckily for the Philadelphia faithful, Dave Dombrowski is the most aggressive general manager in the MLB. If he is presented with a viable opportunity to upgrade the roster, he will take it -- often at great expense.\n\nThe Phillies have enough trade ammo to go big-game hunting, taking comfort in the knowledge that ownership will pay to re-sign stars when the time comes. Philadelphia tends to do right by its best players and carry one of the league's highest payrolls as a result.\n\nSo, if the Phillies can move the needle with a major addition prior to the July 30 trade deadline, that is precisely what the Phillies will do.\n\nHere are a few targets that should top Philadelphia's wishlist.\n\n5. Randy Arozarena, Tampa Bay Rays\n\nIt has been a difficult season for Tampa Bay Rays outfielder Randy Arozarena on the heels of his All-Star campaign in 2023. The former Rookie of the Year is slumping across the board with a .201/.310/.359 slash line and 11 home runs in 304 at-bats.\n\nStill, there is plenty of reason for Philadelphia to invest in the 29-year-old. He's a classic 'change of scenery' candidate. Sometimes, all it takes to revive one's season is a new team and a new perspective. The Rays are on the outside looking in as far as contention is concerned. That is not the case with Philadelphia. Arozarena would be right back in the World Series hunt.\n\nHe would face more pressure on the whole in Philadelphia, but less pressure at the plate. It's a tough place to play, Philly. The fans are brutal when a player falls short of expectations. And yet, Arozarena would have the helpful cushion of Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, Kyle Schwarber, and Alec Bohm around him. Arozarena would go from a focal point in Tampa to a complementary piece in Philadelphia. That change in role could make all the difference.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that Arozarena is arbitration eligible through the 2026 season, giving Philadelphia a long window to contend before worrying about his next contract. Arozarena is too talented to stay ice-cold forever, and he's affordable on the financial front. That should be enough to pique the Phillies' interest.\n\n4. Brent Rooker, Oakland Athletics\n\nThe Phillies are monitoring Brent Rooker's availability as another Oakland Athletics season falls by the wayside. The 29-year-old was Oakland's All-Star representative last season and he's building off that success with a strong 2024 campaign, slashing .278/.353/.537 with 18 home runs and 54 RBI through 281 at-bats.\n\nRooker is the beating heart of Oakland's offense. In Philadelphia, he would become a mere piece to the puzzle. Arbitration eligible through 2027, the Phillies would theoretically get four postseason runs with Rooker before he even gets a chance to leave in free agency. That level of team control makes him especially appealing to a veteran organization with a loaded payroll.\n\nThere are natural concerns -- Rooker isn't great in the field and primarily operates as DH for the A's -- but for Philadelphia, getting another powerful bat in the outfield could prove to be the difference between a memorable regular season and a parade down Broad Street. With Johan Rojas, Nick Castellanos, David Dahl, and Cristian Pache all struggling to varying degrees, the Phillies need to plant a stable source of offense in the outfield.\n\nRooker can suit up and take the field if called upon. He's not quite on the Kyle Schwarber level of DH exclusivity. Philadelphia has a couple truly elite gloves in Brandon Marsh and Rojas, so there are ways to blanket Rooker a bit. Defense is going to be a constant source of woe, but in reality, the Phils are winning games at the plate and with their pitching. There's enough firepower elsewhere to suffer through a below-average glove in left field. Especially when Rooker is raking in the batter's box.\n\n3. Jazz Chisholm Jr., Miami Marlins\n\nThe Miami Marlins are careening toward the bottom of the MLB standings after an improbable postseason run in 2023. The bad karma from the Kim Ng firing is palpable. Miami was never serious about fielding a winner and now, here we are. Few teams are more prepared to sell off key pieces at the deadline.\n\nFormer MLB The Show cover athlete Jazz Chisholm Jr. is the most appealing name circling the Miami rumor mill. The Phillies, again, need offense in the outfield. Chisholm is 26 with team control over his contract through the 2026 season. Philadelphia isn't afraid to spend when it needs to, but adding affordable star-power is the dream. Chisholm has a chance to develop over the next few years before the Phillies start pondering a long-term extension.\n\nThe Marlins locker room has a long history of fissures, with Chisholm rubbing his vets the wrong way (and vice versa). That shouldn't be an issue in Philadelphia, where the leadership structure is airtight and the locker room is brimming with, for lack of a better term, brotherly love. The Phils' organizational culture is special, top to bottom. It's hard to imagine a better environment for Chisholm to blossom in after suffering the Marlins' incompetence for years.\n\nHe hasn't been the most consistent hitter since his first All-Star berth in 2022, but Chisholm's age and natural talent are impossible to overlook. He adds immediate firepower to the Phillies' outfield with additional developmental upside that others on this list can't match. Injuries are a concern, but Chisholm has reduced his strikeout rate this season and he's a major, major athlete.\n\n2. Luis Robert Jr., Chicago White Sox\n\nThe Chicago White Sox are the worst team in the American League with little to play for over the next few months. As a result, Chris Getz and the reworked front office are expected to start dealing -- and that puts 26-year-old Luis Robert Jr. squarely on the trade block.\n\nIt can be difficult for fans to stomach trading a franchise talent as young as Robert, but the White Sox are playing the long game. He figures to fetch a significant haul on the open market and there won't be a shortage of interested suitors. Philadelphia should be at the front of the line. Robert is exactly what the Phillies need -- a plug-and-play centerfielder with explosive offensive potential.\n\nThis has been a challenging season for Robert, who dealt with a hip injury in April. His numbers aren't quite up to his typical standards, slashing .227/.301/.496 with 10 home runs and 19 RBI through 141 at-bats. Even as Robert shakes off the rust and powers through a slump, however, the voltage behind his swing is evident. When he's right, Robert is among the most prolific home run threats in the sport. He bashed 38 moonshots with 80 RBI a season ago. It's only a matter of time until he's back on track.\n\nHe doesn't come concern-free, of course. Robert strikes out more than he should and he doesn't walk as often as you'd expect from such an imposing hitter. And yet, despite those minor quibbles, he's a prime-aged star with an additional three years of team control. He won't come cheap, but Robert would address the Phillies' primary weakness and improve their World Series odds quite a bit.\n\n1. Cody Bellinger, Chicago Cubs\n\nIt's difficult to grade Cody Bellinger compared to the others on this list. He's the best and most accomplished trade candidate, without a doubt. But, he's also the most expensive, with the least long-term security. Bellinger inked a three-year, $80 million contract with the Chicago Cubs last winter. It includes opt-outs after every season, so Bellinger could theoretically leave after half a campaign in Philadelphia.\n\nThat means the Phillies need to tread carefully when it comes to handing out premium prospects to acquire the 28-year-old. All that said, Bellinger is still in the middle of his prime. He also has a longstanding connection to former Dodgers teammate Trea Turner, which could help him ease into the Phillies' welcoming locker room.\n\nFrom a pure talent perspective, the 2019 NL MVP is the clearest upgrade to Philadelphia's woefully shorthanded outfield. He's a natural centerfielder with the flexibility to play first base, so there's Bryce Harper insurance baked into the price. Bellinger hasn't been as dominant this season after his resurgent 2023 campaign -- he's slashing .266/.326/.411 with nine home runs in 304 at-bats -- but he's still the centerpiece of an otherwise milquetoast Cubs lineup. Without Bellinger, Chicago's nightmare season would be going far worse.\n\nIf he's made available by the Cubs, as some expect, Bellinger should fetch a hefty price despite the lack of long-term security tied to his contract. Even if he's a half-season rental, Bellinger has the chance to transform Philadelphia from the best team in 2024 to an all-time heavyweight. Last season, Bellinger was red-hot down the stretch as Chicago aimed for (but narrowly missed) the playoffs. Surrounded by the wealth of talent in Philadelphia's lineup, Bellinger's immense skills would be put to better use.", "source": {"uri": "fansided.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FanSided"},

Or that the sinking line drive heading in Johan Rojas' direction might have tied the game if it skipped past him and rolled to the wall.\n\nRojas' job is to cover the outfield like a tarp, not to play it safe.\n\nSo, the 23-year-old dove to his left, after racing halfway across center field, and turned a surefire hit (expected batting average: .780, according to Statcast) into the second-to-last out of a 5-3 victory at Wrigley Field.\n\nJos\u00e9 Alvarado got credit for the save. The real rescue belonged to Rojas.\n\n\"He can do that. He can cover a lot of ground,\" manager Rob Thomson said. \"That's the biggest reason why he's here. Right?\"\n\nRight. But is it enough to keep Rojas around for the rest of the season?\n\nThree weeks from the trade deadline -- July 30 at 6 p.m., in case you'd like to set a calendar reminder -- the Phillies have internal decisions to make before choosing what to do. Chief among them: Assessing their needs in the outfield.\n\nEntering the week, the Phillies ranked 27th in OPS in center field (.589) and 25th in left field (.645). But it wasn't merely an offensive shortfall at those positions. They were tied for 22nd in wins above replacement in center field (1.1) and tied for 27th in left (0.5), as measured by Fangraphs.\n\nNo wonder the Phillies are rumored to be interested in every outfielder who might be available -- and a few who probably aren't.\n\nBut the market is still taking shape -- through Monday, 22 of 30 teams were in possession of a playoff spot or within 5\u00bd games -- giving the Phillies time to answer a few internal questions.\n\nA year ago, the Phillies scouted several righty-hitting outfielders before the deadline. But after calling up Rojas from double A last July 15 as an injury fill-in, they decided their best alignment included his elite defense in center field.\n\nWhat has changed?\n\nFor one thing, Rojas' defense isn't nearly as elite. He has recorded four outs above average and prevented three runs in 66 games, according to Statcast. In 59 games last year, he recorded nine outs above average and prevented eight runs.\n\nRojas' hitting remains a weakness. Among 223 players who began the week with at least 225 plate appearances, he ranked 219th with a .547 OPS, 44% worse than league average.\n\nWhen the Phillies optioned Rojas to triple A on June 17, they didn't intend to bring him back so quickly. But Kyle Schwarber (groin) and Bryce Harper (hamstring) went on the injured list 11 days later. Rojas started eight of nine games through Sunday and went 5-for-28 (.179) with nine strikeouts and one walk.\n\nRojas is being encouraged to use his speed, and he did leg out a pair of infield hits last Friday night in Atlanta. If he's able drop down a bunt more often, even better. But it's all predicated on difference-making defense, such as his clutch catch last week in Chicago.\n\nOtherwise, the Phillies could more seriously consider a prospect-laden offer for Luis Robert Jr. of the White Sox or the Marlins' Jazz Chisholm Jr. -- unless they suddenly have a different answer to this common question:\n\nPublicly, Thomson continues to express confidence that Marsh will hit lefties. But the manager's actions indicate otherwise. Marsh hasn't been in the lineup against a lefty starter (non-opener) since May 16.\n\nAnd here's the thing: It's difficult to fault Thomson.\n\nIt has been argued, in this space and elsewhere, that the Phillies should play Marsh every day for the time being. But he's 7-for-46 (.152) with 25 strikeouts against lefties this season after going 22-for-96 (.229) with 49 strikeouts against them last year.\n\nFor now, Marsh's opportunities to face lefties come against relievers, and usually when the Phillies have a lead.\n\n\"It's baby steps,\" Thomson said recently. \"Eventually, I think he's going to be not a platoon. I think he's going to get the bulk of left-handed pitching.\"\n\nMaybe. But it won't happen in the next three weeks, so Marsh can't be regarded as a full-time center-field alternative. He's a better defender in left field anyway. But regardless of his position in the outfield, the Phillies must find him a righty-hitting platoon mate.\n\nWhit Merrifield was expected to fill that role, but the veteran utilityman entered the week batting .197/.278/.283 with one RBI since June 13, no extra-base hits since June 8, and the third-lowest hard-hit rate of any player with at least 100 plate appearances. Cristian Pache, two years older than Rojas with a similar skill set, is batting .196/.292/.261.\n\nDepending on recent usage, Thomson appears to trust at least a half-dozen relievers to get important late-inning outs. Five Phillies relievers have at least one save, a club that doesn't include Orion Kerkering and All-Star Matt Strahm, who have a 1.59 and 1.38 ERA, respectively.\n\nBut Thomson's tendency is to lean even harder on the bullpen in the postseason. It's possible, then, that adding another late-game reliever will be the Phillies' top deadline priority.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Phillies pivoted away from the free-agent market after coming up empty in their pursuits of hard-throwing righties Jordan Hicks and Robert Stephenson, preferring to stick with what they have and save up for an in-season move.\n\nIn president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski's three previous seasons with the Phillies, he has mostly supplemented the roster around the edges with deadline deals for Kyle Gibson, Noah Syndergaard, David Robertson, Marsh, and Michael Lorenzen. Going back further in the expanded wild-card era (since 2012), he often took a similar approach with the Tigers and Red Sox. It's his likeliest course again this year.\n\nBut one season stands apart in Dombrowski's recent history. After the Tigers lost in the World Series in 2012 and the ALCS in 2013, he went all-in at the deadline in 2014 and pulled off a blockbuster for David Price.\n\nCould Dombrowski go for it again now in an analogous situation?\n\nThe answer may depend on how the Phillies sort through their internal questions.", "source": {"uri": "mcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Morning Call"},

Wheeler will join Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, Alec Bohm, Ranger Suarez, Jeff Hoffman and Matt Strahm at the Midsummer Classic on July 16 in Arlington, Texas.\n\n\"It could be more than that,\" Wheeler said of the Phillies' All-Star contingent. \"It shows how well we've been playing as a group. Everybody on the roster is a part of every game and winning.\"\n\nIn Wheeler's last start against the Chicago Cubs on Wednesday, the right-hander allowed five hits and two runs over six innings in a no-decision.\n\nWheeler is 2-2 with a 4.72 ERA in six career starts against the Dodgers.\n\nThe Phillies will look for a bounce-back performance after a 6-0 road loss against the Atlanta Braves, who trimmed the Phillies' National League East lead to eight games.\n\nWhit Merrifield had two hits but the Phillies managed only five overall.\n\nThe Phillies could receive a major boost with the possible returns of Harper (strained left hamstring) and Kyle Schwarber (strained left groin). Harper ran the bases before Sunday's game.\n\nWhen asked if he'll be activated before the series opener, Harper said, \"I feel good, but I don't know yet.\"\n\nSchwarber also ran the bases and manager Rob Thomson intimated that the veteran slugger is expected to be activated on Tuesday.\n\nThe Dodgers will arrive in Philadelphia having won two of three against the NL Central-leading Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nHowever, the Dodgers fell flat on Sunday and lost 9-2.\n\nChris Taylor hit a two-run home run to provide the Dodgers' offense. The team went 1-for-9 with runners in scoring position and left 11 on base.\n\nShohei Ohtani, one of six Dodgers' All-Stars, stole two bases and has 28 home runs and 20 stolen bases this year. Ohtani joins Davey Lopes (1979) and Matt Kemp (2011) as the only Dodgers to accumulate at least 20 homers and 20 steals before the All-Star break.\n\nLos Angeles' other All-Stars are Will Smith, Teoscar Hernandez, Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman and Tyler Glasnow.\n\nBetts is on the injured list with a fractured left hand and will miss this series and the All-Star Game.\n\n\"I think there's six of us, that's pretty special,\" Freeman said. \"When you've got over 20 percent of your team going to an All-Star Game, that means you've got a pretty good team. So it's going to be fun. Great group of guys.\"\n\nDespite missing Betts, the Dodgers entered Monday with a 7 1/2-game cushion in the NL West.\n\n\"I think we've done a nice job of sort of trying to weather it and still winning baseball games,\" manager Dave Roberts said. \"We won a series against a good ballclub over there.\"\n\nThe Dodgers will hand the ball to Bobby Miller (1-1, 6.12). In a no-decision against the Arizona Diamondbacks last Tuesday, the right-hander gave up four hits and two runs in five innings. He struck out four and walked three.\n\nMiller is 1-0 in one career start against the Phillies, tossing six scoreless innings on June 10, 2023.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "bnd.com",

Mandatory Credit: Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports / Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Dodgers welcomed back relief pitcher Michael Peterson for their series opener against the Philadelphia Phillies on Tuesday, but his addition came at a cost: reliever Tyler Glasnow was placed on the 15-day injured list with back stiffness.\n\nHere's what else you need to know for the series opener in Philadelphia:\n\nPhillies starter Zack Wheeler, with a strong 9-4 record and a solid 2.74 ERA, is expected to lead the way for Philadelphia. The Phillies also welcomed back two of their better hitters, Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber, from the injured list prior to the game. Dodgers starter Bobby Miller, with an ERA of 6.12, will need to deliver a standout performance to keep the Dodgers in the game. Given the recent struggles of the Dodgers' offense and Miller's inconsistency, the Phillies have an edge on paper.\n\n* Dodgers designated hitter Shohei Ohtani is the first MLB player with 20 steals and 20 home runs this season. He ranks second in the league in home runs (28), runs (72), extra-base hits (53), and total bases (221), while standing fourth with a batting average of .314.\n\n* Freddie Freeman needs two doubles to reach 500 for his career.\n\n* The Dodgers (55-36) and Phillies (58-32) have the two best records in the National League.\n\nGame odds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Glasnow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Glasnow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Schwarber", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Schwarber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Wheeler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zack Wheeler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_bases", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Total bases"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-base_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extra-base hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4925,h_2770,x_0,y_187/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_dodgers/01j2cs83e5bqza1d98mv.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713074", "eventUri": "eng-9713074", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Wheeler says he's still on the fence about traveling to Texas to join six of his Phillies teammates at the July 16 game.\n\nWheeler brushed aside any serious concern about the state of his back after he left the Phillies' 10-1 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers after five innings with left low back tightness. Wheeler said he played it safe with his health after he sat in the dugout for an extended time when Trea Turner hit a grand slam and the Phillies scored six runs in the fourth inning.\n\nHe pitched one more inning and earned his 10th win.\n\nThe 34-year-old Wheeler conceded his back has bothered him at least since a June 22 win over Arizona in Philadelphia. He took the loss in his last start at Miami.\n\n\"I landed kind of hard here on the mound before we left for that road trip,\" Wheeler said. \"It just tightened up on me then and just had to deal with it and treat it here and there.\"\n\nWheeler threw 76 pitches on a steamy night in Philadelphia and left with the Phillies leading 9-1. He allowed three hits, struck out seven and walked two. Wheeler allowed a solo home run to Cavan Biggio in the fifth inning.\n\nWheeler -- who improved to 10-4 and lowered his ERA to 2.70 -- was lined up to start for the Phillies this weekend and won't be available for the National League staff in next week's All-Star game. The major league-leading Phillies had a big league-high seven All-Star selections.\n\nWheeler said he hasn't made up his mind yet if he will attend the game held at Globe Life Field. Wheeler and fellow pitchers Ranger Su\u00e1rez, Jeff Hoffman and Matt Strahm were picked to join three starting Phillies position players: first baseman Bryce Harper, Turner and third baseman Alec Bohm.\n\nWheeler joined Aaron Nola and Su\u00e1rez as Philadelphia's trio of 10-game winners before the All-Star break -- a first in franchise history. It's the first time in Wheeler's career he won 10 games before the All-Star break.\n\nWheeler and the Phillies agreed in March on a $126 million, three-year deal for 2025-27 that has the fourth-highest average salary in baseball history at $42 million.\n\nSeranthony Dom\u00ednguez, Gregory Soto, Orion Kerkering and Jos\u00e9 Ruiz combined to toss four-hit ball against the Dodgers over four scoreless innings of relief.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He is hitting .207 with 21 strikeouts in 62 plate appearances and has whiffed in 10 of his last 11 at-bats. He sat on Sunday against a right-handed starting pitcher, which was telling. Dahl is out of minor-league options so the Phillies would have to designate him for assignment to remove him from the active roster.\n\nThe other decision might be more difficult. Kody Clemens could be optioned to Triple A, which would be the most straightforward move because the Phillies wouldn't risk losing anyone from the organization. They could also DFA one of Cristian Pache or Whit Merrifield. With how much the Phillies and most teams value roster flexibility, Clemens would appear to be the likeliest candidate.\n\nJ.T.

To this point, he has doing more touch-and-feel throwing.\n\n\"The split's better,\" Thomson said. \"We don't really have a gauge on the velocity yet but we should on Wednesday.\"\n\nWalker will go home to Arizona during the All-Star break but will continue to throw.

There aren't many teams that will go into a game favored over Los Angeles, but the Phillies are one of them.\n\nBetMGM has Philadelphia as a pretty substantial favorite over the Dodgers, who send the struggling Bobby Miller to the mound against Phillies All-Star Zack Wheeler. Here's what the odds look like for Tuesday night's showdown:\n\nPerhaps Miller gets his season back on track eventually. His two road starts since returning from the IL on June 19 don't inspire much confidence that it's going to happen Tuesday against Philadelphia. Miller in two road starts since coming off the IL has pitched just 8.1 innings, allowing 10 hits and eight runs with six walks and three strikeouts. Perhaps the most distressing aspect of that admittedly tiny sample size is that he managed to get through just 2.0 innings against a bad White Sox club. He gave up three runs and allowed seven base runners in that start.

Among their potential targets is former All-Star Luis Robert Jr. of the Chicago White Sox. With the ability to be a difference maker both in the field and at the plate, he would be a huge deadline addition to any team, not to mention an already-potent Phillies lineup.\n\nHowever, MLB insider Jon Heyman recently delivered some bad news for the Phillies and their faithful. He claimed that the Seattle Mariners and Los Angeles Dodgers would be the \"most likely\" landing spots for the White Sox superstar.\n\nPhillies Rumors: MLB insider shuts down Phillies-White Sox Luis Robert Jr. trade\n\nAs for the Phillies, Heyman said he believed that they are primarily in the market for just a fourth outfielder.\n\nThis update will certainly disappoint those fans looking forward to Philadelphia making a big splash ahead of the stretch run. After all, the outfield still remains one of the main weaknesses of the ballclub this season. Despite being better of late, the inconsistencies in the play of both Johan Rojas and Nick Castellanos in 2024 should have management somewhat concerned heading into the postseason. On top of that, Brandon Marsh has also fallen off quite a bit since his hot start in the first month of the season.\n\nWhile Robert may not be hitting for average so far this season at .227, he has maintained his power and productivity with 21 runs scored, 10 home runs and 19 RBI in just 37 games. Over a full 162-game schedule pace, that projects to 97 runs scored, 46 home runs and 83 RBI worth of production. He has been heating up recently, slashing .333/.400/.639 over his last 40 plate appearances heading into Sunday's action.\n\nOn top of that, he has been a perfect 6-for-6 in stolen bases this season, showing no ill effects from the right hip flexor strain that sidelined him for almost two months. Defensively, the former Gold Glove winner has only committed one error while playing some sound defense in the outfield.\n\nIt was expected that the Phillies would need to sacrifice a boatload of top prospects to get a deal done to secure Robert's services. If the intention is to go all-in for a World Series this season, it's a gamble worth taking. However, after Heyman's discouraging insight, the possibility of the Phillies landing the superstar appears slim to none.", "source": {"uri": "thatballsouttahere.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "That Balls Outta Here"}, "authors": [{"uri": "edward_eng@thatballsouttahere.com", "name": "Edward Eng", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Robert_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Robert Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Marsh_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Marsh (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Castellanos", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Castellanos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Glove_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold Glove Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plate appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_8256,h_4644,x_0,y_72/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/6/01j24s7dt8srw2f1kwkp.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713074", "eventUri": "eng-9713074", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 111, "textEnd": 118}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Fittingly, it has been their other big star who has done so: In the first eight games after Harper and Schwarber went out, Trea Turner hit .371 with four homers and 11 RBIs. Still: That Braves series didn't go the way anyone wanted it to. Those guys will be happily, giddily welcomed back. [MLB.com]\n\nESPN publishes their power rankings late into a given week rather than at the start of it.\n\nSo with that in mind, here's what David Schoenfield wrote among their baseball panel of a club that they still kept in first:\n\nIt was a tough week for the Phillies as Bryce Harper (hamstring) and Kyle Schwarber (groin) both landed on the injured list (joining J.T. Realmuto, who has been out since June 10). The immediate fallout was a four-game split against the lowly Marlins. Bryson Stott has moved into Schwarber's leadoff spot, Kody Clemens will fill in at first base, Johan Rojas was recalled from Triple-A and will get time in center field, while various players will rotate through the DH slot. Spencer Turnbull also landed on the IL, opening a start for Michael Mercado on Tuesday. He allowed two hits and one run in six innings to earn the win in his major league debut. Mercado was acquired in the offseason from the Rays. [ESPN]\n\nMercado's next turn in the rotation did not go nearly as well. Atlanta tagged him for three homers and five earned runs in total. He only lasted 1.2 innings in a 6-0 loss.\n\nNo matter where your team is at in the standings, attention always turns to the All-Star Game at this point in the summer, and because the Phillies have been so good through the first half of the season, they've got a lot of them this time around.\n\nWith Bryce Harper (.981 OPS, 40 XBH, 20 HR, 58 RBI), Alec Bohm (.833 OPS, 42 XBH, 11 HR< 70 RBI) and Trea Turner (51 G, .879 OPS, 21 XBH, 11 SB) all voted to start the All-Star Game, the Phillies already had their MLB-leading seven All-Star locked in before the reserves were announced. It's not surprising to see four pitchers make the cut from a staff that leads the majors with a ERA, and props to the player vote for recognizing how good Jeff Hoffman (38 G, 8 SV, 10 HLD, 1.21 ERA) and Matt Strahm (36 G, 7 HLD, 1.59 ERA) have been in support of a terrific rotation led by Ranger Su\u00e1rez (18 GS, 2.58 ERA, 1.02 WHIP, 106 K, 108.0 IP) and Zack Wheeler (18 GS, 2.74 ERA, 0.99 WHIP, 119 K, 111.2 IP). [B/R]\n\nStrahm and Su\u00e1rez have actually looked human of late after mowing through hitters at an absurd rate, but that was probably bound to happen, and hardly makes their All-Star nods any less earned. They definitely deserve to be there.\n\nMORE: Major tests for Phils lie ahead with reinforcements on the way\n\nAgain: the Braves series went south, but Atlanta was already working from way behind going in, so it didn't hurt the Phillies too much.\n\nThat was one of the major perks of getting off to that hot start from back in May. It gives you breathing room.\n\nBad timing for the Phillies to get the Braves in Atlanta with both Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber on the injured list. Taking one of the three games is probably, actually, a plus. The Braves needed a sweep to trim the deficit to six games. Instead, it's eight. Anyway, both players will be back soon and I'm not inclined to bump the Phillies under such circumstances. [CBS Sports]\n\nThe Phillies are an MLB-leading 58-32 entering Tuesday night, have a roster flooded with All-Stars, and are looking at pretty good postseason odds approaching the break.\n\nNot a bad spot to be in, but coming back from it, the real race will start to heat up.", "source": {"uri": "phillyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PhillyVoice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Schwarber", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Schwarber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-base_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extra-base hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trea_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trea Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Turnbull", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spencer Turnbull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._T._Realmuto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

In that game, Smith hit second in the lineup and went 2 for 4 with 2 singles and a walk. Smith is having a fantastic year as he's slashing .274/.348/.500 with 15 homers and 55 RBIs on the campaign. Against lefties, Will Smith is batting .329 with an OPS of 1.084 in 74 at-bats this year. That makes him a worthy DFS option against Phillies southpaw Cristopher Sanchez on Wednesday.\n\nPhillies center fielder Johan Rojas had a big game hitting out of the #9 spot in the lineup on Tuesday. In his club's 10-1 win over the Dodgers, Rojas went 2 for 3 with an RBI, 2 runs scored, and a stolen base. Johan Rojas is batting .234 with 2 homers, 21 RBIs, 17 steals, and an OPS of .561 this season. His speed might make him worth a look in DFS as a long-shot play, provided he draws another start against the Dodgers on Wednesday.\n\nLos Angeles is 23-13 straight up after a loss this season.\n\nLos Angeles is 37-22 straight up in non-division games this season.\n\nLos Angeles will start right-hander Gavin Stone for this game. He's quietly having a stellar season. Stone is 9-2 with an ERA of 3.03 and WHIP of 1.20 in 2024. He's been especially good on the road this year. In 7 road starts this season, Gavin Stone is 6-1 with an ERA of 2.30, a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 3.0, and an opponent batting average of just .203. The Dodgers haven't lost 3 games in a row since May 26th. They've lost their last two contests by a combined score of 19-3. I like Los Angeles to bounce back on the road here.

It's the last game before the All-Star break. Because the All-Star game is two days later, Wheeler wasn't going to pitch in that game.\n\nBut Wheeler's injury is a cause for concern for the Phillies. He came into the game against the Dodgers with a 9-4 record ad 2.74 ERA which ranked fourth in the National League. Wheeler pitched 5 innings Tuesday, allowing just a run on three hits while walking two and striking out seven.\n\nWheeler lowered his ERA to 2.70.\n\nBut Wheeler seemed to struggle in the fifth inning. After striking out Miguel Vargas looking for the second out, Wheeler gave up a home run to No. 9 hitter Cavan Biggio. Then he walked Shohei Ohtani and Will Smith back-to-back.\n\nWheeler then got Freddie Freeman to ground out to end the inning.

He might be joined by Bryce Harper, who missed the same amount of time with a left hamstring strain.\n\nIn nine games without Harper and Schwarber, the Phillies averaged 3.67 runs per game, and were held to two or fewer runs five times.\n\nWhatever Phillies lineup is planned, the Dodgers will add another reliever ahead of Tuesday's series opener, with Justin Wrobleski headed back to Triple-A Oklahoma City after making his major league debut on Sunday.\n\nThe Dodgers are going to insert a bullpen game at some point during the final week before the All-Star break, and the earliest it would happen is Thursday's series finale against the Phillies, which would otherwise be Landon Knack's turn in the rotation.\n\nAsked on Sunday about the Dodgers rotation for the Phillies series, manager Dave Roberts said, \"I know Bobby [Miller] and then [Gavin] Stone, and then we'll see about the last day.\"\n\nDodgers pitching has struggled for the last week and a half, since Stone's shutout in Chicago.

Stone, who pitches Wednesday against S\u00e1nchez, ranks sixth with a 3.03 mark.\n\nNational television will show the first two games of this series, with a few caveats. TBS has the Tuesday broadcast, with Brian Anderson and Jeff Francoeur on the call, but that telecast will only be available for those outside the local markets. Tuesday's game will also be televised by the usual local broadcasts. Wednesday, however, is a rare midweek exclusive ESPN game, which means no SportsNet LA for the middle game of the series.\n\nThis is the first of two regular season series between the Dodgers and Phillies this season.

Wheeler says he's still on the fence about traveling to Texas to join six of his Phillies teammates at the July 16 game.\n\nWheeler brushed aside any serious concern about the state of his back after he left the Phillies' 10-1 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers after five innings with left low back tightness. Wheeler said he played it safe with his health after he sat in the dugout for an extended time when Trea Turner hit a grand slam and the Phillies scored six runs in the fourth inning.\n\nHe pitched one more inning and earned his 10th win.\n\nThe 34-year-old Wheeler conceded his back has bothered him at least since a June 22 win over Arizona in Philadelphia. He took the loss in his last start at Miami.\n\n\"I landed kind of hard here on the mound before we left for that road trip,\" Wheeler said. \"It just tightened up on me then and just had to deal with it and treat it here and there.\"\n\nWheeler threw 76 pitches on a steamy night in Philadelphia and left with the Phillies leading 9-1. He allowed three hits, struck out seven and walked two. Wheeler allowed a solo home run to Cavan Biggio in the fifth inning.\n\nWheeler -- who improved to 10-4 and lowered his ERA to 2.70 -- was lined up to start for the Phillies this weekend and won't be available for the National League staff in next week's All-Star game. The major league-leading Phillies had a big league-high seven All-Star selections.\n\nWheeler said he hasn't made up his mind yet if he will attend the game held at Globe Life Field. Wheeler and fellow pitchers Ranger Su\u00e1rez, Jeff Hoffman and Matt Strahm were picked to join three starting Phillies position players: first baseman Bryce Harper, Turner and third baseman Alec Bohm.\n\nWheeler joined Aaron Nola and Su\u00e1rez as Philadelphia's trio of 10-game winners before the All-Star break -- a first in franchise history. It's the first time in Wheeler's career he won 10 games before the All-Star break.\n\nWheeler and the Phillies agreed in March on a $126 million, three-year deal for 2025-27 that has the fourth-highest average salary in baseball history at $42 million.\n\nSeranthony Dom\u00ednguez, Gregory Soto, Orion Kerkering and Jos\u00e9 Ruiz combined to toss four-hit ball against the Dodgers over

Meanwhile, Wheeler has allowed 2 or fewer runs in 6 of his last 7 starts. Both teams possess great bullpens, and remember, the Dodgers are without SS Mookie Betts as well.\n\nTAKE PHILLIES (-135).\n\nRun line/Against the spread\n\nPASS, but as mentioned, Wheeler hasn't allowed more than 2 runs in 6 of his last 7 outings and has only allowed 2 or more runs in 4 of 18 starts this year.\n\nBET ZACK WHEELER UNDER 2.5 EARNED RUNS (-125).\n\nOver/Under\n\nThe wind is forecast to blow out to center at 9 mph, but that may work in our favor. The Over was 0-1-2 in this head-to-head series at Citizens Bank Park last June. Both offenses are missing major cogs. I dig UNDER 9 (-115).\n\nPlay our free daily Pick'em Challenge and win!

This divisional lead has given Los Angeles some breathing room, but the San Diego Padres are still within reach of first place. With this in mind, the Dodgers would love to knock off the Phillies this evening.\n\nLos Angeles is coming off a series win against the Milwaukee Brewers, even though they did not have star player Mookie Betts in the lineup. Betts has been a leader for the Dodgers offense, boasting a .304 batting average this year. However, he has been dealing with an injured wrist since last week, and he will be unavailable for this evening's game.\n\nThe Dodgers will have to rely on Shohei Ohtani and Freddie Freeman to carry the team without Betts in the lineup. Ohtani leads the team in batting average and home runs, while Freeman boasts a team-high .406 on base percentage this season.\n\nThe Phillies are atop the National League East with a 58-32 record. The team has struggled recently, as they are coming off a series loss to the Atlanta Braves. Philadelphia only scored one run in their last two games combined, which must change for the team to win this evening.\n\nThe Phillies offense has been led by Bryce Harper this year, as he possesses a .303 batting average. Additionally, Harper leads the team with 20 home runs this season, making him a massive threat at the plate. However, he has been injured for the past two weeks, so he might not be in tonight's lineup.\n\nIf Harper is unable to play this evening, then Phillies third baseman Alec Bohm will need to carry the offensive load.

With the trade deadline and All-Star break both fast approaching, Philly's rotation is among the best in the majors in basically every category.\n\nHowever, they have no reliable and healthy fifth starter, their undisputed ace left his start Tuesday night with an injury, and their unexpected ace has been awful recently. Will the Phillies bolster their starting pitching at the deadline? Or do they have faith in health and bounce backs from their arms?\n\nWho should you trust right now in the rotation, and how much? Here's a look at our confidence ratings in the Phillies' current starters:\n\nWheeler was yanked after tossing five impressive innings against the Dodgers on Tuesday due to lower back tightness. Manager Rob Thomson said afterward that the move was more of a precaution and that Wheeler should be able to make his next start (via Phillies Nation). If so, Wheeler is hands down the most trustworthy starter on the Phillies' roster, as can be seen in his numbers. He's an All-Star yet again and BetMGM has Wheeler as a slight NL Cy Young favorite over the Braves' Chris Sale.\n\nIf we had done this two weeks ago, the No. 2 spot would have been Su\u00e1rez's running away. But as we'll get into shortly, he's had a couple of really bad outings while Nola has been a steady machine on the mound in recent weeks. His last four starts have all been quality ones, and while he might not be the Phillies starter most likely to throw a shutout every fifth day, he is certainly very likely to give the Phillies a very good chance of winning week in and week out.\n\nS\u00e1nchez is a solid seven right now, as he's relatively unproven and a bit inconsistent. But when he's good, it's masterful. Over a three-game stretch of starts from June 17 to June 28, S\u00e1nchez was 3-0 with a single earned run allowed over 23 innings pitched -- including a shutout. In his most recent outing, he allowed seven runs in four frames. He's got the stuff, and he's worth a healthy dose of confidence.\n\nThrough his first 16 starts, Su\u00e1rez was absolutely magnificent. He had a 1.82 ERA, 10-2 record, averaged more than a strikeout per inning pitched, and was getting real NL Cy Young buzz. In his two most recent starts, however, he allowed 11 earned runs after allowing 20 runs across all of his starts prior. We are not throwing the towel in on Su\u00e1rez -- far from it. But back-to-back stinkers have him in our fourth spot right now. If he returns to form in his final start before his first All-Star game, he will surely be deserving of the confidence he had from fans and teammates earlier this summer.\n\nThe Phillies are currently in limbo here. Taijuan Walker was...okay. He had a 3-3 record and a 5.80 ERA in 10 starts before he hit the injured list but he never fully looked right. There's a chance he returns after the All-Star break, and due to the bags of cash they promised him in free agency two years ago, the Phillies will give Walker every opportunity to seize his role in the rotation.\n\nPhillies fans were hoping for more Spencer Turnbull, who had a 1.78 ERA in seven starting opportunities, but he's also hurt and could miss more time than Walker. The last two starts went to Michael Mercado, who looks probable to get at least one more attempt before the break.

Harper was recovering from a left hamstring injury and Schwarber had a left groin injury.\n\nBoth players were in the lineup for the Phillies' series opener against the Dodgers on Tuesday at Citizens Bank Park. Schwarber is back in the leadoff spot as the designated hitter, and Harper is batting third and playing first base.\n\nIt was initially unclear if Harper would be ready to rejoin the team on Tuesday, but he made significant progress over the weekend's road trip in Atlanta. He ran the bases at 100% effort on Sunday, and said he felt good afterward, but was hesitant to give a timeline for his return.\n\nDespite the fact that he has been cleared to play, Harper plans to be cautious this week.\n\n\"Obviously I'm going to play smart this week, not go crazy I'd imagine, just do the best I can going into the break,\" Harper said.\n\nWhen asked to elaborate on what he meant by playing smart, Harper said: \"Not throwing the cloak on. Understanding what I need to do to stay in the lineup.\"\n\nHarper said on Sunday that he plans to play in the All-Star Game on July 16, and he reiterated that again on Tuesday. The goal for this week will be to not do too much, which, for a player like Harper, is easier said than done.\n\n\"I think anytime you're able to get off the DL within 10 days, it's huge,\" he said. \"Obviously that's a really good team over there. But like I said, I want to play smart. Want to do it the right way, and have a good week.\"\n\nHarper and Schwarber left a June 27 loss to the Marlins early with their injuries and were placed on the injured list the next day. The Phillies went 5-4 without them.\n\n\"They did a fantastic job,\" Schwarber said of his teammates. \"I feel like that's kind of been the MO of the team over the last couple of years: When someone goes down, someone steps right up to the challenge, and they take it right by the reins, and they run with it.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Schwarber", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Schwarber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Bank_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizens Bank Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/297/29718/2971871.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713074", "eventUri": "eng-9713074", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-16", "textStart": 1175, "textEnd": 1182}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 1589, "textEnd": 1596}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

But what happened next was more out of the ordinary than even a trouncing of the mighty Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nBryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber were mostly immaterial to the victory.\n\nCrazy, isn't it? Upon welcoming back the star sluggers who account for more than one-quarter of the team's scoring output, the Phillies leveled a 10-1 shellacking Tuesday night because the bottom of the order -- Brandon Marsh, Rafael March\u00e1n and Johan Rojas -- went 7 for 9 with a homer (from Marsh), two doubles (from March\u00e1n), seven runs, three RBIs and two stolen bases.\n\nOK, so Trea Turner did smash a grand slam to crack open the game like a pi\u00f1ata at an 8-year-old birthday party before struggling Bryson Stott banged a solo shot off the facing of the second deck. And the Dodgers aren't the Dodgers with three regulars, including Mookie Betts, three starting pitchers, and much of their bullpen jamming up on the injured list like a Los Angeles freeway.\n\nIt wasn't all knee-slapping laughs, either, before 43,065 patrons, another sold-out crowd at Citizens Bank Park. Zack Wheeler dominated for five innings, then exited before the sixth with what the Phillies characterized as \"left low back tightness.\"\n\nStay tuned for more on that ominous in-game update.\n\nBut it was a testament to the depth of the roster that the Phillies went 5-4 while Harper and Schwarber were convalescing from a hamstring and groin strain, respectively. Before that, they overcame a six-week stretch without Turner. Heck, they're even 14-12 since irreplaceable catcher J.T. Realmuto had torn cartilage removed from his right knee.\n\n\"They did a fantastic job,\" Schwarber said. \"I feel like that's kind of been the M.O. of the team over the last couple years that when someone goes down, someone steps right up to the challenge and take it by the reins and they run with it.\"\n\nSo, when Harper vowed not to push it too hard in his return from the first hamstring injury of his career -- \"I'm not throwing the cloak on,\" he said before the game -- the rest of the lineup predictably had his back.\n\nThe Phillies raised their best-in-baseball record to 59-32 by pouncing on the 55-37 Dodgers with a two-out rally in the second inning. Marsh drew a walk against starter Bobby Miller, stole second base, went to third on March\u00e1n's single, and scored when Rojas beat out a chopper past the mound to second base. March\u00e1n and Rojas raced home on a two-run single by Schwarber.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Marsh_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Marsh (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Schwarber", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Schwarber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_Stott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryson Stott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Rojas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mel Rojas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Bank_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Citizens Bank Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Wheeler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zack Wheeler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trea_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trea Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._T._Realmuto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

No chance. This game, a 10-1 Philadelphia Phillies drubbing of the Los Angeles Dodgers, featured the two best teams in the National League and it began with Zack Wheeler against Shohei Ohtani -- maybe the best pitcher and hitter in the sport. This is how the Phillies would remind everyone why they are here.\n\nMarch\u00e1n called for a first-pitch fastball. Ohtani fouled back 97 mph on the outer edge. March\u00e1n called for another fastball, up and in. Ohtani whiffed at it.\n\n\"When I saw the first two, he's throwing it,\" March\u00e1n said. \"We're going to throw another one.\"\n\nWheeler threw 98 mph, a little further up and in to Ohtani, and the star slugger swung and missed. Three pitches, three fastballs -- and the last one was the hardest pitch Wheeler threw all night.\n\nOthers noticed. The 59-32 Phillies have a style: Here is our best, do what you can with it. They have scored 118 more runs than they have allowed. They have, for much of this season, bulldozed opponents by leaning on their strengths. Wheeler embodies it. He does not emote. He is an elite athlete who loves junk food. He has mastered new breaking balls, but he is here because of his riding fastball.\n\nWheeler threw only 76 pitches, his fewest of the season, because he felt back tightness. The Phillies were unconcerned afterward; Wheeler said he expects to start Sunday. Manager Rob Thomson echoed that. Bohm said he was unaware something had even happened to Wheeler. It was hot. The Phillies had a huge lead. Wheeler wasn't needed.\n\nIt's funny. There was supposed to be a postseason vibe to this series. All three games are nationally televised. Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber returned to the Phillies lineup after 10-day absences. But, by the fifth inning, both teams were pulling their stars from the lopsided game. At one point, the umpire crew had to call New York to see if the Dodgers could use a position player -- Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez -- to pitch in the seventh inning.\n\nBoth of these teams know there are greater conquests to come. The Dodgers are missing key players. The Phillies are trying to keep everyone healthy for the long haul.\n\nWheeler admitted his back has bothered him for one or two starts now. He had been receiving treatment for it. The Phillies have a conservative medical staff and, if there was any risk, they would have told Wheeler he could not pitch.\n\nThey will re-evaluate him on Wednesday. Thomson described Wheeler's removal as \"precautionary.\" The last pitch Wheeler threw was a 96 mph fastball to Freddie Freeman, who pounded it into the ground for a routine out. The back did not appear to affect Wheeler, but he said something anyway.\n\nIf Wheeler has to go on the injured list, he cannot return until July 26. The Phillies could just skip Wheeler without putting him on the injured list. They have already made one change to their rotation before the All-Star break. Tyler Phillips will slide into the rotation for Saturday's game against the Oakland A's. That bumps Michael Mercado to the bullpen -- for now.\n\n\"This was the plan from the beginning because he doesn't have that many innings on him,\" Thomson said.\n\nMost rival evaluators view Mercado as a reliever, and he'll have a chance in that role. If Wheeler cannot go Sunday, the Phillies could hold Mercado back and start him.\n\nPhillips, who made an impression when he struck out seven Atlanta Braves in his four-inning debut as a reliever over the weekend, has a chance to enter the equation. The Phillies will need a sixth starter in August when they'll want to provide extra rest for everyone else.\n\nTaijuan Walker, all of a sudden, has become important again. He will throw a bullpen session for the first time Wednesday afternoon, then expects to face hitters Saturday in a simulated situation. He is not an option until after the All-Star break. The Phillies will need him.\n\nWheeler lowered his ERA to 2.70 with five strong innings. He shrugged afterward.\n\n\"Velo wasn't necessarily there,\" Wheeler said. \"I mean, it was there some, but wasn't there some. I feel like I was kind of just cruising, but when I needed to reach back I could.\"\n\nLike that first at-bat. Bohm watched from third base and all he could think about was the time three years ago when Wheeler faced Schwarber. It was June 2021 when Schwarber was on an incredible power binge with the Washington Nationals. Wheeler started Schwarber with a fastball.\n\n\"There goes Wheels,\" Bohm said. \"He just challenges him. He hits it foul.\"\n\nIt went 384 feet. But it was foul.\n\nWheeler threw Schwarber two cutters and a curveball. Schwarber struck out. It's one thing for a pitcher to have blind trust in his stuff; it's another to have the stuff that justifies that mindset.\n\n\"Exactly,\" Bohm said. \"And he makes the pitch. No matter who you are. Obviously, guys are going to get him and all that whatever. But a lot of guys probably start (Ohtani) off with a curveball and try to just dance around him there.\"\n\nOr a curveball once he jumped to an 0-2 count against Ohtani. Nope.\n\n\"That's Wheels,\" Bohm said. \"He's a dog up there. It's cool.\"\n\nMaybe he'll start on Sunday. Maybe he won't. No one was worried about it being a serious issue. The Phillies have earned this right -- the bigger picture is more important than anything else. They're going to play in October. They know what it feels like to pit their best against the most formidable opponents.\n\nIt's daunting until it isn't.\n\n\"Just attack,\" March\u00e1n said. \"With Wheeler's stuff, he's got a little bit of an advantage. He's one of the best, too.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_gelb@nytimes.com", "name": "Matt Gelb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Wheeler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zack Wheeler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breaking ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrique_Hern\u00e1ndez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enrique Hern\u00e1ndez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Schwarber", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Schwarber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taijuan_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taijuan Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curveball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curveball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/07/09233919/USATSI_23710731-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713074", "eventUri": "eng-9713074", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 2822, "textEnd": 2829}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

With just a few weeks left before the deadline, the Philadelphia Phillies have become one of the most active teams in the rumor mill.\n\nAs of right now, the Phillies are one of the best teams in baseball. By record, they're the best team.\n\nWhile they don't have to make any moves, there are a couple of areas that the team could look to upgrade. One of them is in the outfield and the other is in the bullpen.\n\nFanSided MLB insider Robert Murray has revealed major details about Philadelphia's trade deadline plans. He seems to think the Phillies could be in the market to make a major move for the offense.\n\n\"I think the Phillies, if they want to, they can go out and get anyone they want. They have the prospect capital to get it done. They have a need for another outfielder that would even allow them to get a Luis Robert Jr. type. I think it makes sense. I don't think it's the most likely thing in the world if the White Sox are going to ask for the moon and back for Robert... If there's one thing we know about Dave Dombrowski, he's not afraid to make a big move. He's not afraid to deal prospects to try and upgrade the Major League roster if he deems the person or player too good to pass on.\"\n\nLuis Robert Jr. is a name that has popped up in many trade rumors connected to the team. He would provide a lot of power to the lineup, although there are major concerns about his ability to stay healthy.\n\nAnother name that has been thrown around heavily in rumors connected to Philadelphia is relief pitcher Tanner Scott.\n\nMurray also revealed some thoughts about the Phillies pursuing bullpen help.\n\n\"I think they need to add somebody. We saw what happened last year with Craig Kimbrel. It wasn't him singlehandedly, but he played a big part in the Phillies not making the World Series. The Phillies were in position to beat the Diamondbacks in that series... I don't think the Phillies want to make that mistake again.\"\n\nObviously, the team is expected to be very busy in the coming weeks.\n\nPhiladelphia has dominant all season long. They aren't going to hold back from making moves that will improve their chances of winning a championship.\n\nFans better buckle up, as things could get very interesting in the near future.

It turned out to be a low-grade strain, so he only needed to spend the minimum amount of time on the shelf.\n\nSchwarber went down at the same time as Harper, suffering a mild left groin strain against the Miami Marlins on June 27.\n\nIn order to make space for the two veteran sluggers on their active roster, the Phillies designated outfielder David Dahl for assignment and optioned infielder Kody Clemens to Triple-A Lehigh Valley.\n\nHarper suffered through quite the cold streak to open the season, batting .230 with an .805 OPS in March and April, but he had been producing at an elite level again before he got hurt.\n\nSince May 1, Harper is batting .342 with a 1.076 OPS.

Harper led all NL players in fan votes during Phase 1 of the selection process.\n\nSchwarber, meanwhile, will not be in Arlington, Texas, as he was crowded out by Shohei Ohtani and Marcell Ozuna.\n\nThe 31-year-old is currently batting .250, which is a vast improvement on the .207 mark he put up between 2022 and 2023. He owns an .820 OPS with 17 home runs, 49 RBI and a 1.8 WAR through 79 games.\n\nSchwarber leads the NL with 247 home runs since the start of 2017, with Aaron Judge being the only MLB player to hit more in that time.\n\nHarper and Schwarber are returning just in time for the Phillies' three-game set against the Los Angeles Dodgers, which gets underway on Tuesday. First pitch for the series opener at Citizens Bank Park is set for 6:40 p.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Schwarber", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Schwarber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dahl_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Dahl (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Clemens", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roger Clemens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_transactions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball transactions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wins Above Replacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitting_streak", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hitting streak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcell_Ozuna", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcell Ozuna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Bank_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citizens Bank Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4118,h_2316,x_0,y_58/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/fastball/01j2ce413fw7zst0hh8d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713074", "eventUri": "eng-9713074", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 230, "textEnd": 237}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 460, "textEnd": 467}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-01", "textStart": 864, "textEnd": 869}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Phillies manager Rob Thomson said Harper's hand was bruised on a groundball in the first inning. Harper, though, clearly grabbed his hand and hunched over in pain on a second-inning chopper by Miguel Rojas.\n\nAll-Star third baseman Alec Bohm moved to first and Edmundo Sosa started at third base for Philadelphia.\n\nHarper is hitting .299 with 20 homers and 58 RBIs for the Phillies, who entered Wednesday with the best record in baseball.\n\nA two-time NL MVP, Harper won consecutive National League Player of the Month awards in May and June. He is near the top of the NL in several categories, including average, homers, RBIs, on-base percentage, slugging percentage and on-base plus slugging percentage.\n\nHarper said Tuesday he would play in the July 16 All-Star Game at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas.\n\nThomson also said All-Star right-hander Zack Wheeler was still \"a little sore\" but no structural damage was found after an MRI on his back. Wheeler left his start Tuesday night against Los Angeles after five innings with left low back tightness but still picked up the win. He threw 76 pitches on a steamy night in Philadelphia.\n\nThomson said he didn't know yet if Wheeler would make his next scheduled start, on Sunday against Oakland.\n\nThe 34-year-old Wheeler conceded his back has bothered him at least since a June 22 win over Arizona in Philadelphia. He took the loss in his June 27 start at Miami.\n\n\"I landed kind of hard here on the mound before we left for that road trip,\" Wheeler said Tuesday. \"It just tightened up on me then and just had to deal with it and treat it here and there.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He had struck out in nine of his last 10 at-bays.\n\nClemens batted .242 with three home runs and 10 RBIs in 62 at-bats for the Phillies.\n\nContact: 609-272-7209\n\nMMcGarry@PressofAC.comTwitter @ACPressMcGarry Can't get enough High School sports?

For the Phillies to recruit any player of value that could significantly help the ballclub, no doubt some valuable prospects will have to head the other way to get any deal done.\n\nWith that in mind, which of the Phillies' prospects should be classified under the untouchables category, and which ones could be expendable? We will look at three top prospects the Phillies should avoid moving at all costs and two others that should become their main trade chips going forward.\n\n3 Phillies prospects who should not be traded, 2 who should\n\nThe Phillies should not trade Aidan Miller at the deadline\n\nOne of the best top prospects in the Phillies' system not named Andrew Painter, Aidan Miller has put together a strong 2024 season thus far. As the Phillies' first-round selection in the 2023 MLB Draft, Miller has jumped all the way to the No. 2 spot in the organization's top prospects list, according to MLB Pipeline, in just about a year's time.\n\nMiller began the year with the Single-A Clearwater Threshers, where he rode his hot bat to a .275 batting average and .884 OPS, with 28 runs scored, 16 doubles, five home runs, 26 RBI and 10 stolen bases in 39 games.

Phillies manager Rob Thomson said Harper's hand was bruised on a groundball in the first inning.

Wheeler left his start Tuesday night against Los Angeles after five innings with left low back tightness but still picked up the win. He threw 76 pitches on a steamy night in Philadelphia.\n\nThomson said he didn't know yet if Wheeler would make his next scheduled start, on Sunday against Oakland.\n\nThe 34-year-old Wheeler conceded his back has bothered him at least since a June 22 win over Arizona in Philadelphia. He took the loss in his June 27 start at Miami.\n\n\"I landed kind of hard here on the mound before we left for that road trip,\" Wheeler said Tuesday. \"It just tightened up on me then and just had

Veteran Kyle Schwarber spoke on the organization's approach and general belief in his team.\n\n\"There's a big picture of an organization, but there's also a picture of why you play the game -- it's to win a championship,\" Kyle Schwarber said, via The Athletic. \"Our guys all know that we have one of the best front offices in all of baseball, the best ownership in baseball, and the best coaching staff. Obviously, we have a really good team. We've been close twice now. We all want to get to that finish line. He's going to do whatever he thinks our team needs to push us to the finish line.\"\n\nSchwarber also emphasized that adding proper personalities that fit the clubhouse is vital as well. Disrupting the chemistry the Phillies have right now would be less than ideal, although it should not be too much of a worry given that they have proven to be a contender with this core over the past couple of seasons.\n\n\"You always want to bring in the right people,\" Schwarber said, via The Athletic. \"We got a really good chemistry with what we have. We have a standard within our clubhouse that people are going to want to abide by. It's just how we are as a team and how we operate. We go from there. We have that trust.\"\n\nIt will be interesting to see who Dombrowski adds to the Phillies at this deadline, and with his track record, he will certainly add talent.\n\nWhat are the Phillies' needs ahead of the trade deadline?\n\nThe Phillies have plenty of star power in both the lineup and the rotation. Schwarber, alongside players like Bryce Harper, Trea Turner and the breakout of Alec Bohm give the lineup plenty of thump. Zach Wheeler, Aaron Nola, Cristopher Sanchez, and despite his recent struggles, Ranger Suarez give the Phillies plenty of depth in the rotation.\n\nDombrowski will be looking for role players and bullpen depth, according to The Athletic. That is unless injuries crop up over the next few weeks before the deadline.\n\nThe good news is that Dombrowski has a track record of making successful depth moves to add players who were pivotal for championship teams. In 1997, Dombrowski traded for Craig Counsell, who had a short track record at the major league level, but he had a pivotal sacrifice fly in Game 7 of the World Series, and eventually scored the winning run in the 11th inning.\n\nDombrowski was in Boston when the Red Sox won the World Series in 2018. That lineup was a juggernaut, similar to the Phillies' current lineup. Dombrowski added Steve Pearce, a player who was a journeyman. He was a player who could succeed in certain situations and matchups. He ended up being the World Series MVP that season.\n\nAs this year's deadline approaches, Dombrowski is looking for that piece to get the Phillies over the hump.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_bologna@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Ryan Bologna", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Schwarber", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Schwarber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Dombrowski", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dave Dombrowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Bohm", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alec Bohm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nola", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Pearce_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Pearce (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Series Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Counsell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craig Counsell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Wheeler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zack Wheeler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trea_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trea Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Phillies-news-Kyle-Schwarber-gives-eye-opening-take-on-trade-deadline-strategy.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713074", "eventUri": "eng-9713074", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Harper and Schwarber return just in time for a three-game home series against the fellow powerhouse Dodgers that begins Tuesday night.\n\nTo create space on the active roster for the slugging duo, the Phils also optioned infielder Kody Clemens back to Triple-A and designated outfielder David Dahl for assignment.\n\nHarper has been out since June 27 because of a hamstring injury.

Or did it have more to do with the anticipation of a series at home against that rich, annoying team from the West Coast voted most likely to play deep into October?\n\n\"I think anytime you're able to come off the (IL) within 10 days, it's huge,\" Harper said. \"Obviously that's a really good team over there, but like I said, we want to play smart, want to do it the right way, and just have a good week.\"\n\nFair enough ... but what does \"playing smart\" mean to him, anyway?\n\n\"It's like, not throwing the cloak on,\" said Harper, perhaps an early day Harry Potter fan. \"Just understanding what I need to do to stay in the lineup.\"\n\nWhile Harper seemed determined to lighten his load for that night's game, it only took a couple of innings for him to get a bit nicked. He took a line drive off the base of his first-baseman's mitt that might not have caught all glove at the time.\n\nWhatever it was, Harper shook it off. He knows that even without your wizard's cloak on, you can play this game \"smart\" only so much.\n\n\"We haven't said anything to him but, really in our minds, he can go 100 percent or he wouldn't be able to play,\" manager Rob Thomson said of Harper. \"If he's going to be cautious, I'm OK with that.\"\n\nSchwarber and Harper went out on the same night, June 27, in the latter stages of a home loss to the Miami Marlins. Schwarber's was a relatively mild groin pull, Harper's a bit more serious of a hamstring. But that injury wasn't nearly as bad as hamstrings usually are.\n\n\"I'll check in with them every day, obviously, and if they're good to go in their mind, then I'm going to let them,\" Thomson said. \"They haven't been out that long.\"\n\nBut it didn't seem to be a coincidence that they were healthy enough to return just in time to face the Dodgers.\n\n\"For us, it's just that we always want to be out there,\" said Schwarber, who added that he's \"100%\" now. \"I take pride in playing as many games as I can. You don't ever want to wind up on the IL, but obviously coming back and helping the team out, that's what this is all about.\n\n\"It's just being healthy in general; you want to be as healthy as long as you can. You play so many games that nothing is ever picture perfect. And hopefully it's kind of like that last little speedbump that we hit, that maybe we can finish this thing out healthy and strong and we'll see where we go.\"\n\n* * *\n\nNOTES >> To make room for Schwarber and Harper, outfielder David Dahl was DFA'd, and is expected to go back to Lehigh Valley. Utility guy Kody Clemens was sent back to the IronPigs, with Thomson requesting that club give him more outfield work than he's had this year. ... Though he was afraid of being rusty at first, Schwarber stung the ball in his first two ABs Tuesday, the second going for a two-run single. ... Without Harper and Schwarber, and with J.T.

Harper was recovering from a left hamstring injury and Schwarber had a left groin injury.\n\nBoth players were in the lineup for the Phillies' series opener against the Dodgers on Tuesday at Citizens Bank Park. Schwarber is back in the leadoff spot as the designated hitter, and Harper is batting third and playing first base.\n\nIt was initially unclear if Harper would be ready to rejoin the team on Tuesday, but he made significant progress over the weekend's road trip in Atlanta. He ran the bases at 100% effort on Sunday, and said he felt good afterward, but was hesitant to give a timeline for his return.\n\nDespite the fact that he has been cleared to play, Harper plans to be cautious this week.\n\n\"Obviously I'm going to play smart this week, not go crazy I'd imagine, just do the best I can going into the break,\" Harper said.\n\nWhen asked to elaborate on what he meant by playing smart, Harper said: \"Not throwing the cloak on. Understanding what I need to do to stay in the lineup.\"\n\nHarper said on Sunday that he plans to play in the All-Star Game on July 16, and he reiterated that again on Tuesday. The goal for this week will be to not do too much, which, for a player like Harper, is easier said than done.\n\n\"I think anytime you're able to get off the DL within 10 days, it's huge,\" he said. \"Obviously that's a really good team over there. But like I said, I want to play smart. Want to do it the right way, and have a good week.\"\n\nHarper and Schwarber left a June 27 loss to the Marlins early with their injuries and were placed on the injured list the next day. The Phillies went 5-4 without them.\n\n\"They did a fantastic job,\" Schwarber said of his teammates. \"I feel like that's kind of been the MO of the team over the last couple of years: When someone goes down, someone steps right up to the challenge, and they take it right by the reins, and they run with it.\n\nAs corresponding moves, outfielder David Dahl was designated for assignment on Monday, and infielder Kody Clemens was optioned to Triple-A Lehigh Valley on Tuesday.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"We're bringing two left-handed bats, so that probably eliminates two left-handed bats, and David didn't have any options left, so that was a DFA,\" said manager Rob Thomson. \"And Kody, as I told him, I just didn't see a whole lot of playing time right now. So, we wanted to keep him going, want to keep him getting regular reps. Want to focus a little bit more on the outfield, left field, so he has that in his back pocket if we need to do it.\"\n\nClemens will play left field three to four times a week in triple A. He'll play the infield when he's not in left field. Thomson didn't rule out the possibility of Dahl returning to the organization if he clears waivers.\n\n\"Can't say enough about what Dave did and how he came up here and performed well for us,\" Schwarber said. \"And obviously Kody too, he had some big hits, right? There's some really good players -- everyone else, too, you look at [Garrett] Stubbs, you look at [Rafael] March\u00e1n, doing such a great job with J.T. [Realmuto] being down. It's just kind of that mentality we have the whole time.\"\n\nMercado out, Phillips in\n\nTyler Phillips will make his first big league start on Saturday. Michael Mercado, who started against the Braves on Sunday and allowed five earned runs in 1 2/3 innings, will move to the bullpen.\n\n\"This was the plan, from the beginning,\" Thomson said of Mercado's move, \"because he doesn't have that many innings on him. [Assistant pitching coach] Brian Kaplan told him that we will build you up, basically until the All-Star break, and then we'll transition you back to the bullpen. At the time, it was in triple A, now we're transitioning to a major league bullpen.\"\n\nWhen asked if this start will be an audition for Phillips, Thomson said: \"We'll see. I mean, anything can happen. But he pitched great the other day, so if he does that, it'll be tough to take him out of the rotation.\"\n\nThe 26-year-old Phillips, a South Jersey native and a graduate of Bishop Eustace Prep, made his big league debut against the Braves on Sunday. He allowed one run on a solo home run on three hits across four innings with seven strikeouts.\n\nExtra bases\n\nReliever Michael Rucker, who was on a rehab assignment (right hand arterial vasospasm), was returned to the injured list on Tuesday with right turf toe.\n\n\u00a92024 The Philadelphia Inquirer.

The Phillies are second in both markets.\n\nThe prices are different for this series. The Phils are a slight -135 favorite to win at least two of three, mostly because of the Bank's home field advantage.\n\nI could argue that this week's series is more important to the Phils in terms of where they stand in the NL than the recently-completed Atlanta series.\n\nKyle Schwarber and Bryce Harper are expected to be back, so the only key component missing from the series is Mookie Betts, who is obviously a big piece, but it's as close to full strength as both teams will be.\n\nIf you're looking at this series on NJ sports betting apps, or sportsbook apps in PA, the Phillies have a very clear pitching advantage, not just in the series, but in an overall comparison to the Dodgers.\n\nZack Wheeler and Ranger Suarez are All-Stars. Aaron Nola and Cristopher Sanchez both have strong cases to be All-Stars.\n\nThe Dodgers have Tyler Glasnow at the top of the rotation, but as you'll see this week, they're relying on a lot of young talent to boost up their rotation right now. They are hoping to get Clayton Kershaw back for the second half, and because it's the Dodgers, they'll probably land a front-end starter at the trade deadline.\n\nWheeler is on the hill for the Phils, and although Freddie Freeman (.412 BA in 51 career at-bats) has a great history against him, he and Shohei Ohtani are holding up a lineup with a lot of holes.\n\nTuesday's Dodgers starter Bobby Miller has horrendous numbers on the road. Miller owns a 9.64 road ERA. He's allowed 15 earned runs in 14 innings away from Dodger Stadium. Sure, it's a small sample size, but it's a pretty awful sample size.\n\nGavin Stone is the Dodgers' best pitcher throwing in the series, but he's going up against the unstoppable machine that is Cristopher Sanchez at the Bank. Sanchez is 5-1 with a 1.35 ERA and 58 strikeouts at home. Good luck beating him, even with Ohtani and Freeman in the lineup.\n\nNola opposes Landon Knack on Thursday. I would expect a bit of extra juice from Nola in that game. He could be mad about missing the All-Star Game and could be motivated by the big-game atmosphere to deliver a gem.\n\nThe pitching edge is clearly there, and with Schwarber and Harper likely back in the lineup, the overall hitting edge is similar.\n\nI don't know if Harper can gain any ground on Ohtani in the NL MVP race this week. It would take a Herculean effort off the injured list, something like four homers in three games, to really put pressure on Ohtani from an oddsmakers perspective.\n\nThe NL MVP is nice, but it's probably the least of the Phillies' concerns right now. The goal of this week is to prove they can not just compete with, but beat the Dodgers, and at least on paper, the setup is there for a big week.", "source": {"uri": "crossingbroad.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crossing Broad"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_tansey@crossingbroad.com", "name": "Joe Tansey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nola", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Schwarber", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Schwarber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Bank_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizens Bank Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Wheeler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zack Wheeler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Glasnow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Glasnow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_Kershaw", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clayton Kershaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.crossingbroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/USATSI_23674617-1200x628.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713074", "eventUri": "eng-9713074", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

It sounded so cool at the time, members of our staff wanted to know where it stacked up to other light beers, both made locally and among some of the most popular beer brands around.\n\nSo naturally, we held a taste test -- for your edification, of course -- and reviewed how Garage compares to like-minded local brews like Love City Lager, Kenwood Beer, 2SP's Pony Boy light lager, and more. I considered dropping a spoiler alert, but don't want to ruin the results (especially for you, Jason Kelce, assuming you're reading this).\n\nLet's see, what else ... just in time for a series with the Los Angeles Dodgers, and before the MLB All-Star break, the Phillies got sluggers Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber back.\n\nNow, that's good news.\n\nOh, you can also feel good with the knowledge that temperatures will return to some semblance of normal soon -- but not today -- as we're looking at highs in the mid-90s again on this sunny Wednesday.\n\n\u2753What's your best all-time Philly sports memory? Email us back for a chance to be featured in the newsletter.\n\nThree weeks from the trade deadline -- July 30 at 6 p.m., in case you'd like to set a calendar reminder -- the Phillies have internal decisions to make before choosing what to do. Chief among them: Assessing their needs in the outfield. But the market is still taking shape -- through Monday, 22 of 30 teams owned a playoff spot or within 5\u00bd games -- giving the Phillies time to answer a few internal questions.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, Harper and Schwarber returned to action yesterday, feeling good off hamstring (Harper) and groin (Schwarber) injuries that sidelined both. Harper noted before last night's game against the Dodgers he planned to \"play smart,\" and \"not go crazy,\" ahead of the MLB All-Star Break which he plans to attend and play in on July 16.\n\nThe bottom of the Phillies lineup -- Brandon Marsh, Rafael March\u00e1n, and Johan Rojas -- went 7-for-9 at the plate and powered a blowout win over the Dodgers. Though Zack Wheeler left Tuesday's game early with lower back tightness, he quelled concerns postgame by saying he expects to make his next start Sunday.\n\nNext: The Phillies continue their series with the Dodgers tonight at 7:05 p.m. (ESPN). Cristopher S\u00e1nchez (6-4, 2.96 ERA) will start against Dodgers right-hander Gavin Stone (9-2, 3.03).\n\nAndre Drummond rounds out the supporting cast of players the Sixers picked up during NBA free agency. If that name sounds familiar, it's because it is. Drummond, who left the Sixers after the 2021-22 season returns to the Wells Fargo Center hungry for a championship. Sixers center Joel Embiid once called Drummond the best backup he's had in his career, and the Sixers brought him back on a two-year, $10 million-plus deal to fill that role again.\n\nThat sounds just fine for Drummond, considered one of the best rebounders in basketball, who's excited to be back in Philly. \"It feels like home,\" Drummond said. \"It feels good to be back. I'm excited to try again and be here for the entire journey.\"\n\nKnow what we're excited about? The Sixers revealed that they may soon return the all-Black uniforms back into the rotation. You know, the ones made famous by Allen Iverson and the 2001 NBA Finals team. When is still up in the air, but we know now that it's not out of the question.\n\nNext: The Sixers face the Utah Jazz Wednesday (9 p.m., ESPN2) at the Delta Center as part of Salt Lake City summer league.\n\nSure, it's July, but there's a good bit of Flyers conversation to be had this offseason. Fortunately, Inquirer NHL beat writer Jackie Spiegel lays it all out in a series showcasing the moves -- or lack thereof judging by this latest piece -- of the Orange and Black, who look to move forward with another young and eager corps in a few months.\n\nFrom line breakdowns to the ongoing goaltending situation, there's a good deal of what-ifs, question marks, and hot stove starters long before the Flyers will drop the puck to kick off the 2024-25 season on Oct. 11 against Vancouver.\n\nWe would love to see more of your photos with a Philly sports theme. It could be a shot of you at Citizens Bank Park, your kid playing Wiffle ball in Phillies gear ... your choice. Send your photos here and we'll see what makes the cut.\n\nSHARON MDANRB\n\nThis current Phillies player was a teammate of the Dodgers Shohei Ohtani and now playing alongside Bryce Harper has been on teams with a pair of MLB MVPs in his career. Think you know? Take a guess and then click here to see if you're right.\n\nQuestion reminder\n\nAnswer: A: 13.

But after a dominant season debut against the Cardinals (6 IP, 0 ER, 11 K), he's been nothing short of disastrous.\n\nMiller allowed seven earned across six innings to the Cubs and Twins before hitting the IL with shoulder and forearm issues. He made some rehab starts at Low-A Rancho Cucamonga and Triple-A Oklahoma City, allowing 13 earned across 15 innings with 10 strikeouts, eight walks and two HBPs.\n\nIn three starts since returning from the minors, Miller's allowed 10 earned across 13 innings with seven strikeouts, nine walks, and three homers.\n\nWhat's more concerning is his velocity and command.\n\nMiller used to have the highest average fastball velocity in baseball (99 mph), but he's been down about two ticks since returning from the IL (97). His heater dropped even more in his most recent start against Arizona (96), and his sinker and slider also lost considerable heat -- his slider is down four ticks on average since opening day.\n\nDuring his most recent three-start stretch, Miller has posted a 110 Stuff+ mark across his arsenal, which is OK but nowhere near the 123 mark he posted in 2023.\n\nOf more significant concern in his control, as his Location+ mark is down to 89 across his past three starts, a 13-point drop from 2023. He only converted 60% of his pitches for strikes against Arizona, his secondaries couldn't earn whiffs, and missed spots resulted in hard-hit balls -- Miller's allowed five barrels across his past 13 innings, a 12% rate.\n\n\" READ MORE: Bet on this three-leg parlay that involves a Spain win or tie against France in the Euros semifinal\n\nMiller looks all out of whack, and he's battling a hard-hitting Phillies lineup that will have their two best southpaw sluggers back. The lineup has held up OK in their absence, but their return should have a monster impact on Tuesday, given Miller's non-negligible platoon splits.\n\nMiller has no shot of competing with Zack Wheeler, Philadelphia's starter for Tuesday.\n\nWheeler is the betting favorite for NL Cy Young (+135 at FanDuel), and I don't need to emphasize just how good he is. He's in excellent form, striking out 20 across his past 20 innings while allowing only five earned runs.\n\nI also give the Phillies a slight bullpen advantage on Tuesday, given they're a consistent top-five bullpen with plenty of depth. Philly relievers have posted a 30% strikeout minus walk rate over the past two weeks, compared to LA's 7% mark during the stretch.\n\nUltimately, I believe the Phillies jump all over Miller, building an early lead, even against an excellent Dodger lineup. The bullpen also has a better chance to hold the lead over the final frames.\n\nThe weather report calls for excellent hitting weather at Citizens Bank Park on Tuesday, with mid-90-degree temperatures and near-double-digit breezes blowing out toward center field. BallParkPal's weather model projects a +17% Run Factor for the game behind a +31% home run factor. BallParkPal projects 10 runs for this game, while the Action Network projects 9.5.\n\nTherefore, I expect a high-scoring Phillies win behind a brutal outing from Miller, and I advise you to wager accordingly.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tanner_mcgrath@inquirer.com", "name": "Tanner McGrath", "type":

Both Kyle Schwarber and Bryce Harper could be activated ahead of Tuesday's series opener against the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nSomeone will have to clear space. It could be as simple as swapping out two other lefty bats, David Dahl and Kody Clemens. They have two underperforming righty hitters, Cristian Pache and Whit Merrifield, whose spots on the roster are also tenuous. This is a bench unit that could undergo change all month.\n\nSchwarber will be in Tuesday's lineup and he'd replace Dahl, who has 10 strikeouts in his past 11 at-bats. The veteran outfielder was noticeably not in Sunday's lineup against a righty pitcher. Merrifield played and collected two singles.\n\nDahl provided a jolt when he came to the Phillies in early June. The club would look to keep him in the organization, but Dahl can elect free agency and seek a better situation if he is designated for assignment and clears waivers. There could be mutual interest in returning to Triple-A Lehigh Valley.\n\nClemens is hitting .217/.250/.304 since his recall. He can be optioned to the minors, while Pache cannot. If the Phillies demote Clemens now, they reserve the right to change course later in the month if they acquire another right-handed-hitting outfielder. Clemens could come back as a lefty bench bat.\n\nIn each of the past two years, the Phillies have delayed certain roster decisions until the trade deadline. They kept Didi Gregorius, Od\u00fabel Herrera and Johan Camargo around until the end of July 2022 before committing to younger players. Josh Harrison was unproductive as a bench player in 2023. He stuck around until Aug. 2.\n\nMerrifield has seen more at-bats in the past two weeks, but he's yet to make better contact. (Among 316 hitters with 100 batted balls this season, Merrifield ranks 316th in average exit velocity.) No one has had a better past two weeks than Weston Wilson at Triple A. He's batting .303/.432/.727 with nine homers in 18 games since his demotion in mid-June. He has walked as many times (15) as he's struck out. Can he push the Phillies to switch bench bats?\n\n\"Well, the clubhouse atmosphere is always on my mind, too,\" Thomson said. \"But he is playing very well. Now, anything can happen. You can have injuries. A lot of things can happen. He's really playing well.\"\n\nThe Phillies are 13-12 since J.T. Realmuto went on the injured list to have knee surgery. Their catchers are hitting .256/.287/.422. That .709 OPS is 16th in the majors in that span.\n\nThomson, a month ago, said any offensive contributions from his catchers, while Realmuto sat, would be a bonus. It's been decent. Garrett Stubbs has been on base at least once in 11 of his 13 starts. Rafael March\u00e1n has hit for power from both sides of the plate.\n\n\"They've been great,\" Thomson said. \"I mean, they really have. They've both been fantastic.\"\n\nRealmuto is progressing well in his rehab work; he's been running, hitting and doing catching drills. He plans to spend the All-Star break in Florida and work at the club's Clearwater complex. The Phillies are targeting July 19 -- the first game after the break -- for his return. Realmuto said playing before that has not been ruled out, but taking the extra weeks seems sensible. He will not take a minor-league rehab assignment.\n\nRealmuto might need an extra day or two off per week upon returning, but the Phillies do not expect to limit his workload more. That is one reason they'd lean toward sending March\u00e1n back to Triple A -- so he can stay sharp by playing four or five times a week.\n\n\"I think being J.T.'s backup might be the toughest job in baseball because you only play a couple times in 10 days,\" Thomson said. \"That's tough. That's hard to do.\"\n\nSoon after last Friday's series-opening win against the Atlanta Braves, Thomson gathered everyone in the clubhouse and toasted Aaron Nola's 100th career win.\n\nNola appreciated the gesture and the significance of all 100 wins being with the same team. He is just one of three active pitchers, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, who have 100 career wins with one club. The others: Clayton Kershaw and Justin Verlander.\n\n\"This day and age, it's tough to get wins as a starter because the third-time-through-the-lineup (penalty) and all those rules that a lot of people are going by,\" Thomson said. \"But ... it's just ... like, his whole life is consistent. He's the same guy every day. Whether he's just throwing long toss, or he's got a bullpen session, or whether he's starting a World Series game. He is the same guy. He's got a routine every day and he sticks to it. He just gets his lunch pail and goes to work.\"\n\nNola's last outing was sneaky good. Braves hitters whiffed at 21 of his 103 pitches. That was the second-most swings-and-misses Nola has ever had in a start. His four-seam fastball averaged 94 mph -- the best velocity he's had all season.\n\nIt was impressive, considering this was Nola's 35th career regular-season start against the Braves. They know him and he knows them. He threw 58 percent fastballs this time -- the most in a start against Atlanta since 2019.\n\n\"The main thing for me was my fastball felt good,\" Nola said. \"The command was good for the most part with that pitch. So I think that opened up some other stuff.\"\n\nNola has a 3.48 ERA. He's allowed 16 homers, although nine were solo shots. It hasn't been perfect. But he is doing his job.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_gelb@nytimes.com", "name": "Matt Gelb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dahl_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Dahl (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Clemens", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roger Clemens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_transactions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball transactions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristian_Pache", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cristian Pache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Schwarber", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Schwarber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whit_Merrifield", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whit Merrifield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_for_assignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Designated for assignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_velocity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exit velocity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Camargo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Johan Camargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Stubbs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Garrett Stubbs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._T._Realmuto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

In fact, I would not be surprised to see him finish as a finalist for the National League Rookie of the Year award. He is coming off a tough start, but do not let that distract from how good he has been. In May and June combined, Stone finished with a 1.97 ERA, 52 strikeouts, and 13 walks in 64 innings pitched. The Dodgers were 9-1 in those 10 starts. If Stone can flush his last start, and go back to how he has been throwing, the Dodgers will win this game.\n\nThe Dodgers have one of the better lineups, even without Mookie Betts. They are batting over .250 as a team, and they are third in home runs in the MLB. Their barrel percentage, hard hit percentage, and average exit velocity are all some of the best in the MLB, as well. In 19 games without Betts, the Dodgers still have an OPS of .789, and they have scored 103 runs. If their offense gets hot, the Dodgers will win this game.\n\nWhy The Phillies Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Phillies are one of the best teams in the MLB in general. They have the best record in the National League, and they are running away with their division. Offensively, the Phillies are third in batting average, seventh in OPS, seventh in home runs, and they talk plenty of walks. Philadelphia has a tough matchup in this game, but they are a very good offense. If they can get hot and stay hot with their bats, the Phillies will win this game.\n\nCristopher Sanchez has been a pleasant surprise the past two season, but especially this season. Sanchez has a sub-3.00 ERA, and he is coming off an excellent month of June. In June, Sanchez had a 1.64 ERA, and he walked just four batters. On the season as a whole, Sanchez does a great job keeping the ball on the ground. Against a team like the Dodgers, this is very important. If Sanchez can pitch like he did in June, and keep the Dodgers from driving the ball in the air, the Phillies will win this game.\n\nFinal Dodgers-Phillies Prediction & Pick\n\nThis is going to be a very good game, and it could be a preview of the NLCS. For this game, I am going to take the Phillies to win at home. Sanchez has been good at home, and the Phillies are hard to beat in Philadelphia.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_zunkel@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Cameron Zunkel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_velocity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exit velocity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Dodgers-vs.-Phillies-prediction-odds-pick-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713074", "eventUri": "eng-9713074", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

If that streaming method has already been used, then Sling offers a first month discount to new users.\n\nThe Dodgers currently possess a 55-37 record, which leads the National League West by 7.5 games. Although their record is impressive, the team has been experiencing some struggles recently. Los Angeles is coming off a terrible 10-1 loss to the Phillies, as they could not find much success in the series opener.\n\nLos Angeles has been playing without their star player Mookie Betts, who is still recovering from a wrist injury. Additionally, the Dodgers have struggled with their pitching rotation, as they have been forced to place numerous pitchers on the injured list. These health problems have hurt the team recently, but they must overcome the adversity to win this evening.\n\nOhtani will need to play at a high level tonight, as the Dodgers try to regain some momentum with a victory in primetime. Ohtani currently boasts a .315 batting average and leads the team in home runs, so he will be their biggest threat at the plate tonight.\n\nThe Phillies improved their record to 59-32 after their dominant victory yesterday, and they could win the series by defeating the Dodgers again this evening. Philadelphia showcased some great hitting last night, as four of their players had multiple hits.\n\nTrea Turner led the team with three hits, including a grand slam in the fourth inning. This incredible performance boosted his batting average to .342, and he will try to replicate his success against Los Angeles tonight.\n\nNotably, Philadelphia star Bryce Harper struggled during his first game back from injury. He was 0-4 at the plate last night, which lowered his batting average to .299. Since he performed poorly yesterday, he will try to bounce back against the hampered Los Angeles pitching staff tonight.", "source": {"uri": "al.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "al"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FuboTV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FuboTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trea_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trea Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/2ZMAZNZAN5EGBBLL6EHAFNAV6Y.jpg?auth=8e6b4176899c550983fe0a55306308c6bfd8235fcd89df490a564df47e1617d1&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713074", "eventUri": "eng-9713074", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

This has been known basically since the first couple weeks of the season when they emerged as a top team in the league.\n\nOutside of the usual bullpen additions, it wasn't clear what exactly Dave Dombrowski would be targeting with this roster already loaded as is, but things started to crystalize over the course of the year when their outfield wasn't quite performing as expected.\n\nNick Castellanos was going through a major slump, Johan Rojas hadn't taken the next step on offense, Cristian Pache was little more than a platoon option, and super utilityman Whit Merrifield has put together the worst performance of his career.\n\nOutfield became an obvious target for the Phillies.\n\nWho they might look to acquire became the next question.\n\nWith things so tight in Wild Card races across the board in both the National and American Leagues, it's not certain who exactly are going to be sellers except for the few who are already way out of the mix.\n\nOne of those teams is the Oakland Athletics, and according to Bob Nightengale of USA TODAY, Philadelphia has their eyes on one of their players.\n\n\"The Philadelphia Phillies are keeping a close eye on Oakland A's left fielder Brent Rooker. The Phillies rank 26th in OPS among left fielders this season,\" he reports.\n\nFollowing Brandon Marsh's 2-for-3 performance with a home run on Tuesday night, those numbers will certainly look better, but the point still remains that the Phillies could use some help in the outfield when it comes to offensive output.\n\nBrent Rooker would be an interesting addition.\n\nThrough 78 games, the 29-year-old is slashing .282/.360/.542 with 18 homers, 55 RBI, an OPS+ of 155, and wRC+ of 153, easily the best numbers of his career.\n\nHe would certainly give Philadelphia the boost they are looking for.\n\nWhat it might take to acquire the up-and-coming outfielder is unknown since he has three more seasons of club control. The Athletics will probably be searching for talented prospects and maybe a piece like Pache in return.\n\nBased on Nightengale's report, it sounds like the Phillies already have a clear target in mind, so this is something worth keeping an eye on.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Dombrowski", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dave Dombrowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Bank_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizens Bank Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristian_Pache", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cristian Pache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Rooker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brent Rooker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whit_Merrifield", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whit Merrifield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Castellanos", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Castellanos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_player", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Utility player"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Marsh_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Marsh (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2899,h_1630,x_0,y_52/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_phillies/01j2dee33sq74zrzxhdj.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713074", "eventUri": "eng-9713074", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 309, "textEnd": 316}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-04-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

The higher-ups in Philadelphia certainly believe so.\n\nAs MLB Insider Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic provided updates across the league, he featured some comments from Phillies manager Dave Dombrowski on the state of their farm.\n\n\"It doesn't get the acclaim it should,\" said Dombrowski's in response to the system ranking in the bottom half of the league for most outlets.\n\nRosenthal pointed out that while Philadelphia does have some exciting young players in the pipeline, they haven't had the chance to draft a lot of new talent which has hurt the depth.\n\n\"The Phillies' spending under owner John Middleton, which began during Matt Klentak's tenure, has cost the franchise young talent, but in a different form. In five of the past six years, the Phillies sacrificed high draft picks after signing free agents who rejected qualifying offers,\" said the writer.\n\nThe signings of current stars Bryce Harper, Zack Wheeler, Nick Castellanos and Trea Turner has cost them second round selections for the past four season. Now, as they prepare for the fast approaching 2024 MLB draft, they have all of their picks to select with for the first time in a while.\n\nPhiladelphia currently holds five Top-100 prospects in Andrew Painter, Aidan Miller, Justin Crawford, Starlyn Caba and Mick Abel. They finished last season with just two. The emergence of a couple key players could be reason enough to reevaluate the state of the farm.\n\nPainter and Miller have been established prospects for a bit now and are expected to both make their debuts by the end of next season.\n\nCrawford as a first-round selection back in 2022 out of high school and has quickly proven that he deserves respect as a prospect.\n\nThough he hasn't progressed past High-A, the speedy centerfielder as slashed .309/.365/.434 and stolen 83 bases in his first three seasons.\n\nMiller is another high school draftee that has been adjusting well to the minor league system. He projects as a very solid power hitter, though the numbers haven't been exactly what the team has wanted with a .240/.361/.422 slashing line with seven home runs this year.\n\nSome of these names could be moved at the trade deadline, which would definitely hurt the overall outlook, but they still have a good mix of players that will be ready soon and future star potential bats.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Dombrowski", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dave Dombrowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Rosenthal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ken Rosenthal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_M._Steinbrenner_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George M.

Despite Mookie Betts being sidelined by injury, the Dodgers have remained similarly dominant over the last month with a 135 wRC+ and .357 wOBA.\n\nOver his last 10 starts, S\u00e1nchez has pitched to an ERA of 2.80 with an xFIP of 2.96. He has continued to generate lots of ground balls, with batters owning a 57.9% ground ball rate over that span.\n\nSince last season, S\u00e1nchez has gotten ground balls 67% of the time with runners in scoring position, which is the highest rate of any starter to throw 165 innings or more and has likely helped him overachieve his xERA in both seasons.\n\nSanchez owns a Stuff+ rating of 92 and a Location+ rating of 100 in 2024.\n\n\" READ MORE: Rory McIlroy to win the Scottish Open among the best bets to place ahead of the tournament\n\nBoth starters have been dominant of late and feature underlying metrics that suggest they should continue to pitch to relatively even results moving forward.

Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman hit a grounder to the right side of the infield. The ball bounced off the glove of Phillies first baseman Bryce Harper, who recovered and retired the runner.\n\nHarper, scheduled to start in Tuesday's All-Star Game, shook his hand for a few moments immediately afterward, a telltale clue that the ball might have caught some flesh as well. \"The hand is fine,\" manager Rob Thomson said after the game, dismissing the question.\n\nOr not.\n\nThe Phillies' lineup for Wednesday night's middle game against the Dodgers at Citizens Bank Park was posted unusually late. The reason was that Harper was still in the batting cage, testing his bruised and sore hand.\n\nIn the end, he did not start. Alec Bohm moved over from third to play first and Edmundo Sosa stepped into his spot.\n\nThat was just one of three injury updates Wednesday afternoon that were more annoying in the short term than concerning in the long run.\n\nAll-Star right-hander Zack Wheeler, who left Tuesday night's start after five dominant innings with tightness in his left lower back, is still questionable for his scheduled start Sunday against the Athletics. Center fielder Johan Rojas, who was hit on the hand by a pitch, was also out of the lineup. Thomson had downplayed the severity of both injuries postgame.\n\nSitting Harper and Rojas was presented as strictly precautionary.\n\n\"Any time with hand and foot injuries, I'm leery because it changes your swing a little bit. If this was a playoff game or anything like that, (Rojas) would be able to play,\" the manager said. \"Harp, we just want to make sure he can swing efficiently.\"\n\nWheeler had an MRI Wednesday that revealed no structural damage, but he was still sore. \"We're going to be very cautious on him,\" Thomson said, a shift from the night before when he said he \"assumed\" the 34-year-old would be good to go.\n\nAsked directly what the upside would be to have Wheeler work on Sunday when skipping that start followed by the All-Star break would give him at least 10 days to recuperate, Thomson said it would be just to have one of baseball's best pitchers on the mound.\n\nBut, he added: \"We're not going to risk anything. And it just happens, really, on the perfect day. The day before the break. That way you can get all your bullpen arms to throw in the game and they don't have five days off coming out of the break.\n\nIt had previously been announced that Wheeler, like any All-Star starting pitcher whose turn was Sunday, would not appear in the game.\n\nMORE GENERAL HOSPITAL\n\nRight-hander Taijuan Walker threw a bullpen Wednesday afternoon. \"He looked good to me. His split looked good,\" Thomson said. \"I'm not sure about velo but Saturday he's going to either throw another bullpen or pitch BP.\"\n\nThe manager guessed that Walker, who is on the IL with right index finger inflammation which is believed to be the reason he's been unable to throw his splitter effectively, would need multiple rehab starts before he could be activated.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Wheeler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zack Wheeler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Thomson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rob Thomson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Philadelphia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Philadelphia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Bank_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizens Bank Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Bohm", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alec Bohm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Sosa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jorge Sosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_cage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taijuan_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taijuan Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-finger_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Split-finger fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic resonance imaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnphilly.com/c40173fc8f6a79047c7d6df490ce1621", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713074", "eventUri": "eng-9713074", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Eric Hartline-USA TODAY Sports / Eric Hartline-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFormer San Diego Padres outfielder David Dahl has been designated for assignment by the top team in the National League, the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nThe Phillies announced the a flurry of transactions, including the move to cut Dahl, via Twitter/X on Tuesday:\n\nThe Phillies called up Dahl on June 3 from Triple-A Lehigh Valley; however, his time in the big leagues was less than ideal. In 19 games with the Phillies, Dahl slashed .207/.242/.397 with a .639 OPS with a 33.9 percent strikeout rate in 62 plate appearances.\n\nAfter mainstays Brandon Marsh, Kyle Schwarber, and superstar Bryce Harper were activated from the injured list, the Phillies no longer needed Dahl's services. The former Padre may now try to find a new team.\n\nDahl's time as a Friar was brief. He signed a minor league deal with the club after the 2022 season.

Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman hit a grounder to the right side of the infield. The ball bounced off the glove of Phillies first baseman Bryce Harper, who recovered and retired the runner.\n\nHarper, scheduled to start in Tuesday's All-Star Game, shook his hand for a few moments immediately afterward, a telltale clue that the ball might have caught some flesh as well. \"The hand is fine,\" manager Rob Thomson said after the game, dismissing the question.\n\nOr not.\n\nThe Phillies' lineup for Wednesday night's middle game against the Dodgers at Citizens Bank Park was posted unusually late. The reason was that Harper was still in the batting cage, testing his bruised and sore hand.\n\nIn the end, he did not start. Alec Bohm moved over from third to play first and Edmundo Sosa stepped into his spot.\n\nThat was just one of three injury updates Wednesday afternoon that were more annoying in the short term than concerning in the long run.\n\nAll-Star right-hander Zack Wheeler, who left Tuesday night's start after five dominant innings with tightness in his left lower back, is still questionable for his scheduled start Sunday against the Athletics. Center fielder Johan Rojas, who was hit on the hand by a pitch, was also out of the lineup. Thomson had downplayed the severity of both injuries postgame.\n\nSitting Harper and Rojas was presented as strictly precautionary.\n\n\"Any time with hand and foot injuries, I'm leery because it changes your swing a little bit. If this was a playoff game or anything like that, (Rojas) would be able to play,\" the manager said. \"Harp, we just want to make sure he can swing efficiently.\"\n\nWheeler had an MRI Wednesday that revealed no structural damage, but he was still sore. \"We're going to be very cautious on him,\" Thomson said, a shift from the night before when he said he \"assumed\" the 34-year-old would be good to go.\n\nAsked directly what the upside would be to have Wheeler work on Sunday when skipping that start followed by the All-Star break would give him at least 10 days to recuperate, Thomson said it would be just to have one of baseball's best pitchers on the mound.\n\nBut, he added: \"We're not going to risk anything. And it just happens, really, on the perfect day. The day before the break. That way you can get all your bullpen arms to throw in the game and they don't have five days off coming out of the break.\n\nIt had previously been announced that Wheeler, like any All-Star starting pitcher whose turn was Sunday, would not appear in the game.\n\nMORE GENERAL HOSPITAL\n\nRight-hander Taijuan Walker threw a bullpen Wednesday afternoon. \"He looked good to me. His split looked good,\" Thomson said. \"I'm not sure about velo but Saturday he's going to either throw another bullpen or pitch BP.\"\n\nThe manager guessed that Walker, who is on the IL with right index finger inflammation which is believed to be the reason he's been unable to throw his splitter effectively, would need multiple rehab starts before he could be activated.\n\nON DECK\n\nRHP Landon Knack (1-2, 2.86) will start the series finale for the Dodgers vs. RHP Aaron Nola (10-4, 4.38) Thursday at 6:05 p.m.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsphiladelphia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports Philadelphia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Thomson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rob Thomson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Wheeler", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zack Wheeler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_cage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Bank_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizens Bank Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Bohm", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alec Bohm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Sosa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jorge Sosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic resonance imaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nola", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taijuan_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taijuan Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-finger_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Split-finger fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/2024/07/GettyImages-2161422986.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713074", "eventUri": "eng-9713074", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

Will Zack Wheeler start Sunday?", "body": "PHILADELPHIA - The Phillies were late posting a batting lineup for Wednesday night's game against the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nWhen it finally came out, Bryce Harper's name was missing.\n\nManager Rob Thomson said Harper bruised his glove hand fielding a ground ball in Tuesday night's 10-1 win over the Dodgers. It was Harper's first game back after being placed on the 10-day injured list with a strained left hamstring. A little less than three hours before Wednesday's first pitch, Harper was in the indoor batting cage testing his hand to see if he could hit.\n\nThe team obviously determined he wasn't ready to play. Alec Bohm started at first and Edmundo Sosa took Bohm's normal spot at third.\n\nWith 30 home runs and a .299/.384/.574 slugging percentage, Harper is an MVP candidate.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Wheeler threw five innings Tuesday and then left the game with lower left back tightness.\n\nThomson said it has not yet been determined whether he will make his scheduled start Sunday, the last game before the All-Star break. The Phillies could easily cover that game with relievers.\n\n\"There's no structural damage,\" Thomson said. \"But we're going to be very precautious. I'm not really concerned. He's been through this before. He's going to be fine. I just want to make sure we take care of him.\"\n\nWheeler said the back had bothered him his last two starts after he landed hard on the mound during a June 27 start against the Miami Marlins. At 10-4 with a 2.70 ERA, Wheeler is one of baseball's best pitchers.\n\nCenter fielder Johan Rojas was also out of Wednesday's lineup after getting hit in the right hand with a pitch Tuesday.\n\nThomson said if Wednesday was a playoff game, Rojas could have played.\n\nWednesday was the second of a highly-anticipated, three-game series between the teams with the best records in the National League. The Phillies (59-32) lead the NL East. The Dodgers (55-37) lead the NL West.\n\nContact: 609-272-7209\n\nMMcGarry@PressofAC.comTwitter @ACPressMcGarry Can't get enough High School sports?

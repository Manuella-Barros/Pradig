Kennedy International Airport without undergoing typical passenger screening procedures.\n\n\"Flight attendants are ideal for smuggling bulk cash\" for this reason, a Homeland Security Investigations special agent wrote in the indictments.\n\nBy \"abusing their privileges as airline employees,\" the flight attendants managed to transport about $8 million in \"bulk cash\" from the US to the Dominican Republic over several years, US Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement.\n\nThe indictments said the smuggling occurred from at least 2014 until as late as 2023.\n\nHernandez was accused of smuggling at least $2.5 million in narcotics proceeds from the US to the Dominican Republic, while Pujols, Torres, and Fabio were each accused of having smuggled narcotics proceeds, or cash they understood to be narcotics proceeds, worth at least $1.5 million.\n\nIn one of the indictment documents, an HSI special agent outlined sting operations in which a cooperating witness provided $60,000 in government funds to Fabio in 2023 and Torres in 2022.\n\nThe pair believed the money was the proceeds of narcotics trafficking and needed to be transported, according to the indictment.\n\nIn separate incidents, a year apart, Torres and Fabio met another informant in the Dominican Republic to deliver the cash, which was then returned to law enforcement, prosecutors said.\n\nThe interactions were recorded.\n\nIn December 2019, an informant gave Hernandez $121,215 in cash, of which $61,215 was handed over to Pujols.\n\nPujols was stopped by Customs and Border Protection agents at JFK.\n\nThe special agent said in the indictment that Pujols claimed to have about $1,000 on her, but agents found about $60,000 in three bundles concealed in her purse. She was fired from her job, according to the indictment.\n\nDelta Airlines confirmed to NBC News that two defendants worked for them.\n\nIn a statement provided to Business Insider, a Delta spokesperson said: \"Delta has cooperated fully with law enforcement in this investigation and will continue to do so.\"\n\nIt's unclear which airlines the other two defendants worked for.\n\nLegal representatives for Fabio and Torres did not immediately respond to BI's request for comment.

Hernandez and Pujols were more veteran flight attendants, but they also started to traffic narcotics money for the gang in 2014 and 2015.\n\nFabio and Torres were caught after law enforcement managed to catch their handler who they then involved in a sting operation. Law enforcement arranged for the handler to give the flight attendants taxpayer money, which was then smuggled to the Dominican Republic by the flight attendants before it was recovered and returned to the US.\n\nThe flight attendants used code words in their communication with the handler to disguise what they were doing, including saying they were sending 'lotions' and 'stuff' to the Dominican Republic.\n\nPujols was the first flight attendant to be caught in December 2019 when she was stopped by CBP officers as she was about to leave on a flight from New York JFK to the Dominican Republic. An inspection of her luggage revealed she had $60,000 in US currency stuffed in her bag.\n\n\"This investigation has exposed critical vulnerabilities in the airline security industry and has illuminated methods that narcotics traffickers are utilizing,\" commented HSI Special Agent in Charge Ivan J. Arvelo on Wednesday.\n\n\"As alleged, the defendants knowingly smuggled large amounts of illicit money linked to the sale of narcotics, to include fentanyl, and took advantage of airport security checkpoints by using their trusted positions as flight attendants,\" Arvelo continued.\n\nThe four ex-flight attendants have each been charged with one count of operations of an unlicensed money transmission business and one count of entering an airport or aircraft area in violation of security requirements. If found guilty, the flight attendants face a maximum sentence of 15 years imprisonment.\n\nIn addition, Pujols and Hernandez have each been charged with one count of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmission business, which carries a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment. Pujols has also been charged with one count of bulk cash smuggling.\n\nMatt's take\n\nIt's probably fair to say that flight attendants are very close to having their Known Crewmember privileges rescinded altogether or, at the very least, significantly altered, after a slew of high-profile abuses of the program.\n\nIn 2022, for example, a flight attendant pleaded guilty to trying to smuggle fentanyl that was strapped to her abdomen through a KCM checkpoint at San Diego Airport. Terese Lee White was only caught when she was pulled aside for a random check which set off the metal detector.\n\nAnd last September, an off-duty flight attendant who was commuting to work was stopped at a KCM checkpoint in Philadelphia with a loaded handgun in her bag. Again, 23-year-old Kiala Santa Cruz was only stopped as a result of a random check.\n\nThose random checks are on the rise because of how a small number of flight attendants have been abusing the KCM lanes to smuggle illicit goods on airplanes.\n\nKCM was created in 2011 as a joint initiative between industry trade group Airlines for America (A4A) and the Air Line Pilots Association to expedite screening for crew members who have already undergone extensive security vetting.\n\nAirlines rely on KCM to shorten turnaround times, but the TSA decided to take full control of the program last year because of alleged abuses. That has led to many more 'random' screenings in a bid to crack down on abuse of the system.\n\nLast year, the union that represents pilots at American Airlines became so frustrated with the growing number of random checks that they threatened to stop using KCM altogether.", "source": {"uri": "paddleyourownkanoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Paddle Your Own Kanoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mateusz_maszczynski@paddleyourownkanoo.com", "name": "Mateusz Maszczynski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_checkpoint", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Security checkpoint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smuggling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smuggling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illegal drug trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flight attendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCM_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "KCM (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transportation Security Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fentanyl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Today's charges should serve as a reminder to those who break the law by helping drug traffickers move their money that crime doesn't pay.\"\n\nDamian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Ivan J. Arvelo, the Special Agent in Charge of the New York Field Office of Homeland Security Investigations (\"HSI\"), announced today the unsealing of two Complaints charging flight attendants CHARLIE HERNANDEZ, SARAH VALERIO PUJOLS, EMMANUEL TORRES, and JAROL FABIO with various offenses in connection with their years-long participation in smuggling narcotics trafficking proceeds from the United States to the Dominican Republic on commercial flights. All of the defendants were arrested yesterday. PUJOLS and FABIO were presented yesterday in Manhattan federal court before U.S. Magistrate Judge Gary Stein, and HERNANDEZ and TORRES will be presented later today before Judge Stein.\n\nAccording to the allegations contained in the Complaints:[1]\n\nHSI Special Agent in Charge Ivan J. Arvelo said: \"As alleged, the defendants knowingly smuggled large amounts of illicit money linked to the sale of narcotics, to include fentanyl, and took advantage of airport security checkpoints by using their trusted positions as flight attendants. This investigation has exposed critical vulnerabilities in the airline security industry and has illuminated methods that narcotics traffickers are utilizing. Today's announcement should serve as a warning to all airline personnel: HSI New York will not tolerate employees' attempts to abuse their power for the sake of transporting illicit goods. I commend El Dorado Task Force's Transnational Criminal Enterprise Investigations Group and our partners in the public and private sectors for recognizing the seriousness of this issue.\"\n\nBefore his or her arrest in about October 2021, a cooperating witness (\"CW-1\") operated a significant money laundering organization (\"MLO\") in New York City, specializing in the movement of cash proceeds from narcotics sales from New York City to the Dominican Republic. One method that CW-1 used in furtherance of his or her MLO was corrupting flight attendants, like the defendants, who worked routes between New York City and the Dominican Republic. In exchange for a fee - which generally amounted to a small percentage of the amount of money that they would be smuggling - the defendants accepted bulk cash from CW-1 in New York City, got it past airport security via the KCM lane, and passed it off to other members of CW-1's MLO in the Dominican Republic, including another cooperating witness (\"CW-2\"). After CW-1 and CW-2 began cooperating with law enforcement, HSI orchestrated a number of sting operations in which CW-1 provided law enforcement funds represented to be narcotics proceeds to the defendants, who then smuggled it down to the Dominican Republic and handed it off to CW-2.\n\nDuring the relevant period charged in the Complaints, all of the defendants were employed as flight attendants with different international airlines that operated routes between New York City and the Dominican Republic. All of the defendants had \"Known Crewmember\" (\"KCM\") status with the Transportation Security Administration, which allowed them to pass through a special security lane at John F. Kennedy International Airport and other airports with less scrutiny than normal passengers. In total, the defendants smuggled approximately $8 million in bulk cash from the United States to the Dominican Republic.\n\nCHARLIE HERNANDEZ, 42, of West New York, New Jersey, SARAH VALERIO PUJOLS, 42, of the Bronx, New York, EMMANUEL TORRES, 34, of Brooklyn, New York, and JAROL FABIO, 35, of New York, New York, are each charged with one count of operation of an unlicensed money transmission business, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and one count of entering an airport or aircraft area in violation of security requirements, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. PUJOLS and HERNANDEZ are additionally charged with one count of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmission business, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and PUJOLS is further charged with one count of bulk cash smuggling, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.\n\n* * *\n\nMr. Williams praised the investigative work of HSI and the New York City Police Department.\n\nThe maximum potential sentences are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendants will be determined by the judge.\n\nThe charges contained in the Complaints are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\nThis case is being handled by the Office's Illicit Finance and Money Laundering Unit.

This allowed them to circumnavigate regular airport security screening.\n\nSpeaking of the incident, US Attorney Damian Williams said,\n\n\"As alleged, these flight attendants smuggled millions of dollars of drug money and law enforcement funds that they thought was drug money from the United States to the Dominican Republic over many years by abusing their privileges as airline employees. Today's charges should serve as a reminder to those who break the law by helping drug traffickers move their money that crime doesn't pay.\"\n\nIt is believed that all four of the flight attendants were employed by major airlines, including two who worked for Delta Air Lines. In a statement reported by NBC News, the carrier said that it \"has cooperated fully with law enforcement in this investigation and will continue to do so.\"\n\nPhoto: Vincenzo Pace I Simple Flying\n\nSuspicions were raised back in December 2019 when an informant gave thousands of dollars that had come from narcotics trafficking to two of the crew members to take to the Dominican Republic. The investigation continued over several years, with the total amount allegedly transported reaching up to $8 million.\n\nThe Known Crewmember program\n\nThis incident may lead to questions being asked about the Known Crewmember program, which is available to crew members at several airports across the US. It is used by TSA agents to confirm the identity and employment status of airline crew members, making their journey through the airport security checkpoint more efficient. It was brought about as part of a joint initiative between Airlines for America (A4A) and the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), and was later approved by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn a statement from the Office of Homeland Special Investigations, Agent Ivan J. Arvelo, said,\n\n\"As alleged, the defendants knowingly smuggled large amounts of illicit money linked to the sale of narcotics, to include fentanyl, and took advantage of airport security checkpoints by using their trusted positions as flight attendants. This investigation has exposed critical vulnerabilities in the airline security industry and has illuminated methods that narcotics traffickers are utilizing.\"\n\nPhoto: Vincenzo Pace | Simple Flying\n\nLast year, following a surveillance operation, an American Airlines mechanic was convicted of trying to smuggle more than 25 lbs of cocaine from the US to Jamaica. The drugs had a street value of more than $235,000, and were found hidden in a compartment underneath the cockpit of the aircraft before it departed New York (JFK) for Montego Bay (MBJ).\n\nDelta Air Lines' growing presence in the Dominican Republic\n\nFrom John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), Delta Air Lines flights to three destinations in the Dominican Republic - Santo Domingo (SDQ), Santiago de los Caballeros (STI), and Punta Cana (PUJ). In fact, JFK is the busiest international destination from all three of these airports.\n\nImage: GCmap\n\nJetBlue and American Airlines also have a significant presence in the New York - Dominican Republic market. Later this year, Delta Air Lines will expand its footprint even further in the Dominican Republic when it launches flights to Puerto Plata (POP) on the country's north coast from its hub at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL).\n\nYou might also like: Arajet Says It Will Finally Launch US Flights This Year But Hurdles Remain The carrier is hoping for US open skies.\n\nWhat do you think of this story?

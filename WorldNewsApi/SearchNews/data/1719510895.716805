{"id": 223701612, "title": "NBA Trade Rumors: Latest Rumblings on Team Plans as 2024 Draft Approaches", "text": "Cleveland Cavaliers standout guard Donovan Mitchell is arguably the top player who might become available on the trade market this offseason. The 27-year-old is entering the final year of his contract and could become available if he doesn't agree to an extension. \"I've been told the Cavs either would sign him to an extension this summer, or trade him,\" Terry Pluto of Cleveland.com wrote. \"They have zero intention of opening the 2024-25 season with Mitchell heading into his free agent year.\" If Mitchell does become available, there should be no shortage of interest teams. The Los Angeles Lakers and Philadelphia 76ers are expected to be among them. Jason Lloyd of The Athletic reported on May 14 that L.A. would be \"one of the teams standing at the front of the line\" if Mitchell can be had. More recently, Yahoo Sports' Jake Fischer reported that Philadelphia would also be interested: \"Without an extension with the Cavaliers, you can add Philadelphia to any proverbial group of interested suitors in Mitchell's services, sources said.\" Of course, Fischer noted that Los Angeles Clippers star Paul George is probably Philadelphia's top option, if he reaches free agency. Plus, there's no guarantee that Cleveland won't get a deal done with Mitchell. If Mitchell isn't extended, however, expect the Lakers and Sixers to at least place a few phone calls to Cavaliers president Koby Altman.", "summary": "With the NBA playoffs nearing the final stage and the 2024 draft set to kick off in one month, there's plenty of intrigue surrounding the upcoming offseason.\u2026", "url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10122576-nba-trade-rumors-latest-rumblings-on-team-plans-as-2024-draft-approaches", "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/v1716690199/xktv1nzj5lqt6mvjwzdo.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:40:39", "author": "Kristopher Knox", "authors": ["Kristopher Knox"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.146}

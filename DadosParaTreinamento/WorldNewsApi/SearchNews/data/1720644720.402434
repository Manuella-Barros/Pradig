{"id": 231268544, "title": "Russia puts former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko on its wanted list", "text": "Russia has put former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko on its wanted list, Russian state media reported, citing the Interior Ministry\u2019s database. Russian state news agency Tass said Tymoshenko was listed as wanted on unspecified criminal charges. She reportedly joins Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, on the same list, which also includes scores of officials and lawmakers from Ukraine and NATO countries. Tymoshenko and her Batkivshchyna (the Fatherland) party did not immediately comment Saturday. Mediazona, an independent Russian news outlet, reported that both Zelenskyy and Poroshenko had been listed since at least late February. Amog others on the list is Kaja Kallas, the prime minister of NATO and EU member Estonia, who has fiercely advocated for increased military aid to Kyiv and stronger sanctions against Moscow. Russian officials in February said that Kallas is wanted because of Tallinn\u2019s efforts to remove Soviet-era monuments to Red Army soldiers in the Baltic nation, in a belated purge of what many consider symbols of past oppression. Russia has laws criminalizing the \u201crehabilitation of Nazism\u201d that include punishing the \u201cdesecration\u201d of war memorials. Also on Russia\u2019s list are cabinet ministers from Estonia and Lithuania, as well as the International Criminal Court prosecutor who last year prepared a warrant for President Vladimir Putin on war crimes charges. Moscow has also charged the head of Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, with what it deems \u201cterrorist\u201d activities, including Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian infrastructure.", "summary": "Russia has put former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko on its wanted list", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/russia-puts-former-ukrainian-prime-minister-yulia-tymoshenko-110951685", "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/954035cb-0096-4afd-9283-c1d610634fc8/wirestory_a222c691884ac1d0f4a999ca6baf2169_16x9.jpg?w=1600", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:50:26", "author": "The Associated Press", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.002}

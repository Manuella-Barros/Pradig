{"id": 231976068, "title": "Rudeboy vs Saida Boj, Mercy Eke\u2019s N100 million, Flavour\u2019s dad\u2019s burial, other top entertainment stories last week", "text": "How D\u2019banj influenced Jenifa\u2019s sequel \u2013 Funke Akindele Actress Funke Akindele recounted how singer D\u2019banj gave her money and encouraged her to create a sequel to \u2018Jenifa\u2019 at a dinner celebrating D\u2019banj\u2019s 20th anniversary in Lagos State. In 2008, she released \u2018Jenifa\u2019 as a two-part movie. She then released the first sequel in 2011, \u2018The Return of Jenifa\u2019. The 46-year-old revealed that the \u2018Oliver Twist\u2019 hitmaker initiated a career-changing conversation with her after she stopped producing subsequent content on \u2018Jenifa\u2019. Akindele, who won the Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her role in \u2018Jenifa,\u2019 said she could not feature D\u2019banj in the movie as intended because the singer was not around during production. She said: \u201cIn 2009, we developed the \u2018Jenifa\u2019 brand. Following the significant success, it garnered immense love from everyone. I was in the midst of it all, witnessing the celebrations. Then, Mr Foli Coker extended an invitation to his club, expressing, \u2018I want to host you. You are very hardworking. I love \u2018Jenifa\u2019. Come with your cast and crew members.\u2019 \u201cSo, we accepted the invitation, and that\u2019s when I met D\u2019banj for the first time. He greeted me with, \u2018I am here to serenade you.\u2019 We danced joyfully, and he even shared his number with me. Later, he took me aside and asked, \u2018Why did you let Jenifa go like that? Is there another Jenifa?\u2019 I explained that it was over. He insisted, \u2018That is the brand you can figure out for the rest of your life.\u2019 I was puzzled by his words. \u201cHe emphasised that Jenifa had to return, assuring me that nothing bad had happened to her and that she would awaken from the dream. He encouraged me to contact him for any needed support, promising, \u2018I will give you support. When you have a brand, you feed on the brand. You milk the brand very well. Make money out of it.\u2019 He generously gave me some money from his pocket, saying, \u2018Go and write another \u2018Jenifa\u2019. I support you with this money.\u2019 I was moved to tears by his gesture, without any strings attached. So, I filmed and wrote it. Unfortunately, he was unavailable to film the \u2018Return of Jenifa\u2019. Yet, to this day, the brand remains relevant.\u201d How being single revived my career \u2013 Korra Obidi US-based Nigerian dancer Korra Obidi said during an interview on Heroes Diary podcast that her separation from ex-husband Justin Dean positively impacted her career. The 32-year-old married Mr Dean in 2017, but their marriage ended in March 2022. The mother-of-two said she had received back-to-back bookings since her marriage ended. The alumna of the University of Lagos (UNILAG) noted that marriage often limits opportunities in the entertainment industry. She said: \u201cOne thing about us humans is that when somebody is married, I don\u2019t know why people don\u2019t like the person anymore. They say, \u2018Happy married life,\u2019 and then they say she can\u2019t be on my show, she can\u2019t be in my movie. But now that I am single, I am getting booked back-to-back, so it is good for me. I think being single is advantageous in the industry. \u201cI want to make a public service announcement. I\u2019m not the only person who got married in Nigeria. My marriage wasn\u2019t even public. All you saw was one post on Instagram saying Korra is taken. Now you\u2019re using the marriage to tie my legs. It\u2019s been two years since my divorce; please leave me alone. I am single as a dollar bill, and I am not searching.\u201d Why I wouldn\u2019t disclose my choice of candidate again \u2013 Toyin Abraham Actress Toyin Abraham, on her X page, vowed not to disclose her political choices of candidate in subsequent elections after being criticised for supporting President Bola Tinubu during the 2023 general election. The 41-year-old mother-of-one was among celebrities who publicly endorsed Bola Tinubu for president. The online interaction started when an X user, Otunba (@ManLikeIcey), asked her to share the plans Mr Tinubu discussed during the campaign. In response, she said: \u201cYou politely asked me so that I will answer you. Of course, I was told and promised good governance and happiness for everyone, which I believe. \u201cIf things didn\u2019t go well, why do I have to be the one to suffer for it? I remember I voted for former President Goodluck Jonathan, and I was bullied, but I didn\u2019t put the blame on anyone after everyone chose Ex-President Mohammadu Buhari. So please, why would they be cursing and trolling me every time? I have faced my life and career because I am not a politician, and I\u2019m not in government; I have learned my lesson never to be open with my choice again.\u201d In 2003, the actress debuted her acting career and gained popularity for her roles in Alani Baba Labake and Ijakumo, among others. Why I didn\u2019t believe in girlfriend concept \u2013 Layi Wasabi Skit maker Isaac Olayiwola, known as Layi Wasabi, revealed during an interview on the \u2018Is This Seat Taken?\u2019 podcast with actress Chinasa Anukam that he preferred the term \u2018partnership\u2019 to \u2018girlfriend\u2019. The winner of Best Online Content Creator at the 10th Africa Magic Viewers\u2019 Choice Awards said he initiated a relationship with \u2018courtship\u2019. He said, \u201cI do not believe in the concept of a girlfriend. I believe in partnership. I do not believe in that phase of girlfriends. I start with courtship. I have to see the wife in the person from the beginning,\u201d Layi Wasabi began his comedy career as a teenager and was known for blending Nigerians\u2019 societal issues and everyday challenges into content. Portable disses Saida Boj in his upcoming track Controversial singer Portable criticised social media influencer Saida Boj in his upcoming (title undisclosed) song for her views on relationships and money during an interview on \u2018The Honest Bunch podcast\u2019. The 30-year-old singer shared a snippet of the soon-to-be-released track on his Instagram page. The song\u2019s lyrics stated: \u2018Who bought you an iPhone can\u2019t buy you food. You\u2019re hot on status but begging in someone\u2019s DM. If you spoil your private parts because of money, you\u2019ll face the consequences. \u201cSaida Boj has spoiled the private part (vagina). Don\u2019t spoil your private part because of money, and don\u2019t ruin tomorrow because of today, as it\u2019ll later become yours.\u201d The Zeh Nation boss, currently in the United States for his seven-day tour, did not disclose the song\u2019s release date. Similarly, \u2018Zazzu Zeh\u2019 hitmaker revealed that Davido gifted him a brand-new pair of luxurious Dior sneakers during their dinner hangout in Atlanta. Portable shared photos and videos of their outing, where he was seen beaming with excitement. Before the hangout, Portable said he was told to fight the \u2018Assurance\u2019 hitmaker, but he refused because Davido had helped him in the past. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t fight your helper. They pushed me to fight with Davido, but I didn\u2019t listen to them because I\u2019m loyal to my helper. Once I see Davido, I\u2019m blessed.\u201d Tems\u2019 prison experience Grammy-winning Nigerian singer Tems recounted her ordeal in Ugandan prison as a blessing in disguise during an interview with Angie Martinez of Power 105.1 FM, New York. In December 2020, authorities apprehended, charged, and subsequently imprisoned Tems and Omah Lay in Uganda for their participation in a concert held at Speke Resort in Kampala, which allegedly violated COVID-19 social distancing regulations. Tems emphasised that she wouldn\u2019t have known what prisoners were going through if she hadn\u2019t experienced it herself. The 28-year-old insisted they didn\u2019t break COVID-19 rules but were set up. She said: \u201cI spent two nights in prison. I thought I wasn\u2019t going to come out. I thought maybe I was going through it for a reason. Perhaps this is for me to help the people in prison. It was wild, I\u2019m not going to lie. I was settling in because I adapt quickly. The prison was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I feel honoured to have had because otherwise, I would never have thought about these people, and to be in their presence was very humbling. \u201cWe didn\u2019t break the [COVID-19] rules. It was basically like a set-up. We went to Uganda, and I had a show there. It was during the COVID-19 year, but they had opened things up then. They had just had a rally in Uganda. People were going out. It wasn\u2019t on lockdown. It was the aftermath. And the organisers said they had the permit, so they sent us the permit. Everything was cool. And we went there, and there was this particular artist; I\u2019m not sure now what his role was, but he was threatening Nigerian artists that they shouldn\u2019t come. And after the show, the police arrived. They weren\u2019t in uniforms. \u201cThey just knocked on my hotel room. My manager and I were eating lunch or dinner. And they just came and said we should follow them, and my manager was like he would go with them. So, he went with them. But they came back upstairs to pick me up. So, it was like, who called them? Later, I found out that there was something weird. That was so scary.\u201d The songstress became famous after being featured on Wizkid\u2019s 2020 single \u2018Essence\u2019. Why I stop criticising Nigerian govt \u2013 Falz Rapper Falz, during a private listening party for his latest extended play (EP) \u2018Before The Feast\u2019, said he stopped criticising the government to avoid being the bearer of complaints. The human rights activist lawyer Femi Falana\u2019s son was known for criticising the government with his songs addressing bad governance and societal ills, such as \u2018Wehdone Sir\u2019, \u2018Child of the World\u2019, \u2018Talk\u2019, and \u2018Mr Yakubu\u2019 among others. The 33-year-old said, \u201cI do not want that guy to get to a point where he is seen as a guy that will always complain\u2019. I do not ever want to get to that point. That\u2019s why I\u2019m pausing. I want to rearrange how I approach it. So how am I doing it? Am I doing it in a way that makes everybody feel sad? We already know that we are in trouble. Why am I further immersing you in that emotion? I want to lift you out of that emotion somehow, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do. \u201cWhat differentiates this project from my other works? Maybe it\u2019s the absence of any attack or commentary on current events. As I said, given the theme and direction, such would have been out of place. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s even a mention, even lyrically, that I can recall right now. That\u2019s definitely what sets this project apart from the rest.\u201d The Lagos-born singer began his career in 2009 and became popular after the release of \u2018Marry Me\u2019 featured vocals from Poe and Yemi Alade. Actor Wale Ojo\u2019s future wife Actor Wole Ojo, on his Instagram page, expressed shame that his missing rib (future wife) had still not found him. The alumnus of the University of Lagos (UNILAG) declared that his future wife should be ashamed for not finding him as he celebrated his 40th birthday. The 39-year-old shared a video clip on Instagram, captioning it: \u201cHow I snuck into 40 yesterday. The fourth floor was conquered! Dear future wife, shame on you for still not finding me.\u201d The Benin-born actor rose to fame in 2009 after winning the fourth edition of the Amstel Malta Box Office reality show.

Her sister, Adetoke Oluwo, also a fashion influencer, broke the news on her Instagram stories without disclosing the cause of death. Adetoke described her sister as her pillar of strength, positively changing her life. Adetoke wrote: \u201cOmoteniola, you do this one. I thought I was a strong person, but I realised you have always been my strength. My pillar of strength. How can I be talking about you in the past tense? It would help if you were out of your mind to think you could leave me like this. This year in particular. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you leave when we were suffering and hustling up and down in Lagos? I\u2019d have understood. Why now? When you should be enjoying your life. What will happen to all the planned trips and our life goals? I used to hear of grief, but Teni, you should have waited for me to get back to see you. You thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to take it, I\u2019m sure, but Teni, my heart is broken. I can\u2019t take this. I can\u2019t feel my heart, Teni. You promised me you\u2019d be with me forever. You said you got me for life. How dare you leave me now. \u201cAt just 35 years. It would help if you were out of your mind. Who will guide me through life? Who will preach to me? You know I only listen to you. No wonder your last words were, \u201cNever respond in fear\u201d. Temi, I can\u2019t keep that promise; I better pick up your call. I know you don\u2019t like calls, but at least message me back and say this is a joke; you are only testing my pain. Teni, my heart can\u2019t take this; I\u2019m not strong. \u201cOne thing I know is you have changed my life. You came into this world for that purpose: to change my life completely. I know you will not want me to cry anymore; I don\u2019t even have tears. I have questions. I love you forever, Omoteniola, and nobody will ever take your place in my heart.\u201d Teni, born in 1989, was a writer, fashion journalist, and TV producer whose work was recognised globally. She was featured in Vogue Magazine. Paul Okoye vs Saida Boj Controversial social media influencer Saida Boj criticised singer Paul Okoye, aka Rudeboy, for accusing her of corrupting young girls.

His remark came after Saida discussed exchanging money for love on \u2018The Honest Bunch\u2019 podcast. \u201cAs long as you continue to allow some of these idiots to influence your daughters to bill men and know their worth, more girls will continue to fall victim,\u201d Rudeboy wrote on his Instagram. Saida, believing the comments were directed at her, went on her Instagram page to criticise the musician. She blamed him for leaving his ex-wife, Anita, to follow his new wife, Ivy Ifeoma. She wrote: \u201cI heard someone say that an artiste with dreadlocks claimed I was corrupting your daughters. Dude, why do you think your new wife chose to marry you? What did your ex-wife, who used to understand you, gain? Didn\u2019t you betray her for a gold digger like me? \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re handsome or have a certain swag to make that beautiful model marry you; the smart girl came for the money, bruh. Help me convey to her that I am proud of her. You\u2019re an older man; don\u2019t think like a boy under 20. One more thing, always be polite when speaking to ladies, and do not be rude.\u201d Mercy Eke\u2019s N100 million Former BBNaija star Mercy Eke disclosed she had over N100 million in her Heritage Bank account after the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) revoked the bank\u2019s operating licence. Eke, the 2020 winner of Africa Magic Viewers\u2019 Choice Award for \u2018Best Dressed Female\u2019, revealed she opened the account because the bank sponsored the fourth edition of the BBNaija reality show, which she won.

For them to pay our money, we were advised to open an account with them. \u201cStupid me went ahead and funded the account. I\u2019m full of regrets right now. She (my bank manager) lured me into fixing my money, knowing there had been issues with the bank. I don\u2019t have words for her; I blame myself.\u201d The 33-year-old said she submitted a notice to the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Commission to retrieve her money.

A new generation tries out that beloved time-tested crab recipe or a veteran crab picker showcases their method to a newcomer.\n\nAnd, crabbers in the Chesapeake Bay supply these cherished times by venturing out onto waters with hopes for a bountiful catch.\n\nBut, a recent decision to lift a 15-year ban on the blue crab winter harvest chipped away at these quintessential Virginia memories.\n\nThe 5-4 vote by the Virginia Resources Marine Commission (VMRC) opened the door to endangering the vital and vulnerable blue crab, not to mention jeopardizing sustainable harvests for Virginia crabbers throughout the year. It's a wrong move for both our economy and our environment.\n\nFortunately, it's not too late to make the right call. At its September meeting, the VMRC can still heed the science and vote to keep the crab fishery closed this coming winter.\n\nProtecting female blue crabs during the winter remains key to supporting this valuable fishery that brings in anywhere from $22 million to $38 million annually for Virginia.\n\nFemale crabs bury themselves at the bottom of the bay in the winter, waiting to release millions of eggs. Come spring, they spawn and help produce the next generation of crabs.\n\nWinter crabbers deploy heavy metal dredges, rake-like structures, to scrape crabs from the bottom of the bay, and female crabs come up by far the most. According to a VMRC staff presentation, the winter fishery harvested an estimated 32% of the female crabs in the Bay at the start of the season. Overall, females make up 96% of the winter harvest.\n\nWhen the federal government declared a fisheries disaster in 2008, Virginia promised to protect adult female crabs. A major way Virginia fulfilled this promise to the federal government was by shutting down the winter crab season. By closing the winter fishery, Virginia met 17% of its 34% crab death reduction pledge.\n\nSince then, there have been gains in the female population. But, the current 133 million female crabs is nowhere near the 215 million needed for a healthy female population in the Chesapeake Bay and the progress has not been constant. Since last year, females declined by nearly 20 million.\n\nWe're only two years removed from record-low crab numbers. Young crabs remain below average for the fifth year in a row and male crabs decreased by 9 million since last year.\n\nIsn't it better to rebuild the blue crab population to the agreed targets rather than open crabs to the harvest that likely helped lead to the 2008 disaster?\n\nNow is not the time to put the blue crab more at risk. The vast majority of crabbers aren't interested in winter harvest, preferring to pursue plentiful oysters and then return to crabbing in the spring and summer.\n\nThose crabbers deserve to remain confident that come spring and summer they too will have the opportunity to catch the crabs that support their livelihood, one of Virginia's most valuable fisheries, and the species at the center of cherished Virginia memories.\n\nLooking at the numbers, VMRC staff recommended keeping the ban. And nearly 200 public comments supported keeping the winter season closed.\n\nAlso, Virginia and Maryland are in the middle of an assessment that's taking a scientific deep dive into the factors behind the decline in the blue crab. That's expected to be out in early 2026. Increasing the crab harvest before then is irresponsible and could throw off the results of this study.\n\nVMRC has said their vote allowed them to gather more data. But, the data already begs for precaution. Virginia's crabbers, this important species and this valuable fishery need the VMRC to heed the science.\n\nHistory has already shown what happens when we don't protect the struggling blue crab.\n\nWhen they reconsider this issue in September, Virginia commissioners should reinstate the ban on the winter crab harvest and wait for more science-backed answers from the stock assessment.", "source": {"uri": "pilotonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Virginian Pilot"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callinectes_sapidus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Callinectes sapidus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fishery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesapeake_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chesapeake Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_fisheries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crab fisheries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerable species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heavy metals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spawn_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spawn (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dredging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dredging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oyster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Fish_and_Seafood", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Fish and Seafood", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Exotic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Exotic", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Winter", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Winter", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Winter_Sports/Snowshoeing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Winter Sports/Snowshoeing", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://www.dailypress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/I6UV7KF57NDQ7EMRZ3WRUOZIU4.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717164", "eventUri": "eng-9717164", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

The board is expected to reconvene in September to consider staff recommendations on how to implement the fishery. The new season could open as early as this December.\n\n\"It's a stopgap to keep our industry moving and keep our waterman working during those winter months,\" said Zach Widgeon, a VMRC spokesman. But, he added, \"this is not us turning loose a fleet of boats to go out winter crab dredging right now. [Repealing the prohibition] opens up that dialog for our staff to go ahead and find these answers out.\"\n\nThe board's action came after the VMRC's Crab Management Advisory Committee, which is mostly made up of industry members, voted 10-2 in favor of reopening the winter season. After that May 29 vote, the agency received 186 public comments on the proposal -- all in opposition.\n\nIn addition, the VMRC's own staff had urged the board against doing so, pointing to a declining trend in overall crab numbers in recent years.\n\n\"The reason staff recommend not opening at this time is the abundance is still below average,\" said Pat Geer, VMRC's chief of fisheries management. He added that allowing watermen to harvest crabs in the winter would upend an ongoing species stock assessment, which is set for completion in 2026.\n\nConservation groups say they strongly oppose the reopening, arguing it would make it harder to maintain the species at a healthy population.\n\n\"It is incredibly disappointing,\" said Chris Moore, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation's Virginia director. \"The VMRC's vote imperils not only the vulnerable blue crab, but the sustainability of harvests throughout the year and other species in the Bay that depend on the blue crab for food.\"\n\nThe move would also put Virginia at odds with neighboring Maryland, where winter dredging has long been banned. Crabs move freely between both states' portions of the Bay during different parts of their life cycles.\n\nMaryland fishery managers quickly denounced the VMRC's action.\n\n\"The success of the species' recovery after a steep decline in the 2000s can be directly traced to Maryland and Virginia cooperatively managing blue crabs, especially females, based on science,\" said Maryland Department of Natural Resources Secretary Josh Kurtz. \"Today's action by Virginia breaks with this successful approach.\"\n\nDredging involves dragging a metal, rake-like apparatus behind a boat to scoop up semi-dormant crabs from the mud. Female crabs migrate to the southern end of the Bay in the winter to release their eggs. As a result, they account for about 90% of the crabs caught in the winter in Virginia, Geer said.\n\nA dramatic decline in the population led to a federal disaster declaration in 2008. Virginia, Maryland and the Potomac River Fisheries Commission responded by working together for the first time to enact shared harvest limits.\n\nAll three jurisdictions pledged to reduce the female harvest by 34%. In Virginia, the closure of the winter dredging fishery beginning in the 2008-2009 season was the centerpiece of the effort to protect crabs in that state's portion of the Bay. From then forward, the VMRC board had reauthorized the prohibition every year until June's vote.\n\nAll but one of the five votes supporting the repeal were made by members appointed by Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R). Those were A.J. Erskine, Jamie Green, Spencer Headley and Lynn Kellum. They were joined by James Minor, who was appointed by Youngkin's predecessor, Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam.\n\n\"I was here when we took it away from them,\" Kellum said. \"I've said this before: Are we being fair to that user group that we took it away from?\"\n\nIn opposition were three Youngkin appointees -- Will Bransom, Patrick Hand and Jeanette Edwards -- and one Northam appointee, Heather Lusk.\n\nTo maintain the 34% reduction for the female harvest, critics warn that the VMRC will almost certainly have to offset the additional catch in the winter with cuts to the crab pot fishery, which accounts for 97% of the state's current take.\n\n\"Opening this fishery in the winter would be for the benefit to the very few and come at a high risk to all crabbers,\" Bransom said.\n\nIn 2008, when winter dredging was last permitted, the state issued 98 licenses, leading to a harvest of about 1.4 million pounds of crabs. That represented about 7% of the total annual harvest, according to VMRC records.\n\nThe VMRC estimates that about 15-20 crabbers would participate in the reopened fishery. The longtime prohibition closed the season from Dec. 1 to March 31. Headley suggested that crabbers should be allowed to dredge only in January and February.\n\nIn 2024, according to a recently released benchmark survey, the Baywide adult female crab population ticked down to 133 million from 152 million last year. But that figure is still above the recommended threshold of 72.5 million crabs.\n\nThe overall crab population in 2022 dipped to its lowest recorded level in the survey's 32-year history, with an estimated 227 million crabs. That number jumped to 323 million in 2023 before falling once again in 2024 to 317 million.", "source": {"uri": "marylandmatters.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Maryland Matters"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_kurtz@marylandmatters.org", "name": "Josh Kurtz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prohibition in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callinectes_sapidus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Callinectes sapidus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dredging", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dredging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fishery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterman_(occupation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Waterman (occupation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesapeake_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chesapeake Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harvest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Marine_Resources_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia Marine Resources Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservation movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Youngkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Youngkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Department_of_Natural_Resources", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maryland Department of Natural Resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biological life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisheries_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fisheries management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bird migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerable species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Green", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Northam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ralph Northam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potomac_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Potomac River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Winter", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Winter", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Respite_Care", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Respite Care", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/5e499aed2107f.image_.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717164", "eventUri": "eng-9717164", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-01", "dateEnd": "-03-31", "textStart": 4829, "textEnd": 4847}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-25", "textStart": 289, "textEnd": 296}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-29", "textStart": 1054, "textEnd": 1060}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

That's been my daily mantra at this stage of life, or at least what I tell myself.\n\nClearly, poking a hornet's nest wasn't a concern for the five members of the Virginia Marine Resources Commission, who recently voted to repeal the longstanding -- and justifiable -- ban on winter crab dredging in Virginia waters.\n\nWhat the VMRC called a \"significant step towards assessing the viability of reintroducing a controlled and regulated year-round crab fishery\" is being lambasted by almost everyone else. And rightly so.\n\nIn fact, angling and conservation groups alike -- Virginia Saltwater Sportfishing Association, Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Friends of the Rappahannock, James River Association -- let state officials and VMRC members know this was a bad idea before the 5-4 vote.\n\nThe action potentially allows licensed watermen to use pots, dredges and other gear to \"help stabilize the commercial crabbing industry throughout the year.\" While a 'winter fishery' sounds benign, in reality the dredge fishery almost exclusively targets adult female blue crabs, whose numbers decreased from 152 million in 2023 to 133 million in 2024 and are below target levels, according to the annual crab survey.\n\nSo what they're telling us is that disrupting egg-laden, female crabs from their near-dormant state just as they're preparing to release millions of baby crabs back into the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem is sound fishery policy? Bullocks, I say.\n\nMoreover, of those eggs that are released, it only takes one well-timed late season Nor'Easter to keep those tiny crabs from re-entering the bay to join the population. See the risks?\n\nAnd why VMRC acted now is also puzzling. A stock assessment is due out in less than two years that's expected to shed a brighter light on the status of the bay's blue crab population. VMRC staff will be at the table when the regional Crab Management Advisory Committee meets to come up with longer term strategies to protect crabs.\n\nI can't imagine that the pitch to \"assess the feasibility and impacts of a year-round fishery\" will be welcomed with resounding applause. More likely stunned silence.\n\nMoreover, findings from this evaluation will be presented to the multi-state Bay Commission in September. That's a lot of brain power and assumedly a hefty price tag on taxpayers dime to carry out the work necessary to protect one of the bay's most valuable fisheries.\n\nSo when one of the key players decides to tweak the rules for a small group of stakeholders, that's bad optics. VMRC's qualifier that the \"repeal of the crab dredge prohibition does not open a crab dredge fishery in Virginia\" but simply allows VMRC staff to \"explore the viability of a year-round crab fishery\" affords little comfort to me and the crab loving public writ large.\n\nDr. Allison Colden, Chesapeake Bay Foundation Maryland executive director, issued a statement warning the vote \"represents a major breakdown in the cooperative management of blue crabs across the Chesapeake Bay.\"\n\nColden said the partnership between Virginia, Maryland, and the Potomac River Fisheries Commission has been key to maintaining a \"more productive and stable blue crab population since its drastic decline\" in the early 2000s.\n\n\"VMRC's decision damages this partnership and undermines the need for conservative management of the species which has seen below average numbers throughout the Chesapeake Bay for years,\" Colden summarized.\n\nVMRC claims that \"no more than 20 crabbers are expected to have interest in obtaining a dredge license. This translates to a minimal increase in overall crab harvest.\"\n\nAgain, I'm not buying that assertion. I don't know this for a fact, but I believe it to be true: If there's an opportunity to catch more crabs, fish and oysters -- translated: make more money -- very few watermen will decline. In fact, more will want in on the fishery.\n\nVSSA Chairman Steve Atkinson called the decision \"disappointing\" and said it \"opens the door\" to the possibility of winter dredging at a time when female crabs are below (population) target. Atkinson decried the fact VMRC went forward without the benefit of an updated stock assessment, which is expected in 2025.\n\n\"When you have a citizen board stacked with commercial interests it puts our natural resources at risk. Just ask any of us who have tried to get action on the industrial menhaden fishery,\" Atkinson said.\n\nTo that point, this latest stunner begs the question: who's driving the train here? Public marine resources must be managed for abundance for the greater good, not the benefit of a select few. Is it slightly hyperbolic to say this decision could take us down a perilous path? Probably. But sometimes you need to have a fire drill to fight the real fire.\n\nThrough July: Resident striper season in Maryland is open. Restrictions apply.

Here's what to do if you see it", "body": "European green crabs are considered to be one of the world's worst invasive species and a significant threat to the health of Washington's marine waters.\n\nTheir destructive tendencies damage both critical habitat (like eelgrass beds) and other native species.\n\n\"I think the most concerning thing about European green crab is that they are excellent generalists, meaning they can eat all sorts of things,\" said Stena Troyer, science specialist at the environmental education nonprofit Harbor WildWatch. \"They have the potential to consume so many critical parts of the Salish Sea food web including oysters, clams, and Dungeness crab -- all of which happen to be things that people value eating too.\"\n\nMore than 105,300 European green crabs have been removed in Washington waters this year, with the tally recently at 752,047 total removals since Jan. 1, 2022.\n\nStatewide efforts to control these crabs began in 2020 and public education efforts ramped up in 2022. While a very small population was detected in Hood Canal in 2022 and 2023, thankfully they still have not been detected in south Puget Sound.\n\nControl and monitoring are managed through the combined efforts of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife-led coalition of tribal co-managers and partners, as well as Washington Sea Grant's Crab Team. However, only a small fraction of the identified suitable nearshore habitat -- which spans the entirety of the Puget Sound and Salish Sea -- can be monitored by these teams.\n\nThat's where the Molt Search Program comes in, calling on the public's help to keep the south Puget Sound free of this invasive species and monitor shorelines throughout the Salish Sea.\n\nHow to identify crab species\n\nMolt Search is a volunteer-based early detection program led by Washington Sea Grant and Washington State University. The program trains interested beachgoers to identify crab molts and report local findings. Better yet, Molt Search partners with local organizations across 12 Puget Sound counties to help lead programs.\n\nHarbor WildWatch recently led a molt training at Titlow Beach Park and has incorporated molt searches into their biannual participatory science beach monitoring as well as their summer beach tours. They encourage interested beachgoers to reach out to Troyer about early detection trainings or come to one of their many educational beach tours over the summer.\n\nWashington Sea Grant also has weekly trainings in-person and online across the Puget Sound.\n\n\"In-person trainings give you a hands-on experience identifying crab species which can be extra helpful when distinguishing a Dungeness crab from the similar Graceful crab,\" said Troyer. \"While we anticipate a bunch of 'zeros' reported in the South Sound, this is still an important number to record. Plus, when submitting reports, there is the opportunity to contribute data about Dungeness crab.\"\n\nThe premise behind Molt Search is straightforward: set a timer and go on a personal scavenger hunt in the rack line of the shore where high tide stretched to and often remnants of seaweed remain. Beachgoers should specifically look for crab carapaces, the outer exoskeleton or shell of crabs. All crabs shed their carapaces when they grow, so looking for molts enables detection of populations when they are (hopefully) still small.\n\nIn fact, when European green crabs were originally detected in the late-1990s, the very first reports were not of molted shells rather than live crabs. According to Washington Sea Grant, the recent increases in their numbers are a crucial focus of population control for state managers and early detection is a high priority.\n\nReport sightings immediately\n\nThe trickiest part of Molt Search is identifying any discoveries, which is where the trainings come in handy. Despite their name, European green crabs aren't always green and can range from red to yellow depending on age. The best way to identify them is by counting the five prominent marginal teeth on their carapace, located near their eyes (for comparison, Dungeness and Graceful crabs have 10 prominent marginal teeth).\n\n\"The five marginal teeth on the wide eye side are the key to identifying this invasive crab,\" said Troyer. \"Here's a fun memory tool: think of the five letters in the word 'green' as your key to remember the five marginal teeth from each eye of the European Green Crab. Then hold up your hand to give a 'European green crab high-five.'\"\n\nTroyer offered another memory tool: European green crabs' carapaces are wide on the eye side, kind of like your eyes might be if you were to come across one in the south Puget Sound.\n\nIf a carapace or live European green crab is identified, it can be reported through WDFW, Washington Sea Grant, or through the MyCoast app (which trainings help familiarize volunteers with). Any live findings should be left in place after being reported.\n\nThough leaving crabs in place might sound counterintuitive, WDFW does not want native species to be incorrectly identified and accidentally killed. Leaving the crab and reporting it allows partners to investigate findings and set traps. If any European Green Crabs are caught in the traps, they are frozen and reutilized by WDFW as fertilizer.\n\n\"Trained or not, if you've found a European green crab, report it immediately,\" said Troyer. \"If it is a dead crab or a molt, WDFW requests that you hold on to the specimen so it can be verified. Sightings can be reported to the WDFW hotline at 1-888-WDFW-AIS.\"\n\nCommunity-involved programs like Molt Search provide important data for researchers and are imperative to having more boots on the ground to detect a highly invasive species. Put simply: the Puget Sound and Salish Sea have more than 2,000 miles of shoreline. Researchers and managers can't cover these beaches alone, so searching for molts provides critical support to the early detection of these crabs before they establish large populations that would be difficult, or impossible, to control.\n\n\"The more folks we have on the beach reporting the presence and, more importantly, the absence of European Green Crab, the better for reacting to this potentially devastating invasion,\" said Troyer.\n\n--\n\nSee you on the shore for a molt search!

This crustacean, known scientifically as Eriocheir sinensis, is making waves in the world of pest management, offering a natural and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional chemical pesticides.\n\nThe integration of mitten-handed crabs into rice cultivation has proven to be a game-changer for farmers seeking to reduce their environmental impact. This innovative approach, which has gained popularity in China, creates a symbiotic relationship between the crabs and rice plants. The rice provides shelter for the crabs, reducing cannibalism and improving their living conditions, while the crabs contribute by controlling weeds and fertilizing the soil with their waste.\n\nThis mutually beneficial system has led to increased production of both crabs and rice. Farmers have reported yields of 300-450 kilograms of crabs per hectare, in addition to their rice harvest. The success of this method has not only boosted agricultural output but has also demonstrated the potential for eco-friendly pest control on a larger scale.\n\nWhile the use of mitten-handed crabs offers numerous advantages, it's not without its challenges. One of the primary benefits is the significant reduction in chemical pesticide use. This decrease in synthetic inputs leads to improved water quality and less impact on non-target species, promoting overall ecosystem health.\n\nHowever, farmers must carefully manage the balance between the needs of the crabs and the rice plants. For instance, pesticide treatments for rice must be applied judiciously to avoid harming the crabs. Additionally, water management becomes more complex, as rice occasionally requires dry soil while crabs need a constant aquatic environment.\n\nDespite these challenges, the potential for mitten-handed crabs in integrated pest management (IPM) programs is significant. Their ability to control pest populations naturally aligns well with sustainable agricultural practices and environmental conservation goals.\n\nAs the demand for sustainable farming practices grows, the use of mitten-handed crabs for pest control is likely to expand. However, it's crucial to approach this method with caution, particularly in regions where these crabs are not native. Proper assessment and monitoring are essential to prevent potential negative impacts on local ecosystems.\n\nFor businesses in the agricultural sector, the mitten-handed crab presents an opportunity to embrace innovative, eco-friendly pest management solutions.

Bay Oyster Farm's Lester Marshall said he has never seen so many of the crabs gather at Kellidie Bay, 49km west of Port Lincoln.\n\nHe said it is likely the \"invasion\" of crabs marched up through the channels of Coffin Bay and came across to moult.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\n\"In the 25 to 35 years I've been oyster farming, I've never seen this many come here and we're not sure why,\" Marshall said.\n\n\"It is a sight to behold, that's for sure.\"\n\nGiant spider crabs are found throughout the Great Southern Reef that stretches from the west to east coast of Australia.\n\nThey can measure up to 16cm across their shells and 70cm across their legs.\n\nAs they grow bigger, the crabs extract themselves from their shells in a process known as moulting.\n\nIt is believed giant spider crabs gather in large numbers to protect themselves from predators when they are at their most vulnerable without their shells.\n\nDeakin University researchers have been trying to understand more about the crabs by asking members of the public to document sightings through a citizen science project.\n\nMarine ecologist Dr Elodie Camprasse has been leading the work and said it is still not known where the crabs are coming from to gather in mass numbers.\n\n\"We know very little about spider crabs,\" Camprasse said.\n\n\"I can't tell you if it's unusual or whether it's just not been reported ... but either way it's pretty exciting that it's getting reported now,\" she said about the Kellidie Bay sighting.\n\nWhen she started her research more than two years ago, Camprasse said the only scientific information on the crab gatherings was in Victoria's Port Phillip Bay and in Tasmania.\n\n\"As a result of me doing media interviews, people have contacted me saying, 'Why don't you ever say we have spider crabs in South Australia too?' and it's (because) I didn't know, it's not reported anywhere,\" she said.\n\nCamprasse said her team has set up underwater cameras in Port Phillip Bay to determine where the crabs are coming from to moult in one location.\n\n\"In Port Philip Bay, the big question is: do they live in the bay?\" she said.\n\n\"We think they live solitary lives at other times, perhaps in deeper water, then come together to moult or they would be coming from Bass Strait.\n\n\"(But) this just hasn't been scientifically investigated.\"\n\nCamprasse has been told of giant spider crab sightings in Kangaroo Island and in the Spencer Gulf, but said there is not much consistent or detailed information.\n\nShe said scientists also do not know how or why the crabs travel long distances, or what triggers them to moult at the same time.\n\n\"Some people think it's the full moon, some people think it has to do with water temperature, so that's what we're investigating at the moment,\" Camprasse said.\n\nShe said giant spider crab mass gathers were unique to Australia, and it was important for local communities to understand more about their marine life.\n\n\"It does generate tourism and interest from people from interstate and overseas,\" Camprasse said.", "source": {"uri": "7news.com.au", "dataType":

locals and experts", "body": "Little is known about the arthropods, with a researcher asking the community to log sightings online to help scientists.\n\nA \"big invasion\" of giant spider crabs in waters off South Australia's Eyre Peninsula has surprised locals and experts alike.\n\nHundreds of the bright orange arthropods have been spotted at Kellidie Bay, near Coffin Bay, in recent days.\n\nOyster farmer Lester Marshall, who has worked in the area for more than 25 years, said he had never seen this many giant spider crabs gather in the region.\n\n\"We've had a big invasion of spider crabs turn up, they've marched up through the channels of Coffin Bay and come right across here into Kellidie Bay in half a metre, a metre of water in the thousands,\" he said.\n\n\"Particularly when the sun's out and they're bright orange and there are masses of them and groups of 200, 300, 500 -- it is a sight to behold.\n\n\"They're so slow-moving but they've obviously moved hundreds of kilometres, they come from outside the continental shelf into the bay here.\"\n\nMr Marshall said the mass appearance was unusual but suspected it could be because of an upwelling from the continental shelf when deep, cold water rises to the surface.\n\nDeakin University researcher Elodie Camprasse, who leads a citizen science project on spider crabs, said the creatures usually congregate during the moulting process, where they shed their shells and harden a new shell.\n\n\"They actually have to shed their shell, extract themselves from the shell, pump themselves full of water then they harden a new shell on top of their bigger bodies,\" she said.\n\n\"At that time they're often vulnerable to predators.\n\nDr Camprasse said spider crabs have previously been spotted near Kangaroo Island and the Spencer Gulf -- but that most reported sightings have been in Tasmania and Port Phillip Bay in Victoria.\n\nShe said she was \"very excited\" to hear about the spider crabs gathering near Coffin Bay.\n\n\"We do know very little about spider crabs, about the moulting and their gatherings,\" Dr Camprasse said.\n\n\"It could be that spider crabs do gather in this area but that's just not been reported in a way that us as scientists can access.\n\n\"There's also sightings of spider crabs in Tasmania but it doesn't seem to be necessarily in reliable locations year after year.\"\n\nDr Camprasse said moulting usually happens during winter but very little is known about the process.\n\n\"There are some theories around water temperature having to drop to a certain temperature for the environment to be suitable for spider crabs to moult,\" she said.\n\n\"Other people think this is related to moon cycles, perhaps particularly around full moon.\"\n\nDr Camprasse said the citizen science program hopes to give more clarity about where, when and how long spider crabs congregate.\n\n\"One of the big questions that we have is the role of spider crabs for the broader ecosystem -- so are they important in keeping predator population healthy?\" she said.\n\nShe said the community could report sightings to Spider Crab Watch on iNaturalist to help scientists understand more about the mysterious animal.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}, "authors": [],

But also, I'm always scared in the beginning. I never think, 'Oh, I can do this. No big deal.' I'm always scared I won't get it right, or it won't be as good as it should be.\" The author says it usually takes about 200 pages before she can really relax, and she strives to make her books \"better every time.\" For more on Danielle Steel, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday, or subscribe here. Her writing process begins with an outlines she does by hand, accompanied by exhaustive research, much of which she does herself because that attention to detail is what makes her books credible, and keeps her readers coming back. Once it's time to write the manuscript itself, she has to have her desk \u2014 and her headspace \u2014 ready to dive in. \"I need everything perfect to start. After that, I could make a mess, but my desk has to be cleared off. I have to have all my work done. I have to just feel peaceful and ready,\" she says. Each draft begins on her Olympia typewriter because she prefers the heft of the manual keys \u2014 and she\u2019d rather avoid the risk of accidentally deleting everything on a computer. When she's writing, which is most of the time, she might spend 20 hours at that desk, or up to 24 when she's really in the zone. \"If it's flowing well, I hate to stop and go to bed, because it's kind of like skiing in the morning,\" Steel explains. \"It's all white snow. And then you figure out the path you're going to take, and you go to sleep, and it goes away. So I tend to sit there for many, many hours.\" Dedicated bookworms may know the feeling of sitting in place for too long because the book is too good to put down.

And after a while, you just don't even notice the pain. You\u2019re just so engrossed in the book.\" Once the first draft is done, which can take \"weeks and weeks,\" she makes corrections by hand. Steel will generally do that while sitting on one of her couches, often with one of her Chihuahuas in her lap. \"The first draft is pretty much what rolls out of the typewriter,\" she adds. \"And then I spend a year correcting it and changing it and polishing it.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer , from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

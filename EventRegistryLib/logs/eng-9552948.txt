In court on Thursday, prosecutors said there is video showing the shooting.\n\nProsecutors outlined years of animosity between Robertson and Shadbar in court, saying that Shadbar frequently used racial slurs against her two biracial children. The most recent case of such epithets came on Tuesday, the day he shot Robertson.\n\nRobertson and another woman who lived at the house were in the back yard with their young sons, prosecutors said, according to Patch. Shadbar suddenly began revving his motorcycle engine, prompting Robertson to blast an airhorn in his direction.\n\n\"There's going to be dead n****** today,\" Shadbar shouted back.\n\nThe other woman brought the two children inside the house as Shadbar through a bottle over the fence. Moments later, she heard the gunshots, prosecutors said. As Robertson crawled into the house, she saw Shadbar walked past the window carrying his rifle.\n\nPolice said Shadbar barricaded himself inside his home but was eventually persuaded to surrender by a crisis negotiator, according to WBBM. Police said he made several incriminating statements to the negotiator before he left the home.\n\nBeyer told the station that Shadbar frequently railed at the children using slurs.\n\n\"And, you know, 'What are you doing here? Get out of here.' He'd call my niece an N-lover. Just anything,\" she said. \"Apparently, yesterday it escalated. He was yelling 'Dead N-word' as he was trying to get into her backyard to shoot, and her son, her 8-year-old, was on the trampoline, with another little one.\"\n\nMikeal Johnson, Robertson's stepson, told WLS that the family had called police multiple times, when Shadbar had thrown fireworks at them or fired blanks.\n\n\"Nothing was done,\" he said. \"And it's very unfortunate.\"\n\nBeyer told the station that one of Robertson's children -- an 8-year-old boy -- was home when his mother was shot. She dragged herself into her house from the yard, and a friend who was staying with her called 911.\n\n\"We were all very shocked when this happened, but honestly sadly we are not surprised,\" Beyer said. \"This has been nine years and coming.\"\n\nPolice said they found multiple unlicensed weapons in Shadbar's home after his arrest and that he had been denied a firearm owner's card because of a previous felony conviction.\n\n\"Nothing was ever done. And I don't care if he was shooting blanks,\" Beyer said. \"If he's in his front yard waving a gun and doesn't have a FOID card. I mean, I have a FOID card.

Shadbar, 70, faces charges of attempted first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm, and unlawful use of a weapon by a felon in the shooting of a 45-year-old woman, deputies said in a news release.\n\nThe violence happened on Tuesday. Deputies with the Will County Sheriff's Office responded at 5:37 p.m. to 144th Place and Rickerman Road in unincorporated Lockport Township for a shots fired complaint, authorities said. The area is about 35 miles southwest of Chicago.\n\nWhile deputies were responding, they were told that the victim had been shot by her neighbor, authorities said. Witnesses told 911 dispatchers that Shadbar shot the victim, firing dozens of rounds of ammunition with an assault-style rifle at her from different locations outside, authorities said. The shooting prompted a shelter-in-place alert for area residents, officials said.\n\nOnce there, deputies secured the area and began tending to the victim before she was taken to a hospital, where she was in critical condition with a gunshot wound to her chest and wounds to her hand.\n\nAfter allegedly shooting her, authorities said Shadbar barricaded himself in his home and was talked out by a crisis negotiator who convinced him to surrender peacefully. He was booked into the Will County Adult Detention Facility without bail, online records show.\n\nFamily members identified the victim as Melissa Robertson. The victim's niece Jeanne Beyer told Chicago ABC affiliate WLS that her 8-year-old son was home when the shooting happened.\n\n\"Random during the day or night, he would come out and shoot his gun off into the air, into the woods across the street,\" Beyer said. \"Yell racist slurs. God forbid the 8-year-old is out in the backyard or front yard playing.\"\n\nBeyer told Fox Chicago affiliate WFLD that Shadbar has been \"terrorizing her in the neighborhood for years ... revving his motorcycle engine at all hours as loud as it can possibly go, blasting music, yelling, getting drunk and disorderly, shooting his gun into the air.\"\n\n\"When an 8-year-old is terrified to play in his backyard, it's pretty bad,\" she told the station.\n\nRobertson's niece Natalie Beyer set up an online fundraiser for help with medical bills. She said Robertson, a single mother, suffered damage to her abdomen and hand and was on a ventilator. The shot to her stomach damaged her colon and spleen and shattered several ribs, which surgeons removed, she said. Robertson will need reconstructive hand surgery.\n\n\"The bullet tore off quite a bit of her thumb and index finger,\" the niece wrote. \"Ordinarily, they would amputate, but because the thumb is so important, the doctors will try to save it.\"\n\n\"We do not know what lies ahead, but we do know that, at the least, she will need months of rehabilitation and care,\" she also wrote. \"During that time, we want her to be able to focus on her recovery and family ... not what's bound to be staggering medical and household bills.

A friend who had been staying with her called 911.\n\nAfter Shadbar's arrest, prosecutors said multiple unlicensed weapons were recovered inside his home, and added that Shadbar had previously been denied a FOID card because of a felony conviction for battery that dates back to the 19070s.\n\nRobertson's family's frustration was evident outside court Thursday.\n\n\"Nothing was ever done. And I don't care if he was shooting blanks. If he's in his front yard waving a gun and doesn't have a FOID card. I mean, I have a FOID card. I can't go stand in my front yard and wave my gun around without some consequences,\" Beyer said.\n\n\"I was on my way home from work. My little brother was home. And I just wish I could have been there. I mean not much I could have done, but I wish I could have been there for my family when they needed me the most,\" said Johnson.\n\nBeyer said Shadbar terrorized her niece's neighborhood.\n\n\"Random during the day or night, he would come out and shoot his gun off into the air, into the woods across the street,\" Beyer said. \"Yell racist slurs. God-forbid the eight-year-old is out in the backyard or front yard playing.\"\n\nShadbar is due back in court on May 23. He can appeal his detention at that hearing.", "source": {"uri": "abc7chicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC7 Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockport_Township,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lockport Township, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lockport Township, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WLS_(AM)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WLS (AM)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hate crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockport,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lockport, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lockport, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigger", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigger"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battery (crime)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/14789187_050924-wls-lockport-piekos1130aclipped-vid.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552948", "eventUri": "eng-9552948", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lockport Township, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 1084, "textEnd": 1089}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-23", "textStart": 2801, "textEnd": 2807}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Shadbar, 70, of Lockport Township, was arrested on Wednesday and was booked on four charges, including attempted-first degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm, and unlawful use of a weapon by a felon.\n\nShadbar is being held at the Will County Adult Detention Facility and is set to appear in court for a hearing on Thursday afternoon. It is unclear if Shadbar has retained an attorney in this case.\n\nThe victim of the shooting is a 45-year-old female, according to authorities, but her identity has not yet been released.\n\nAccording to the WCSO, sheriff's deputies responded to the area of 144th Place and Rickerman Road in Unincorporated Lockport Township, just southwest of Chicago, at 5:37 PM local time on Tuesday in response to a complaint of shots fired.\n\n\"Witnesses to the incident advised 911 that the offender, John Shadbar, shot the victim outside and was walking around his property with a rifle,\" WSCO said in a statement announcing Shadbar's arrest. \"A reverse 911 call was placed to area residents to shelter in place due to this incident. Witnesses stated that Shadbar fired dozens of rounds of ammunition with an assault-style rifle at the victim from different outside locations.\"\n\nAccording to the sheriff's office, the suspect barricaded himself inside his residence for a brief time after the shooting and was later convinced by a crisis negotiator to exit his residence \"with his hands up.\"\n\n\"While speaking to the crisis negotiator, Shadbar made several incriminating statements,\" according to a WSCO statement.\"\n\n\"Detectives are confident that additional charges will be filed regarding this case, as this incident appears to be racially motivated,\" the statement continued.\n\nAccording to law enforcement, deputies provided aid to the victim and she was then transported to a local hospital \"in critical condition,\" where she has undergone surgery for her injuries, which include a gunshot wound to her chest that exited her back, and a gunshot wound to her hand.\n\nDetectives and investigators obtained video evidence of the shooting and are working to recover additional evidence pending a search warrant of the suspect's residence, according to WSCO, and will provide additional detail as the investigation progresses.\n\nWill County Sheriff Mike Kelley thanked the \"heroes\" from the sheriff's office, the Lockport Police Department, and Lockport Township Fire Protection, who responded to the scene.\n\n\"They put themselves in harm's way, knowing that there was an armed individual in the area with the ability to shoot at them from a long distance,\" Kelley said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"[They] collaborated and worked together to ensure that the victim could be stabilized and transported out of harm's way.

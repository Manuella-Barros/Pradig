It called on the Kano government to respect rule of law in the interest of peace, stability of Kano State and Nigeria. The Chairman of the Foundation Sheikh Ibrahim Sheikh Dahiru stated this on Sunday while addressing a press conference in Bauchi, said that the call became imperative following the reactions the situation has developed from various stakeholders who have the interest of the country at heart. He said that nobody no matter how highly placed in the society is above the law, stressing that the Kano State government should allow peace and justice to prevail in the state and avoid a needless crisis. The Chairman of the foundation stressed on the need for leaders in the nation to respect the rule of law, calling on all arms of government to work together in harmony to ensure peace, stability, and progress in the state. \u201cIn the interest of peace we want justice to prevail, since the court intervenes to maintain law and order, we expect each party to respect the rule of law in the interest of peace.It is wrong for the Kano State Government to continue with the process of appointing the 16th emir of Kano, and dethrone the five emirs despite the court injunction\u201d \u201cI advise the emirs to take a vow in the interest of peace brotherhood to save the blood of many innocent souls and allow peace and stability to reign. \u201cIf for example Sanusi was dethroned by Former Governor Ganduje, and people pray for his return, today he was appointed by Governor Abba, there is nothing wrong if Sanusi will emulate Sayyidina Hassan grandson of Prophet Muhammad peace be upon who left power to Mu\u2019awiyyah in the interest of peace brotherhood among the muslim Ummah\u201d. \u201cIn this light, I am calling on the National Assembly to amend the constitution and make laws that will protect traditional rulers from the politicians who used their powers to dethrone them or appoint them at their pleasure\u201d he said Chairman urged the government, the two emirs and the people of Kano to respect rule of law not to be on haste but to follow due process and follow whatever court will say in the interest of justice \u201cWe want Governor Abba Kabir Yusuf, and the State House of Assembly to exercise caution and refrain from making decisions that may jeopardize the state\u2019s stability and exacerbate the suffering of the people of Kano State, who have already endured enough due to previous negative decisions and misguided policies. \u201cWe are grateful to all stakeholders for standing strong and protecting the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. We commend the Federal Government for their commitment to upholding the rule of law and separation of powers, and the vital role they played in maintaining peace in Kano State and the country at large\u201d The Chairman stated According to him\u201cWe want the parties to work together to build a brighter future for the people of Kano State and Nigeria, where justice, peace, and prosperity reign, and where the rights and dignity of all citizens are upheld and respected.\u201d", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"720\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240526-WA0053.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240526-WA0053.jpg 720w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240526-WA0053-300x178.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></div>Following the Kano emirate power tussle, the Sheikh Dahiru Usman Bauchi Foundation has expressed displeasure over the decision of the Kano state government to appoint the 16th emir of Kano, Lamido Sanisu and dethrone the five emirs despite the court injunction.

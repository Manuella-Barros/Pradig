{"id": 225054542, "title": "\u2018A fine line between humor and flopping\u2019: tech summit\u2019s rap battle is the height of corporate cringe", "text": "The next time you\u2019re sitting through a company-wide meeting, half-listening to a leader drone on about updates or product launches (and hoping they don\u2019t announce layoffs or budget cuts), remember this: at least they\u2019re not rapping. That\u2019s what happened at Canva Create, a summit held in Los Angeles last week, in honor of Canva, a graphic design company known for helping non-designers produce good-enough flyers to advertise a yard sale or middle school talent show. In LA, Melanie Perkins, co-founder of the $40bn Australian brand, spoke to attendees about \u201cbrand-building, maintaining a strong company culture and scaling operations\u201d, per Variety. (Something she knows a lot about: Disney\u2019s CEO, Bob Iger, who also spoke at the summit, is an investor and board member of the platform.) After run-of-the-mill talks and discussions, the team decided to put on a show. Two presenters \u2013 and a cast of backup breakdancers, all of whom were most certainly regretting their respective life paths in the moment \u2013 performed a \u201crap battle\u201d that they used to describe updates the tech company has made to the design app. Sample bars included: \u201cYou can redesign your work / Canva got that glow up / We redesign errything / From the floor up.\u201d On the topic of AI, which is known to steal art from actual human workers, one performer dropped: \u201cWe don\u2019t train on your work without your permission / Safe and securrrrrr if that\u2019s what you\u2019re wishing.\u201d As many online commentators have pointed out, the dorky, Hamilton-esque delivery epitomized cringe. \u201cCall 911 I\u2019m having a cringe overdose,\u201d the YouTube and Twitch streamer Finn McKenty, also known as the Punk Rock MBA, wrote on X. \u201cThere\u2019s no project important enough for me to spend a long weekend watching Canva the Musical,\u201d the comedian Katrina Davis added. Canva aims to help users create graphics that are effortless and aesthetically pleasing \u2013 words that no one would use to describe the song and dance. Canva\u2019s bust comes shortly after Apple released a much-maligned ad for its iPad Pro, which showed a series of objects such as pianos, books and a classical bust being crushed by a mechanical press. The brand meant to show how the latest iPad compresses all the world\u2019s creativity into one device \u2013 though many people instead saw it as a metaphor for tech\u2019s potential to destroy culture as we know it. (Apple later apologized for the ad.) It wasn\u2019t always like this. Every so often, a video goes viral showing the launch party of Windows 95, in which Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, clad in dad Dockers and polo shirts, awkwardly and excitedly dance to Start Me Up by the Rolling Stones. It\u2019s corny, but potentially cute, because it lacks the try-hard nature of Canva\u2019s big-budget musical revue. To be fair, it\u2019s tough to pull off an enjoyable corporate event \u2013 no one ever truly enjoys being trapped in an auditorium with their co-workers and industry peers when they could be off the clock. \u201cThe problem is the people putting it together want to be innovative and modern while also relating to the brand or industry, and it doesn\u2019t always come off well,\u201d said Rich Libner, president of MCP Talent, a company that plans corporate and private events. \u201cThey\u2019re usually not modern and overcompensate with putting too much focus on branding. It comes off as messy and inauthentic.\u201d Gianna Cardinale Gaudini, a former event planner for Google and author of The Art of Event Planning, added: \u201cPeople are intuitive and emotionally driven beings who can sniff out authenticity or lack thereof. There is a fine line between eliciting nostalgia or tongue-in-cheek humor and flopping, and brands take a huge hit if they don\u2019t hit the mark.\u201d Gary Ferrar is a magician and mentalist who performs at such events. Recently, a client texted him a script of what to say at the beginning of the set: \u201cWelcome [REDACTED] Team members! Today is all about celebrating YOU \u2013 because at [REDACTED], you matter! I hope that you enjoy this special session designed just for [REDACTED] team members. Now, let\u2019s get started.\u201d \u201cI tried very hard to convince them that this opening conveys the complete opposite of \u2018you matter\u2019,\u201d Ferrar said. \u201cAttendees are aware of where they work, and do not need to hear the company name three times in three sentences.\u201d But upper management won, and Ferrar had to deliver those lines \u201cas sincerely as I could\u201d. Ultimately, tech companies and Silicon Valley titans alike just can\u2019t figure out how to meaningfully communicate with the rest of us. In recent years, Mark Zuckerberg traded in his geek-chic hoodie and jeans for designer clothes from the likes of Alexander McQueen and Rahul Mishra \u2013 plus a very conspicuous chain necklace presumably meant to communicate a breezy swag. Ditto for Jeff Bezos, whose new interest in fashion kicked off a friendship with Vogue\u2019s editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour (they are both noted union busters, so presumably they have much to talk about). Despite their billions, both men struggle to truly look cool \u2013 in fact, they dress as if they are directed by an algorithm.", "summary": "<p>A Hamilton-esque performance extolling the virtues of design software was exactly the wrong kind of corny</p><p>The next time you\u2019re sitting through a company-wide meeting, half-listening to a leader drone on about updates or product launches (and hoping they don\u2019t announce layoffs or budget cuts), remember this: at least they\u2019re not rapping.</p><p>That\u2019s what happened at Canva Create, a summit held in Los Angeles last week, in honor of Canva, a graphic design company known for helping non-designers produce good-enough flyers to advertise a yard sale or middle school talent show.

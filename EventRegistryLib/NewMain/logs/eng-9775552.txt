But that sentiment has changed, and the stock is nearing all-time low prices. This can either be seen as a buying opportunity or a sign of things to come, but it's not entirely clear which it is.\n\nI came up with three reasons Snowflake could be a fantastic buy right now, but also one reason to sell. Even though it's three reasons to one, the one thorn in Snowflake's side could be enough to avoid it entirely.\n\nSnowflake's products center around its data cloud offering. Its software provides everything its clients could want in terms of data collection, storage, and processing. This offering has amassed a large clientele, with nearly 10,000 customers using the product.\n\nOf that group, 485, or about 5%, spend at least $1 million annually with Snowflake. That's a large customer base and shows Snowflake is doing something right.\n\nBut that figure could soon explode higher because data is vital to artificial intelligence (AI). Although AI models are great, if you put in bad information, you'll get a worthless model. That's why having a vast, diverse data stream to feed these models is so important. As a result, using a product like Snowflake to capture real-time data is important.\n\nRight now, the biggest demand in the AI space is in the hardware and base-model segment. Eventually, the demand will shift toward the application segment, requiring large data input. This is a huge tailwind that will benefit Snowflake immensely in the future.\n\nPart of the reason Snowflake's stock sold off is that its growth rate has been slowing.\n\nWhile investors love to see eye-popping numbers in the revenue growth space, 33% growth isn't anything to be concerned about. Management forecast growth to slow, however, with second-quarter product revenue expected to increase by about 27%. For its 2025 fiscal year (ending Jan. 31, 2025), product revenue is predicted to grow around 24%.\n\nOne important caveat here is the word \"product.\" This only accounts for sales tied directly to its software, not any other revenue it derives from setup or support services. Regardless, growth is starting to slow.\n\nThis is normally a red flag, but investors need to remember that Snowflake is approaching $1 billion in quarterly revenue, so growing by 50% or more in a quarter is becoming more difficult.\n\nInvestors need to adjust their expectations because the company's growth is still strong compared to many other companies in its industry.\n\nAs a result of the sell-off and still-strong growth, Snowflake's stock has reached a valuation point it has never touched in its previous time on the markets. With a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of about 14, it's far cheaper than many of its peers.\n\nLet's look at some growth rates and P/S valuations of some of Snowflake's software peers.\n\nData source: YCharts.\n\nWhile I'm not going to argue that 14.2 times sales is dirt cheap by any stretch, it's still less pricey than some of its peers despite growing faster.\n\nMy only holdup with Snowflake's stock is its lack of progress in turning a profit. It isn't close to breaking even, and isn't getting any better, either.\n\nFor the past two and a half years, Snowflake essentially hovered around the 40% operating-loss margin mark. This is concerning, as most companies focus more on turning a profit when their growth begins to slow.\n\nThis could start to change with a new CEO, but until I see steady improvement, this will always be a red flag.\n\nWith these four factors in mind, I believe Snowflake's stock is ripe for a turnaround. A directional shift in the company could easily correct my reason to sell, so I think Snowflake is a buy right now.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Snowflake, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Snowflake wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $683,777!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

With a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of about 14, it's far cheaper than many of its peers.\n\nLet's look at some growth rates and P/S valuations of some of Snowflake's software peers.\n\nData source: YCharts.\n\nWhile I'm not going to argue that 14.2 times sales is dirt cheap by any stretch, it's still less pricey than some of its peers despite growing faster.\n\nMy only holdup with Snowflake's stock is its lack of progress in turning a profit. It isn't close to breaking even, and isn't getting any better, either.\n\nFor the past two and a half years, Snowflake essentially hovered around the 40% operating-loss margin mark. This is concerning, as most companies focus more on turning a profit when their growth begins to slow.\n\nThis could start to change with a new CEO, but until I see steady improvement, this will always be a red flag.\n\nWith these four factors in mind, I believe Snowflake's stock is ripe for a turnaround. A directional shift in the company could easily correct my reason to sell, so I think Snowflake is a buy right now.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "keithen_drury@fool.com", "name": "Keithen Drury", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflake_Inc.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snowflake Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headwind_and_tailwind", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headwind and tailwind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data_Administration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data Administration", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/784574/data-scientist-working-at-night-defense-contractor.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775552", "eventUri": "eng-9775552", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Moreover, its tax-sheltered status makes it ideal for holding inflation-beating asset classes such as stocks, exchange-traded funds, and mutual funds.\n\nIntroduced in 2009, the TFSA can be used as a wealth-creating machine, making it ideal for holding quality growth stocks positioned to beat the market. The TFSA contribution room in 2024 is $7,000, and here's how you can invest it right now.\n\nThe asset class you should own depends on factors such as your age, risk appetite, and investment horizon. For example, older investors should have a higher exposure to lower-risk financial products such as Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs).\n\nThe GIC is an instrument where you deposit a certain sum for a fixed period with a bank or a financial institution in return for regular interest payments. In recent years, interest rate hikes have meant the interest rate on GICs is around 5%, which is higher than the current inflation rate. Moreover, GICs are ideal for those with a short-term investment horizon.\n\nAlternatively, younger Canadians with a higher risk appetite can hold quality growth stocks in the TFSA to benefit from multifold returns over time. Here is one such tech stock you can own right now.\n\nValued at US$43 billion by market cap, Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) is a software-as-service (SaaS) company that is growing at an enviable pace. Snowflake provides enterprises with a cloud-based data warehousing platform and has experienced explosive growth as its sales more than doubled in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022 (ended in January). Its top-line growth has decelerated in recent years as the company expects product sales to grow by \"just\" 24% in fiscal 2025.\n\nSimilar to other asset-light tech companies, Snowflake has a high gross margin of 75%. Alternatively, it expects an operating margin of 3% in fiscal 2025, lower than its initial forecast of 6%.\n\nSnowflake's RPO, or remaining performance obligations, had grown by 46% to US$5 billion at the end of the first quarter (Q1), providing investors with top-line visibility. It is also seeing renewed client interest in bigger deals, as it signed a US$100 million deal in Q1 and a US$250 million deal in fiscal Q4 of 2024.\n\nThe company reported a net retention rate of 128% in Q1, which means existing customers have increased spending on the Snowflake platform by 28% in the last 12 months.\n\nWhile Snowflake remains unprofitable on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis, it reported an adjusted free cash flow margin of 44% in fiscal Q1. With US$4.5 billion in cash, Snowflake is well-funded and has the financial flexibility to invest heavily in organic growth and accretive acquisitions.\n\nSnowflake's decelerating sales growth has dragged the stock lower by 68% from all-time highs. Despite the pullback, Snowflake stock trades at a price-to-sales multiple of 12.3 times, which is quite expensive.

He threw for four first downs on that opening drive but twice missed Mike Evans on fade routes in the end zone. Backups Ryan Fitzpatrick and Ryan Griffin alternated after that, and it was not promising. Fitzpatrick ran in a 6-yard touchdown, but had a dreadful series in the fourth quarter. In a span of three plays, he was nearly picked off, fumbled, and then was intercepted. Griffin went 4-for-9 for 57 yards and left the game with a shoulder injury.\n\nWhen it was starters vs. starters, the Bucs looked ...: Pretty good. Evans caught four passes on seven targets for 58 yards. On defense, Hargreaves made an outstanding touchdown-saving interception at the goal line on a pass intended for Brandon LaFell. He also had a pass breakup on third down, forcing the Bengals to settle for a field goal.\n\nOne reason to be concerned: While the Bucs' defensive starters had a nice outing, backups struggled, making Bengals backup quarterback Jeff Driskel look like an All-Pro in the second half. There was no pressure up front, there were missed tackles and miscommunication. Justin Evans was nowhere to be found when Robert McClain was expecting help over the top on Josh Malone's touchdown. Backups along the offensive line also struggled in protection.\n\nThat guy could start: Javien Elliott looks like a solid nickelback, finishing with three combined tackles and a pass breakup. Between an overwhelming number of first-team reps in practice and his performance in Friday's game, he should clinch the job.\n\nRookie watch: Tight end O.J. Howard continued the strong run blocking he's shown in practice, helping spring Peyton Barber on fourth-and-1. Safety Evans showed that tackling is still an issue for him and he's got a ways to go before he can challenge for a starting role. He finished with five combined tackles. Linebacker Kendell Beckwith finished with five combined tackles, a sack of Driskel in the third quarter and a tackle for a loss. Wide receiver Chris Godwin had one catch on one target for 14 yards.\n\nKicking catastrophe: Aguayo's 2016 struggles carried over into the preseason. The former second-round draft pick, who went 22-for-31 as a rookie last season, made a 20-yard field goal to open the night but missed a 33-yard extra point in the second quarter. Aguayo was then brought out in the fourth quarter to attempt a 47-yard field goal and also missed. In the third quarter, Folk made a 45-yarder. The two have been competing neck-and-neck in practice, but Folk clearly had the upper hand Friday night.\n\nCornerback concerns: With cornerbacks Brent Grimes and Jude Adjei-Barimah both out with injuries, the Bucs are now lacking depth outside. Ryan Smith had a ton of snaps in Grimes' absence. He had a couple of nice moments. He's very fast. The Bucs' ground game also wasn't particularly impressive, although Charles Sims broke a nice 13-yard run.", "timeCrawl": "03:37:00", "sim": 0.843137264251709, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8738772", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation", "id": 75, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Sporting_Goods", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Sporting Goods", "id": 88, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "id": 288, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors", "id": 405, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost_or_Missing", "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost or Missing", "id": 645, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "id": 646, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "id": 1106, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

But he has been burned by it, too.\n\nThat's why the gunslinger quarterback sat in coach Dirk Koetter's office at the start of training camp and asked, \"How much is doing too much?\"\n\nWinston discovered some answers in Friday's 23-12 preseason-opening loss to the Bengals. He was patient. He was surgical. He spread the ball around. He drove it downfield when he had time. He checked it to his running backs and tight ends when he did not.\n\nShowing he can play with a resting pulse rate, Winston calmly completed his first four passes and drove the offense 92 yards in the Bucs' first series.\n\nHe did everything but finish with a touchdown. The opening drive stalled after two fade passes in the end zone to Mike Evans fell incomplete, the second of which could have been a holding penalty on Bengals cornerback Adam Jones.\n\nKicker Roberto Aguayo made a 20-yard field goal to give the Bucs a 3-0 lead. (He would later clank an extra-point attempt off the right upright and miss a field goal from 47 yards.)\n\nWinston finished 9 of 13 passing for 99 yards. He spread the ball around with completions to Evans, Cameron Brate, Adam Humphries, Jacquizz Rodgers and DeSean Jackson, who took the Hardest Knock from Bengals linebacker Kevin Minter.\n\n\"It just seems every year Jameis takes another step,\" Brate said. \"He's always been a great leader. I think the biggest thing he's done is kind of maintained his emotions. Sometimes he gets too excited, and he's controlled that consistently throughout camp, and you saw it (Friday), too.\"\n\nUnfortunately for the Bucs, their offense began the game backed up to the north bank of the Ohio River, the result of a bad decision by Ryan Smith to bring the opening kickoff out of the end zone and a penalty.\n\n\"Any time you get a chance to face adversity on your first drive as a team, you see how we react to it,\" Winston said. \"I believe we did well. We definitely didn't get stopped by (the Bengals). We stopped ourselves.\"\n\nOn their second try, the Bucs took over at their 1-yard line when cornerback Vernon Hargreaves intercepted a pass from Andy Dalton intended for Brandon LaFell.\n\n\"Those are morale killers down there,\" Hargreaves said. \"I just took a chance. There's not a lot of space behind me, so I took a chance being aggressive, and I happened to make a play.\"\n\nWinston was effective moving the Bucs out of trouble again, but his pass on third and 2 at the Tampa Bay 30 was a little behind Evans and fell incomplete.\n\nFor the most part, Winston felt comfortable targeting the players who are not new to the offense. Evans had four catches for 58 yards.\n\n\"We've done a lot of work the last couple years,\" said Brate, who had two catches for 27 yards. \"He was looking toward us a little bit, but O.J. (Howard) and DeSean will get theirs.\"\n\nJackson is going to be a big, big part of this offense. He already creates a ton of space for running backs and receivers; the Bengals kept a safety over the top when he was in the game.\n\nBackup quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick took over from Winston early in the second quarter and led the Bucs to a touchdown, scoring on a 6-yard run (which was followed by Aguayo's missed extra point), and later drove his team to a 45-yard field goal by Nick Folk.\n\nQuarterback Ryan Griffin left the game in the fourth quarter with a shoulder injury.\n\nIt wasn't a particularly good showing by the defense, despite Hargreaves' heroics. The Bengals took the lead in the third quarter when former Florida and Louisiana Tech quarterback Jeff Driskel ran for a score and threw for one against the second unit.\n\n\"We were kind of feeling things out, and we were a little rusty,\" tackle Gerald McCoy said. \"I think that showed.\"\n\nAguayo's missed field goal came with 1:03 left in the game after quarterback Sefo Liufau led the Bucs from their 25 to the Bengals' 29 following a Cincinnati field goal.\n\n\"I keep saying it, but it's true,\" coach Dirk Koetter said. \"If you're a kicker, you have to make your kicks.\"\n\nBy far, the biggest takeaway from the game was how Winston wasn't about to give the ball away. A year ago, he threw 18 interceptions and lost six fumbles. Eight picks came in the first four games as the Bucs started 1-3.\n\nWinston knows he can do more for the offense than he did in two series Friday. But he's learning when not doing too much is enough.", "timeCrawl": "06:18:00", "sim": 0.7490196228027344, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8878701", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "id": 134, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "id": 137, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "id": 205, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Cats", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Cats", "id": 482, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "id": 641, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

It's unknown how serious the injury is, but he did not return to the game.\n\nMeanwhile, free agent QB Ryan Fitzpatrick ran for a touchdown and also led the Bucs to a field goal.\n\nFitzpatrick finished 4-of-11 for 36 yards and threw an interception.\n\nGriffin, who has never taken a regular season snap in the NFL, alternated with Fitzpatrick on Friday after starter Jameis Winston left with a 3-0 lead early in the second quarter.\n\nGriffin finished 4-of-9 passing for 57 yards. The Bucs also have Colorado rookie Sefo Liufau, who entered the game late in the fourth quarter.\n\nAguayo starts on the bad foot\n\nRoberto Aguayo may have lost whatever foothold he had on the Bucs' place-kicking job.\n\nAfter starting with a chip-shot 20-yard field goal, Aguayo clanged an extra point off the right upright, and missed a 47-yard field goal wide right in the final minute. \"Honestly, the (extra point) felt good,\" Aguayo said. \"When I caught it, I knew I pushed it a little bit and I was like, 'hopefully it will stay in,' but it hit the upright. Unlucky. And the last one, I was trying to get a good hit on it. I hit it good and it just started to fade.

The Bucs' first team units looked better than the Bengals, but once depth had to get on the field Tampa Bay was clearly outclassed.\n\nThe Bucs opened the score with a field goal and added a Ryan Fitzpatrick touchdown scramble in the second quarter, but couldn't do much more than that. The Bengals were largely stifled early on, with a beautiful Vernon Hargreaves interception on the goal-line snuffing out their best chance of scoring, but Jeff Driskel of all people managed to score two touchdowns to get them the win.\n\nStill, the Bucs' stars showed up and did some work. Mike Evans had a few good catches, Cameron Brate was reliable as always, O.J. Howard looked really good as a blocker but didn't get many receiving opportunities.\n\nSo let's look at the top five takeaways from the game.\n\nThe Bucs offense struggled a little to get the running game going, but Jameis Winston didn't skip a beat. With Mike Evans and DeSean Jackson on the field and pass protection holding up, Winston marched the team down the field twice in the two drives he got.\n\nWinston finished the game completing 9 of 13 passes for 99 yards with, surprisingly perhaps, no runs. Winston scrambled a couple of times but found a receiver down the field every time. That was good to see, too: Winston does need to reduce the number of hits, and not running as much would help a lot.\n\nOverall, this was a very strong performance for Winston. He was accurate, got the ball out on time, and found the open option every time. No interceptions or near-interceptions, no bad decisions -- just good football.\n\nThe Bucs offensive line has been much-maligned this offseason, but the starters held up well. And that's with starting center Ali Marpet out due to an ankle injury. They were especially impressive in pass protection, with Donovan Smith having a few dominant plays -- to be fair, he had a few less-than-perfect plays, too.\n\nThe run-blocking was a little less impressive, which is a little concerning. But that should be better with Marpet back in there, and some of it may be due to lackluster running back play. In fact, Charles Sims was the only running back to really impress today, though most only got a few carries to work with.\n\nAll that said, the Bucs' backup lines were no match for the Bengals' pass-rush. That was really ugly.\n\nThe Bucs had some issues stopping the run throughout the game, and most of it appeared to be missing run fits: players not being where they need to be in the defensive scheme. The result was the Bengals collecting 140 yards on 36 carries -- not a good day for a defense that had issues stopping the run last year, and added a few big players in an effort to improve there. Though, to be fair, that's only 3.9 yards per carry, so perhaps I'm being a bit too harsh.\n\nLast year's second-round pick had two short kicks, and missed one of them. That's not good. And then he got a 47-yard attempt at the end of the game and missed it too. Oops.\n\nNick Folk, on the other hand, was perfect. One complicating matter: Aguayo got the first kicks, which generally (though not always) indicates he was ahead of Folk coming into this game. But I think we're past that now.\n\nThe Buccaneers have two Ryans as their backup quarterbacks, and both of them have problems. Fitzpatrick's problem is that he's not any good at throwing the ball, and his arm is a noodle now. He completed XXXX of XXXXX passes for XXXXX yards and an interception and just looked plain terrible.\n\nGriffin's problem is that while he looked decent, he had to go to the locker room with a shoulder injury that almost immediately got him ruled out for the rest of the game -- not a good indication.\n\nThere's still this one unsigned guy out there who I hear has some talent...", "timeCrawl": "04:44:00", "sim": 0.7215686440467834, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8744216", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "id": 134, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "id": 135, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "id": 137, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "id": 205, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "id": 641, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

the time: \"It's just preseason.\"\n\nIt's a catch-all for the NFL in August -- if your team plays well, it's just the preseason; if your quarterback throws three interceptions, it's just the preseason.\n\nBut jobs are won and lost in the preseason -- as the Bucs choose 53 players from the 90 on the roster, their play in the four preseason games is the best way to get an NFL job. Here are five things to watch in Friday's preseason opener at the Bengals.\n\n1. Backup QBs: You'll see Jameis Winston for about one quarter, but who takes over from there? Ryan Griffin -- the Bucs' No. 3 the past two years who hasn't taken a regular-season snap at age 27 -- might get the first look, and he has played well with the No. 2 offense in practice. His competition is Ryan Fitzpatrick, signed to a one-year, $3 million deal but not assured of the top backup job.\n\nGriffin must be better than he was in last year's preseason. He had four interceptions against one touchdown, playing primarily with third-stringers. Bucs backup quarterbacks had just two touchdown passes in 119 preseason passes last year. Expect much more with improved depth.\n\nLoren Elliott | Times\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers quarterbacks Ryan Fitzpatrick (14) and Ryan Griffin (4) are seen during training camp.\n\n2. Kicker battle: Practice kicks are being tallied as Roberto Aguayo and Nick Folk battle for the kicker job, so preseason kicks carry huge importance.\n\nHow many chances might they have? The Bucs have had nine or 10 field-goal attempts in three of the past four preseasons. That would be better than 2014, when the Bucs had four field goals in four games.\n\nAre preseason field goals that telling, though? Aguayo went 8-for-10 on field goals as a rookie in the preseason last year, good from as far out as 48 and 50 yards. He didn't hit a field goal longer than 43 yards in 16 regular-season games.\n\nMisses will be costly. Both of Aguayo's preseason misses last year came at Jacksonville, going wide right from 32 and 49 yards. He'll be back there Thursday.\n\nLoren Elliott | Times\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers kickers Roberto Aguayo (19) and Nick Folk (2) are seen during training camp.\n\n3. Receiver depth: Fans are excited to see DeSean Jackson for the first time, and they'll see promising rookie Chris Godwin as well. But those two are locks to make the roster, along with Mike Evans and Adam Humphries.\n\nThe intrigue is who can grab the last spot or two. Fans have seen Freddie Martino and Josh Huff, and to a lesser extent, Bernard Reedy. Donteea Dye has an ankle injury and likely won't play. Watch out for Derel Walker, a college teammate of Evans at Texas A&M who had gaudy numbers in the CFL last year: 109 catches for 1,589 yards and 10 touchdowns.\n\nAlso trying to make their case are two speedy rookies, Florida State's Bobo Wilson and Eastern Washington's Shaq Hill. The Bucs had only six touchdown receptions in last year's preseason, so this is a chance to showcase the improved depth at receiver.\n\nLoren Elliott | Times\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Derel Walker runs a route during a practice at One Buc Place.\n\n4. New safeties: Chris Conte and Keith Tandy, back from last season, are more known commodities, familiar with Mike Smith's defense and working most often as the starting safeties in practice.\n\nBut the Bucs made investments in two challengers -- second-round draft pick Justin Evans from Texas A&M, and free agent J.J. Wilcox, signed from the Cowboys. They need to show they've picked the defense, and the best way to do so is lining up in the right place and making plays in preseason games.\n\nThose four seem like locks to make the 53-man roster, and Josh Robinson, a special-teams standout, will make the team on his kick coverage skills alone. The rest are outside shots, like Marqueston Huff, on his fifth team in less than a year, and Isaiah Johnson, who spent last season on the Bucs' practice squad.\n\nLoren Elliott | Times\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers safety Marqueston Huff participates in drills during training camp.\n\n5. Linebacker depth: The last spot or two is up for grabs -- that player is more likely to contribute on special teams, but it would help to show upside on defense should one of the top three or four linebackers get injured.\n\nIt's a battle between returning special-teamers from last year -- Adarius Glanton and Cameron Lynch -- and newcomers like undrafted rookies Riley Bullough and Richie Brown and CFL import Jeff Knox. Bullough was a surprise star on Hard Knocks this week, lauded by coaches for his communication in picking up the defense quickly and his leadership skills, even as a third-stringer.\n\nBucs fans will also be excited to see rookie Kendell Beckwith, who has made a remarkable return, not even nine months removed from an ACL tear in November. It's also a big game for Devante Bond, trying to show he can be the team's primary strongside linebacker after missing his rookie season with a hamstring injury.\n\nLoren Elliott | Times\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers inside linebacker Kendell Beckwith (51) defends tight end Cameron Brate (84) during the first day of training camp.\n\nOn the other side: Familiar names you'll remember on the Bengals side of this game? DE Michael Johnson, an expensive bust in one year with the Bucs in 2014, had 3.5 sacks last season after returning to Cincinnati. ... Hardy Nickerson -- that's the son of former Bucs great Hardy Nickerson -- is tryiing to make the roster as an undrafted rookie out of Illinois, where he played for dad and Lovie Smith last season. ... Karel Hamilton, an undrafted rookie receiver who played at Strawberry Crest, gets his first chance to overcome the odds and make the roster. ... Former Gators QB Jeff Driskel, who finished his college career at Louisiana Tech, is Cincinnati's third QB, and could be in line for a practice squad job, with A.J. McCarron still lined up as Andy Dalton's backup, barring someone overpaying for him in a trade.", "timeCrawl": "08:40:00", "sim": 0.7098039388656616, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8570234", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "id": 30, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "id": 32, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "id": 284, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "id": 435, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

"The Tampa Bay Buccaneers will play their preseason debut tonight at 7;30 PM EST against the Cincinnati Bengals. Both teams saw a good bit of change in their locker rooms this offseason -- with the Bengals losing arguably their best two offensive linemen in Andrew Whitworth and Kevin Zeitler and adding speedster John Ross and home-run hitter Joe Mixon through the draft. The Bucs, as we all know, got two big free agent additions in wide receiver DeSean Jackson and nose tackle Chris \"Swaggy\" Baker, also adding all-around talents in tight end O.J. Howard and receiver Chris Godwin through the draft.\n\nThe Bucs can expect several players out on Friday night -- cornerback Brent Grimes sustained a gash on his leg in practice Wednesday and will not play, cornerback Jude Adjei-Barimah is set to have surgery that will end his season for a patellar fracture, as well as center Ali Marpet (ankle), guard/center Evan Smith (back), linebacker Adarius Glanton (unknown) and receiver Donteaa Dye (ankle). On the other side, the Bengals can expect to be missing first round pick John Ross (shoulder), running back Giovani Bernard (knee), corner Dre Kirkpatrick (unknown), safety George Iloka (knee) and several other players.\n\nSpeaking of the Bucs playing the Bengals, hey, Terrance Newman.\n\nWith that being said, let's get into the matchups.\n\nThe Bucs kicking battle has been fairly even so far, with Roberto Aguayo only slightly edging out veteran Nick Folk for the job if I were to pick now. However, practice will not be weighed nearly as much as game action in the grand scheme of things and deciding who will be taking kicks for the Bucs Week 1. I'd expect Aguayo to handle the kicking duties as the \"first-team\" kicker in the first quarter, but the team makes it clear in their preliminary depth chart that it's an either/or type of deal, and unlike other positions, kicking isn't nearly affected as much as other positions based on whether or not you're going up against first, second, or third-stringers.\n\nWith the Bucs first and fourth outside corners on the depth chart in Brent Grimes and Jude Adjei-Barimah out tonight, it will be interesting to see how the substitutions end up playing out. The team has had veteran Cody Riggs and undrafted rookie Maurice Fleming working with the third team defense as the outside corners, so I'd expect one of them to step up and join second-year corner Ryan Smith with the first team. Smith, who's had a strong camp and has locked himself in now as the team's third boundary corner, will likely now play all of the first half in Cincinnati and will be tasked with dealing with a variety of the Bengals' weapons, including Tyler Boyd and Brandon LaFell. Boyd struggled after being a top 60 pick as a rookie and will look to have a big sophomore season in the reloaded Bengals offense. The team also has two Day 3 selections into receivers in the last two seasons in Josh Malone and Cody Core, who should both see significant playing time in the second quarter and on tonight.\n\nThe Bucs third round draft pick, drafted 97th overall, tore his ACL near the end of his college career but has quickly turned around in just eight months to position himself well to be the team's starting SAM linebacker alongside Lavonte David and Kwon Alexander. Beckwith has also been working with the second team as the MIKE linebacker behind Kwon Alexander and will likely see significant playing time tonight. With such a quick recovery from an ACL tear -- and not even wearing a brace in practice -- I'm hesitant to declare Beckwith 100% and will need to see that he's fully free-of-flow and ready to go tonight to make a final judgement.\n\nAlthough the top four receivers on the Bucs roster (Mike Evans, DeSean Jackson, Chris Godwin, Adam Humphries) appear to be locked in to make the roster, the fifth and/or sixth receiver spots are up in the air at the moment. The candidates on roster for now are Josh Huff, Derel Walker, Jesus \"Bobo\" Wilson, and Freddie Martino, with Shaq Hill, Donteaa Dye, and Bernard Reedy on the outside looking in for a roster spot. I think Huff and Walker are the most likely at this point, but that's just based off of training camp performance, which matters much less than how you do against your opponent in-game.\n\nSeveral months ago, the Bucs signed veteran backup Ryan Fitzpatrick to a one year, $4.5 million dollar deal. I praised the move at the time, saying that I saw Fitzpatrick as one of the most reliable and consistent backups in the league, even if he had been inconsistent at best as a starter for the Jets previously. However, Fitzpatrick has shown signs of steep decline in camp, often struggling to push the ball down the field or rely on his smarts as much as he once did. This has brought Ryan Griffin back into play for the team, a guy who was seen as out of a job with the Fitzpatrick signing. Griffin has been a tad disappointing considering the team carved out a roster spot as the third quarterback for him for two seasons and he hasn't done a whole lot to warrant or earn it, but he's now splitting the second team reps with Fitzpatrick in practice. It will be interesting to see how they stack up against each other tonight, and I expect each to play a little over a quarter with undrafted rookie Sefo Liufau finishing things off at the end of the fourth.", "timeCrawl": "01:21:00", "sim": 0.7019608020782471, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8728565", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "id": 25, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "id": 28, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "id": 30, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "id": 32, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "id": 36, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "id": 284, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

We knew he wasn't good, ever, but he'd had a few years where he played okay football, or at least managed to get okay results. Based on that, I thought he'd be a decent backup quarterback. But his performance agains the Cincinnati Bengals was shockingly terrible -- and not just in the stats.\n\nThose statistics were bad enough: Fitzpatrick completed 6 of 13 passes for 45 yards, a sack and an interception. But his play was worse: his passes came out slow, late, and inaccurately. The one redeeming factor was the ability to run a little, but that's not something you want to build an offense around.\n\nFitzpatrick has looked consistently terrible in training camp, too, which is why a third-year undrafted free agent in Ryan Griffin was genuinely competing with him, to the point of alternating drives with Fitzpatrick in the first preseason game. That is: until Griffin went down with a shoulder injury.\n\nThat injury will keep Griffin out for 'weeks', Koetter said, and that may very well be an understatement. Shoulder injuries tend to be really tough to recover from quickly, and it's Griffin's throwing shoulder, too.\n\nThat means the Bucs are stuckwith Fitzpatrick as their backup quarterback now, with undrafted rookie Sefo Liufau as the main competition -- but he doesn't really stand much of a chance. That should scare Bucs fans, and the front office: the team doesn't have much of a chance to win any games that Fitzpatrick is starting.\n\nThe Bucs aren't ready to say they're just going to give up games that Winston can't play in -- they didn't offer Mike Glennon an expensive long-term extension for no reason. Which means that they really should be investing a little more in their backup quarterback situation.\n\nUnfortunately for them, it's a little late to do anything about this problem. The only quarterback on the market who could realistically be an upgrade over Fitzpatrick is Colin Kaepernick. He's getting frozen out of the NFL because of his protests, and I wouldn't be surprised if that's part of why the Bucs haven't contacted him, too.\n\nThere have been some suggestions that he may not fit the Bucs' traditional dropback offense, given the schemes he played in in San Francisco, but I don't really buy that: Kaepernicks' a big, strong-armed, reasonably accurate quarterback -- exactly the type of player Koetter has often played with. His biggest issue is taking far too many sacks, and the accompanying fumbles, but he actually throws far fewer interceptions than the average quarterback.\n\nHonestly, at this point, not signing Kaepernick is pretty indefensible, at least from an on-field perspective. There is no way he's worse than Fitzpatrick. And right now, if anything were to happen to Jameis Winston for even a short amount of time, the Bucs would see their season go down the drain almost immediately.", "timeCrawl": "17:50:00", "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8949171", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "id": 284, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "id": 566, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Abstract", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Abstract", "id": 751, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "id": 1106, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Griffin is undergoing further evaluations today. It's unknown whether it will force him to miss playing time.\n\nFor Griffin, who enters his third season with a real chance to become the Bucs' No. 2 quarterback behind Jameis Winston, the timing couldn't be worse. Griffin has thrown the football very accurately in training camp and may have had a slight edge over Jets free agent veteran Ryan Fitzpatrick entering Friday's game. Alternating every series with Fitzpatrick after Winston left the game early in the second quarter, Griffin completed 4-of-9 passes for 57 yards but failed to produce any points prior to his injury.\n\n\"Yeah, I mean any injury is tough,'' Fitzpatrick said. \"You hate to see your teammates get injured or anyone get injured. Ryan was having an exceptional camp. He's been playing great, so that was tough to see him get an opportunity and then go down.''\n\nBucs coach Dirk Koetter said Griffin caught a bad break but was uncertain of his condition. \"(The competition) is close,'' Koetter said. \"Fitz (Ryan Fitzpatrick) looked like he played a lot of football, and of course, we wanted to see Griff play a lot. (His injury) was an unfortunate, freak thing. When he got hit, he fell on his shoulder and the guy landed on him. He still is being evaluated. It was unlucky for Griff and what we expected from Fitz. It was good to see Sefo (Liufau) get in there because he hasn't been getting a lot of reps.''\n\nSo what will the Bucs do now? A lot depends on whether Griffin can return before the end of the preseason. He still is eligible for the practice squad, but that would mean having to release him and hoping nobody signed him. Would the Bucs consider signing another quarterback? Before you start a campaign for Colin Kaepernick, consider that most teams only keep two quarterbacks and the combination of Winston-Fitzpatrick gerald is a good one.\n\nFitzpatrick still is getting used to the Bucs' system under Koetter but managed to produce a touchdown and field goal. \"I think it was nice to get into a game situation with Dirk calling the plays and figuring out the tempo and the pace that we're going to have,'' Fitzpatrick said. \"Making sure I'm operating the offense with the same procedure as Jameis. That's my been my goal and focus and something I've had to work on since I've been here because it's different than what I've experienced.''\n\nOn Friday, Koeter had Fitzpatrick and Griffin alternate every other series, which makes it difficult to get into rhythm. \"That's part of it,'' Fitzpatrick said. \"I've done it every which way, so I know you've always got to be ready to get in there and when you're in there, you've always got to take advantage of your opportunities.''", "timeCrawl": "06:17:00", "sim": 0.6509804129600525, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 26, "date": "2017-08-11", "textStart": 17}], "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8878690", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "id": 134, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "id": 284, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Athletes hoping to get frisky during the upcoming Olympic Games in Paris appeared to have their dreams dashed after organizers announced they were ordering the same \u201canti-sex\u201d beds used at the 2020 Tokyo Games. But the 16,000 modular mattresses made by Japanese company Airweave and sent to the City of Love ahead of the opening ceremony on July 26 are safe for sex, The Post can reveal. Photographs of the twin-size mattresses \u2014 made of polyethylene and set up on cardboard bed frames \u2014 recently raised eyebrows, with many speculating they were designed to deter any amorous activity. However, looks can be deceiving. Airweave US\u2019 Chief Operating Officer Brett Thornton told The Post that the cardboard frames are even \u201cdesigned far sturdier than typical wooden bed frames,\u201d meaning athletes can go for the gold on the mattresses night after night. When pressed to confirm whether or not the competitors can have sex on the beds, a rep for Thornton pointed to a statement originally given to the Japan Times by Airwave CEO Motokuni Takaoka. \u201cSex is sex, whether it\u2019s on our mattress or somebody else\u2019s,\u201d Takaoka told the publication. \u201cWe just wanted to create a mattress that is stronger than normal mattress. We\u2019re only focused on sleep; we\u2019re not concerned with anything else that happens on the bed.\u201d Airweave has been working with Olympic athletes since the 2008 Games in Beijing but became an official partner for the Tokyo Games in 2020. At that Games, organizers implemented an \u201cintimacy ban\u201d amid the COVID pandemic. The Airweave beds were subsequently dubbed \u201canti-sex\u201d \u2014 a term that gained traction given their twin size and the fact they were made of polyethylene. It\u2019s all about comfort \u2014 not kink While the Airweave mattresses may not look ideal for lovemaking, they are said to be surprisingly comfortable, ensuring every athlete gets seriously good sleep. Each mattress is comprised of three separate blocks that come in varying grades of firmness (firm, moderate and soft) so they can be customized for different body types. Upon arrival at the Olympic Village, each athlete will be scanned by an artificial intelligence-powered app so that they can have a mattress made to match their needs. For instance, most swimmers have a lean build, meaning their mattress will most likely be comprised of three soft blocks. Rugby players, on the other hand, have a build that usually requires a firm block in the middle. Seriously good sleep Airweave said that studies have shown that their mattress\u2019 polyethylene material \u201cpromotes deeper, quality sleep by allowing better distribution of weight, effortless turning and optimal spinal alignment.\u201d Meanwhile, the company claimed polyethylene has been \u201cscientifically proven\u201d to result in deep sleep that lasts 308% longer than that which occurs on a regular memory foam mattress. During the Tokyo Games, American fencer Katharine Holmes claimed that the mattresses were comfortable compared to other beds she had slept on while traveling for competitions. \u201cI don\u2019t wake up in the middle of the night in screaming agony,\u201d she stated, defending the Airweave products in an interview with Business Insider. Additionally, the mattress blocks are entirely washable and hypoallergenic, meaning there won\u2019t be any worry about bedbugs infesting the Olympic Village. That\u2019s of particular relief, given that Paris was plagued by the parasites last summer. Meanwhile, the mattresses are 100% recyclable, meaning they\u2019re perfect for Olympic organizers, who have sustainability at top of mind. \u201cI hope that Paris 2024\u2019s efforts to reduce its impact will show that it is possible to do things differently,\u201d Georgina Grenon, director of environmental excellence for the organizing committee, recently told the AFP. Wild sex \u2014 anywhere and everywhere While the Airweave mattress will withstand wild nights of sex, amorous athletes don\u2019t require beds to get bawdy. Over the years, stories about wild romps among Olympians have abounded in the media \u2014 and the sizzling sex sessions seemingly take place anywhere and everywhere. ESPN quoted one kinky competitor as saying they had sex on a balcony at the 2004 Games in Athens before being busted by a fellow athlete. Meanwhile, the Mirror reported that an orgy occurred among Olympians in a hot tub one year. The same publication also cited one two-time gold medalist as saying: \u201cI\u2019ve seen people having sex right out in the open. On the grass, between buildings, people are getting down and dirty.\u201d Organizers are anticipating that this year\u2019s competitors will be as horny as ever, ordering 300,000 condoms to be delivered to the Olympic Village alongside the Airweave beds.", "summary": "These amorous Olympians won't be getting gold medals for abstinence.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/05/29/lifestyle/the-surprising-truth-about-the-olympic-games-anti-sex-beds/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/2024-french-president-emmanuel-macron-82525493_3e6850.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/5k4YgJQ3-RyIcpnTz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:11:40", "author": "Andrew Court", "authors": ["Andrew Court"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.168}

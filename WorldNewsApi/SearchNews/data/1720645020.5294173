The Manchester United forward's run of participating in four straight international tournaments for England has come to an end this month after he was left out of Southgate's preliminary squad following a below-par season for his club. Despite his less-than-impressive campaign for the Red Devils, many thought he'd still possess a place in the Three Lions squad for the tournament this month considering how important he's been for the team during Southgate's reign. Ex-England international Jenas was among the section of individuals to question the call. But he admitted he wasn't \"surprised\" when finding out about the 26-year-old's omission. Speaking exclusively to Mirror Sport , the Match of the Day pundit suggested Rashford hasn't been shown the same level of leniency when it comes to form compared to his club team-mates Luke Shaw and Harry Maguire. Shaw will be going to Germany this summer, while Maguire was cut from the squad earlier this week. Speaking before the announcement. Jenas said: \"I mean, all you got to do is look at Luke Shaw, whether he just doesn't rely or like Ben Chilwell, I don't know, but he's picking Luke Shaw on the basis of what I don't know. They obviously feel they can rely on him in that capacity. \"So I think he's given the same kind of leniency towards Harry Maguire at times. Earlier on in the year when he was struggling with his form and he's done well for England. Jordan Pickford has probably had the same graces as well, so it's strange to me when I think about it more that for some reason Marcus' dip in form, has been more focused on and put more in line with.\" The 41-year-old believed Rashford's exploits for his country, which includes three goals at the 2022 World Cup, would have been enough to secure a place in Southgate's squad. \"I don't know anybody else who is trying to hit good form to get in the team,\" the ex-Spurs and Newcastle midfielder commented. \"I feel like Marcus would have been outside of that bracket of people that have to maintain form.\" Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

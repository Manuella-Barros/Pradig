{"id": 231382792, "title": "Taconite freighter headed to port after underwater collision on Lake Superior", "text": "A ship carrying iron ore across Lake Superior collided with something underwater Saturday morning, puncturing the vessel and allowing water inside, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The Michipicoten, a carrier ship longer than two football fields, began taking on water at 6:53 a.m., about 35 miles southwest of Isle Royale. At least 22 people were on board, the Coast Guard said, and half the crew members have safely evacuated. Coast Guard officials said pumps aboard the ship had removed some water on board. The freighter is now headed to a nearby port for inspection and repairs, accompanied by another bulk carrier, the Edwin H. Gott, and assisted by boat crews with the U.S. Coast Guard, Border Patrol and National Park Service. Officials say details about the collision and what caused it will be released after \"the situation is stabilized.\" The ship is carrying taconite, a low-grade iron ore often mined from the Mesabi Iron Range. According to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, such ships sail to Indiana, Ohio and other steel-making areas around the Great Lakes where the taconite is melted into steel. None of the taconite on board the Michipicoten was believed to have spilled so far. Isle Royale is about 20 miles east of Grand Portage, Minn., just south of the Canadian border. It's not immediately clear whether the ship was in Minnesota or Michigan waters when the collision occurred. This is a developing story. Check back for further details as they become available.", "summary": "The Michipicoten was carrying iron ore when it struck something southwest of Isle Royale, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.", "url": "https://www.startribune.com/freighter-ship-taking-on-water-after-underwater-collision-on-lake-superior/600372045/", "image": "https://arc.stimg.co/startribunemedia/IGRLWEK2ZJF5DHXDD65BQZRDVU.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:15:49", "author": "Kyeland Jackson,Star Tribune", "authors": ["Kyeland Jackson", "Star Tribune"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.018}

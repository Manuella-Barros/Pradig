Police then instructed him to leave the area or risk being arrested. He left, but while walking away, he yelled \"obscenities to the occupants of the vessel,\" a Miami Beach Police arrest affidavit read.\n\nHowever, a short time later, he returned to the marina and headed back to the yacht, before officers caught up with him.\n\nScott is reported as speaking to one sergeant and \"becoming erratic\" and \"disturbing the peace of the occupants of the marina and nearby residential buildings causing public disturbance,\" the arrest affidavit added, before he was taken into custody.\n\nWATCH THE TRAILER FOR 'AM I RACIST?' -- A MATT WALSH COMEDY ON DEI\n\n\"Mr. Scott was briefly detained due to a misunderstanding,\" his legal rep Bradford Cohen told NBC News. \"There was absolutely no physical altercation involved, and we thank the authorities for working with us towards a swift and amicable resolution.\"\n\nLater, Scott took to X and wrote about his arrest, noting his European tour was still on. The rapper also posted on his Instagram story about the arrest, including a picture of his mugshot and a second post using his mugshot, but edited to include him wearing headphones and sunglasses.\n\nScott shares two children with \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians\" star Kylie Jenner: Stormi, 6, and Aire, 2.

The footage, obtained by NBC6, shows Scott yelling at people on a yacht, leading to his arrest for disorderly intoxication and trespassing.\n\nThe incident took place on June 20 at the Miami Beach marina, where police found Scott standing on a dock, reportedly intoxicated, and shouting at people aboard a nearby yacht. Despite officers' attempts to calm him down, Scott continued to yell, even after being asked to leave. As he walked away, he returned shortly after and began yelling again, disturbing others in the area.\n\nAccording to the arrest report, Scott responded to officers' questions about his behavior with, \"It's Miami,\" before being handcuffed and taken into custody. He was later released from Miami-Dade County Jail after posting a $650 bond.\n\nMonths later, prosecutors decided to drop the disorderly intoxication charge against Scott. However, he still faces a charge of trespassing after warning. Scott's attorney, Bradford Cohen, maintained that the arrest stemmed from a misunderstanding, emphasizing that no physical altercation took place.\n\nIn a lighthearted response to the situation, Scott posted \"Lol\" on X (formerly Twitter) and humorously edited his mugshot on his Instagram story, adding sunglasses and earbuds.

The musician reportedly landed in police custody at around 5 am on Friday after an altercation erupted inside George V Hotel near the Champs-\u00c9lyse\u00e9s. A police source confirmed that when they arrived at the location, they met Scott in a heated brawl with his bodyguard. According to French news site Valeurs Actuelles, the Utopia singer was intoxicated at the time of the confrontation. The authorities quickly took the hip-hop artist into custody. However, they couldn't question Travis Scott after his arrest as he wasn't in the right condition. Instead, they placed him in a cell, where the police source revealed, \"he is still sobering up.\"\n\nTravis Scott's Paris arrest comes after the police arrested the rapper in Miami in June. His arrest was for causing a disturbance on a yacht. At the time, Miami Beach Police Department officers reported that Scott was drunk while causing the ruckus. The rapper was asked to leave multiple times but remained adamant. Eventually, they arrested him, even though he appeared erratic, yelling obscenities.\n\nUltimately, Scott spent some time at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center. The authorities later released him on a $650 bond, which worked out as $500 for the trespass charge and $150 for disorderly intoxication.\n\nAfter his release, Scott's mugshot went viral, showing him bleary-eyed. The 33-year-old cared less about the photo as he shared it online, mocking it with the caption, \"lol.\" A few days later, Scott released a T-shirt with the mugshot printed. Meanwhile, TMZ confirmed that prosecutor officials dropped the disorderly intoxication charge against Scott at a hearing in Miami on Thursday, which the rapper didn't attend. However, the state of Florida is still looking to pursue the misdemeanor trespassing charge. As such, Scott will reportedly return to court on September 10, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "thenerdstash.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nerd Stash"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chukwudi_onyewuchi@thenerdstash.com", "name": "Chukwudi Onyewuchi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_V", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Utopia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyguard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bodyguard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Beach_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trespass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mug_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mug shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substance intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.thenerdstash.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Travis-Scott-.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802956", "eventUri": "eng-9802956", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-09-", "textStart": 1919, "textEnd": 1931}], "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Less than two months ago, Scott was arrested in Miami Beach on charges of misdemeanor trespassing and public intoxication.\n\nThe incident occurred on June 20 at a marina, where Scott, who has kids Stormi and Aire with ex Kylie Jenner, was reportedly trying to retrieve belongings he had left on a boat.\n\nIn bodycam footage from that arrest, released by TMZ, he can be heard telling police officers that he was not carrying any weapons and only wanted to \"secure\" his property.\n\nHe expressed frustration with the situation, stating: \"This is a waste of y'all's time right now.\"\n\nScott explained that he initially left the area without his belongings because he felt intimidated by the large police presence, but later returned to retrieve them. He admitted that the stress of the situation caused him to misspeak, insisting: \"[There's] 50 cops around me, bro!\"\n\nA statement to the PA news agency from the Miami Beach Police Department said at the time: \"The Miami Beach Police Department confirms the arrest of Mr Jacques Webster, DOB 4/30/1991, on June 20, 2024, at approximately 1.44am.\n\n\"Mr Webster was taken into custody following an incident at the Miami Beach Marina located at 300 Alton Road.\"\n\nFollowing the Miami incident Scott faced a disorderly intoxication charge, which was dropped during a hearing.\n\nHowever, the state of Florida is still pursuing the misdemeanor trespassing charge, with a trial date set for September 10.\n\nAfter his Miami arrest, Scott posted a bond of $650 (\u00a3512), covering both the trespassing and the now-dropped disorderly intoxication charges.\n\nIn response to his recent legal troubles, Scott has remained nonchalant, even taking to social media to poke fun at the situation.\n\nAfter news of his Miami arrest broke, he posted a simple \"Lol\" on X and humorously edited his mugshot by adding sunglasses and headphones, sharing the altered image on his Instagram

However, he's still facing a charge of trespassing after warning.\n\nMiami Beach Police said they responded to the city's marina on June 20 and found Scott standing on the dock yelling at people on the ship. Officers told him to sit down, but he kept standing back up and yelling. They could smell alcohol on his breath, police said. The man who called police did not want to press charges, so Scott was allowed to leave.\n\nAs he walked away, however, Scott kept turning to yell obscenities at people on the yacht. He left as a passenger in a waiting car, but returned five minutes later and ignored officers' orders to again leave, police said in the arrest report.\n\nOfficers say he then began yelling again, disturbing people in nearby boats and buildings. When officers asked if he had been drinking, he replied, \"It's Miami.\" He was arrested.\n\nPolice body camera footage obtained by NBC6 on Thursday shows a witness telling a responding police officer that Scott was \"getting aggressive and pushing everyone.\"\n\nWhen officers approach Scott at the marina, the rapper starts speaking with officers after the captain of the boat called police, claiming a fight broke out on the yacht.\n\n\"I rented this boat, the owners came on this boat. They kicked down my door at 12 o'clock. I don't know what's going on, ask him,\" Scott tells the officers, adding, \"There was no fighting involved.\"\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, Scott is heard yelling at people on the yacht while police instruct him to walk away.\n\n\"This my gang. This my gang right here. Everybody with me, 12 with me on the hood,\" he says.\n\nAt one point, Scott approaches an officer and gets into an argument. He's then put in handcuffs, with officers telling him that he's causing a disturbance.\n\nScott was released from Miami-Dade County Jail after posting a $650 bond. The rapper later poked fun at the arrest after bonding out, posting \"Lol\" on X and adding sunglasses and earbuds to his mugshot on his Instagram story.\n\nHis attorney, Bradford Cohen, said in a statement at the time that Scott was \"detained due to a misunderstanding.\"\n\n\"There was absolutely no physical altercation involved, and we thank the authorities for working with us towards a swift and amicable resolution,\" Cohen said.", "source": {"uri": "nbcmiami.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 6 South Florida"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacht", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yacht"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(armed_forces)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (armed forces)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Cohen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bradford Cohen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mug_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mug shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handcuffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Handcuffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami-Dade_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami-Dade County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami-Dade County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://media.nbcmiami.com/2024/08/travis-scott-miami-beach-yacht-arrest-bodycam.png?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802956", "eventUri": "eng-9802956", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 420, "textEnd": 427}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Come on, bruh,\" the rapper was heard saying.\n\nEarlier this week, TMZ reported that the disorderly intoxication charge against the rapper has been dropped by the state.\n\nScott was not in attendance at the legal proceedings.\n\nHowever, he is still facing a misdemeanor trespassing charge and is due to be in court on Sept. 10.\n\nThe Post has reached out to Scott's reps for comment.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trespass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacht", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yacht"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicko_Mode", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sicko Mode"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handcuffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Handcuffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goosebumps_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goosebumps (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substance intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-ds6504fs6-1723190792663.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1723176537&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802956", "eventUri": "eng-9802956", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 340, "textEnd": 347}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-10", "textStart": 3681, "textEnd": 3689}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

In June, the singer was embroiled in a yacht altercation.\n\nAlthough his charge for disorderly intoxication during that incident has since been dropped, Scott still faces a trespassing charge.\n\nThe June incident saw Kylie Jenner's ex initially detained at Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Centre after being arrested for causing a \"disturbance\" on a charter boat at the Miami Beach Marina.\n\nJoin the Daily Record's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\nAt the time, Miami Beach Police Department officers stated he was \"drunk causing a disturbance, and asked to leave multiple times.\"\n\nScott, whose real name is Jacques Bermon Webster, was released on a $650 bond (\u00a3512). This was calculated as $500 (\u00a3394) for the trespass charge and $150 (\u00a3118) for disorderly intoxication.\n\nWhen his mugshot was made public at the time, he looked visibly weary.

The arrest took place in the lobby of the luxury hotel George V, in the eighth district of the French capital, where the artist is staying to enjoy the Olympic Games. A police source, to which the French newspaper Le Parisien has had access, revealed that it was precisely the hotel employees who called the police due to \"acts of violence against a receptionist.\" According to some media, Travis Scott was drunk when the incident occurred, so he could not be questioned at first.\n\nThe same source told French media that the Texan rapper was under the influence of alcohol not only at the time of the arrest, but throughout the time he was in police custody. The police arrived at 5 a.m. at the hotel, which is located a few meters from the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in the French capital. In the videos of the arrest posted on social media, the artist is seen to be intoxicated as officers put him in the police car in handcuffs. The rapper has already been released, according to local media. The last time he was seen publicly was on Thursday night during the Olympic basketball semi-final between the United States and Serbian, which the former won by 95-91.\n\nAfter the exciting match that took the U.S. team to the Olympic final, Scott went partying, as can still be seen in the stories of his Instagram account, which has 57 million followers. In the daily bulletin on the main events that occurred during the Olympic Games, the Paris Prosecutor's Office has specified that the investigation into Scott is being carried out by the first district of the Judicial Police.\n\nThis is not the first time Travis Scott has been arrested. In June, the famous rapper -- also widely known for being the ex-partner of Kylie Jenner, the youngest of the Kardashian sisters and with whom he has two children -- was arrested in Miami for trespassing and disorderly intoxication. Authorities were alerted to an incident on a yacht, which appeared to be a fight. When they arrived, according to an affidavit obtained by People magazine, Scott was \"yelling at the vessel occupants.\"\n\n\"Officers made contact with [Scott] to conduct an investigation,\" the affidavit reads. \"The defendant was asked by officers to sit down, at which point [he] temporarily sat down and then began continuously standing back up, disregarding officers' commands. Throughout the interaction, officers on scene could sense a strong smell of alcohol coming from the defendants' breath.\"\n\nThe owners of the yacht did not want to press charges, they only asked the rapper to get off the boat, and leave the dock. The police also asked Jacques Bermon Webster II -- the artist's real name -- to leave. But according to the affidavit, during the walk from the vessel to the boardwalk, Scott walked backwards and yelled \"obscenities\" to the occupants of the yacht. In the end, he had to pay a fine of $150 for disorderly intoxication and $500 for the trespassing.\n\nThe rapper's shows are known for being chaotic and disorderly. His most tragic show took place November 2021, when an avalanche killed 10 people and injured dozens more during his performance at the Astroworld festival in Houston. Security forces, who had a 56-page plan (and 20 ambulances at the gate, although more than 60 were needed) were unable to deal with what happened to the 50,000 attendees. Nearly 60 lawsuits were filed. Scott did not face criminal charges, but remains implicated in the civil cases because of poor organization of the event.\n\nJust a week ago, the artist was seen on the streets of Madrid, where he gave two concerts at the WiZink Center as part of his Circus Maximus World Tour. For the moment, the tour is set to end on February 4, 2025, in Munich, Germany, but the rapper is expected to announce new dates. His album Utopia became the best-selling hip hop release of 2023, remaining firmly at number 1 on the Billboard Top 200 for four consecutive weeks, and receiving more than 50 billion streams worldwide.", "source": {"uri": "english.elpais.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EL PA\u00cdS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "el_pais@english.elpais.com", "name": "El Pa\u00eds", "type": "author",

arrested in June for disorderly conduct.\n\nA number of Miami Beach officers had attended the marina just after 1am on June 20 in relation to reports of fighting after a yacht owner reportedly told the rapper to get off his boat.\n\nPolice reportedly found Scott \"yelling at people\" and \"disturbing the peace\" and refused to comply with the officers.\n\nHe was subsequently taken into custody for disorderly intoxication and trespassing.\n\nScott is bringing his Circus Maximus Tour to Australia in October, kicking off his concerts down under at Allianz Stadium in Sydney before lighting up the Marvel Stadium in Melbourne.\n\nThe 33-year-old became embroiled in controversy however in 2021 after 10 fans died at his Astroworld Festival in Houston in what authorities ruled as a \"massive crowd surge\".\n\nTens of thousands of festivalgoers rushed towards the stage when Scott appeared for his performance, which left fans pressed so tightly together they were left unable to breathe.\n\nLocal police said at the time that hundreds of people were injured after falling, passing out or being trampled during the crowd rush.\n\nScott faced heavy criticism for failing to stop the concert, but his lawyer maintained the rapper was unaware of the tragedy unfolding in the audience.\n\nHe did not face any criminal charges over the incident.", "source": {"uri": "skynews.com.au",

Known off-stage as Jacques Bermon Webster, he had faced the charge after a chaotic night involving yacht staff.\n\nWhile this development brings some relief, Scott remains embroiled in other legal challenges, including a lawsuit related to the tragic 2021 Astroworld Festival.\n\nTravis Scott's road to legal redemption is far from over, despite the dismissal of the disorderly intoxication charge.\n\nThe 33-year-old, who was absent from Thursday's Miami court hearing, still faces a misdemeanor trespassing charge, with a trial date set for September 10.\n\nThe incident in question occurred in June when police were called to a Miami Beach marina after reports of Scott allegedly engaging in a heated argument with a yacht worker.\n\nWhile the disorderly charge has been dismissed, the state of Florida is pressing forward with the trespassing accusation, per TMZ.\n\nAt the time of the incident, police initially escorted Scott away, allowing him to leave, but the rapper returned, insisting he needed to retrieve something from the yacht.\n\nHowever, after officers intercepted him, they claimed he became antagonistic, after which they placed him in handcuffs.\n\nScott's legal troubles took a dramatic turn with his arrest in June. The father-of-two appeared emotionless in his mugshot, taken shortly after his arrest in Miami.\n\nThe Blast reported that the star was booked into the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center around 4:35 a.m. but quickly posted bail. He secured his release with a $650 bond -- $500 for a trespassing charge and $150 for disorderly intoxication.\n\nThe arrest mugshot revealed a strikingly emotionless expression from the \"Sicko Mode\" rapper. While the incident undoubtedly disrupted his schedule, the timing could not have been worse.\n\nJust days after his arrest,the highly anticipated Circus Maximus stadium tour was set to kick off in the Netherlands.This marked a significant return to the stage for the rapper, who has been under intense scrutiny since the tragic Astroworld Festival.\n\nScott's recent legal challenges are just the latest in a string of issues. Last November, Scott was accused of failing to pay over $100,000 in taxes for 2021, leading to a lien from the state's Franchise Tax Board.\n\nThe agency warned that interest and fees would continue to accumulate until the debt was settled. This financial setback came just weeks after another lawsuit linked to Astroworld surfaced.\n\nA company named Ceremony of Roses (COR) accused Scott and concert organizer Live Nation of \"negligence and willful misconduct.\" The organization claimed they lost significant investments that should have been recouped from festival revenue.\n\nScott and other Astroworld Festival organizers are gradually closing a difficult chapter in their lives. Three years after the tragic event, nine of the ten wrongful death lawsuits against Scott have been settled.\n\nThe Blast reported in May that the most recent case involved the family of Madison Dubiski, but they resolved their lawsuit just before jury selection began.\n\nWhile the terms of the agreement remain confidential due to a gag order, both sides have expressed relief and a desire to move forward. Live Nation's attorney, Neal Manne, confirmed the settlements during a court hearing but could not reveal all the details.\n\nThe Dubiski family's attorney Noah Wexler, noted that everything had been \"resolved in its entirety.\" Scott's representative, Ted Anastasiou, also expressed gratitude for the resolution. He added:\n\n\"The confidential agreement will honor Madison Dubiski's legacy and promote improvements for concert safety.\"\n\nThe tragic death of 9-year-old Ezra Blount at the 2021 Astroworld Festival continues to cast a long shadow. His family's wrongful death lawsuit is the last remaining case from the devastating event.\n\nWhile the Blount family's legal team is eager to proceed to trial, other parties involved, including Live Nation, are seeking more time to prepare their defense.\n\nThe case has now become a focal point for Judge Kristen Hawkins, who is considering prioritizing it over the numerous injury lawsuits stemming from the concert.\n\nHawkins is expected to address the Blount case and other related lawsuits in an upcoming hearing. She is making it clear that if a settlement is not reached, the Blount trial will likely be the next to unfold.\n\nWith over 4,000 plaintiffs and hundreds of lawsuits filed, the Astroworld tragedy has created a complex legal landscape. The outcome of the Blount case could set a precedent for the remaining litigation.\n\nWill Travis Scott emerge victorious in all his legal woes, or will the hammer of justice strike hard on one of the charges?", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors": [{"uri": "afouda_bamidele@theblast.com", "name": "Afouda Bamidele", "type": "author", "isAgency":

According to Valeurs Actuelles and Le Parisien, the two men got into an altercation at 5 a.m. local time in Paris' 8th arrondissement. Police sources who spoke with the media said the hip-hop artist was arrested for \"acts of violence\" against his bodyguard while under the influence of alcohol.\n\nNewsweek emailed a spokesperson for Scott for comment on Friday.\n\nScott, who has two children with reality star Kylie Jenner, has been in the capital city for the Olympic Games. On Thursday evening, he was spotted watching the basketball semifinal between the U.S. and Serbia. Going into the final quarter, the U.S. trailed Serbia by 13 points but eventually won 95-91.\n\nThe night of the game, Scott posted to X (formerly Twitter) asking for basketball legend LeBron James to source him an Olympic jersey. He wrote: \"Some body tell @KingJames I need Olympic jerzzzz.\"\n\nAt the time of writing, the post had been viewed more than 1.1 million times.\n\n\"That game was f****** wilddddddd,\" he wrote in a follow-up post, which has almost 900,000 views.\n\nThis isn't Scott's first run-in with the law; during the early hours in the morning on June 20, he was arrested in Miami on disorderly intoxication and trespassing charges.\n\nIn an email sent to Newsweek, the Miami Beach Police Department \"confirmed the arrest of Mr. Jacques Webster, D.O.B 4/30/1991, on June 20, 2024, at approximately 1:44 a.m.\"\n\nPolice officers were called regarding a disturbance at the marina, with the incident occurring at 12:44 a.m. As per the arrest form affidavit seen by Newsweek, the complainant said that people were fighting on a yacht. Upon arrival, police witnessed Scott \"standing by the dock yelling at the vessel occupants.\"\n\nOfficers on the scene could \"sense a strong smell of alcohol coming from the defendant's breath.\" Scott admitted to police that he had been drinking alcohol, saying: \"It's Miami.\"\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the case who spoke to Newsweek, there \"was no physical altercation with anyone. This was a rowdy party and Travis was already bailed out for a few hundred dollars. He is already home. There will be no further action to be taken as it was a minor incident akin to receiving a ticket with no injuries.\"\n\nIn a statement shared with Newsweek, Scott's legal representative Bradford Cohen said: \"Mr. Scott was briefly detained due to a misunderstanding. There was absolutely no physical altercation involved, and we thank the authorities for working with us toward a swift and amicable resolution.\"\n\nSeveral hours later, Scott reacted to the arrest via X, writing \"lol [laugh out loud].\" He followed up the post with a message to fans that he still plans on going hard on tour.\n\n\"6 days to circus Maximus tour,\" Scott wrote. \"For the record I'm going.

Kylie Jenner's ex had initially been held at Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Centre after being arrested for causing a \"disturbance\" on a charter boat at the Miami Beach Marina.\n\nAt the time, Miami Beach Police Department officers said he was \"drunk causing a disturbance, and asked to leave multiple times.\" Scott, whose real name is Jacques Bermon Webster, was released on a $650 bond (\u00a3512). This was worked out as $500 (\u00a3394) for the trespass charge and $150 (\u00a3118) for disorderly intoxication.\n\nThe police department told 7 News Miami Scott was arrested after he had refused to leave the charter boat. His mugshot was also shared by Miami Dade Corrections facility.\n\nNow, according to TMZ, prosecutors officially dropped the disorderly intoxication charge against him at a hearing in Miami on Thursday. It's reported the star didn't appear in court for the hearing.\n\nAt the hearing, it was confirmed the state of Florida was set to push on with the misdemeanour trespassing charge against him and the singer is set to go to trial on September 10.\n\nThe yacht incident came shortly after Scott was said to have been involved in a bust-up with Kylie Jenner's ex Tyga's friend at a party in Cannes. Scott and Alexander 'AE' Edwards reportedly got into a scuffle in the French destination.\n\nThe celebrities were at Richie Akiva's famed 'The After' bash during the Cannes Film Festival when tensions reportedly flared near to the DJ's booth. It was reported in May that Scott and his friend Southside clashed with AE, who is friends with Tyga, Kylie Jenner's ex who is the mother of Travis' children.\n\nA source told Page Six at the time: \"Models were flying everywhere in the melee. Someone got hit with an ice bucket.\" Another insider told the publication the incident occurred after Scot was said to be upset at a shoutout given to Tyga and Edwards.\n\nThe second source said: \"The history [with Kylie] is there [but] it's not like that's necessarily what was the cause [of this fight].\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and

arrest.\n\nThe rapper has been in trouble with the law several times over the last few years with wild footage, exclusively obtained by The U.S. Sun, showing him being hauled away while he shouts in

\"erratic\" and \"yelling.\"\n\nAfter the arrest, Scott mocked his own bleary-eyed mug shot on as he posted it online with the caption \"lol\".\n\nDays later, he released a T-shirt with his mugshot

Scott wrapped up his look with a brown mini purse, seemingly matching his lady friend's red mini purse.\n\nThe mystery lady looked stunning in a mini skirt, crop top, and Team USA jacket. She concealed her eyes behind dark shades and kept a fair distance from the rapper in the shots.\n\nScott's auspicious outing falls around the dismissal of the disorderly intoxication charge he was charged with in June in Miami.\n\nThe Blast noted that the dismissal of his disorderly case was only one part of his victory. The rapper is still in court for a misdemeanor trespassing charge.\n\nA new trial date for his trespassing case has been set for September 10. The incident occurred in Miami in June when police arrived at a Miami Beach marina.\n\nLocal authorities appeared on the scene following a call about Scott allegedly engaging in a heated argument with a yacht staff.\n\nThe rapper was led off the scene by the cops and was allowed to leave, but he returned to the spot, claiming he left an important item on the yacht.\n\nHe was restricted by the officers but reportedly became irritable and struggled to get out of their grip, which prompted them to place him in handcuffs.\n\nThe rapper was also embroiled in a tax debt of over $100,000 last November. The huge sum came from his owed taxes for 2021, which had now led to a lien from the state's Franchise Tax Board.\n\nThe board warned the artist of accumulating interest on the sum if he failed to settle the debt and there has been no new development on the status of the payment yet.\n\nScott's money woes surfaced weeks after a lawsuit connected to Astroworld by a certain Ceremony of Roses company emerged.\n\nThe company accused the \"Highest In The Room\" rapper and show organizer Live Nation of \"negligence and willful misconduct.\"\n\nCeremony of Roses company added that they lost huge investments that should have been recouped in profits from the festival revenue back in 2021.\n\nHowever, nine out of the ten wrongful death lawsuits against the artist have been settled, with the most recent involving Madison Dubiski, who took the settlement route before the jury selection.\n\nLive Nation's attorney confirmed that the settlement occurred during a court hearing but the terms of the agreement remained confidential due to a gag order.\n\nThe Dubiski family also expressed their desire to move forward and stated that everything had been resolved amicably. Scott's attorney was grateful for the resolution and promised that the confidential agreement would \"honor Madison Dubiski's legacy and promote improvements for concert safety.\"\n\nBefore they officially parted ways, the famous couple left fans with a trail of hints about the status of their relationship.\n\nThe Blast shared that Scott's pictures disappeared from Jenner's Instagram profile, and the rapper himself was not physically present at the Kardashian-Jenner Christmas Eve party in 2022.\n\nThe last time the influencer posted her relationship was on November 28th, 2022, and the post gathered over 12 million likes with thousands of comments from their fans and celebrity pals.\n\nInstead, Jenner spent quality time with her best friend, Stassie Karanikolaou, and shared snapshots of them on social media, fueling different theories among their fans and followers.\n\nThe pair were on very different pages before parting ways for good despite sharing two children together.\n\nAn inside source declared that \"Kylie was very focused on her kids and her business\" and does not like to party the way Scott does.\"\n\n\"They definitely have different focuses. They always did,\" continued the insider, who explained further that their relationship was never easy, and Jenner flipped out any time cheating rumors surfaced.\n\nThe last cheating rumor that rocked the duo's boat emerged in October 2022, and they seemingly did not make it past a few months after that.\n\nLegal troubles or not, Travis Scott just wants to live life!", "source": {"uri":

cops.\n\nFootage of Scott at the Bercy Arena showed him alongside pal Quavo as the duo screamed and shouted as they watched the US progress to the final.\n\nHe can be seen jumping on his seat and even lifting up his top in the viral celebrations.\n\nAfter returning to his five star hotel in Paris, Scott was then reportedly seen getting into an altercation with his own bodyguard.\n\nThe rapper was said to have been intoxicated when the brawl erupted inside the George V hotel near the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.\n\nCops were called shortly after as Scott was hauled into custody, a police source told Valeurs Actuelles.\n\nAn investigating source later revealed the rapper was still feeling the effects of his drink hours after his arrest.\n\nThey said: \"He was not in the right condition to be questioned straight away, so was put in a cell where he is still sobering up.\"\n\nLawyers for Scott are yet to comment on his arrest.\n\nThe rapper has been in trouble with the law several times over the last few years with wild footage, exclusively obtained by The U.S. Sun, showing him being hauled away while he shouts in disbelief.\n\nIt followed his arrest for disorderly intoxication and trespassing in June.\n\nA police report said he was \"walking backward and yelling obscenities\" while handcuffed and appeared \"erratic\" and \"yelling.\"\n\nAfter the arrest, Scott mocked his own bleary-eyed mug shot on as he posted it online with the caption \"lol\".\n\nDays later, he released a T-shirt with his mugshot printed on it.\n\nTravis will reportedly be going back to court on September 10.\n\nThe Astroworld artist has also been arrested twice for provoking his audiences to rush the stage in defiance of security measures.\n\nThe 30-year-old musician pleaded guilty to public disorder charges at concerts in 2015 and 2018.\n\nOnce at Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago before again three years later at Scott's first Astroworld Festival in 2018.\n\nTravis is well known for his rap career as well as being the father of Kylie Jenner's, 26, two children Stormi, 6, and Aire, 2.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

'This is a waste of y'all's time right now.'\n\nHe told them he initially left without getting his possessions because he was 'scared' by the vast presence of police, while one of the officers reminded the rapper he had told them he hadn't left anything on the boat.\n\nHe insisted he misspoke due to the stress of the situation, adding: '[There's] 50 cops around me, bro!'\n\nOn Thursday, the Sicko Mode rapper also had a disorderly intoxication charge dropped in relation to the incident following a hearing.\n\nHowever, the state of Florida is still looking to pursue the misdemeanor trespassing charge, with a trial set to start on September 10.\n\nMetro.co.uk understands Scott - who has kids Stormi and Aire with ex Kylie Jenner - attended a 'rowdy party', although no one was involved in any physical altercation.\n\nA statement to the PA news agency from the Miami Beach Police Department said: 'The Miami Beach Police Department confirms the arrest of Mr Jacques Webster, DOB 4/30/1991, on June 20, 2024, at approximately 1.44 a.m.\n\n'Mr Webster was taken into custody following an incident at the Miami Beach Marina located at 300 Alton Road.'\n\nAfter his arrest, it is understood he paid a $650 (\u00a3512) bond, comprising $500 (\u00a3394) for the trespass charge and $150 (\u00a3118) for disorderly intoxication.\n\nShortly after Scott's arrest was reported, he wrote on X: 'Lol.'

arrested after drunken fight with bodyguard at Paris...", "body": "Rapper Travis Scott has been arrested in Paris for getting into a drunken brawl with his bodyguard hours after he sat courtside to watch Team USA at the Olympics, according to local reports.\n\nThe \"Butterfly Effect\" hitmaker, 33, was detained by police early Friday following a boozy night out in the French capital with his entourage, local outlet Le Parisien reports.\n\nThe heated exchange between Scott, whose real name is Jacques Webster, and his bodyguard -- which reportedly turned physical -- took place at the luxury Four Seasons Hotel George V hotel in the city's posh 8th arrondissement.\n\nScott, who is currently staying at the celeb hotspot during the 2024 Olympics, returned to the hotel late Thursday night before getting involved in a fight with a member of his team, law enforcement sources told the outlet.\n\n\"He was not in the right condition to be questioned straight away, so was put in a cell where he is still sobering up,\" an insider told the outlet.\n\nThe rapper, who was reportedly under the influence at the time of the ordeal, was arrested just after 5 a.m. local time, with officers saying he was still \"sobering up\" in his jail cell before a round of questioning.\n\nPolice were called to the hotel -- located just moments away from the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es -- after reports of \"acts of violence against a receptionist,\" sources said.\n\nThe \"Sicko mode\" hitmaker, who shares two kids with ex-girlfriend Kylie Jenner, is currently in Paris for the Olympic Games.\n\nScott joined his pal and fellow rapper Quavo and Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin front row at the USA-Serbia basketball semi-final late Thursday.\n\nThe trio were displaying a range of emotions during the nail-biting match-up, which saw Team USA's men's basketball team overcome a double-digit deficit in the fourth and advance to Saturday's final against France.\n\nThe 10-time Grammy nominee's arrest comes just one day after bodycam footage from his Miami Beach trespassing arrest on June 20 was released.\n\nIn the video, Scott told police officers he was \"scared\" by their large presence after officers responded to a report of people fighting on a yacht and found Scott standing by the dock and yelling at the occupants of one of the boats.\n\nScott was then taken into custody in connection with misdemeanor trespassing and public intoxication, the latter charge has since been dropped.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [],

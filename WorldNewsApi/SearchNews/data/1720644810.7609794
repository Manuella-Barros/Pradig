LSU gymnast Olivia Dunne and Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce star together in a new social media skit tied to Accelerator Active Energy, which incorporates a fun nod to Kelce's girlfriend, Taylor Swift. On Friday June 7, Dunne uploaded the clip to Instagram and TikTok, in which the athletic pair mouthed some dialogue from Tim Robinson's I Think You Should Leave \u2014 particularly dialogue from a dating show skit where one contestant in particular wouldn't stop using a zipline. \"I feel like you're just here for the zipline,\" Kelce, 34, says, before Dunne responds: \"What?\" But instead of ziplines, Dunne, 21, put the following text over the video: \"I feel like you're just here for concert tickets?\" \"Who me?! Never\u2026,\" Dunne jokingly captioned the footage, along with the hashtags \"#swiftie,\" \"#taylorswift,\" and \"#traviskelce.\" Both Dunne and Kelce aren't just a random link-up, either, as the Accelerator Active Energy Instagram account had posted a series of promotional photos of the two posing with beverages from the brand earlier on Friday, June 7. The athletes have also previously partnered with Accelerator, per its website, while Men's Journal noted that Kelce became an investor in the brand last year, along with his brother Jason. Travis, currently in his off-season, gave Dunn a shout-out when he appeared on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America earlier this week. \"I got Livy Dunn in the building. LSU gymnast. Absolutely just an awesome person. She\u2019s down there making Accelerator look just amazing,\" Travis told GMA. Meanwhile, just last month, Dunne caught up with PEOPLE about the LSU NCAA gymnastics championship win \u2014 when her LSU Tigers bested Florida, California and Utah \u2014 on April 20. \"The first thing I did was start crying right after we won,\" Dunne said. \"I just felt like my team's hard work had finally paid off, just four years of working so hard towards a common goal.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \"I think it's so special to have a group of young women all have a common goal in mind and then work to reach that goal and then win,\" she added. \"That is so rewarding.\" After the win, Dunne added that she gave her mom \"a big hug\" and called up boyfriend and MLB prospect Paul Skenes, also 21. \"I just wanted to fill him in on what just happened because I know he just won a national championship at LSU. He understands all the feelings so I just wanted to call him and just tell him what it was like,\" she said. Dunne also revealed that she often \"pushes aside\" a majority of her work obligations outside of gymnastics during the actual season, so things start picking up during the current off season \u2014 but here's to hoping those Eras Tour tickets work out! \"I'm just so busy during the season and then it kind of starts to pile up during my summers. So right now I'm starting to get to the point where it's piling up a bit, but I'm going to balance it all and I'm going to make everything work between going and seeing Paul, working and relaxing.\" During his GMA chat, Travis also spoke about how he's handling worldwide attention amid his romance with Swift, 34. \"When you have good family and friends around you, it makes that aspect in life that much easier,\" he said. Later in the discussion, he added: \"I\u2019m so fortunate, so grateful of everything that come my way in life. I feel like I\u2019m on top of the mountain, even after winning the Super Bowl and having the off-season that I\u2019m having. Living the dream, baby,\"", "summary": "The LSU gymnast shared a fun clip she and Kelce had been filming while working with Accelerator Active Energy", "url": "https://people.com/travis-kelce-and-olivia-dunne-nod-to-taylor-swift-in-new-skit-8660486", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/yhjq4qmpBGwt5nJaoRm618kHZHw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(746x186:748x188)/travis-kelce-olivia-dunne-060824-7957187efa9b42a19b217c9bb2b825e7.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:30:12", "author": "Brenton Blanchet", "authors": ["Brenton Blanchet"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.06}

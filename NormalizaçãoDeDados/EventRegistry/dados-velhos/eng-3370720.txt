She said: 'Nazis are always bad, I don't care what you say.'\n\nFey then referenced the 'alt-right' rallies planned for this weekend and encouraged people to not participate and instead find Jewish or African-American run bakeries to support before reaching for a cake with the American flag decorated on top\n\nThe 47-year-old actress discussed how she heard about more 'alt-right' rallies taking place across the country this weekend, noting that New York City is one of the scheduled locations.\n\n'Part of me hopes these neo-Nazis do try it in New York City and get the ham salad kicked out of them by a bunch of drag queens,' Fey said.\n\n'Because you know what a drag queen still is? A 6'4' black man.'\n\nShe added, 'But, at the same time, I don't want anymore good people to get hurt.\n\n'I know a lot of us are feeling anxious and asking ourselves, what can I do? I'm just one person, what can I do? I would urge people Saturday, instead of participating in the screaming matches and violence, find a local business you support, maybe a Jewish run bakery or African-American run bakery.'\n\nFey then reached to the side and grabbed a huge cake with an American flag decorated on top in icing before digging into it with a fork and shoving huge pieces in her mouth.\n\nAs she shoved huge pieces of the cake in her mouth, Fey explained how America was 'stolen from Native Americans'\n\nShe concluded by concluded by encouraging 'all good, sane Americans to treat these rallies this weekend like the opening of a thoughtful movie with two female leads. Don't show up. Let these morons scream into the empty air.'\n\n'The next time when you see a bunch of white boys in polo shirts screaming about taking our country back and you want to scream, it's not our country, we stole it,' Fey said with a mouth full of cake.\n\n'We stole from the Native Americans. And when they have a peaceful protest at Standing Rock we shoot at them with rubber bullets, we let you chinless turds march the streets with semi-automatic weapons.'\n\nFey also cracked a few jokes at 'yard sale Barbie' Ann Coulter and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who she said 'doesn't even know how to @ somebody on Twitter' in reference to the politician tweeting about the controversial remarks the president said about the Charlottesville incident on Tuesday without directly putting his name in the tweet.\n\nThe former SNL castmember concluded by encouraging 'all good, sane Americans to treat these rallies this weekend like the opening of a thoughtful movie with two female leads. Don't show up. Let these morons scream into the empty air.'\n\nFellow comedians Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers also appeared on Weekend Update separately from Fey as two slave-owning founding fathers.\n\nFellow comedians Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers also appeared on Weekend Update separately from Fey as two slave-owning founding fathers. Fallon, portrayed President George Washington (center), while Meyers dressed up as President Thomas Jefferson (right).\n\nFallon, portrayed President George Washington, while Meyers dressed up as President Thomas Jefferson.\n\nJost began the segment by telling co-host Michael Che, 'You're not going to believe this, but President Trump's approval rating is down. Trump can't believe it either because everywhere he goes people are always waving to him.'\n\nHe then showed a photo of neo-Nazis giving the Sieg Heil salute in Charlottesville.\n\nChe, who was fed-up, said: 'I don't want to do this. Nazis? Confederates? What is with these old-timey threats making a comeback? What's next, Vikings? Polio?'\n\nHe then referenced the president's remark that there were 'fine people' on 'both sides' of the violence in Charlottesville and said, 'OK, but if you are a fine person and you happen to be at a rally filled with Nazis, at what point do you stop and think, 'Hey, am I being unreasonable?'\n\nChe then noted how Trump has compared Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and President George Washington several times in the past few days before introducing the nation's first president.\n\n'About this whole Robert E. Lee thing, I'm nothing like that guy,' Fallon said during his portrayal of Washington. 'I created this country, he tried to tear it apart. I rebelled against England, he rebelled against America.'\n\nThe duo sported the costumes to defend George Washington and Thomas Jefferson against Trump's comments comparing them to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee since they owned slaves\n\nChe eventually confronted the founding father about owning slaves.\n\n'Right, that was bad, that was wrong,' he answered. 'But if you want to talk about owning slaves, you should really talk about Thomas Jefferson.'\n\nMeyers then emerged at the anchor desk dressed as Jefferson and ready to defend himself.\n\n'Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're gonna throw me under the carriage like that?' he asked.\n\n'You're going to make me the slave guy? Really? Come on! What more do you want? You are the one on the quarter. I'm on the nickel and two dollar bill, joke money!'\n\n'You have to remember, it was a different time, man,' Meyers' Jefferson added.\n\n'It was the '70s, man.' The 1770s. 'Look, we have all done bad things, but the difference between us and Robert E. Lee is we did good things. I wrote the Declaration of Independence.'\n\nFallon's Washington then quipped, 'Not to be a jerk, but I won my war.'\n\n'Yeah, and I'm sorry Robert E. Lee, but I prefer generals who win wars,' Meyer's Jefferson added.", "id": "9832508", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Tina Fey blasts'Jackass' Donny John Trump during SNL Weekend Update", "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/18/06/4358287400000578-0-image-a-12_1503033936846.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "218049", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nazism"}, "id": "302813", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Comedian"}, "id": "302911", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Black people"}, "id": "304217", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people"}, {"label": {"eng": "African American"}, "id": "304393", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "id": "304554", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews"}, {"label": {"eng": "Native Americans in the United States"}, "id": "305166", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "George W.

The segment's former anchors Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers returned to the desk, portraying founding fathers George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, respectively. It was an entertaining response to Donald Trump's recent comparisons between Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and the two slave-owning presidents; however, the star of tonight's installment was, without a doubt, Tina Fey.\n\nThe University of Virginia alumna went in on Trump and the nation's white supremacists, less than a week after the deadly white nationalist rally took place in Charlottesville.\n\n\"It broke my heart to see these evil forces descend upon Charlottesville,\" Fey said. \"Then our president, Donald John Trump -- which I don't think people talk enough about what a stupid, jackass name that is.

Of her alma mater, she said, \"It's a beautiful school and I have nothing but fond memories of my time there,\" even though she \"graduated a virgin.\" The comedic actress said, \"It broke my heart to see these evil forces descend on Charlottesville,\" and then to see Donald Trump's response. \"He condemns violence on many sides and I'm feeling sick 'cause I've seen Raiders of the Last Ark and wasn't confused by it. Nazis are always bad. I don't care what you say.\"\n\nNoting that white supremacists have other protests scheduled, Fey admitted, \"Part of me hopes these neo-Nazis do it in New York City. I hope they do try it and get the ham salad kicked out of them by a bunch of drag queens.\" She added, however, \"At the same time, I don't want any more good people to get hurt.\" And with everyone \"anxious\" and asking \"what can I do?\" she encouraged people to \"find a local business you support, maybe a Jewish-run bakery or an African-American-run bakery. Order a cake with an American flag on it, and just eat it.\"\n\nWhen Colin Jost questioned how that would help, she shot back, \"Love is love, Colin.\" Fey went on to stress-eat a cake then and there as she continued to rant about recent events. In regards to white supremacists wanting to \"take\" back the country,\" she pointed out, \"We stole it from the Native Americans, and when they have a peaceful protest in Standing Rock, we shoot at them with rubber bullets.\" She again emphasized that \"the other size is Nazis and Klansman,\" and bluntly stated, \"And also, who drove the car into the crowd? Hillary's emails?\"\n\nFey further called out Ann Coulter and Paul Ryan, the latter of whom did not tag Trump in his tweet about bigotry. \"You don't how to @ somebody on Twitter?!\" she asked incredulously. \"Racism is bad @realDonaldTrump, you p*ssy!\" As for Trump objecting to the removal of Confederate statues, she cracked, \"You know he would take them down in a second if he could build a bunch of poorly-contructed condos on the spot.\"\n\nIn conclusion, with more protests on the horizon, she urged such events be treated just like \"the opening of a thoughtful movie with two female leads: Don't show up.\" Earlier in the episode, as Gossip Cop reported, Jost and co-anchor Michael Che also addressed Trump and the Nazis with help from Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers.

Almost immediately, the hashtags \"#sheetcakemovement\" and \"#sheetcaking\" began circulating on social media.\n\n\"Most of the women I know have been doing it once a week since the election!\" Fey told the show's anchors.\n\nFey, who graduated from U-Va. in 1992, said it \"broke her heart\" to watch the news in Charlottesville.\n\n\"And then our president, Donald John Trump, and I don't think enough people talk about what a stupid, jackass name that is,\" she said. \"Anyway, Donny John comes out and he says that he condemns violence 'on many sides,' on many sides.\"\n\n\"I'm feeling sick because, you know, I have seen Raiders of the Lost Ark and I wasn't confused by it,\" she added. \"Nazis are always bad.\"\n\nShe said that when a \"bunch of white boys in polo shirts\" scream about \"taking our country back\" many people might want to scream back that \"it's not our country, we stole it, we stole it from the Native Americans.\"\n\n\"And when they have a peaceful protest at Standing Rock we shoot at them with rubber bullets,\" Fey said, referring to the thousands of Native Americans and their allies who gathered for months at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation to protest the completion of the Dakota Access crude-oil pipeline.\n\n\"But we let you chinless turds march through the streets with semiautomatic weapons,\" she said, with frosting all over her face.\n\n\"Don't yell it at the Klan,\" she added, \"Yell it into the cake.\"\n\nAt one point Fey even dipped a grilled cheese into the sheet cake, shaking her head as she shamelessly took a bite.\n\nShe criticized some right-wing responses to the Charlottesville violence: \"Who drove the car into the crowd, Hillary's emails?\" She also talked about the white supremacist rallies planned around the country this weekend, some of which have already been canceled.\n\n\"Part of me hopes these neo-Nazis do try it in New York City,\" Fey said. \"I hope they try it and get the ham salad kicked out of them by a bunch of drag queens.\"\n\nIn conclusion, she encouraged \"all good sane Americans\" to treat the upcoming rallies \"like the opening of a thoughtful movie with two female leads: \"Don't show up.\"\n\n\"Let these morons scream into the empty air,\" she said.\n\nSee the full sketch:\n\nAs Fey lifted fists full of cake in the air, \"sheetcaking\" was already popping up across Twitter. Within hours, people began posting pictures of their own American flag-decorated sheet cakes. A T-shirt with the words \"I'd Rather Be Sheetcaking\" emerged on Amazon and a Twitter account name \"T.Fey's Sheet Cake\" emerged.\n\n\"Bakeries are going to have loads of sheetcake orders,\" one Twitter user wrote.\n\n\"Tina Fey stress-eating an entire cake while discussing the state of our nation is all of us right now,\" wrote another.\n\nTina Fey is a national treasure and the only woman who perfectly summarizes my feelings #weekendupdate #sheetcaking pic.twitter.com/lusnA8DAka\n\n-- Jennifer Van Dyke (@Jennger22) August 18, 2017\n\nTake the #SheetCakeChallenge today #sheetcake #sheetcakemovement and make a video of you eating sheet cake while screaming at racists.\n\n-- Aaron Elijah Colyer (@TheAaronColyer) August 18, 2017\n\nMusic to eat a sheet cake by - Tiki Torch Nazis by @hckeymama4obama @JoyReid @Rosie @SNLUpdate pic.twitter.com/A9jCiLZfvp\n\n-- RiotWomenn (@riotwomennn) August 18, 2017\n\nPublished: August 18, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 6:52 AM EDT | Updated: August 18, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 7:18 AM EDT\n\nThanks for your continued support...\n\nWe recently asked you to support our journalism.

With neo-Nazis marching and the president implicitly supporting them, it's natural that you wouldn't quite know where to turn for some sense. SNL, however, has an answer -- just watch Tina Fey go off on the Charlottesville violence, and then you'll know exactly what to do: get a giant cake, and eat that giant cake. Yes, the whole cake.\n\nFey, a UVA grad with a personal connection to Charlottesville, graced the set of SNL's \"Weekend Update\" to spread a little sense during what may seem like a week largely devoid of it. She started out with the obvious point that so many of us have been harping on for days: \"I've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark, and uh, I wasn't confused by it ... Nazis are always bad.\" This is something, of course, that President Trump has gone back and forth on, and Fey spoke for all of us when she said that his response to the weekend's events made her sick.\n\nWhen Fey started talking about the next set of alt-right rallies planned over the weekend, that's when her advice got really revolutionary. Instead of counter-protesting, she said, those who oppose literal Nazis should \"find a local business you support, maybe a Jewish-run bakery, or an African American-run bakery, and order a cake with the American flag on it ... and um, just eat it.\"\n\nThe best part about the segment is that during that little monologue, Fey actually pulled a giant cake with an American flag out from under the desk, and then began to eat it. And I mean really eat it, the way you never allow yourself to dig into a cake. When \"Weekend Update\" host Colin Jost asked her how that was supposed to help, it all became clear. If there's something you want to go out and scream at the polo shirt-wearing guys with automatic weapons, Fey said, \"don't yell it at the Klan, Colin, yell it into the cake!\"\n\nAnd when you think about it, it all makes so much sense. This is the ultimate form of non-violent, peaceful protest, and so many people benefit from it. Firstly, and most importantly, you're keeping yourself safe from any potential violence that breaks out. You're supporting a local business. You're eating delicious cake. And you're not wasting any of your precious time or energy trying to convince the alt-right marchers that their views are actually just plain bigotry and racism, because you're not going to get anywhere with that.\n\n\"Sheet-caking is a grassroots movement,\" Fey said. \"Most of the women I know have been doing it once a week since the election.\" If you're not one of those people, it's never to late to jump onto the sheet-caking bandwagon, especially now that Fey has given you the inspiration. And if things get worse rather than better this weekend, Fey even has advice on what to do then: \"dip a grilled cheese into the cake.\"\n\nSo, it's decided -- don't go to a counter protest. Don't confront the Nazis and the Klan. Eat an American flag cake, just like Tina Fey.", "id": "9860661", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Watch Tina Fey Go Off On The Charlottesville  --  All While Eating A Giant Cake", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/uploads/image/2017/8/18/cac077b4-de88-4411-8238-7762d69f173a-screen-shot-2017-08-18-at-92124-am.png?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&fm=jpg&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Business"}, "id": "302720", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nazism"}, "id": "302813", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Violence"}, "id": "302966", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bakery"}, "id": "303658", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "id": "304554", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tina Fey"}, "id": "307954", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Fey"}, {"label": {"eng": "Polo shirt"}, "id": "310046", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo_shirt"}, {"label": {"eng": "Saturday Night Live"}, "id": "314618", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ku Klux Klan"}, "id": "318256", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cake"}, "id": "318379", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake"}, {"label": {"eng": "Protest"}, "id": "319773", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nonviolence"}, "id": "320531", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}, "id": "326977", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Monologue"}, "id": "354815", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monologue"}, {"label": {"eng": "Colin Jost"}, "id": "357326", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Jost"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nonviolent resistance"}, "id": "368060", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_resistance"}, {"label": {"eng": "Weekend Update"}, "id": "388626", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekend_Update"}, {"label": {"eng": "Raiders of the Lost Ark"}, "id": "411673", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alt-right"}, "id": "1268917", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 121, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Women"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 627, "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Baked Goods", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Baked_Goods"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 628, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Baked Goods", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Baked_Goods"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 812, "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Disorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 888, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Flags and Banners", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Flags_and_Banners"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 889, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Flags", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Flags"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 890, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Flags/Regional", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Flags/Regional"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1003, "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Baking and Confections", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Baking_and_Confections"}], "time": "06:05:00"}

The melee among protesters and counter-protester on Saturday left a 32-year-old woman dead.\n\nFey's history with the city clearly animated her performance opposite \"Weekend Update\" anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che. Fey anchored \"Weekend Update\" for most of her 1998-2006 tenure on \"SNL\" as a writer and performer. During her roughly five-minute segment, Fey spoke with bits of cake flying out of her mouth. She told Jost that \"sheetcaking\" is a \"grassroots movement -- most of the women I know have been doing it once a week since the election.\"", "id": "9890800", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Tina Fey Delivers Takedown of President Trump, White Supremacists on 'Weekend Update' (Watch)", "image": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-18-at-7-28-27-am.png", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tina Fey"}, "id": "307954", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Fey"}, {"label": {"eng": "Saturday Night Live"}, "id": "314618", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cake"}, "id": "318379", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}, "id": "326977", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "University of Virginia"}, "id": "337392", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Icing (food)"}, "id": "342344", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icing_(food)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Colin Jost"}, "id": "357326", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Jost"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sheet cake"}, "id": "380230", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_cake"}, {"label": {"eng": "Weekend Update"}, "id": "388626", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekend_Update"}, {"label": {"eng": "Binge eating"}, "id": "448959", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binge_eating"}, {"label": {"eng": "Michael Che"}, "id": "547680", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Che"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 93, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 253, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1003, "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Baking and Confections", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Baking_and_Confections"}], "time": "12:21:00"}

Clad in a UVA sweatshirt, Fey told hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che, \"It broke my heart to see these evil forces descend upon Charlottesville.\"\n\nShe then bashed President Trump -- or Donny John, as she refers to him -- for saying that \"he condemns violence on many sides.\"\n\n\"I'm feeling sick because I've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark and I wasn't confused by it. Nazis are always bad. I don't care what you say,\" she said.\n\n\"There's nine more alt-right rallies planned around the country this Saturday, including one in New York City in Washington Square Park,\" Fey continued. \"Part of me hopes these neo-Nazis do try it and get the ham salad kicked out of them by a bunch of drag queens, because you know what a drag queen still is? A six-foot-four black man.\"\n\nAdding that she doesn't want \"any more good people to get hurt,\" she urged those frustrated by the events to find a local business -- \"maybe a Jewish-run bakery or an African-American-run bakery\" -- order a cake decorated with the American flag, and eat it, which is exactly what Fey proceeds to do, pausing mid-bite to point out that Native Americans protesting at Standing Rock were shot by the police with rubber bullets, but \"chinless turds\" were allowed to \"march through the streets with semi-automatic weapons\" in Charlottesville.\n\nEarlier in the show, Fallon and Meyers returned to the news desk, but this time as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, respectively.\n\nFallon, as Washington, wanted to talk about the \"Robert E. Lee thing\" -- referring to the statue of Lee that the Charlottesville city council voted to take down, which is what spurred the rally. \"I'm nothing like that guy,\" he claimed. \"I rebelled against England, he rebelled against America. Him, bad; me, the founding father, the original dad. Who's your daddy? Me!\" he yelled.\n\nChe then pressed him on owning slaves, at which point Fallon points the finger at Thomas Jefferson, prompting Meyers to appear dressed as the former president. \"Woah, woah, woah, you're just going to throw me under the carriage like that?\" Meyers asks.\n\nBut he ultimately confessed that he did own slaves: \"It's true, Che, it's true. You've got to remember, it was a different time, man. It was the '70s man. It was the 1770s, crazy times. Everyone in capri pants, smoking hemp.\"\n\nThe two closed the segment with a joint statement: \"In the end, we don't need statues to commemorate us. Our legacy is the country that we risked our lives to create, and that is why this great nation has given us an honor greater than any statue: a three-day weekend in February during which all Americans get 50 percent off on mattresses.

Lee to George Washington, noting that the founding father of America also owned slaves.\n\nRELATED: Eric And Donald Trump Jr. Featured On 'SNL Weekend Update'\n\nThis led to a visit by none other than slave-owning founding fathers George Washington and Thomas Jefferson (played by \"SNL\" alums Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers), who pointed out that unlike General Lee -- whose chief accomplishment was losing the Civil War -- they actually did stuff, pointing to the Declaration of Independence and winning the Revolutionary War.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough \"SNL\" alum star power for a single night, another blast from the past dropped by when Tina Fey crashed the fake newscast to introduce her idea to help America cope with everything that's been taking place: stress-eating.\n\n\"It broke my heart to see these evil forces descend upon Charlottesville,\" said Fey. \"Then our president, Donald John Trump -- which I don't think people talk enough about what a stupid, jackass name that is. Donald John? Whatever! He gets away with it because he's gorgeous. Anyway, Donny John comes out and he says that he condemns violence on many sides, and I'm feeling sick because I've seen 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and I wasn't confused by it. Nazis are always bad. I don't care what you say.\"\n\nNoting that there are many more alt-right rallies planned for this Saturday -- one of which will be held in NYC's Greenwich Village -- Fey joked that she hopes the neo-Nazis marching in Washington Square Park \"get the ham salad kicked out of them by a bunch of drag queens, because you know what a drag queen still is? A six-foot-four black man.\"\n\nRELATED: Bill Hader Is 'The Mooch' In 'SNL' Weekend Update Summer Edition\n\nFinally, Fey advised people to avoid these rallies, and instead visit a local bakery and \"order a cake with the American flag on it like this one and just eat it, Colin.\"\n\nWith that, Fey grabbed a fork and started chowing down, advising everyone to follow her lead by taking all the rage about what's going on and channeling it into angrily devouring an entire cake.\n\nWill \"sheetcaking\" catch on as a grassroots protest movement?

The University of Virginia alumna made a surprise visit to the set of Weekend Update for a serious therapy session, and she did it all while stress-eating a sheet cake! \"It broke my heart to see these evil forces descend upon Charlottesville,\" she ranted. \"Then our president, Donald John Trump -- which I don't think people talk enough about what a stupid, jackass name that is.

So I would urge people this Saturday instead of participating in these screaming matches and potential violence, find a local business that you support -- maybe a Jewish-run bakery, or an African-American-run bakery. Order a cake with the American flag on it like this one and just eat it, Colin.\" That sounds like an idea we can all get behind!\n\nTina wasn't the only surprise guest on Aug. 17. Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers also stopped by dressed as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. As the forefathers, they slammed Trump for comparing them to Robert E. Lee. \"I'm nothing like that guy,\" said Jimmy, as Washington. \"I rebelled against England, he rebelled against America.\" We're living for Weekend Update, and it's only the second episode.

Lee.\n\n\"I'm nothing like that guy,\" Fallon's offended George said. \"I rebelled against England, he rebelled against America.\" When Che pressed him on his bad deeds, GW confessed: He did cut down the cherry tree and, yes, he did have wooden teeth (\"Thanks, Obamacare!\").\n\nWhen Che continued pressing, Fallon's GW ratted out Jefferson as the bigger slave owner, upon which a bewigged Meyer's slid into place behind the desk. \"Whoa, you're going to throw me under the carriage like that?\"\n\n\"I did,\" Meyer's TJ confessed. \"It's true, Che, it's true. But it was the '70s man. The 1770s. Everyone in capri pants, smoking hemp.\"\n\n\"Look,\" said Jefferson, \"we've all done bad things, but the differnce between us and Robert E Lee is we also did good things. I wrote the Declaration of Independence.\"\n\nAdded Washington, \"And I won my war.\"\n\nAlso tonight, Kenan Thompson played an eclipse-excited Neil DeGrasse Tyson, but it was Fey who really delivered the goods tonight. Reaffirming her love for her old college town, she said it broke her heart \"to see these evil forces\" descend on the campus. She noted that police shot rubber bullets at Native Americans protesting at Standing Rock while letting \"chinless turds march through the streets with semi-automatic weapons\" in Charlottesville.", "id": "9808245", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "'SNL': Tina Fey, Jimmy Fallon & Seth Meyers Revisit Weekend Update", "image": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/fallon.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "242110", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dessert"}, "id": "305368", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dessert"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tina Fey"}, "id": "307954", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Fey"}, {"label": {"eng": "Slavery"}, "id": "309898", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Saturday Night Live"}, "id": "314618", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cherry"}, "id": "314674", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jimmy Fallon"}, "id": "317182", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Fallon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cake"}, "id": "318379", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Declaration of Independence"}, "id": "320718", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Thomas Jefferson"}, "id": "332840", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"}, {"label": {"eng": "University of Virginia"}, "id": "337392", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia"}, {"label": {"eng": "George Washington"}, "id": "337858", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington"}, {"label": {"eng": "Seth Meyers"}, "id": "358335", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Meyers"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert E.

First, late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers appeared as Founding Fathers George Washington and Thomas Jefferson rising from the dead to defend themselves against Trump's comparing them to Confederate general Robert E. Lee. (The removal of Lee's statute in Charlottesville, Virginia was sparked a violent white supremacist protest on Saturday.) When it was Tina Fey's turn at the Weekend Update desk, the comedian gave us a perfect alternative to participating in a screaming match: Eat a sheet cake.\n\nSheet-caking is a grass-roots movement. Most of the women I know have been doing it once a week since the election.\n\nThe University of Virginia alumna, speaking with hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che, said it broke her heart to see \"evil forces descend upon Charlottesville.\" The violent events in Charlottesville resulted in one death and 19 more injured after a 20-year-old neo-Nazi from Ohio drove his car into a crowd of counter-protestors, police said. Fey joked she wouldn't mind seeing black drag queens physically interrupt future protests by the radical right before adding that at the same time, she doesn't want to see any more good people getting hurt. Then Fey shared some interesting advice for Americans tempted to start a shouting match with someone who disagrees about the violence in Charlottesville:\n\nFey then proceeded to whip out a frosted sheet cake straight from your elementary school party dreams and dug in. \"Sheet-caking is a grassroots movement,\" she said in between shoveling cake in her mouth. \"Most of the women I know have been doing it once a week since the election. As Fey continued to devour cake, she gave some choice words on responding to racist protestors: next time you see \"a bunch of white boys in polo shirts screaming about taking our country back,\" remind them that we stole it from the Native Americans, who police shoot with rubber bullets when they protest peacefully at Standing Rock. Meanwhile, neo-Nazis march through the streets of Charlottesville with assault weapons.\n\nBut in seriousness, Fey called on all \"good, sane Americans\" to respond to such hate rallies by ignoring them and letting the haters scream into empty air. She also criticized Trump for his blaming the violence on \"both sides,\" saying Trump would be the the first one to take down a monument if he could build condominiums in its place.\n\n\"I love you Charlottesville,\" she declared in her last words, \"and as Thomas Jefferson once said, 'Who's that hot, light-skinned girl over by the butter churn?'\"", "id": "9845822", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Tina Fey Wants You To Eat Sheet-Cake In The Name Of Crushing Neo-Nazis", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/uploads/image/2017/8/18/4ad68e75-e9ab-4ec4-8242-f4e65be17236-screen-shot-2017-08-17-at-103831-pm.png?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&fm=jpg&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "219910", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Comedian"}, "id": "302911", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}, "id": "304238", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots"}, {"label": {"eng": "School"}, "id": "304246", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"}, {"label": {"eng": "Native Americans in the United States"}, "id": "305166", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tina Fey"}, "id": "307954", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Fey"}, {"label": {"eng": "Saturday Night Live"}, "id": "314618", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jimmy Fallon"}, "id": "317182", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Fallon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}, "id": "317554", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen"}, {"label": {"eng": "Founding Fathers of the United States"}, "id": "318104", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cake"}, "id": "318379", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rubber bullet"}, "id": "322312", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_bullet"}, {"label": {"eng": "Polo"}, "id": "328830", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo"}, {"label": {"eng": "Thomas Jefferson"}, "id": "332840", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"}, {"label": {"eng": "University of Virginia"}, "id": "337392", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia"}, {"label": {"eng": "George Washington"}, "id": "337858", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington"}, {"label": {"eng": "Icing (food)"}, "id": "342344", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icing_(food)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Colin Jost"}, "id": "357326", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Jost"}, {"label": {"eng": "Seth Meyers"}, "id": "358335", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Meyers"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert E.

So I would urge people this Saturday instead of participating in these screaming matches and potential violence, find a local business that you support -- maybe a Jewish-run bakery, or an African-American-run bakery. Order a cake with the American flag on it like this one and just eat it.\"\n\nShe also recommended instead of yelling things at the white nationalists, people should just \"yell it at the cake\" - and then proceeded to do so.\n\n\"The next time when you see a bunch of white boys in polo shirts screaming about taking our country back and you want to scream, it's not our country, we stole it,\" she said while stuffing her face with the dessert. \"We stole from the Native Americans.

If you'd like to learn more...\n\nThis week's edition of Saturday Night Live's Weekend Update started and ended with President Donald Trump being ripped over his response to the violence in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nThe episode began with Colin Jost laying into Trump's poor approval ratings, saying the president was surprised at his faltering numbers because people always wave at him wherever he goes (in reference to Nazi salutes seen in Charlottesville).\n\nWATCH: Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers appear as Washington and Jefferson to defend their legacies on SNL Weekend Update\n\nStory continues below\n\nCo-host Michael Ceh then pondered whether the past was repeating itself, wondering out loud, \"Nazis? Confederates? What's with all these old-timey threats making comebacks? What's next, Vikings? Polio?\"\n\nHe then suggested that the term \"alt-right\" was coined by \"racist white guys trying to rebrand themselves,\" comparing it to the rebranding of cable television company Time Warner Cable as Spectrum.\n\nThe hosts then began discussing the question of Confederate statues being brought down, and Trump's comments about the dangers of condemning slave-owners from America's history, given that founding fathers George Washington and Thomas Jefferson also owned slaves.\n\nWATCH: Trump calls removal of Confederate statues \"foolish\"\n\nThis prompted Jimmy Fallon to appear in the role of George Washington.\n\nAccused by Ceh of doing some unsavoury things, Fallon appeared awkward before admitting, \"Yes, I did cut down that cherry tree,\" in reference to the famous tale of Washington cutting down his father's cherry tree as a young boy.\n\nPressed further, Fallon's Washington admitted that owning slaves was \"wrong\" and \"bad,\" but then tried to deflect the issue in Jefferson's direction.\n\nWATCH: Late-night host Seth Meyers slams Trump's 'clinically insane' press conference\n\nSeth Meyers then appeared as Thomas Jefferson, insisting that the '70s -- as in the 1770s -- were \"a different time, man.\"\n\nJefferson and Washington then proclaimed that they didn't need statues of themselves, as their legacy as founding fathers was cemented in the form of \"a three-day weekend in February in which all Americans get 50 per cent off all mattresses.\"\n\nANALYSIS: Removing Confederate symbols won't fix America's race and inequality issues\n\nThe next segment saw comedian and University of Virginia alumna Tina Fey appear at the co-hosts' desk to condemn the white supremacist rallies in Charlottesville, and Trump's insistence on blaming \"both sides\" for the violence.\n\n\"Donny John [Donald J. Trump] comes out and says that he condemns violence on many sides, and I'm feeling sick because I've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark and I wasn't confused by it. Nazis are always bad,\" she said.\n\nFey then pointed out that several more alt-right rallies were planned for this coming weekend including one in New York City, where she said she hopes attendees will \"get the ham salad kicked out of them by a bunch of drag queens.\"\n\nWATCH: Man loses his job after being identified at Charlottesville white supremacist rally\n\nShe then implored Americans to avoid going to the rallies and instead order a cake with an American flag on it, before continuing her rant in between messy mouthfuls of cake.\n\n\"The next time when you see a bunch of white boys in polo shirts screaming about taking our country back and you want to scream -- it's not our country, we stole it from the Native Americans.\"\n\nREAD MORE: 40% of Americans want Donald Trump impeached:

And so I would urge people this Saturday, instead of participating in the screaming matches and potential violence: find a local business you support ... order a cake with the American flag on it, and just eat it.\"\n\nProducing exactly that, Fey proceeded to dig in, voicing her frustrations over prejudice with her mouth full of cake. \"And whatever you want to yell,\" she tells her co-host, \"don't yell it at the clan, Colin, yell it into the cake.\"\n\nWhen told that some of the planned rallies were being cancelled, Fey declared \"See, it's working already. 'Sheetcaking' is a grassroots movement\".\n\nAs supporters of both cake and finding alternatives to violence, we're open to 'sheetcaking'. If you've had a particularly stressful week (or you just love cake), we'd recommend the ever-popular, and tray cake classic, carrot cake with cream cheese icing, a light vanilla sponge or, for severe cases, this fancy black forest cake.\n\nOf course, there's no reson you couldn't try someting a little more extravagent, like an orange-pistachio Bundt cake, or this brown sugar and buttermilk version.\n\nAfter reducing the cake to a mound of crumbs and icing, Fey then suggested dipping a grilled cheese sandwich in the cake.

Not only does she add a new hashtag to the world (\"sheetcaking\" should be trending pretty soon -- and, yup, there it is), her guest appearance on tonight's Weekend Update: Summer Edition provides context for how best to enjoy these SNL pre-season warmups. Showing up in her rumpled University of Virginia sweatshirt, UVA alum Fey addressed the recent Nazi and white supremacist violence there -- and the bullshit false equivalency of one Donald John Trump surrounding it -- and delivered a rapid-fire barrage of solid, mean, furiously ass-kicking jokes while jamming oversized mouthfuls of an American flag sheet cake into her still-talking mouth.\n\nIt's a funny bit that has the benefit of being character-driven (coming from an outraged person intimately familiar with the people of Charlottesville), expertly constructed (co-anchor Michael Che plunges his bare hand into the cake in perfect timing to Fey's fact about the number of armed white supremacist militias in this country), and hilariously gross. (Fey was not kidding around with that cake, nor about the grilled cheese sandwich backup comfort food she started dipping into the frosting halfway through her rant.) As Che and Colin Jost -- ruined cake between them -- said during tonight's signoff, \"Obviously, this is a tough week to do comedy.\" But they did, with Fey's help, and that of a few other returning SNL alums and good old Kenan Thompson, and, like Fey's bravura guest shot showed, sometimes a go-for-broke belly-laugh isn't a bad way to power through.\n\nThe episode started off with the traditional Jost and Che one-liner joke-off, which hit consistently. The dynamic this week -- you know, the week where Nazis killed and injured people and the president openly made excuses for them -- saw Che intermittently acting on the verge of simply throwing up his hands. It worked to underscore the difficult-to-believe awfulness of what's going on in America, and Che made it work for his jokes beautifully. \"Ugh, I don't wanna do this,\" is how he introduced a joke about \"old-timey threats making comebacks,\" before speculating that, in addition to Confederates and Nazis, we're due for Vikings and polio to fuck things up next. Che infused the material with a knowing energy that only served to bump it up. And it was pretty solid to begin with. His joke echoing the now depressingly clich\u00e9 sentiment that \"my grandfather didn't fight Nazis in WWII so that...\" snaps hard with his punchline about his grandfather not serving in WWII because \"he was in jail for whistling at a white lady.\"\n\nJost, too, went hard at jokes about that whole \"the president defends actual Nazis\" thing by deadpanning that Trump only doesn't believe in his abysmal poll numbers because \"everywhere he goes, people are always waving to him.\" Cue picture of the \"very fine people\" Trump extolled at the Virginia rally throwing up Nazi salutes. The crowd gasped, Jost stared them down, and he got the laugh. Solid. If there's a major complaint about the anchor jokes again this week it's that, with so many horrifying/ridiculous political targets to go after, there's always time for innocuous gags. They weren't bad -- both Che and Jost have become quite adept at delivering snappy punchlines -- but the momentum they'd built up dissipated a bit.\n\nThat should have been true when Kenan showed up as his starry-eyed Neil deGrasse Tyson, enthused beyond all scientific propriety at the prospect of next week's solar eclipse. Kenan's been on Saturday Night Live since 2003, and has become a slyly joyous performer, his infectious commitment outpacing the fact that he's not the natural impressionist that last week's guest, Bill Hader is. Here, his Tyson, making Jost uncomfortable with his elaborately naughty eclipse-worshipping plans (\"Naked!,\" Tyson repeats with glee to the confused Jost) is a bundle of sunshine, the scientist excitedly taking time off from \"pointing out the unrealistic parts of the new Planet Of The Apes movie\" to strip down, surround himself with sun-powered things (like, hilariously, \"1000 raisins\"), and calling out a nerdy \"ravage me\" to the mother sun.\n\nFunny, too, was a doubles act from former SNL all-stars, Update anchors, and current NBC late-night tag-team hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers. Addressing the reddit-level ahistorical illogic of Trump defending a Robert E. Lee statue by invoking those of fellow slave-owners George Washington (Fallon) and Thomas Jefferson (Meyers) is a fool's errand, so Update went broad with it. Washington kept deliberately missing Che's point while pumping up his achievements versus Lee's (\"Him bad, me the founding father -- I'm out!\") before trying to deflect attention onto Meyers' Jefferson, who indignantly burst out to huge applause. The conceit of the two bro-ing out (\"You gonna throw me under the carriage like that?\") yet made room for some hearty slaps at Trump's Confederate-cuddling bullshit. \"We prefer generals who win wars,\" tossed Trump's infamous attack on Senator John McCain's torture as a POW back in Trump's face, while the summation that neither founding father cares about statues of themselves because \"Our legacy is the country that we risked our lives to create\" follows through satisfyingly. (And Fallon managed to keep from giggling at how adorable he is, which is something to be thankful for.)\n\nBut it was Fey who nailed the episode shut, with the former Update anchor and SNL head writer coming hard after Trump's comments, the planned white supremacist rallies planned for this weekend (the term \"chinless turds\" should also find a home on Twitter), \"yard sale Barbie\" and Nazi apologist Ann Coulter, and Paul Ryan's spineless response to Trump's bigotry (\"It's 'Racism is bad' @realDonaldTrump, you pussy!\"). All while, as mentioned, shoveling therapeutic cake down her gullet. It's a fine, cathartic bit, full of laughs both broad and subtle (urging people to boycott those hate-rallies, Fey tells people to treat them like \"the opening of a thoughtful movie with two female leads\"), and one that gives this second extended Weekend Update a much more satisfying flavor.", "id": "9814241", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "On Weekend Update: Summer Edition,

Channel all of your emotion into consuming an entire sheetcake all by your lonesome, and leave neo-Nazis twisting in the wind when no one shows up to watch their little parade. Calling Paul Ryan a \"pussy\" and Ann Coulter a \"yard sale Barbie\" and pointing out a few of the bigger flaws in Trump's pro-Confederate logic are optional.\n\nBehold:\n\nFor good measure, the glory of posterity, and our own personal gratification, here's the full transcript of Tina Fey's sheetcaking protest, starting from the 55-second mark in the clip above:\n\nTINA FEY: Thank you Colin, and, Che: I just want to say that I always come out on Colin's side because it's the better half of my face-but I feel like this week it's important to be clear about that.\n\nMICHAEL CHE: Still not buying it, Tina. Not buying it at all.\n\nCOLIN JOST: Now, Tina, you graduated from UVA in 1992.\n\nTINA: Yes, Colin. It's a beautiful school, and I have nothing but fond memories of my time there. And-I graduated a virgin, and I still liked it. That's how good the architecture is down there. So it broke my heart to see these evil forces descend upon Charlottesville. And then our president, Donald John Trump-which, I don't think people talk enough about what a stupid, jackass name that is. It does *not* flow-Donald John? Whatever, he gets away with it 'cause he's gorgeous.\n\nAnyway, Donnie John comes out, and he says that he condemns violence on many sides. On many sides, Colin. And I'm feeling sick. 'Cause, you know. I've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark, and, uh, I wasn't confused by it. No, Colin, Nazis are always bad-I don't care what you say.\n\nCOLIN: ...Well, *I* don't say...\n\nTINA: Then, we hear that there's nine more alt-right rallies planned around the country this Saturday, including one in Washington Square Park. And part of me hopes these neo-Nazis do try it in New York City? Like, I hope they try it and get the ham salad kicked out of them by a bunch of drag queens? 'Cause, 'cause you know what a drag queen still is? A six-foor-four black man.\n\nBut, at the same time, I don't want any more good people to get hurt. And I know a lot of us are feeling anxious, and we're asking ourselves, like, 'What can I do? I'm just one person-what can I do?' And so, I would urge people this Saturday, instead of participating in the screaming matches and potential violence, find a local business you support. Maybe, a Jewish-run bakery, or, an-African-American run...bakery. Order a cake with the American flag on it-like this one-and, um...just eat it, Colin.\n\nCOLIN: Wait-I'm sorry; how is that supposed to help?\n\nTINA (mouth overfull with cake): Love is love, Colin.\n\nCOLIN: I'm sorry, what?\n\nTINA: And then, next time, when you see a bunch of white boys, boys in polo shirts screaming about taking our country back, and you want to scream, 'It's not our country-we stole it. We stole it from the Native Americans. And when they have a peaceful protest at Standing Rock, we shoot at them with rubber bullets. But we let you chinless turds march through the streets with semi-automatic weapons.' When you want to yell that, don't yell it at the Klan, Colin. Yell it into the cake. (Screams into cake) Then, when Ann Coulter crawls out of her roach motel, and says, 'Uh, antifa attacked Republicans in Berkeley,' and you're like, 'OK, yard sale Barbie, but the other side is Nazis and Klansmen. And also, who drove the car into the crowd? Hillary's e-mails?'\n\nCOLIN: Well, you know, they've already canceled some of these new rallies.\n\nTINA: You see? It's working already. Sheetcaking is a grassroots movement, Colin. Most of the women I know have been doing it once a week since the election. And don't worry, guys-by the way-don't worry. Some of the people in Charlottesville weren't Klansmen-they were independent militias! Yeah! Did you know there's over 250 well-armed militias across the US that are ready to mobilize at any time? Yeah! Guess what, Che-they're not cops. No! They're not cops, Che-they're just militias and they train themselves.\n\nCHE: Gimme some of that damn cake. (Reaches across the desk, grabs huge handful of cake, starts eating it)\n\nTINA: (Slaps more cake down on the desk for Che) And you know what I say? I say, oh, you know, where's Paul Ryan in all this? Right? You're supposed to be like the cool, young Congressman in all this, but you don't know how to @ somebody on Twitter? 'Racism is bad @realDonaldJTrump, you pussy.' Then, then Donnie Johnny says we need to defend our country's 'beautiful Confederate monuments' when you know he would take 'em down in a second if he thought he could build a bunch of poorly constructed condos on the spot. Google 'Trump Bonwit Teller,' okay? And then your family says, 'Oh, mom, you need to calm down,' and then you start to feel powerless-and that is when you need to dip a grilled cheese into the cake. (Does so)\n\nCOLIN: And...and are you gonna stay until, like, the whole cake is gone, or...?\n\nTINA: In conclusion. I really want to say-to encourage all good, sane Americans to treat these rallies this weekend like the opening of a thoughtful movie with two female leads: Don't show up. Let these morons scream into the empty air. I love you Charlottesville, and, as Thomas Jefferson once said, 'Who's that hot light-skinned girl over by the butter churn?'\n\n(Photo credits: Tina Fey's sheetcaking protest via Saturday Night Live on YouTube)", "id": "9896425", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "VIDEO Tina Fey's sheetcaking protest against white supremacy is a thing of furious beauty", "image": "http://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Tina-Feys-sheetcaking-protest-2.jpg?w=640", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "218051", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nazism"}, "id": "302813", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google"}, "id": "302865", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}, "id": "302944", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hillary Rodham Clinton"}, "id": "302951", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton"}, {"label": {"eng": "Violence"}, "id": "302966", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Food"}, "id": "303078", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bakery"}, "id": "303658", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Salad"}, "id": "303703", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad"}, {"label": {"eng": "Black people"}, "id": "304217", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}, "id": "304323", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"}, {"label": {"eng": "African American"}, "id": "304393", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "id": "304554", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews"}, {"label": {"eng": "Paul Ryan"}, "id": "304743", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ryan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Native Americans in the United States"}, "id": "305166", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "George W.

Clad in a UVA sweatshirt, Fey told hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che, \"It broke my heart to see these evil forces descend upon Charlottesville.\" She then bashed President Trump -- or Donny John, as she refers to him -- for saying that \"he condemns violence on many sides.\"\n\n\"I'm feeling sick because I've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark and I wasn't confused by it. Nazis are always bad. I don't care what you say,\" she said.\n\n\"There's nine more alt-right rallies planned around the country this Saturday, including one in New York City in Washington Square Park,\" Fey continued. \"Part of me hopes these neo-Nazis do try it and get the ham salad kicked out of them by a bunch of drag queens, because you know what a drag queen still is? A six-foot-four black man.\"\n\nAdding that she doesn't want \"any more good people to get hurt,\" she urged those frustrated by the events to find a local business -- \"maybe a Jewish-run bakery or an African-American-run bakery\" -- order a cake decorated with the American flag, and eat it, which is exactly what Fey proceeds to do with the sheet cake, pausing mid-bite to point out that Native Americans protesting at Standing Rock were shot by the police with rubber bullets, but \"chinless turds\" were allowed to \"march through the streets with semi-automatic weapons\" in Charlottesville.\n\nShe then proceeds to offer a biting commentary on Charlottesville and \"Donny\" Trump (\"Who drove the car into the crowd, Hillary's emails?\") while devouring the cake, and attempting to make \"sheet-caking\" and screaming your frustrations into a cake a \"grassroots movement.\"\n\nEarlier in the show, Fallon and Meyers returned to the news desk, but this time as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, respectively.\n\nFallon, as Washington, wanted to talk about the \"Robert E. Lee thing\" -- referring to the statue of Lee that the Charlottesville city council voted to take down, which is what spurred the rally. \"I'm nothing like that guy,\" he claimed. \"I rebelled against England, he rebelled against America. Him, bad; me, the founding father, the original dad. Who's your daddy? Me!\" he yelled.\n\nChe then pressed him on owning slaves, at which point Fallon points the finger at Thomas Jefferson, prompting Meyers to appear dressed as the former president. \"Woah, woah, woah, you're just going to throw me under the carriage like that?\" Meyers asks.\n\nBut he ultimately confessed that he did own slaves: \"It's true, Che, it's true. You've got to remember, it was a different time, man. It was the '70s man. It was the 1770s, crazy times. Everyone in capri pants, smoking hemp.\"\n\nThe two closed the segment with a joint statement: \"In the end, we don't need statues to commemorate us. Our legacy is the country that we risked our lives to create, and that is why this great nation has given us an honor greater than any statue: a three-day weekend in February during which all Americans get 50 percent off on mattresses.

Clad in a UVA sweatshirt, Fey told hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che, \"It broke my heart to see these evil forces descend upon Charlottesville.\" She then bashed President Trump -- or Donny John, as she refers to him -- for saying that \"he condemns violence on many sides.\"\n\n\"I'm feeling sick because I've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark and I wasn't confused by it. Nazis are always bad. I don't care what you say,\" she said.\n\n\"There's nine more alt-right rallies planned around the country this Saturday, including one in New York City in Washington Square Park,\" Fey continued. \"Part of me hopes these neo-Nazis do try it and get the ham salad kicked out of them by a bunch of drag queens, because you know what a drag queen still is? A six-foot-four black man.\"\n\nAdding that she doesn't want \"any more good people to get hurt,\" she urged those frustrated by the events to find a local business -- \"maybe a Jewish-run bakery or an African-American-run bakery\" -- order a cake decorated with the American flag, and eat it, which is exactly what Fey proceeds to do with the sheet cake, pausing mid-bite to point out that Native Americans protesting at Standing Rock were shot by the police with rubber bullets, but \"chinless turds\" were allowed to \"march through the streets with semi-automatic weapons\" in Charlottesville.\n\nShe then proceeds to offer a biting commentary on Charlottesville and \"Donny\" Trump (\"Who drove the car into the crowd, Hillary's emails?\") while devouring the cake, and attempting to make \"sheet-caking\" and screaming your frustrations into a cake a \"grassroots movement.\"\n\nEarlier in the show, Fallon and Meyers returned to the news desk, but this time as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, respectively.\n\nFallon, as Washington, wanted to talk about the \"Robert E. Lee thing\" -- referring to the statue of Lee that the Charlottesville city council voted to take down, which is what spurred the rally. \"I'm nothing like that guy,\" he claimed. \"I rebelled against England, he rebelled against America. Him, bad; me, the founding father, the original dad. Who's your daddy? Me!\" he yelled.\n\nChe then pressed him on owning slaves, at which point Fallon points the finger at Thomas Jefferson, prompting Meyers to appear dressed as the former president. \"Woah, woah, woah, you're just going to throw me under the carriage like that?\" Meyers asks.\n\nBut he ultimately confessed that he did own slaves: \"It's true, Che, it's true. You've got to remember, it was a different time, man. It was the '70s man. It was the 1770s, crazy times. Everyone in capri pants, smoking hemp.\"\n\nThe two closed the segment with a joint statement: \"In the end, we don't need statues to commemorate us. Our legacy is the country that we risked our lives to create, and that is why this great nation has given us an honor greater than any statue: a three-day weekend in February during which all Americans get 50 percent off on mattresses. And I think there's a Toyota-thon that weekend, too.\"", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "wgt": 100, "id": 393, "label":

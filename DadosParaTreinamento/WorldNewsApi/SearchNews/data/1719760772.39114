{"id": 225031854, "title": "Owner of two Vancouver condos gets three empty home tax audits in a year", "text": "He is a carpenter and said that 2021 was a \u201cswitch over year. I lived on Main Street whilst I drove to this Yew Street place, which would be my new home eventually and I renovated it.\u201d He remembers tracking all the timing to keep his insurance company apprised. \u201cThey asked, \u2018Well, where do you live?\u2019 and I had to tell them I\u2019m in between because the bathroom and bedrooms are nearly finished and I am sleeping over some of the time instead of coming home. They wanted specific details to make sure I was covered so I had to guide them through.\u201d He moved fully into the Yew Street place during the later half of 2021 and a month later, he moved tenants into the Main Street one. In April 2023, he got a first audit letter for the Yew Street property to prove it was occupied in 2021. In October 2023, he got a second audit letter for the Main Street property to prove it was occupied in 2021. At the time, he was incredulous at having to repeat what were two parts of the same story. He said he told city staff: \u201c\u2018Guys, I\u2019ve just done the audit on Yew Street for 2021. I had to prove that I was living between the two. So, it\u2019s all been done.\u2019 But they said, \u2018Well, we can\u2019t do that. You have got to do a separate audit.'\u201d", "summary": "A month after fighting a fine for 2021 \u2014 that was eventually reversed \u2014 he has received notice for another audit for the same Main Street property, but for 2022", "url": "https://vancouversun.com/business/real-estate/owner-of-two-vancouver-condos-gets-three-empty-home-tax-audits-in-a-year", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/vancouversun/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/png0528nassessment-05.jpg", "video": "", "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:00:24", "author": "Joanne Lee-Young", "authors": ["Joanne Lee-Young"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.949}

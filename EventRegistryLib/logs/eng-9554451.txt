Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive back Jimmy Johnson, a three-time All-Pro and member of the All-Decade Team of the 1970s, has died. He was 86. Johnson's family told the Pro Football Hall of Fame that he died on Wednesday night, May 8, 2024.\n\nPro Football Hall of Fame defensive back Jimmy Johnson, a three-time All-Pro and member of the All-Decade Team of the 1970s, has died. He was 86.\n\nJohnson's family told the Pro Football Hall of Fame that he died on Wednesday night.\n\nJohnson, inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1994, played his entire 16-year pro career with San Francisco. He appeared in 213 games, more than any other 49ers player at the time of his retirement.\n\n\"Jimmy Johnson was extraordinarily athletically talented,\" Hall of Fame President Jim Porter said. \"The 49ers enjoyed the luxury of using him on offense and defense early in his career to fill team needs. Once he settled in at left cornerback, he flourished. The notion that a 'lockdown' cornerback could cut the field in half for the opposition was true with Jimmy. Only rarely would other teams' quarterbacks even look his direction, and more often than not regretted the decision if they challenged him.\"\n\nThe 49ers drafted Johnson sixth overall in 1961 out of UCLA -- the Chargers of the upstart AFL took him in the fourth round of that league's draft -- and he became a starter almost immediately as a cornerback. He had five interceptions as a rookie.\n\nBut he was so versatile that the Niners used Johnson on offense in 1962, when he made 34 receptions for 627 yards and scored four touchdowns.\n\nPreventing opponents from compiling such stats was his forte, however, and by 1964 Johnson was a fixture on the corner. He remained there until retiring after the 1976 season, totaling 47 interceptions, returning two for scores, and earning a reputation as a stingy cover man with a nose for the ball. In 1971, in the midst of a three-year run as an All-Pro, Johnson won the George Halas Award for courageous play.\n\n\"You have to be worked on, cornered in and cornered out to become as good as you can be,\" Johnson said when he entered the Hall of Fame. \"So actually I feel standing here today that I never reached that level, I never reached as good a football player as I could be. But thanks to God and inner talent I was able to present a picture to those individuals who were voting for the Hall of Fame, and my longevity and the level of game that I played from my rookie season to my last. That on this wondrous year of 1994 I've been given the opportunity, the glorious opportunity, to become a member of the most wonderful society: The National Football League Hall of Fame.\"\n\nIt reached the point when Johnson was at his peak that opponents rarely threw his way. He was Deion Sanders long before Prime Time hit the NFL.\n\n\"Jim doesn't receive much publicity because the opposition avoids him as much as possible,\" San Francisco quarterback John Brodie once said. \"Talk to veteran quarterbacks like John Unitas and Bart Starr and they'll tell you they call few pass patterns in Jimmy's area. The only reason Johnson doesn't lead the league in interceptions is he doesn't get the chance.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nFormer 49ers coach Dick Nolan once said Johnson was a better cornerback than two of his other players, (Hall of Famer) Mel Renfro and (two-time All-Pro) Cornell Green with the Cowboys.\n\nThe brother of Olympic decathlon champion Rafer Johnson, Jimmy Johnson played two ways at UCLA. He was a wingback on offense and a defensive back, while also competing in track as a hurdler and broad jumper.\n\nHis brother was Johnson's presenter for enshrinement in the Canton, Ohio, hall.\n\n\"Rafer Johnson is in fact my hero and that is an amazing thing in itself,\" Jimmy Johnson said that day. \"Most young men growing up usually have a hero in another town, another city, another country, and they will write to this individual, receive an autographed photo and then tack that photo up on the wall and worship that photo, play for that photo and get inspiration from that photo. No such problem for me.\n\n\"I had a brother living with me on a day-to-day basis that I was able to talk to, ask the pertinent questions, get the pertinent feedback and get corrected in my direction, if needed. I must say I must give brother Rafer credit for everything that I have accomplished in the field of athletics. And I just wish that we could split this trophy, this bust of myself, right down the middle because he surely deserves half of it.\"\n\nBarry Wilner is a retired Pro Football Writer for The Associated Press.

Only rarely would other teams' quarterbacks even look his direction, and more often than not regretted the decision if they challenged him.\"\n\nJohnson made the AP All-Pro first team three consecutive years, from 1970-71, while also making the Pro Bowl in those seasons, as well as in 1969 and 1974, primarily as the 49ers' left cornerback.\n\nJohnson recorded 47 interceptions in his 49ers career. He also scored two touchdowns, recovered seven fumbles, forced a fumble and a safety.\n\nA two-way standout out on UCLA's football team (as well as a NCAA high-hurdle champion and broad jumper), Johnson did see some action for the 49ers offense, though a broken wrist prior to his rookie training camp delayed his two-way play. He had 34 receptions for 627 yards and four touchdowns in his second season, highlighted by an 80-yard touchdown against the Chicago Bears and a 181-yard outing against the Detroit Lions.\n\nJohnson twice received the 49ers' most prestigious honor, the Len Eshmont Award, for his courageous and inspirational play, winning it in 1969 and 1975.", "source": {"uri": "montereyherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Monterey Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cam_inman@montereyherald.com", "name": "Cam Inman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Johnson_(American_football_coach)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brodie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Brodie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_Owls_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rice Owls football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Len_Eshmont", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Len Eshmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Bruins_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UCLA Bruins football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_jump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long jump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Squash", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Squash", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.montereyherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20150915__EDDIED1.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554451", "eventUri": "eng-9554451", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

His 213 games played with the 49ers trail only Jerry Rice (238).\n\nOne of the greatest players in 49ers' history, Johnson was among the original shutdown cornerbacks. Former 49ers quarterback John Brodie revealed veteran quarterbacks didn't throw Johnson's way because of the fear of being intercepted.\n\n\"Jim doesn't receive much publicity because the opposition avoids him as much as possible,\" Brodie said back when they were teammates, via the Pro Football Hall of Fame website. \"Talk to veteran quarterbacks like John Unitas and Bart Starr and they'll tell you they call few pass patterns in Jimmy's area.\n\n\"The only reason Johnson doesn't lead the league in interceptions is he doesn't get the chance.\"\n\nOriginally drafted as a two-way player, Johnson moved to defense full time in 1964.

(AP Photo/RHH, File)\n\nPreventing opponents from compiling such stats was his forte, however, and by 1964 Johnson was a fixture on the corner. He remained there until retiring after the 1976 season, totaling 47 interceptions, returning two for scores, and earning a reputation as a stingy cover man with a nose for the ball. In 1971, in the midst of a three-year run as an All-Pro, Johnson won the George Halas Award for courageous play.\n\n\"You have to be worked on, cornered in and cornered out to become as good as you can be,\" Johnson said when he entered the Hall of Fame. \"So actually I feel standing here today that I never reached that level, I never reached as good a football player as I could be.

Johnson, who eventually went on to make the Pro Football Hall of Fame, began his career at UCLA as a dual-sport athlete, competing for the Bruins in both track and field and football.\n\nAt UCLA, Johnson was versatile both on the gridiron as well as the track. In track, Johnson was a team captain, an All-American, and an NCAA 110-meter hurdle champion with a time of 14 seconds. In football, Johnson was a two-way player, playing as both a wingback and defensive back for the Bruins. He totaled 812 yards from scrimmage in 1959 and 1960, but wished he had contributed even more for the team despite winning the UCLA Iron Man award in one season for playing the most minutes on the team.\n\n\"I played a lot of football, maybe not as much as I wanted to,\" Johnson said of his days at UCLA, via the Pro Football Hall of Fame. \"I could have played 60 minutes.\"\n\nFollowing his time at UCLA, Johnson was drafted sixth overall in the 1961 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers, where he spent his entire career. The cornerback made an immediate impact for the 49ers as a rookie, intercepting five passes for 116 return yards. The 49ers actually wanted to use him as a receiver during his rookie season, but he broke his wrist before training camp that year. So, they instead used him at corner, where he still garnered five picks. Johnson then shifted to wide receiver in his second NFL season, catching 34 passes for 627 yards and four touchdowns while averaging 18.4 yards per catch before returning to corner the next year.\n\nConsidered one of the best man-to-man corners in NFL history, Johnson compiled 47 interceptions during his 16-year career with the 49ers. He likely would have had more interceptions in his career, but opposing quarterbacks knew better than to throw to him, earning him the nickname, 'The Lonesome Cornerback.' Hall of Fame quarterbacks and wide receivers Johnny Unitas, Joe Namath, Bart Starr, and Fred Biletnikoff have acknowledged how tough an opponent Johnson was, either hoping he'd make a mistake or simply avoiding him.\n\n\"Jimmy Johnson was extraordinarily athletically talented. The 49ers enjoyed the luxury of using him on offense and defense early in his career to fill team needs,\" Pro Football Hall of Fame President Jim Porter said. \"Once he settled in at left cornerback, he flourished. The notion that a 'lockdown' cornerback could cut the field in half for the opposition was true with Jimmy.\"\n\nDuring his career, Johnson was a four-time First-Team All-Pro from 1969-72, and a four-time second-team All-Pro from 1964-66, and in 1968. He was a five-time Pro Bowler, and a starting cornerback on the prestigious NFL 1970s All-Decade Team. He won the George Halas Award in 1972 for courageous play after playing through a broken hand the second half of the year.\n\nDespite many great 49ers playing for the team after Johnson's retirement, including the 1980s dynasty under Bill Walsh, he undoubtedly left a lasting legacy on the franchise.

He was first-team All-Pro in 1970, '71 and 72. The Pro Football Hall of Fame selected him for the All-Decade Team of the 1970s.\n\nA native of Dallas who moved to California as a youth, Johnson went about his business quietly with respect for his opponents.\n\n\"I don't look at someone and think that he can't beat me,\" Johnson said. \"If you play long enough, you're going to get beat. The question and the key to your effectiveness is how often.\"\n\nHe also played halfback and flanker in 1962 and 1963, catching 40 passes for 690 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nSan Francisco selected him as one of its three first-round draft choices (sixth overall in 1961. He was a football star at UCLA at wingback and defensive back as well as a track standout in hurdles and long jump.\n\nHis brother, Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete Rafer Johnson, was his presenter at the Hall of Fame induction ceremony on July 30, 1994.\n\n\"Jimmy is a quiet man, but he played with determination and commitment,\" Rafer Johnson said. \"Most of all, Jim was and is a gentle man and a true gentleman.\"\n\nJimmy Johnson won the Pro Football Writers' George Halas Award for courageous play in 1971 after playing half of that season with a broken wrist. He twice received the Len Eshmont Award, chosen by 49ers players and given to a teammate for inspirational play.\n\n\"Jimmy Johnson has not only been a great football player, he has been one of the game's finest citizens throughout his career,\" Joe Thomas, the team's vice president and general manager at that time said when the 49ers retired Johnson's No. 37 jersey in 1977. \"There is no one in the NFL who does not have the highest respect for him, both as a player and as a man.\"", "source": {"uri": "kansas.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wichita Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Few, if any, had a more diverse skill set as an athlete than Jimmy Johnson. The celebrated San Francisco 49er died Wednesday night at age 86.\n\nJohnson was a three-time All-Pro as a cornerback, and member of the NFL 1970s All-Decade Team. He intercepted 40 passes and made the Pro Bowl five times in a 16-year career from 1961-76. In 1994, he was selected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nA football and track standout in college, Johnson spent his entire professional career in San Francisco. He was among the 49ers' most outstanding players before the franchise rose to prominence under head coach Bill Walsh in the 1980s.\n\n\"Jimmy Johnson was extraordinarily athletically talented,\" Hall of Fame President Jim Porter told the Associated Press. \"The 49ers enjoyed the luxury of using him on offense and defense early in his career to fill team needs. Once he settled in at left cornerback, he flourished. The notion that a 'lockdown' cornerback could cut the field in half for the opposition was true with Jimmy. Only rarely would other teams' quarterbacks even look his direction, and more often than not regretted the decision if they challenged him.\"\n\nThe 49ers drafted Johnson sixth overall in 1961 out of UCLA, and he became a starter almost immediately as a cornerback. He had five interceptions as a rookie. The San Diego Chargers, then of the American Football League, selected Johnson in the fourth round of that year's draft as well.\n\nIn 1962, Johnson's second season with the 49ers, he caught 34 passes for 627 yards before switching back to the defensive side of the ball the following year. He finished his career with 47 interceptions on defense -- two for touchdowns -- and seven fumble recoveries in 213 games.\n\nAt UCLA, Johnson won the NCAA championship in the 110-meter hurdles in 1960, in addition to a standout career on the gridiron. His brother, Rafer, dominated track and field in college and parlayed that skill into an Olympic gold medal in the decathlon in 1960.\n\nThe Johnsons were born in Texas and raised in the Fresno County town of Kingsburg. Jim Johnson was inducted into the Fresno Athletic Hall of Fame in 1978.\n\nAccording to the Fresno Athletic Hall of Fame, Johnson enjoyed fishing and golf in his retirement years while often working as a motivational speaker for local charities, schools and golf events.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Pro Football Hall of Fame announced his death Thursday.\n\nJohnson grew up in the Fresno County town of Kingsburg, Calif., was a football and track star at UCLA and was so beloved by the 49ers they retired his number, 37, a year after he played his last snap in 1976.\n\nHe played 16 NFL seasons, all of them with the 49ers. He missed only 12 games in that span, an amazing feat for someone with an every-down role on defense until he was 38 years old. He was named to five Pro Bowls, won the Pro Football Writers' George Halas Award for courageous play in 1971 and was a two-time winner of the Len Eshmont Award, the 49ers' highest honor and one voted on by the players. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1994.\n\nHis 47 career interceptions were the most ever for the 49ers until Ronnie Lott broke that mark in 1989. Lott grew up an NFL superfan, loved all of the greats of the 1960s and early 1970s and always had a special admiration for Johnson.\n\n\"A great person,\" Lott said of Johnson in 2022.\n\nDespite his accolades, Johnson wasn't the most famous athlete in his family. His older brother, Rafer, was the first Black captain of a U.S. Olympic team. He carried the U.S. flag into Rome's Olympic Stadium in 1960 and won a gold medal in the decathlon.\n\nRafer didn't compete after his decathlon gold, instead becoming a goodwill ambassador and taking a leadership role with the Special Olympics. He became close to the Kennedy family and was with Sen. Robert F. Kennedy the night the presidential candidate was fatally shot at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Rafer, former NFL star Rosey Grier and journalist George Plimpton helped subdue the assassin movements after the shots were fired.\n\nRafer passed away in 2020 at age 86.\n\n\"I've gotten more benefit from being Rafer's brother than I can begin to tell you,\" Johnson told The Fresno Bee in 1994. \"He's been my shining light, the person that I've looked up to. Most people, if they want an autograph of their sports hero, have to send off somewhere. I had my hero living with me.\"\n\nRafer and Jimmy attended UCLA where Rafer dominated in the decathlon and Jimmy specialized in the 110-meter hurdles and the long jump. He was the NCAA champion in the high hurdles in 1960 and he once posted a 25-foot jump. All the while, Jimmy was a two-way player at UCLA, lining up at wingback and defensive back.\n\nThe 49ers made him the first of three first-round picks in 1961, selecting Johnson with the sixth pick and then taking receiver Bernie Casey and quarterback Billy Kilmer, who also played at UCLA, later in the round. Noting Johnson's speed and leaping ability, the 49ers' first thought was to make him a receiver.\n\nHe finished the 1962 season as the team's second-leading pass catcher and had an impressive 18.4-yard per-catch average. His 80-yard touchdown on a throw from John Brodie against the Bears that season was the deciding score in the 49ers' win and stood for a decade as the franchise's longest-scoring reception.\n\nIn 1964, however, injuries had depleted the 49ers' secondary and Johnson was moved to left cornerback. He became a fixture there until he retired. Dick Nolan, a defensive specialist and the 49ers' head coach from 1968 to 1975, said Johnson was the greatest defensive back he'd ever coached. Johnson also served as the players' spokesman and Nolan knew that if Johnson came to him with a request it was serious.\n\nThe two had a good relationship. Before he passed in 2007, Nolan recalled the time Johnson entered his office to negotiate his contract. To gain a psychological advantage, the cornerback sat across from the head coach wearing dark sunglasses. The famously taciturn Nolan merely reached into his desk, put on his own pair of sunglasses and stared back until Johnson couldn't take it anymore and burst out laughing.\n\nJohnson was a perennial Hall of Fame finalist during the 1980s but had to wait until 1994 to get in. He may have suffered from lack of exposure during his playing days. For one, the 49ers never won a championship during his tenure, always seeming to come up short to the hated Dallas Cowboys. And while his 47 career interceptions were impressive, they didn't rank in the top 30 on the all-time list even in 1994.\n\nPlayers from his era, however, noted there was a reason Johnson's statistics weren't gaudier: Quarterbacks were scared to throw in his direction. He played a physical form of press coverage and was one of the first so-called \"shut-down\" cornerbacks. Opponents like Bart Starr, Johnny Unitas and Joe Namath simply avoided him.\n\n\"Why would I want to throw a pass somewhere when I only had a 50-50 chance of completing it?\" Namath told the San Jose Mercury News in 1994.\n\nJohnson was 55 when he learned he would finally be inducted into the Hall of Fame.\n\n\"I'm still in a state of disbelief,\" he told The Fresno Bee in 1994. \"Nothing in my athletic career has come easy. You look at the dream, you look at the rainbow, and you hope you can get to that pot of gold. I didn't believe it until I received the phone call.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_barrows@theathletic.com", "name": "Matt Barrows", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Johnson_(American_football_coach)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Lott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ronnie Lott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Decathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Halas_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Halas Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Len_Eshmont", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Len Eshmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Nolan_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dick Nolan (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retired_number", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Retired number"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsburg,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kingsburg, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kingsburg, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fresno County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fresno County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Kilmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billy Kilmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Casey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Casey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosey_Grier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rosey Grier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fresno_Bee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Fresno Bee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambassador_Hotel_(Los_Angeles)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Plimpton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Plimpton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Stadium_(Montreal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Stadium (Montreal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/110_metres_hurdles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "110 metres hurdles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

A Pro Football Hall of Famer, Johnson grabbed 47 career interceptions before retiring.\n\nJohnson was named First-Team All-Pro four times and Second-Team All-Pro five times. A five-time pro Bowler, Johnson was named to the NFL's 1970s All-Decade team.\n\nHis No. 37 jersey is retired by the 49ers organization and he was inducted into the team's Hall of Fame.\n\nIn addition to his 47 interceptions, he logged 615 return yards and two defensive touchdowns. The Pro Football Hall of Fame regards Johnson as \"one of the best man-to-man defenders in history.\"\n\nA Dallas native, Johnson moved to central California when he was just a boy and attended Kingsburg High School in Fresno County.\n\nHis older brother Rafer was also a star at the same high school and UCLA, winning the Gold Medal at the 1960 Summer Olympics in the decathlon.\n\nOnce Johnson attended UCLA after his brother, he played wingback and defensive back for the Bruins.

DeBartolo Sr. 49ers Hall of Fame inaugural class (2009), Johnson was originally drafted by the 49ers as the sixth overall selection in the 1961 NFL Draft. He played his entire 16-year career in San Francisco where he registered 47 interceptions for 615 yards, including five his rookie year, and two touchdowns. He also started in five postseason contests for the 49ers. Johnson began his 49ers career as a defensive back but was moved to wide receiver during the 1962 season when he caught 34 passes for 627 yards and four touchdowns. His 47 career interceptions and 213 career regular season games are both the second-most in franchise history, while his 16 seasons played with the team are tied for the second-most in franchise history. Johnson was named a Pro Bowler five times (1969-72, 1974) and an All-Pro by the Associated Press on five occasions (First-Team 1970-72; Second-Team 1965-66).

Still, Johnson intercepted 47 passes and returned them for 615 yards.\n\n\"Jim doesn't get a lot of publicity because the opposition avoids him as much as possible,\" quarterback John Brodie, a former teammate, said in an interview during their playing days. \"Talk to veteran quarterbacks like JOHN'S UNITY And BART STARR and they'll tell you they don't call many pass patterns in Jimmy's area. The only reason Johnson doesn't lead the league in interceptions is because he doesn't get the opportunity.\"\n\nDick Nolan, the 49ers' head coach from 1968 to 1975, was a big Johnson fan.\n\n\"I coached three defensive backs that I thought were great, MEL RENFRO and Cornell Green with the Dallas Cowboys and Johnson,\" he said. \"Jimmy is the best I've ever seen.\"\n\nHall of Fame recipient FRED BILETNIKOFF also praised Johnson.\n\n\"I think Jim is one of the best corners in professional football,\" he said during their playing days. \"I just hope he makes some mistake so I can gain an advantage.

He played in three Pro Bowls and was selected for two others that he missed due to injuries.

The reason his honor came so late was because he never hit the drums himself.\n\nThe reserved Johnson waited nearly two decades before being elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nIn introducing his brother for enshrinement, Rafer Johnson said: \"Jimmy is a quiet man, but he played with determination and dedication.

He appeared in 213 games, more than any other 49ers player at the time of his retirement.\n\n\"Jimmy Johnson was extraordinarily athletically talented,\" Hall of Fame President Jim Porter said. \"The 49ers enjoyed the luxury of using him on offense and defense early in his career to fill team needs. Once he settled in at left cornerback, he flourished. The notion that a 'lockdown' cornerback could cut the field in half for the opposition was true with Jimmy. Only rarely would other teams' quarterbacks even look his direction, and more often than not regretted the decision if they challenged him.\"\n\nThe 49ers drafted Johnson sixth overall in 1961 out of UCLA -- the Chargers of the upstart AFL took him in the fourth round of that league's draft -- and he became a starter almost immediately as a cornerback. He had five interceptions as a rookie.\n\nBut he was so versatile that the Niners used Johnson on offense in 1962, when he made 34 receptions for 627 yards and scored four touchdowns.\n\nPreventing opponents from compiling such stats was his forte, however, and by 1964 Johnson was a fixture on the corner. He remained there until retiring after the 1976 season, totaling 47 interceptions, returning two for scores, and earning a reputation as a stingy cover man with a nose for the ball.\n\n\"Jimmy embodied the essence of what it meant to be a 49er,\" the team said in a statement. \"He was the ultimate gentleman and will be remembered for his humility, kindness and loveable demeanor.\"\n\nIn 1971, in the midst of a three-year run as an All-Pro, Johnson won the George Halas Award for courageous play.\n\n\"You have to be worked on, cornered in and cornered out to become as good as you can be,\" Johnson said when he entered the Hall of Fame. \"So actually I feel standing here today that I never reached that level, I never reached as good a football player as I could be. But thanks to God and inner talent I was able to present a picture to those individuals who were voting for the Hall of Fame, and my longevity and the level of game that I played from my rookie season to my last. That on this wondrous year of 1994 I've been given the opportunity, the glorious opportunity, to become a member of the most wonderful society: The National Football League Hall of Fame.\"\n\nIt reached the point when Johnson was at his peak that opponents rarely threw his way. He was Deion Sanders long before \"Prime Time\" hit the NFL.\n\n\"Jim doesn't receive much publicity because the opposition avoids him as much as possible,\" San Francisco quarterback John Brodie once said. \"Talk to veteran quarterbacks like John Unitas and Bart Starr and they'll tell you they call few pass patterns in Jimmy's area. The only reason Johnson doesn't lead the league in interceptions is he doesn't get the chance.\"\n\nFormer 49ers coach Dick Nolan once said Johnson was a better cornerback than two of his other players, (Hall of Famer) Mel Renfro and (two-time All-Pro) Cornell Green with the Cowboys.\n\nThe brother of Olympic decathlon champion Rafer Johnson, Jimmy Johnson played two ways at UCLA. He was a wingback on offense and a defensive back, while also competing in track as a hurdler and broad jumper.\n\nHis brother was Johnson's presenter for enshrinement in the Canton, Ohio, hall.\n\n\"Rafer Johnson is in fact my hero and that is an amazing thing in itself,\" Jimmy Johnson said that day. \"Most young men growing up usually have a hero in another town, another city, another country, and they will write to this individual, receive an autographed photo and then tack that photo up on the wall and worship that photo, play for that photo and get inspiration from that photo. No such problem for me.\n\n\"I had a brother living with me on a day-to-day basis that I was able to talk to, ask the pertinent questions, get the pertinent feedback and get corrected in my direction, if needed. I must say I must give brother Rafer credit for everything that I have accomplished in the field of athletics. And I just wish that we could split this trophy, this bust of myself, right down the middle because he surely deserves half of it.\"", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Johnson_(American_football_coach)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Halas_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Halas Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Renfro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mel Renfro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Nolan_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dick Nolan (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Big_Red_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornell Big Red football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brodie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Brodie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafer_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafer Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Unitas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Unitas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bart Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_jump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long jump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Squash", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Squash", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c28d1ae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1994x1122+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F50%2F75%2Fac9d6e2b46f4a3ed83c75153a691%2Fobit-johnson-54643.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554451", "eventUri": "eng-9554451", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 452992800, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 33, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 33}}}

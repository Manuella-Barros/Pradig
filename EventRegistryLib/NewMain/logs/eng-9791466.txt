Puigdemont, the former leader of Catalonia who left Spain after organizing an independence referendum in the Spanish northeastern region seven years ago, announced that he plans [...]\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Former Catalonia leader Carles Puigdemont, who fled Spain after organizing an independence referendum in the wealthy Spanish region nearly seven years ago that was declared illegal, returned to the country on Thursday despite a pending arrest warrant.\n\nPuigdemont defiantly appeared in Barcelona after traveling from Belgium and made a speech in front of a large crowd of supporters. He faces charges of embezzlement for his part in the attempt to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain in 2017.\n\nPuigdemont appeared in a central Barcelona park where several thousand separatist supporters who had gathered in expectation of his arrival waved Catalan flags. He punched the air to cheers on a bright, sunny day.\n\nAddressing the crowd, Puigdemont accused Spanish authorities of \"a crackdown\" on the Catalan separatist movement.\n\n\"For the last seven years we have been persecuted because we wanted to hear the voice of the Catalan people,\" Puigdemont said. \"They have made being Catalan into something suspicious.\"\n\nHe added: \"All people have the right to self-determination.\"\n\nAfter his speech, Puigdemont went into an adjacent marquee tent. There, he hurried out of an exit and jumped into a waiting car that sped away, according to an Associated Press photographer who witnessed his departure. Puigdemont's whereabouts weren't known, and police made no immediate comment.\n\nThe 2017 referendum organized by Puigdemont was declared illegal at the time both by Spain's central government and the Constitutional Court.\n\nPuigdemont has dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in northeast Spain -- a struggle which is decades-old. His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government.\n\nThe event was organized by his political party Together for Catalonia (Junts), hours before a new regional government was to take office nearby.\n\nLocal police were deployed in a security ring around a section of the park where Catalonia's parliament building is located behind walls. Puigdemont, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and tie, walked toward the building followed by masses of supporters.\n\nPuigdemont had earlier announced publicly he was going back to Spain, though he gave no travel details.\n\nPuigdemont's presence in Spain is likely to generate renewed political tension over the smoldering issue of Catalan independence. The failed secession attempt triggered a protracted constitutional crisis.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear how authorities would proceed if Puigdemont was arrested.\n\nA contentious amnesty bill, crafted by Spain's Socialist-led coalition government, could potentially clear Puigdemont and hundreds of other supporters of Catalan independence of any wrongdoing in the illegal 2017 ballot.\n\nBut the bill, approved by Spain's parliament earlier this year, is being challenged by the Supreme Court, which argues the pardon does not apply to embezzlement, unlike other crimes that Puigdemont had previously been charged with. Puigdemont could be placed in pretrial detention.\n\nThe former Catalan leader's return threatened to complicate a deal brokered after months of deadlock between Salvador Illa's Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) and the other main Catalan separatist party and left-wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC).\n\nThat deal had ensured just enough support in Catalonia's parliament for Illa to become the next regional president in an investiture debate Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name":

Spain's Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that an amnesty law for Catalan separatists that came into force earlier this year would not fully apply to him.\n\nIn a letter posted on social network X on Saturday, Puigdemont repeated his plans to return to Catalonia for the upcoming investiture vote.\n\n\"I know that my return may entail arrest and imprisonment, who knows for how long,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Just as going into exile was a political decision, returning from exile is also a political decision.\"\n\nPuigdemont's arrest would likely inflame the separatist base and could lead the

He faces charges of embezzlement for his part in the attempt to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain.\n\nAddressing the crowd, Puigdemont accused Spanish authorities of \"a crackdown\" on the Catalan separatist movement.\n\n\"For the last seven years we have been persecuted because we wanted to hear the voice of the Catalan people,\" Puigdemont said. \"They have made being Catalan into something suspicious.\"\n\nHe added: \"All people have the right to self-determination.\"\n\nThe 2017 referendum organized by Puigdemont was declared illegal at the time both by Spain's central government and the Constitutional Court.\n\nPuigdemont has dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in northeast Spain -- a struggle which is decades-old. His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government.\n\nPuigdemont appeared in a central Barcelona park where several thousand separatist supporters who had gathered in expectation of his arrival waved Catalan flags.

leader as ex-leader Puigdemont's arrest looms", "body": "The parliament of Spain's Catalonia region is set to elect a new leader this week, although the event may be upstaged by the return of its former leader from self-imposed exile, despite a pending warrant for his arrest.\n\nCarles Puigdemont is the figurehead of hardline separatist party Junts, and led Catalonia between 2016 and 2017 before fleeing Spain following a referendum on independence deemed illegal by the judiciary.\n\nIt remains unclear how he plans to return to the country and enter the regional parliament while evading police.\n\nJordi Turull, secretary-general of Junts, told broadcaster 324 on Tuesday that he would call for the leadership vote to be suspended if Puigdemont is detained, as \"it cannot take place in normal conditions\" without him present.\n\nThe vote to invest Socialist Salvador Illa, who will be backed by the left-wing separatist ERC party after a bilateral deal last week, will kick off on Thursday at 10 a.m. local time (0800 GMT), according to the parliamentary speaker.\n\nThe Spanish parliament passed an amnesty law in May pardoning those involved in the failed 2017 secession bid, but the Supreme Court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and two others, who were also charged with embezzlement, ruling that the amnesty law does not apply to them.\n\nA source close to Puigdemont told Reuters he had \"no doubt\" that the former leader - who lived in Belgium between 2017 and 2024 while serving as a member of the European Parliament and has in recent months been based in southern France - would be arrested upon re-entering Spain and brought before the Supreme Court in Madrid.\n\nPolitical scientist Toni Rodon of Barcelona's Pompeu Fabra University told Reuters that Puidgemont had possibly decided to come back because of the personal toll of living in exile.\n\n\"The amnesty has changed the game play, and the other strategy he can pursue can be more useful inside the Spanish borders even if he ends up in jail,\" Rodon added.\n\nIn an open letter posted on his X account on Friday, Puigdemont described Spain's efforts to detain him as a \"hybrid coup\", adding \"if they succeed, I imagine what awaits me and know what I must do\".\n\nERC spokesperson Raquel Sans acknowledged on Tuesday that Puigdemont's arrest could delay the vote for a new Catalan leader.\n\nPolice will try to arrest Puigdemont before he reaches the heavily guarded parliament building in Barcelona, but are also authorised to enter if needed, El Periodico newspaper reported, citing police sources.\n\nOfficers were also monitoring the sewer system in case it was used for alternative entry routes.\n\nIn 2011, then-leader Artur Mas was forced to access the building's rooftop by helicopter after it was surrounded by nearly 1,000 anti-austerity activists protesting against budget cuts.", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"},

He faces charges of embezzlement for his part in the attempt to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain in 2017.\n\nPuigdemont appeared in a central Barcelona park where several thousand separatist supporters who had gathered in expectation of his arrival waved Catalan flags. He punched the air to cheers on a bright, sunny day.\n\nAddressing the crowd, Puigdemont accused Spanish authorities of \"a crackdown\" on the Catalan separatist movement.\n\n\"For the last seven years we have been persecuted because we wanted to hear the voice of the Catalan people,\" Puigdemont said. \"They have made being Catalan into something suspicious.\"\n\nHe added: \"All people have the right to self-determination.\"\n\nAfter his speech, Puigdemont went into an adjacent marquee tent. There, he hurried out of an exit and jumped into a waiting car that sped away, according to an Associated Press photographer who witnessed his departure. Puigdemont's whereabouts weren't known, and police made no immediate comment.\n\nThe 2017 referendum organized by Puigdemont was declared illegal at the time both by Spain's central government and the Constitutional Court.\n\nPuigdemont has dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in northeast Spain -- a struggle which is decades-old. His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government.\n\nThe event was organized by his political party Together for Catalonia (Junts), hours before a new regional government was to take office nearby.\n\nLocal police were deployed in a security ring around a section of the park where Catalonia's parliament building is located behind walls. Puigdemont, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and tie, walked toward the building followed by masses of supporters.\n\nPuigdemont had earlier announced publicly he was going back to Spain, though he gave no travel details.\n\nPuigdemont's presence in Spain is likely to generate renewed political tension over the smoldering issue of Catalan independence. The failed secession attempt triggered a protracted constitutional crisis.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear how authorities would proceed if Puigdemont was arrested.\n\nA contentious amnesty bill, crafted by Spain's Socialist-led coalition government, could potentially clear Puigdemont and hundreds of other supporters of Catalan independence of any wrongdoing in the illegal 2017 ballot.\n\nBut the bill, approved by Spain's parliament earlier this year, is being challenged by the Supreme Court, which argues the pardon does not apply to embezzlement, unlike other crimes that Puigdemont had previously been charged with. Puigdemont could be placed in pretrial detention.\n\nThe former Catalan leader's return threatened to complicate a deal brokered after months of deadlock between Salvador Illa's Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) and the other main Catalan separatist party and left-wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC).\n\nThat deal had ensured just enough support in Catalonia's parliament for Illa to become the next regional president in an investiture debate Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "keyt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsChannel 3-12"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@keyt.com", "name":

"body": "Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont is returning after seven years in self-imposed exile to Spain, where he will likely be arrested over his role in the region's 2017 independence bid.\n\nHis arrest and potential imprisonment before he might face trial could unleash fresh turmoil in Catalonia and threaten the fragile Socialist-led coalition ruling Spain, which relies on Puigdemont's hardline Junts party to pass legislation.\n\nTo secure Junts' legislative support for Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's government, Spain's parliament in May approved an amnesty law designed to allow Puigdemont a safe return from Belgium.\n\nThe amnesty aimed to cancel legal proceedings against hundreds of separatists involved in Catalonia's 2017 illegal referendum, but Spain's Supreme Court ruled in July the law did not apply to an embezzlement charge against Puigdemont and upheld an arrest warrant he faces.\n\nStill, Puigdemont said he remained committed to attending the Catalan parliament's session that is due to swear in the region's new leader following an election in May, in which Puigdemont finished second.\n\nThe swearing-in is scheduled for Thursday.\n\nPuigdemont said he would keep his word and be in Barcelona then.\n\n\"I have started the return trip from exile,\" he said in a video posted on X.\n\nHe also said in the video message that his arrest would be illegal and arbitrary.\n\nNeither Puigdemont nor Junts said on Wednesday whether he had already entered Spain.\n\nThursday's session is poised to appoint Socialist Salvador Illa as the new Catalan president, ending more than a decade of separatist governments.\n\nPuigdemont's supporters plan to welcome him on Thursday morning on a Barcelona boulevard near the regional parliament, setting the stage for a potentially dramatic arrest.\n\nModerate separatist party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, currently governing Catalonia, called Puigdemont's return an \"exceptional moment\" and said it would attend the welcoming event.\n\nThat might require a delicate balancing act from the party, which as leader of the regional government is responsible for the regional police force that could arrest Puigdemont.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The political event in Barcelona is likely to gather many Puigdemont supporters.\n\nThe Mossos D'Esquadra, the regional police in Catalonia, say that they intend to obey court orders to arrest Puigdemont, if he does return.\n\nIn his announcement made on YouTube, Puigdemont recognized that he \"cannot attend freely\" the scheduled parliamentary session and accused authorities of \"a long persecution\" over the unsuccessful breakaway attempt.\n\n\"This challenge must be answered and confronted,\" he said.\n\nPuigdemont's return is likely to generate renewed political tension over the smoldering issue of Catalan independence.

He is a celebrated figurehead for many Catalans who want to break away from the rest of Spain.\n\nEarlier this year, Puigdemont denied that he had hidden in a car trunk to avoid detection while slipping across the border after the referendum.

The search for former Catalan president and pro-independence leader Carles Puigdemont by the Mossos d'Esquadra has clogged the main roads, resulting in traffic jams. The officers have activated operation 'cage' to locate the former president, who remains missing after returning to Barcelona following seven years of avoiding arrest for organising an independence referendum in 2017.\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Police launched a manhunt in Barcelona on Thursday for ex-Catalonia leader and fugitive Carles Puigdemont, a celebrated campaigner for Catalan independence who made a sensational return to Spain and an equally sensational getaway from a speech in the city with the alleged help of a local police officer.\n\nThe events took place nearly seven years after Puigdemont fled Spain after a failed independence bid, with an outstanding arrest warrant pending against him.\n\nPuigdemont had previously announced his intention to be in Spain on a day that Catalonia's parliament is due to swear in a new president. The 61-year-old initially lived in Belgium after bolting from Spain in 2017, but his latest place of residence wasn't known.\n\nPuigdemont kept his travel plans secret before setting out to the wealthy Catalan region in northeastern Spain. He gave a speech in front of a large crowd of supporters in central Barcelona under the noses of police officers, who made no attempt to detain him.\n\nAfter his speech, in a cloak-and-dagger moment, Puigdemont went into an adjacent marquee tent. There, he hurried out of an exit and jumped into a waiting car that sped away, according to an Associated Press photographer who witnessed his departure.\n\nCatalan police arrested one of their own officers on charges of aiding Puigdemont's getaway, the force's press office told The Associated Press. No further details were available.\n\nAbout three hours after Puigdemont vanished, Catalan police called off the manhunt without saying why.\n\nThe Catalan police force is called Mossos d'Esquadra and operates separately from Spain's Policia Nacional. At the time of the 2017 ballot, the Spanish government suspended the Mossos' chief and placed the force under investigation for failing to stop the vote. The chief and his staff were eventually exonerated.\n\nAuthorities, who may have wanted to avoid confrontation with the crowd of several thousand separatist supporters, had set up a police cordon at the nearby regional parliament where Puigdemont was expected to go afterward.\n\nOnce Puigdemont had slipped away, roadside police units checked vehicles across the city of around 1.6 million people in an effort to nab him. The checks snarled city traffic. Police also checked vehicles heading on highways to neighboring France.\n\nPuigdemont faces charges of embezzlement for his part in an attempt to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain in 2017. As regional president and separatist party leader at the time, he was a key player in an independence referendum that was outlawed by the central government but went ahead anyway.\n\nThose events triggered a political crisis that roiled Spain for months.\n\nPuigdemont's appearance in Barcelona, Catalonia's capital, and his game of cat-and-mouse with police, stole the show on a day when a new government was being sworn in at the regional parliament.\n\nLocal police were deployed in a security ring around a section of the park where Catalonia's parliament building is located behind walls. Meanwhile, Puigdemont, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and tie, walked with supporters to the nearby stage where he gave his speech.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nAddressing the crowd in the park and at times pumping his fist, Puigdemont accused Spanish authorities of \"a crackdown\" on the Catalan separatist movement.\n\n\"For the last seven years we have been persecuted because we wanted to hear the voice of the Catalan people,\" Puigdemont said. \"They have made being Catalan into something suspicious.\"\n\nHe added: \"All people have the right to self-determination.\"\n\nThe gripping turn of events, broadcast live on Spanish television channels, was likely to bring political recriminations.\n\nThe leader of the Popular Party, the main opposition to Spain's left-of-center coalition government which has long rebuffed Catalonia's independence movement, condemned Puigdemont's return. Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o posted on X that Puigdemont's reappearance was an \"unbearable humiliation\" that damaged Spain's reputation.\n\nSpain's government encouraged a deal brokered after months of deadlock between Salvador Illa's Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) and the other main Catalan separatist party and left-wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC). That deal had ensured just enough support in Catalonia's parliament for Illa to become the next regional president Thursday.\n\nSpeaking to Catalan lawmakers before the vote, Illa called for reconciliation and respect for Spain's controversial amnesty bill. He vowed to govern for all Catalans after years of bitter divisions between those in favor of independence and those against it.\n\nPuigdemont has dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in northeast Spain -- a struggle which is decades-old. His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government.\n\nA contentious amnesty bill, crafted by Spain's Socialist-led coalition government, could potentially clear Puigdemont and hundreds of other supporters of Catalan independence of any wrongdoing in the 2017 ballot. Spain's central government and the Constitutional Court declared at the time that the referendum was illegal.\n\nBut the bill, approved by Spain's parliament earlier this year, is being challenged by the Supreme Court, which argues the pardon doesn't apply to embezzlement, unlike other crimes that Puigdemont had previously been charged with.\n\nPuigdemont could be placed in pretrial detention if he is arrested.\n\nBarry Hatton reported from Lisbon, Portugal.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri":

ALSO READ: Pro-independence ERC party backs socialists to form government in Catalonia.\n\nIn a video posted on social media with English subtitles (see below), Puigdemont explained that 'in normal democratic conditions, for an MP like me to announce his intention to attend that session would be unnecessary'.\n\nPuigdemont is the figurehead of hardline pro-independence Junts per Catalunya (JxCat) party, and led Catalonia between 2016 and 2017 before fleeing Spain following a referendum on independence deemed illegal by the judiciary.\n\nThe Spanish parliament passed an amnesty law in May pardoning those involved in the failed 2017 secession bid, but the Supreme Court has upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and two others, who were also charged with embezzlement, ruling that the amnesty law does not apply to them. ALSO READ: Controversial Catalan amnesty law gets final approval in Spanish Congress.\n\nIt remains unclear how Puigdemont plans to return to the country and enter the regional parliament while evading police.\n\nThe Catalan police, the Mossos d'Esquadra, are putting together an increased security plan for around and inside Barcelona's Ciutadella park, where the Catalan Parliament is located, ahead of Thursday.\n\nThe Mossos will deploy additional officers ahead of the expected return of Puigdemont, with the aim of preventing him from entering the parliament building.\n\nOn Wednesday, dozens of security agents were already deployed around the park to control access and movements of potential demonstrators. Authorities plan to close the park and restrict access to any non-accredited person.\n\nThere will also be riot police deployed in the area in anticipation of two opposing demonstrations regarding the arrest of Puigdemont, one organised by the far-right Vox party and another by the former president's own party, JxCat.\n\nJordi Turull, secretary-general of JxCat, told Catalan broadcaster 324 on Tuesday that he would call for the leadership vote to be suspended if Puigdemont is detained, as 'it cannot take place in normal conditions' without him present.\n\nThe vote to invest Salvador Illa, who will be backed by the more moderate pro-independence party, Esquerra Republicana (ERC), after a bilateral deal last week, will kick off on Thursday at 10am local time.\n\nPuigdemont lived in Belgium from 2017 to 2024 while serving as a member of the European Parliament but has in recent months been based in southern France. Spanish media reports that he will be arrested upon re-entering Spain and brought before the Supreme Court in Madrid.\n\nIn an open letter posted on his X account on Friday, Puigdemont described Spain's efforts to detain him as a 'hybrid coup', adding 'if they succeed, I imagine what awaits me and know what I must do'.\n\nERC spokesperson Raquel Sans acknowledged on Tuesday that Puigdemont's arrest could delay the vote for a new Catalan leader.\n\nPolice will try to arrest Puigdemont before he reaches the heavily guarded parliament building in Barcelona, but are also authorised to enter if needed, El Periodico newspaper reported, citing police sources.\n\nPuigdemont's party, JxCat, has announced on social media a 'welcoming' gathering for him at 9am on Thursday in the Passeig Llu\u00eds Companys in Barcelona. The Catalan investiture debate is scheduled to start at 10am in the parliament, just a short walk away.\n\nIn 2011, then-leader Artur Mas was forced to access the building's rooftop by helicopter

Meanwhile, Puigdemont, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and tie, walked with supporters to the nearby stage where he gave his speech.\n\nAddressing the crowd in the park and at times pumping his fist, Puigdemont accused Spanish authorities of \"a crackdown\" on the Catalan separatist movement.\n\n\"For the last seven years we have been persecuted because we wanted to hear the voice of the Catalan people,\" Puigdemont said. \"They have made being Catalan into something suspicious.\"\n\nHe added: \"All people have the right to self-determination.\"\n\nThe turn of events was likely to bring political recriminations.\n\nThe leader of the Popular Party, the main opposition to Spain's left-of-center coalition government which has long rebuffed Catalonia's independence movement, condemned Puigdemont's return. Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o posted on X that Puigdemont's reappearance was an \"unbearable humiliation\" that damaged Spain's reputation.\n\nSpain's government encouraged a deal brokered after months of deadlock between Salvador Illa's Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) and the other main Catalan separatist party and left-wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC). That deal had ensured just enough support in Catalonia's parliament for Illa to become the next regional president Thursday.\n\nSpeaking to Catalan lawmakers before the vote, Illa called for reconciliation and respect for Spain's controversial amnesty bill. He vowed to govern for all Catalans after years of bitter divisions between those in favor of independence and those against it.\n\nPuigdemont has dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in northeast Spain -- a struggle which is decades-old. His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government.\n\nA contentious amnesty bill, crafted by Spain's Socialist-led coalition government, could potentially clear Puigdemont and hundreds of other supporters of Catalan independence of any wrongdoing in the 2017 ballot. Spain's central government and the Constitutional Court declared at the time that the referendum was illegal.\n\nBut the bill, approved by Spain's parliament earlier this year, is being challenged by the Supreme Court, which argues the pardon doesn't apply to embezzlement, unlike other crimes that Puigdemont had previously been charged with.\n\nPuigdemont could be placed in pretrial detention if he is arrested.\n\nBarry Hatton reported from Lisbon, Portugal.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Catalonia region is set to elect a new leader this week, although the event may be upstaged by the return of its former leader from self-imposed exile, despite a pending warrant for his arrest, APA reports citing Reuters.\n\nCarles Puigdemont is the figurehead of hardline separatist party Junts, and led Catalonia between 2016 and 2017 before fleeing Spain following a referendum on independence deemed illegal by the judiciary.\n\nIt remains unclear how he plans to return to the country and enter the regional parliament while evading police.\n\nJordi Turull, secretary-general of Junts, told broadcaster 324 on Tuesday that he would call for the leadership vote to be suspended if Puigdemont is detained, as \"it cannot take place in normal conditions\" without him present.\n\nThe vote to invest Socialist Salvador Illa, who will be backed by the left-wing separatist ERC party after a bilateral deal last week, will kick off on Thursday at 10 a.m. local time (0800 GMT), according to the parliamentary speaker.\n\nThe Spanish parliament passed an amnesty law in May pardoning those involved in the failed 2017 secession bid, but the Supreme Court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and two others, who were also charged with embezzlement, ruling that the amnesty law does not apply to them.\n\nA source close to Puigdemont told Reuters he had \"no doubt\" that the former leader - who lived in Belgium between 2017 and 2024 while serving as a member of the European Parliament and has in recent months been based in southern France - would be arrested upon re-entering Spain and brought before the Supreme Court in Madrid.\n\nPolitical scientist Toni Rodon of Barcelona's Pompeu Fabra University told Reuters that Puidgemont had possibly decided to come back because of the personal toll of living in exile.\n\n\"The amnesty has changed the game play, and the other strategy he can pursue can be more useful inside the Spanish borders even if he ends up in jail,\" Rodon added.\n\nIn an open letter posted on his X account on Friday, Puigdemont described Spain's efforts to detain him as a \"hybrid coup\", adding \"if they succeed, I imagine what awaits me and know what I must do\".\n\nERC spokesperson Raquel Sans acknowledged on Tuesday that Puigdemont's arrest could delay the vote for a new Catalan leader.\n\nPolice will try to arrest Puigdemont before he reaches the heavily guarded parliament building in Barcelona, but are also authorised to enter if needed, El Periodico newspaper reported, citing police sources.\n\nOfficers were also monitoring the sewer system in case it was used for alternative entry routes.\n\nIn 2011, then-leader Artur Mas was forced to access the building's rooftop by helicopter after it was surrounded by nearly 1,000 anti-austerity activists protesting against budget cuts.\n\nZelensky: US, China or EU can mediate between Russia and Ukraine, not Hungary T\u00fcrkiye's National Security Council to mull normalization

Madrid imposed direct rule on the region shortly after and Mr Puigdemont fled to Belgium.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Puigdemont briefly addressed hundreds of supporters who gathered near the Catalan parliament in Barcelona, shortly ahead of the expected investiture of a new head of the Catalan government.\n\nHe said he had returned \"to remind you that we are still here\" and added: \"Holding a referendum is not and will never be a crime.\"\n\nPuigdemont then disappeared.\n\nMany were expecting him to turn up inside the parliament building in time for the investiture ceremony at 10:00 (08:00 GMT), but he was nowhere to be seen.\n\nRoadblocks have now been set up across the city, a spokesperson for Catalonia's interior department said in a statement.\n\nSpanish TV also showed images from La Jonquera, a municipality bordering France, where police could be seen stopping cars and checking their boots.\n\nPuidgemont ally Aleix Sarri criticized the police operation on X, saying: \"Hundreds of policemen encircle Barcelona to arrest President Puigdemont. A hunt paid with public money to please the powers in Madrid. This is not what a democracy does.\"\n\nPolice reportedly used pepper spray to disperse Puigdemont supporters who gathered near the parliament.\n\nIgnacio Garriga of the far-right Vox party, which strongly opposes independence for Catalonia, said Vox would \"do everything necessary to ensure that Puigdemont is arrested\".\n\nSome Spanish commentators are puzzled at the fact that police were unable to arrest Mr Puigdemont despite him announcing he would return to Catalonia earlier this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, he posted a video on X saying that he had \"started the return trip from exile\" and added that his arrest would have been illegal and arbitrary.\n\nThere appear to be several motives behind Carles Puigdemont's return to Spain.\n\nFirstly, he wants to pressure the authorities into applying the country's new amnesty law - which withdraws legal action against Catalan nationalists - to him, after the supreme court excluded him from its application on technical grounds.\n\nHe also aims to disrupt the investiture of Socialist Salvador Illa as the new Catalan president today.\n\nThe former Spanish health minister would become the region's first non-nationalist leader since 2010.\n\nEqually important for Puigdemont is to assert himself and his Junts per Catalunya (JxCat) party as the main pro-independence force.\n\nHe is keen to cast his separatist rival, the Catalan Republican Left (ERC), as being complicit with Spanish unionism because of its agreement to support Mr Illa's investiture.\n\nUntil a new local government is in place, ERC is still responsible for the Catalan police force, making the former regional president's return particularly uncomfortable for the party. -- BBC", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Saudi

But then he vanishes again", "body": "Not a subscriber? Buy a Day Pass or just this story using our new Digital Wallet\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Police launched a manhunt in Barcelona on Thursday for ex-Catalonia leader and fugitive Carles Puigdemont, a celebrated campaigner for Catalan independence who made a sensational return to Spain and an equally sensational getaway from a speech in the city with the alleged help of a local police officer.\n\nThe events took place nearly seven years after Puigdemont fled Spain after a failed independence bid, with an outstanding arrest warrant pending against him.\n\nPuigdemont had previously announced his intention to be in Spain on a day that Catalonia's parliament is due to swear in a new president. The 61-year-old initially lived in Belgium after bolting from Spain in 2017, but his latest place of residence wasn't known.\n\nPuigdemont kept his travel plans secret before setting out to the wealthy Catalan region in northeastern Spain. He gave a speech in front of a large crowd of supporters in central Barcelona under the noses of police officers, who made no attempt to detain him.\n\nAfter his speech, in a cloak-and-dagger moment, Puigdemont went into an adjacent marquee tent. There, he hurried out of an exit and jumped into a waiting car that sped away, according to an Associated Press photographer who witnessed his departure.\n\nCatalan police arrested one of their own officers on charges of aiding Puigdemont's getaway, the force's press office told The Associated Press. No further details were available.\n\nAbout three hours after Puigdemont vanished, Catalan police called off the manhunt without saying why.\n\nThe Catalan police force is called Mossos d'Esquadra and operates separately from Spain's Policia Nacional. At the time of the 2017 ballot, the Spanish government suspended the Mossos' chief and placed the force under investigation for failing to stop the vote. The chief and his staff were eventually exonerated.\n\nAuthorities, who may have wanted to avoid confrontation with the crowd of several thousand separatist supporters, had set up a police cordon at the nearby regional parliament where Puigdemont was expected to go afterward.\n\nOnce Puigdemont had slipped away, roadside police units checked vehicles across the city of around 1.6 million people in an effort to nab him. The checks snarled city traffic. Police also checked vehicles heading on highways to neighboring France.\n\nPuigdemont faces charges of embezzlement for his part in an attempt to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain in 2017. As regional president and separatist party leader at the time, he was a key player in an independence referendum that was outlawed by the central government but went ahead anyway.\n\nThose events triggered a political crisis that roiled Spain for months.\n\nPuigdemont's appearance in Barcelona, Catalonia's capital, and his game of cat-and-mouse with police, stole the show on a day when a new government was being sworn in at the regional parliament.\n\nLocal police were deployed in a security ring around a section of the park where Catalonia's parliament building is located behind walls. Meanwhile, Puigdemont, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and tie, walked with supporters to the nearby stage where he gave his speech.\n\nAddressing the crowd in the park and at times pumping his fist, Puigdemont accused Spanish authorities of \"a crackdown\" on the Catalan separatist movement.\n\n\"For the last seven years we have been persecuted because we wanted to hear the voice of the Catalan people,\" Puigdemont said. \"They have made being Catalan into something suspicious.\"\n\nHe added: \"All people have the right to self-determination.\"\n\nThe gripping turn of events, broadcast live on Spanish television channels, was likely to bring political recriminations.\n\nThe leader of the Popular Party, the main opposition to Spain's left-of-center coalition government which has long rebuffed Catalonia's independence movement, condemned Puigdemont's return. Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o posted on X that Puigdemont's reappearance was an \"unbearable humiliation\" that damaged Spain's reputation.\n\nSpain's government encouraged a deal brokered after months of deadlock between Salvador Illa's Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) and the other main Catalan separatist party and left-wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC). That deal had ensured just enough support in Catalonia's parliament for Illa to become the next regional president Thursday.\n\nSpeaking to Catalan lawmakers before the vote, Illa called for reconciliation and respect for Spain's controversial amnesty bill. He vowed to govern for all Catalans after years of bitter divisions between those in favor of independence and those against it.\n\nPuigdemont has dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in northeast Spain -- a struggle which is decades-old. His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government.\n\nA contentious amnesty bill, crafted by Spain's Socialist-led coalition government, could potentially clear Puigdemont and hundreds of other supporters of Catalan independence of any wrongdoing in the 2017 ballot. Spain's central government and the Constitutional Court declared at the time that the referendum was illegal.\n\nBut the bill, approved by Spain's parliament earlier this year, is being challenged by the Supreme Court, which argues the pardon doesn't apply to embezzlement, unlike other crimes that Puigdemont had previously been charged with.\n\nPuigdemont could be placed in pretrial detention if he is arrested.\n\nBarry Hatton reported from Lisbon, Portugal.", "source": {"uri": "news-gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News-Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The 61-year-old fugitive initially lived in Belgium after bolting from Spain in 2017, but his latest place of residence wasn't known.\n\nPuigdemont kept his travel plans secret before setting out to the wealthy Catalan region in northeastern Spain. He gave a speech in front of a large crowd of supporters in central Barcelona under the noses of police officers, who made no attempt to detain him.\n\nAfter his speech, in a cloak-and-dagger moment, Puigdemont went into an adjacent marquee tent. There, he hurried out of an exit and jumped into a waiting car that sped away, according to an Associated Press photographer who witnessed his departure.\n\nCatalan police arrested one of their own officers on charges of aiding Puigdemont's getaway, the force's press office told The Associated Press. No further details were available.\n\nAuthorities, who may have wanted to avoid confrontation with the crowd of several thousand separatist supporters, had set up a police cordon at the nearby regional parliament where Puigdemont was expected to go afterward.\n\nOnce Puigdemont had slipped away, roadside police units checked vehicles across the city of around 1.6 million people in an effort to nab him. The checks snarled city traffic. Police also checked vehicles heading on highways to neighboring France.\n\nPuigdemont faces charges of embezzlement for his part in an attempt to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain in 2017. As regional president and separatist party leader at the time, he was a key player in an independence referendum that was outlawed by the central government but went ahead anyway.\n\nThose events triggered a political crisis that roiled Spain for months.\n\nPuigdemont's appearance in Barcelona, Catalonia's capital, and his game of cat-and-mouse with police, stole the show on a day when a new government was being sworn in at the regional parliament.\n\nLocal police were deployed in a security ring around a section of the park where Catalonia's parliament building is located behind walls. Meanwhile, Puigdemont, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and tie, walked with supporters to the nearby stage where he gave his speech.\n\nAddressing the crowd in the park and at times pumping his fist, Puigdemont accused Spanish authorities of \"a crackdown\" on the Catalan separatist movement.\n\n\"For the last seven years we have been persecuted because we wanted to hear the voice of the Catalan people,\" Puigdemont said. \"They have made being Catalan into something suspicious.\"\n\nHe added: \"All people have the right to self-determination.\"\n\nThe gripping turn of events, broadcast live on Spanish television channels, was likely to bring political recriminations.\n\nThe leader of the Popular Party, the main opposition to Spain's left-of-center coalition government which has long rebuffed Catalonia's independence movement, condemned Puigdemont's return. Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o posted on X that Puigdemont's reappearance was an \"unbearable humiliation\" that damaged Spain's reputation.\n\nSpain's government encouraged a deal brokered after months of deadlock between Salvador Illa's Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) and the other main Catalan separatist party and left-wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC). That deal had ensured just enough support in Catalonia's parliament for Illa to become the next regional president Thursday.\n\nSpeaking to Catalan lawmakers before the vote, Illa called for reconciliation and respect for Spain's controversial amnesty bill. He vowed to govern for all Catalans after years of bitter divisions between those in favor of independence and those against it.\n\nPuigdemont has dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in northeast Spain -- a struggle which is decades-old. His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government.\n\nA contentious amnesty bill, crafted by Spain's Socialist-led coalition government, could potentially clear Puigdemont and hundreds of other supporters of Catalan independence of any wrongdoing in the 2017 ballot. Spain's central government and the Constitutional Court declared at the time that the referendum was illegal.\n\nBut the bill, approved by Spain's parliament earlier this year, is being challenged by the Supreme Court, which argues the pardon doesn't apply to embezzlement, unlike other crimes that Puigdemont had previously been charged with.\n\nPuigdemont could be placed in pretrial detention if he is arrested.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carles_Puigdemont", "type":

Puigdemont said he would keep his word and be in Barcelona then.\n\n\"I have started the return trip from exile,\" he said in a video posted on X. He also said in the video message that his arrest would be illegal and arbitrary.\n\nNeither Puigdemont nor Junts on Wednesday said whether he had already entered Spain.\n\nThursday's session is poised to appoint Socialist Salvador Illa as the new Catalan president, ending over a decade of separatist governments.\n\nPuigdemont's supporters plan to welcome him on Thursday morning on a Barcelona boulevard near the regional parliament, setting the stage for a potentially dramatic arrest witnessed by reporters and bystanders.\n\nModerate separatist party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, currently governing Catalonia, called Puigdemont's return an \"exceptional moment\" and said it would attend the welcoming event.\n\nThat might require a delicate balancing act from the party, which as leader of the regional government is responsible for the regional police force that could arrest Puigdemont. Esquerra will also lend its key votes for Illa to be elected president in exchange for a deal under which Catalonia would gain autonomy in collecting and managing taxes.\n\nBoth Esquerra and Junts have backed the Socialist-led national government in Madrid.\n\nIf the judge in charge of his case issues a pre-trial imprisonment, Puigdemont is expected to appeal for his release to Spain's

His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain\u2019s central government.\n\nPuigdemont appeared in a central Barcelona park where several thousand separatist supporters who had gathered in expectation of his arrival waved Catalan flags. He punched the air to cheers on a bright, sunny day.\n\nThe event was organised by his political party Together for Catalonia (Junts), hours before a new regional government was to take office nearby.\n\nLocal police were deployed in a security ring around a section of the park where Catalonia\u2019s parliament building is located behind walls. Puigdemont walked toward the building followed by masses of supporters.\n\nPuigdemont had earlier announced publicly he was going back to Spain, though he gave no travel details.\n\nPuigdemont\u2019s presence in Spain is likely to generate renewed political tension over the smouldering issue of Catalan independence. The failed secession attempt triggered a protracted constitutional crisis.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear how authorities would proceed if Puigdemont was arrest.\n\nA contentious amnesty bill, crafted by Spain\u2019s Socialist-led coalition government, could potentially clear Puigdemont and hundreds of other supporters of Catalan independence of any wrongdoing in the illegal 2017 ballot.\n\nBut the bill, approved by Spain\u2019s parliament earlier this year, is being challenged by the Supreme Court, leaving uncertainty about what crimes would be pardoned. Puigdemont could initially be placed in pretrial detention if he is arrested.\n\nThe former Catalan leader\u2019s return threatened to complicate a deal brokered after months of deadlock between Salvador Illa\u2019s Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) and the other main Catalan separatist party and left-wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC).\n\nThat deal had ensured just enough support in Catalonia\u2019s parliament for Illa to become the next regional president in an investiture debate Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"},

The parliamentary speaker has yet to confirm the date.\n\nThe Spanish parliament passed an amnesty law in May pardoning those involved in the failed 2017 secession bid, but the Supreme Court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and two others, who were also charged with embezzlement, ruling that the amnesty law does not apply to them.\n\nA source close to Puigdemont told Reuters he had \"no

arrested upon re-entering Spain and brought before the Supreme Court in Madrid.\n\nIn an open letter posted on his X account on Friday, Puigdemont described Spain's efforts to detain him as a \"hybrid coup\", adding \"if they succeed, I imagine what awaits me and know what I must do\".\n\nERC spokesperson Raquel Sans acknowledged on Tuesday that Puigdemont's arrest could delay the vote for a new Catalan leader.\n\nPolice will try to arrest Puigdemont before he reaches the heavily guarded parliament building in Barcelona, but are also authorized to enter if needed, El Periodico newspaper reported, citing police sources.\n\nOfficers were also monitoring the sewer system in case it was used for alternative entry routes.\n\nIn 2011, then-leader Artur Mas was forced to access the

But while senior officials of Puigdemont's Junts party and members of the moderate separatist Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya made their way to the building, he instead got into a white car which belonged to a regional police officer, a Catalan government source said.\n\nA spokesperson for the regional police, known as the Mossos d'Esquadra, said one of its officers had been arrested \"as part of the investigation into Puigdemont's whereabouts.\"\n\nTRAFFIC CHAOS\n\nThe hunt for the separatist leader created traffic chaos in Barcelona and near the border with France as police set up roadblocks and searched car boots.\n\nThe search for Puigdemont was later called off, a Mossos spokeseperson said, without explaining why.\n\nSeveral Puigdemont supporters clashed with police in a bid to breach the cordon surrounding the park housing the parliament building. Officers clad in riot gear used batons and pepper spray to deter them.\n\nPuigdemont, 61, fled to Belgium seven years ago after a failed secession bid and has been living in exile ever since.\n\nHe faces an arrest warrant for alleged embezzlement related to the 2017 independence referendum ruled illegal by the Spanish courts, but he insists the vote was not illegal and so the charges linked to it have no basis.\n\nA debate to swear in Socialist Salvador Illa as Catalonia\u00b4s new president, ending a decade of separatist rule, began amid confusion and speculation about Puigdemont's whereabouts.\n\nA Catalan government spokesperson confirmed Puigdemont had evaded capture. \"I can confirm Puigdemont has not been detained yet,\" he said.\n\nReacting to news that Puigdemont had again absconded from under the noses of a large deployment of the Catalan regional police force, a Supreme Court source said the judge had been clear in his instructions that the former regional president was to be arrested.\n\n\"The Mossos know that they have a detention order. The judge's writ reminded the state security forces that the national arrest warrant for aggravated embezzlement remained active and they had the obligation to detain him and bring him before the courts.\"\n\nTwo national police unions criticised the failure to arrest Puigdemont.\n\n\"Where are the Mossos? The best-paid police force in Spain incapable of doing their job, of arresting the coup-monger and fugitive from justice Puigdemont,\" police union Jusapol said on X.\n\nTwo sources with links to the Catalan government said it was realising it had a problem with some rogue Mossos, who appear to be loyal to Puigdemont.\n\n\"UNBEARABLE HUMILIATION\"\n\nAlberto Nunez Feijoo, leader of the opposition People\u00b4s Party (PP) blamed Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez for the situation, describing it as \"an unbearable humiliation.\"\n\n\"It\u00b4s unforgivable to damage Spain's image like this,\" Feijoo said on X.\n\nA government spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Puigdemont\u00b4s lawyer.\n\nOn Wednesday, Puigdemont had announced he had started his \"return trip from exile\", saying he remained committed to attending Thursday's session of the regional parliament, which is sitting to swear in the region's new leader following an election in May, in which Puigdemont's Junts party finished second.\n\nHis arrest could jeopardise the Socialist-led national government\u00b4s fragile alliance with Junts, on which it relies for legislative support.\n\nThe Socialists hope taking control in Catalonia after a decade of separatist rule will turn the page on the independence drive.\n\nThe Spanish parliament passed an amnesty law in May pardoning those involved in the failed 2017 secession bid, but the Supreme Court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and two others who were also charged with embezzlement, ruling that the amnesty law does not apply to them.\n\nThe crowd of thousands, who had gathered near the parliament to welcome him, hoped his return would help build momentum towards independence, which has lost support in recent years.\n\n\"It represents the return of a symbol,\" said Xavier Vizcaino, 63, who was wrapped in an independence flag.\n\nNo-one had expected him to disappear again.\n\nFormer Barcelona Mayor Xavier Trias, who was present at the gathering, described Puigdemont as a magician.\n\n\"It was magic,\" he told Reuters of Puigdemont\u00b4s escape.", "source": {"uri": "cyprus-mail.com", "dataType":

The failed secession attempt triggered a protracted constitutional crisis in Spain.\n\nMr Puigdemont and his supporters have long taken a confrontational and at times provocative stance toward Spain's central authorities, especially the Madrid-based government.\n\nThe former Catalan leader's return threatened to complicate a deal brokered after months of deadlock between Salvador Illa's Catalan Socialist Party and the other main Catalan separatist party and left-wing Esquerra Republicana.\n\nThat deal had ensured just enough support in Catalonia's parliament for Mr Illa to become the next regional president in an investiture debate on Thursday, scheduled shortly after Mr Puigdemont's first planned event and which will take place amid tight security.\n\nMr Puigdemont, who is wanted on charges of embezzlement during the secession attempt, has dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in north-east Spain -- a decades-long struggle.\n\nHis largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government.\n\nA contentious amnesty bill, crafted by Spain's Socialist-led coalition government, could potentially clear Mr Puigdemont and hundreds of other supporters of Catalan independence of any wrongdoing in the illegal 2017 ballot.\n\nBut the bill, approved by Spain's parliament earlier this year, is being challenged by the Supreme Court, which argues the pardon does not apply to embezzlement, unlike other crimes that Mr Puigdemont had previously been charged with.\n\nMr Puigdemont could be placed in pretrial detention.\n\nMr Puigdemont's escape from Spain became the stuff of legend among his followers, and a huge source of embarrassment for Spanish law enforcement.\n\nHe is a celebrated figurehead for many Catalans who want to break away from the rest of Spain.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr Puigdemont denied that he had hidden in a car trunk to avoid detection while slipping across the border after the referendum.\n\nThe subsequent legal crackdown landed several of his cohorts in prison until Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez's government pardoned them.", "source":

The operation was reportedly ended a few hours later.\n\nFor much of the past several years he has lived in Brussels, after police indicted him on charges linked to a failed bid for Catalan independence in 2017.\n\nAt the time, Catalonia's pro-independence leaders including Mr Puigdemont organised a referendum - which was ruled illegal by Spain's constitutional court - and later declared independence for the region. Madrid imposed direct rule on the region shortly after and Mr Puigdemont fled to Belgium.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Mr Puigdemont briefly addressed hundreds of supporters who gathered near the Catalan parliament in Barcelona, shortly ahead of the expected investiture of a new head of the Catalan government.\n\nHe said he had returned \"to remind you that we are still here\" and added: \"Holding a referendum is not and will never be a crime.\"\n\nMr Puigdemont then disappeared.\n\nMany were expecting him to turn up inside the parliament building in time for the investiture ceremony at 10:00 (08:00 GMT), but he was nowhere to be seen.\n\nA Catalan police officer was detained on suspicion of helping Mr Puigdemont flee, a spokesperson for the Mossos d'Esquadra said.\n\nThe officer allegedly owns a car in which Mr Puigdemont escaped after making his address, Spanish media said.\n\nRoadblocks have now been set up across the city, a spokesperson for Catalonia's interior department said in a statement.\n\nSpanish TV also showed images from La Jonquera, a municipality bordering France, where police could be seen stopping cars and checking the boots.\n\nPuigdemont ally Aleix Sarri criticised the police operation on X, saying: \"Hundreds of policemen encircle Barcelona to arrest President Puigdemont. A hunt paid with public money to please the powers in Madrid. This is not what a democracy does.\"\n\nPolice reportedly used pepper spray to disperse Puigdemont supporters who gathered near the parliament.\n\nIgnacio Garriga of the far-right Vox party, which strongly opposes independence for Catalonia, said Vox would \"do everything necessary to ensure that Puigdemont is arrested\".\n\nSome Spanish commentators are puzzled at the fact that police were unable to arrest Mr Puigdemont despite him announcing he would return to Catalonia earlier this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, he posted a video on X saying that he had \"started the return trip from exile\" and added that his arrest would have been illegal and arbitrary.\n\nThere appear to be several motives behind Carles Puigdemont's return to Spain.\n\nFirstly, he wants to pressure the authorities into applying the country's new amnesty law - which withdraws legal action against Catalan nationalists - to him, after the supreme court excluded him from its application on technical grounds.\n\nHe also aims to disrupt the investiture of Socialist Salvador Illa as the new Catalan president today.\n\nThe former Spanish health minister would become the region's first non-nationalist leader since 2010.\n\nEqually important for Mr Puigdemont is to assert himself and his Junts per Catalunya (JxCat) party as the main pro-independence force.\n\nHe is keen to cast his separatist rival, the Catalan Republican Left (ERC), as being complicit with Spanish unionism because of its agreement to support Mr Illa's investiture.\n\nUntil a new local government is in place, ERC is still responsible for the

The political event in Barcelona is likely to gather many of Puigdemont's supporters.\n\nThe Mossos D'Esquadra, the regional police in Catalonia, say that they intend to obey court orders to arrest Puigdemont, if he does return.\n\nIn his announcement on YouTube, Puigdemont recognized that he \"cannot attend freely\" the scheduled parliamentary session and accused authorities of \"a long persecution\" over the unsuccessful breakaway attempt.\n\n\"This challenge must be answered and confronted,\" he said.\n\nFILE - Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont speaks at a press conference in Alghero, Italy, Oct. 4, 2021. (AP Photo/Gloria Calvi, File)\n\nPuigdemont's return is likely to generate renewed political tension over the smoldering issue of Catalan independence. The failed secession attempt triggered a protracted constitutional crisis in Spain.\n\nPuigdemont and his supporters have long taken a confrontational and at times provocative stance toward Spain's central authorities, especially the Madrid-based government.\n\nThe former Catalan leader\u00b4s return threatened to complicate a deal brokered after months of deadlock between Salvador Illa's Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) and the other main Catalan separatist party and left-wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC).\n\nThat deal had ensured just enough support in Catalonia\u00b4s parliament for Illa to become the next regional president in an investiture debate Thursday, scheduled shortly after Puigdemont's first planned event and which will take place amid tight security.\n\nPuigdemont, who is wanted on charges of misuse of public funds, among other offenses, during the secession attempt, has dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in northeast Spain - a struggle which is decades-old. His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government.\n\nA contentious amnesty bill, crafted by Spain\u00b4s Socialist-led coalition government, could potentially clear Puigdemont and hundreds of other supporters of Catalan independence of any wrongdoing in the illegal 2017 ballot.\n\nBut the bill, approved by Spain\u00b4s parliament earlier this year, is being challenged by the Supreme Court, leaving uncertainty about what crimes would be pardoned. Puigdemont could be placed in pretrial detention.\n\nPuigdemont\u00b4s escape from Spain became the stuff of legend among his followers, and a huge source of embarrassment for Spanish law enforcement. He is a celebrated figurehead for many Catalans who want to break away from the rest of Spain.\n\nEarlier this year, Puigdemont denied that he had hidden in a car trunk to avoid detection while slipping across the border after the referendum. The subsequent legal crackdown landed several of his cohorts in prison until Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u00b4s government pardoned them.\n\nBarry Hatton reported from Lisbon, Portugal.",

Puigdemont, who remains the target of an arrest warrant.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Puigdemont delivered a short speech to thousands gathered near the Catalan regional parliament, which is set to elect a

party.\n\nThe Socialists won the most seats in the Catalan regional election in May but failed to get a majority and the support of the ERC is crucial.\n\nIf a new Catalan regional government is not formed by August 26, a fresh election will be held in October.\n\nPuigdemont led the regional government of Catalonia in 2017, when it pushed ahead with an independence referendum despite a court ban, followed by a short-lived declaration of independence.\n\nHe fled Spain shortly after the independence bid to avoid prosecution and has since lived in Belgium and more recently France.\n\nWhile Spain's parliament in May passed an amnesty law for those involved in the botched secession bid, the Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that the measure would not fully apply to Puigdemont.\n\n\"A country that has an amnesty law and does not apply it, has a problem with democracy,\" he said in his speech.\n\nThe head of Spain's main opposition Popular Party, Alberto Nunez Feijoo, called Puigdemont's return and then disappearance \"an unbearable humiliation\".\n\n\"It is unforgivable to damage Spain's image like this,\" he added.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez agreed to the amnesty law in exchange for JxCAT's crucial support in the national parliament for his fragile minority government.\n\nThe move sparked huge street protests that were organised by the right wing.\n\nSanchez is now facing opposition from parts of his own Socialist party as well as the right over a proposal to give Catalonia full control of the taxes collected in the region.\n\nThe measure was promised to the ERC in exchange for the party's support for Illa in Thursday's Catalan investiture vote.\n\nThe proposal has for decades been one of the main demands of Catalan independence parties but critics argue it would deprive the central state of a substantial source of revenue.\n\nIt must still be approved by Spain's national parliament.\n\nIf Illa passes Thursday's investiture vote, he will be the first head of Catalonia's regional government since 2010 who does not come from the separatist camp.\n\nThe former health minister has defended the tax agreement made with the ERC, saying it was \"favourable for all Catalans\".\n\nBut former Socialist deputy prime minister Alfonso Guerra has said the tax agreement opens \"a path towards a federal system and the independence of Catalonia\".",

Why is his return to Barcelona causing such a tumult?", "body": "Carles Puigdemont on Thursday made a sensational return to Spain and an equally sensational getaway from a speech in the city with the alleged help of a local police officer.\n\nPuigdemont, the Catalonia leader and leader of the hardline Junts party, returned to Barcelona on Thursday after spending seven years in exile.\n\nThe 61-year-old fled Spain after a failed bid for Catalonia's independence.\n\nA manhunt for Puigdemont, who has an outstanding arrest warrant against him, is underway.\n\nBut who is Puigdemont? Why is his return so controversial?\n\nPuigdemont was born on December 29, 1962 in the tiny village of Amer.\n\nAs per France 24, the village, with its population of just 2,200, is not far from Girona - which itself is around 100 kilometres northeast of Barcelona.\n\nPuigdemont, nicknamed Pugi by his friends, descended from a long line of bakers. Puigdemont, like his forbearers, was an ardent nationalist.\n\nPuigdemont studied for a degree in Catalan philology at the University College of Girona.\n\nHowever, in 1983, he decided to become a journalist after he had a serious car accident. He began his journalistic career as a copy editor at El Punt Avui.\n\nHe became editor next - and ascended to editor-in-chief.\n\nHis colleagues recall his separatist leanings.\n\n\"When we played pinball and he lost the ball, he'd call the machine a 'Spanish whore',\" one of his former colleagues said.\n\nPolitics\n\nPuigdemont in 1991 began lobbying to change the Gerona's name to its Catalan counterpart Girona.\n\nHe also founded the youth group JNC.\n\nThe outfit had links to the nationalist party of the Democratic Convergence of Catalonia.\n\nIt would later be reestablished as Catalan European Democratic Party (PDECAT) in 2016, according to France24.\n\nPuigdemont's political career began in earnest in 2007 when he stood for Girona mayor.\n\nIn 2011, Puigdemont was elected Mayor of Girona.\n\nThis made him the first non-socialist mayor in the history of Spanish democracy.\n\nOn January 12, 2016, Puigdemont was officially sworn in as the 130th President of the Government of Catalonia.\n\nHe made history by becoming the first president of Catalonia not to swear fealty to Spain's Constitution and King Felipe VI.\n\nPuigdemont dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in northeast Spain -- a struggle which is decades-old. His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government.\n\nSecession and exile\n\nIn 2017, Puigdemont, as regional president and separatist party leader, tried to get Catalonia to secede from Spain.\n\nAs per Al Jazeera, millions of Catalans took the polls with a huge majority of voters backing independence.\n\nMeanwhile, violence unfolded as the central government attempted to halt the vote.\n\nFour weeks later, the region declared independence.\n\nSpain's central government and the Constitutional Court declared at the time that the referendum was illegal.\n\nMadrid then activated Article 155 - letting the national government take full control of the region.\n\nSpain also dismissed Puigdemont and his cabinet and called fresh elections.\n\nPuigdemont and his minister then left for Belgium\n\nAs per Al Jazeera, Puigdemont said he went to \"the capital of Europe\" so that he could speak from a position of \"freedom and safety.\"\n\nHe said he would not return unless he was guaranteed a free and fair trial.\n\nIn December 2017, Puigdemont contested Catalan's regional elections and was re-elected to Parliament.\n\nThe secessionists also kept a narrow majority in the Catalan Parliament.\n\nThough Puigdemont called for new unconditional talks with the Spanish government and even proposed meeting the prime minister, his proposal was rejected.\n\nThough the 61-year-old initially lived in Belgium, his latest place of residence remained known.\n\nPuigdemont faces charges of embezzlement for his part in the attempted secession.\n\nIn 2018, Puigdemont was stopped by German police while travelling from Finland to Brussels by car.\n\nThis, after the Spanish Supreme Court issued an arrest warrant against him.\n\nPuigdemont on Thursday made a sensational return to Spain and an equally sensational getaway from a speech in the city with the alleged help of a local police officer.\n\nPuigdemont kept his travel plans secret before setting out to the wealthy Catalan region in northeastern Spain. He gave a speech in front of a large crowd of supporters in central Barcelona under the noses of police officers, who made no attempt to detain him.\n\nLocal police were deployed in a security ring around a section of the park where Catalonia's parliament building is located behind walls. Meanwhile, Puigdemont, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and tie, walked with supporters to the nearby stage where he gave his speech.\n\nAddressing the crowd in the park and at times pumping his fist, Puigdemont accused Spanish authorities of \"a crackdown\" on the Catalan separatist movement.\n\n\"For the last seven years we have been persecuted because we wanted to hear the voice of the Catalan people,\" Puigdemont said. \"They have made being Catalan into something suspicious.\"\n\nHe added: \"All people have the right to self-determination.\"\n\nAfter his speech, in a cloak-and-dagger moment, Puigdemont went into an adjacent marquee tent. There, he hurried out of an exit and jumped into a waiting car that sped away, according to an Associated Press photographer who witnessed his departure.\n\nCatalan police arrested one of their own officers on charges of aiding Puigdemont's getaway, the force's press office told The Associated Press.\n\nNo further details were available.\n\nAbout three hours after Puigdemont vanished, Catalan police called off the manhunt without saying why.\n\nThe Catalan police force is called Mossos d'Esquadra and operates separately from Spain's Policia Nacional. At the time of the 2017 ballot, the Spanish government suspended the Mossos' chief and placed the force under investigation for failing to stop the vote. The chief and his staff were eventually exonerated.\n\nAuthorities, who may have wanted to avoid confrontation with the crowd of several thousand separatist supporters, had set up a police cordon at the nearby regional parliament where Puigdemont was expected to go afterward.\n\nOnce Puigdemont had slipped away, roadside police units checked vehicles across the city of around 1.6 million people in an effort to nab him. The checks snarled city traffic. Police also checked vehicles heading on highways to neighboring France.\n\nWhy is his return controversial?\n\nBecause Puigdemont's return comes on the very day when a new socialist government was being sworn in at Catalonia's Parliament.\n\nSpain's government encouraged a deal brokered after months of deadlock between Salvador Illa's Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) and the other main Catalan separatist party and left-wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC).\n\nAs per Al Jazeera, though the socialists won the recent polls they failed to nab a majority.\n\nThe support of the ERC proved crucial to forming the regional government.\n\nThe new government had to be sworn by August 26 or fresh elections would be held in October.\n\nThat deal had ensured just enough support in Catalonia's parliament for Illa to become the next regional president Thursday.\n\nPuigdemont could also hurt Spain's Socialist-led coalition government at the Centre.\n\nThe Central's government has a shaky alliance with Puigdemont's Junts - on whom it depends to pass legislation, as per Al Jazeera.\n\nComplicating matters is the fact that a contentious amnesty bill, crafted by the Centre, could potentially clear Puigdemont and hundreds of other supporters of Catalan independence of any wrongdoing in the 2017 ballot.\n\nHowever, the bill, approved by Spain's parliament earlier this year, is being challenged by the Supreme Court which has argued that the pardon doesn't apply to embezzlement, unlike other crimes that Puigdemont had previously been charged with.\n\nPuigdemont could be placed in pretrial detention if he is arrested.\n\nWhat do experts say?\n\nAccording to BBC, Puigdemont by returning wants to pressure authorities into including him under the ambit of the amnesty bill.\n\n\"The amnesty law has created the conditions for him to return,\" Pablo Sim\u00f3n, a political scientist at Carlos III University in Madrid told The New York Times. \"Returning is the only thing he can do in order to continue to play the victim.\"\n\nPuigdemont also wants to make sure his Junts party is viewed by the public as the main party fighting for Catalonia's independence.\n\nAt the same time, he wants to make sure the rival ERC is seen as hand-in-glove with those fighting for Catalonia to remain in Spain.\n\nBut others think it's too late.\n\n\"It's Puigdemont's last dance,\" Ignacio Lago, a professor of political science at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, told The New York Times.\n\nLola Garc\u00eda, the deputy editor of the Catalan daily La Vanguardia, a paper which has been close to the Junts, told The Guardian, \"The possibility of Puigdemont being jailed might complicate things for the Spanish government, although a change of government wouldn't be in his interest at this juncture.\"\n\nBut it won't resuscitate the unity of the independence movement nor the independence process.\"\n\n\"Things are complicated in the sense that there's this interest in stopping him. But at the end of the day, he's a member of parliament. He's a former president. So if he is arrested, this would be against the immunity of the members of parliament,\" Mar Aquilera Varques, a constitutional law professor at Barcelona University, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"There are some people who are tired of this political crisis. But many people in Catalonia still want independence,\" she added.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The parliamentary speaker has yet to confirm the date.\n\nEXCLUDED FROM AMNESTY\n\nThe Spanish parliament passed an amnesty law in May pardoning those involved in the failed 2017 secession bid, but the Supreme Court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and two others, who were also charged with embezzlement, ruling that the amnesty law does not apply to them.\n\nA source close to Puigdemont told Reuters he had \"no doubt\" that the former leader - who lived in Belgium between 2017 and 2024 while serving as a member of the European Parliament and has in recent months been based in southern France - would be arrested upon re-entering Spain and brought before the Supreme Court in Madrid.\n\nIn an open letter posted on his X account on Friday, Puigdemont described Spain's efforts to detain him as a \"hybrid coup\", adding \"if they succeed, I imagine what awaits me and know what I must do\".\n\nERC spokesperson Raquel Sans acknowledged on Tuesday that Puigdemont's arrest could delay the vote for a new Catalan leader.\n\nPolice will try to arrest Puigdemont before he reaches the heavily guarded parliament building in Barcelona, but are also authorised to enter if needed, El Periodico newspaper reported, citing police sources.\n\nOfficers were also monitoring the sewer system in case it was used for alternative entry routes.\n\nIn 2011, then-leader Artur Mas was forced to access the building's rooftop by helicopter after it was surrounded by nearly 1,000 anti-austerity activists protesting against budget cuts.\n\n(Reporting by David Latona and Bel\u00e9n Carre\u00f1o;

The officer allegedly owns a car in which Puigdemont escaped after briefly addressing a few thousand supporters near the Catalan parliament, Spanish media said.\n\nPuigdemont, 61, fled to Belgium seven years ago after a failed secession bid and has been living in exile ever since. He faces an arrest warrant for alleged embezzlement, which he denies.\n\nHis supporters hope his return will rekindle enthusiasm for the Catalan independence cause, which lost support in recent years.\n\nSenior officials of Puigdemont's Junts party, including parliament speaker Josep Rull, and members of the moderate separatist Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya which currently runs the regional government led a march to the Catalan parliament after the rally.\n\nA debate to swear in Socialist Salvador Illa as Catalonia's new president, ending a decade of separatist rule, began amid confusion and speculation about Puigdemont's whereabouts.\n\nA Catalan Interior Ministry spokesperson confirmed Puigdemont had evaded capture. \"I can confirm Puigdemont has not been detained yet,\" he said.\n\nA Supreme Court spokesperson declined to comment on Puigdemont's disappearance in Barcelona. A government spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Puigdemont's lawyer.\n\nOn Wednesday, Puigdemont had announced he had started his \"return trip from exile\", saying he remained committed to attending Thursday's session of the regional parliament, which is sitting to swear in the region's new leader following an election in May, in which Puigdemont's Junts party finished second.\n\nHis arrest could jeopardize the national government's fragile alliance with Junts, on which it relies for legislative support.\n\nIn the morning, a crowd of thousands had gathered near the parliament to welcome him and hear him speak.\n\nSeveral police vans were located nearby after radical protest group CDR called on its members to attend the gathering.\n\n\"It represents the return of a symbol,\" said Xavier Vizcaino, 63, who was wrapped in an independence flag.\n\nGiven the risk of imprisonment, Vizcaino said he was unclear of Puigdemont's intentions but hoped his return would build momentum towards independence.\n\n\"I hope it is a stimulus that helps the movement recover energy and efforts,\" he said. \"I want to believe there is a well structured plan behind his return.\"\n\nThe vote to invest Socialist Illa, who will be backed by the left-wing separatist ERC party after a bilateral deal last week, began an hour later.\n\nThe Socialists hope taking control in Catalonia after a decade of separatist rule will turn the page on the independence drive.\n\nThe Spanish parliament passed an amnesty law in May pardoning those involved in the failed 2017 secession bid, but the Supreme Court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and two others who were also charged with embezzlement, ruling that the amnesty law does not apply to them.\n\nThe embezzlement charges were related to the 2017 independence referendum ruled illegal by the Spanish courts.\n\nPuigdemont insists the vote was not illegal and so the charges linked to it have no basis.\n\nWearing a T-shirt and waving a flag with Puigdemont's face and the motto 'No surrender,' 41-year-old Susana Masnou described his return as an act of \"democratic disobedience\" to make sure the amnesty law applies to him.\n\n\"He is a very brave man, with convictions, risking his life to move the country forward,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "newseu.cgtn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "newseu.cgtn.com"},

The failed secession attempt triggered a protracted constitutional crisis in Spain.\n\nMr Puigdemont and his supporters have long taken a confrontational and at times provocative stance toward Spain's central authorities, especially the Madrid-based government.\n\nThe former Catalan leader's return threatened to complicate a deal brokered after months of deadlock between Salvador Illa's Catalan Socialist Party and the other main Catalan separatist party and left-wing Esquerra Republicana.\n\nThat deal had ensured just enough support in Catalonia's parliament for Mr Illa to become the next regional president in an investiture debate on Thursday, scheduled shortly after Mr Puigdemont's first planned event and which will take place amid tight security.\n\nMr Puigdemont, who is wanted on charges of embezzlement during the secession attempt, has dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in north-east Spain -- a decades-long struggle.\n\nHis largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government.\n\nA contentious amnesty bill, crafted by Spain's Socialist-led coalition government, could potentially clear Mr Puigdemont and hundreds of other supporters of Catalan independence of any wrongdoing in the illegal 2017 ballot.\n\nBut the bill, approved by Spain's parliament earlier this year, is being challenged by the Supreme Court, which argues the pardon does not apply to embezzlement, unlike other crimes that Mr Puigdemont had previously been charged with.\n\nMr Puigdemont could be placed in pretrial detention.\n\nMr Puigdemont's escape from Spain became the stuff of legend among his followers, and a huge source of embarrassment for Spanish law enforcement.\n\nHe is a celebrated figurehead for many Catalans who want to break away from the rest of Spain.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr Puigdemont denied that he had hidden in a car trunk to avoid detection while slipping across the border after the referendum.\n\nThe subsequent legal crackdown landed several of his cohorts in prison until Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez's government pardoned them.", "source":

Political scientist Toni Rodon of Barcelona's Pompeu Fabra University told Reuters that Puidgemont had possibly decided to come back because of the personal toll of living in exile.\n\nThe parliament of Spain's Catalonia region is set to elect a new leader this week, although the event may be upstaged by the return of its former leader from self-imposed exile, despite a pending warrant for his arrest. Carles Puigdemont is the figurehead of hardline separatist party Junts, and led Catalonia between 2016 and 2017 before fleeing Spain following a referendum on independence deemed illegal by the judiciary.\n\nIt remains unclear how he plans to return to the country and enter the regional parliament while evading police. Jordi Turull, secretary-general of Junts, told broadcaster 324 on Tuesday that he would call for the leadership vote to be suspended if Puigdemont is detained, as \"it cannot take place in normal conditions\" without him present.\n\nThe vote to invest Socialist Salvador Illa, who will be backed by the left-wing separatist ERC party after a bilateral deal last week, will kick off on Thursday at 10 a.m. local time (0800 GMT), according to the parliamentary speaker. EXCLUDED FROM AMNESTY\n\nThe Spanish parliament passed an amnesty law in May pardoning those involved in the failed 2017 secession bid, but the Supreme Court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and two others, who were also charged with embezzlement, ruling that the amnesty law does not apply to them. A source close to Puigdemont told Reuters he had \"no doubt\" that the former leader - who lived in Belgium between 2017 and 2024 while serving as a member of the European Parliament and has in recent months been based in southern France - would be arrested upon re-entering Spain and brought before the Supreme Court in Madrid.\n\nPolitical scientist Toni Rodon of Barcelona's Pompeu Fabra University told Reuters that Puidgemont had possibly decided to come back because of the personal toll of living in exile. \"The amnesty has changed the game play, and the other strategy he can pursue can be more useful inside the Spanish borders even if he ends up in jail,\" Rodon added.\n\nIn an open letter posted on his X account on Friday, Puigdemont described Spain's efforts to detain him as a \"hybrid coup\", adding \"if they succeed, I imagine what awaits me and know what I must do\". ERC spokesperson Raquel Sans acknowledged on Tuesday that Puigdemont's arrest could delay the vote for a new Catalan leader.\n\nPolice will try to arrest Puigdemont before he reaches the heavily guarded parliament building in Barcelona, but are also authorised to enter if needed, El Periodico newspaper reported, citing police sources. Officers were also monitoring the sewer system in case it was used for alternative entry routes.\n\nIn 2011, then-leader Artur Mas was forced to access the building's rooftop by helicopter after it was surrounded by nearly 1,000 anti-austerity activists protesting against budget cuts.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Puigdemont had previously announced his intention to be in Spain on a day that Catalonia's parliament is due to swear in a new president. The 61-year-old fugitive initially lived in Belgium after bolting Spain in 2017, but his latest place of residence wasn't known. Puigdemont kept his travel plans secret before setting out to the wealthy Catalan region in northeastern Spain. He gave a speech in front of a large crowd of supporters in central Barcelona under the noses of police officers, who made no attempt to detain him. After his speech, in a cloak-and-dagger moment, Puigdemont went into an adjacent marquee tent. There, he hurried out of an exit and jumped into a waiting car that sped away, according to an Associated Press photographer who witnessed his departure. Authorities, who may have wanted to avoid confrontation with the crowd of several thousand separatist supporters, had set up a police cordon at the nearby regional parliament where Puigdemont was expected to go afterward. Once Puigdemont had slipped away, roadside police units checked vehicles across the city of around 1.6 million people in an effort to nab him. The checks snarled city traffic. Police also checked vehicles heading on highways to neighboring France. Puigdemont faces charges of embezzlement for his part in an attempt to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain in 2017. As regional president and separatist party leader at the time, he was a key player in an independence referendum that was outlawed by the central government but went ahead anyway. Those events triggered a political crisis that roiled Spain for months. Puigdemont's appearance in Barcelona, Catalonia's capital, and his game of cat-and-mouse with police, stole the show on a day when a new government was being sworn in at the regional parliament. Local police were deployed in a security ring around a section of the park where Catalonia's parliament building is located behind walls. Meanwhile, Puigdemont, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and tie, walked with supporters to the nearby stage where he gave his speech. Addressing the crowd in the park and at times pumping his fist, Puigdemont accused Spanish authorities of \"a crackdown\"\u009d on the Catalan separatist movement. \"For the last seven years we have been persecuted because we wanted to hear the voice of the Catalan people,\"\u009d Puigdemont said. \"They have made being Catalan into something suspicious.\"\u009d He added: \"All people have the right to self-determination.\"\u009d The turn of events was likely to bring political recriminations. The leader of the Popular Party, the main opposition to Spain's left-of-center coalition government which has long rebuffed Catalonia's independence movement, condemned Puigdemont's return. Alberto N\u00c3\u00ba\u00c3\u00b1ez Feij\u00c3\u00b3o posted on X that Puigdemont's reappearance was an \"unbearable humiliation\"\u009d that damaged Spain's reputation. Spain's government encouraged a deal brokered after months of deadlock between Salvador Illa's Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) and the other main Catalan separatist party and left-wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC). That deal had ensured just enough support in Catalonia's parliament for Illa to become the next regional president Thursday. Speaking to Catalan lawmakers before the vote, Illa called for reconciliation and respect for Spain's controversial amnesty bill. He vowed to govern for all Catalans after years of bitter divisions between those in favor of independence and those against it. Puigdemont has dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in northeast Spain - a struggle which is decades-old. His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government. A contentious amnesty bill, crafted by Spain's Socialist-led coalition government, could potentially clear Puigdemont and hundreds of other supporters of Catalan independence of any wrongdoing in the 2017 ballot. Spain's central government and the Constitutional Court declared at the time that the referendum was illegal. But the bill, approved by Spain's parliament earlier this year, is being challenged by the Supreme Court, which argues the pardon doesn't apply to embezzlement, unlike other crimes that Puigdemont had previously been charged with. Puigdemont could be placed in pretrial detention if he is arrested. ___ Barry Hatton reported from Lisbon, Portugal.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine

Puigdemont shouted \"Long live a free Catalonia!\" as he climbed onto a stage in Barcelona to address thousands gathered near the Catalan regional parliament which is set to elect a new leader later in the day. \"I have come here to remind you that we are still here,\" he said as many in the crowd waved red, yellow and blue Catalan independence flags.\n\nAfter his brief address, Puigdemont appeared to head toward the Catalan parliament but the assembly began an investiture vote to pick a new leader for the region without him being present. A small group of protesters gathered nearby waving Spanish flags and holding signs that read \"Catalonia is Spain\" in a demonstration organized by far-right party Vox.\n\nPuigdemont's dramatic return came just days after Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialists struck a deal with moderate Catalan separatist party ERC - which competes with Puigdemont's more hardline JxCAT - to make the Socialist candidate, Salvador Illa, the next head of the Catalan regional government. The Socialists won the most seats in a regional election in May but failed to get a majority and the support of the ERC is crucial. If a new Catalan regional government is not formed by August 26, fresh elections will be held in October.\n\nPuigdemont led the regional government of Catalonia in 2017 when it pushed ahead with an independence referendum despite a court ban, which was followed by a short-lived declaration of independence. He fled the country shortly after the independence bid to avoid prosecution and has since lived in Belgium and more recently France.\n\nWhile Spain's parliament in May passed an amnesty law for those involved in the botched secession bid, the Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that the measure would not fully apply to Puigdemont. In a video posted on social network X on Wednesday to announce his imminent return to attend the investiture vote, Puigdemont accused Spanish authorities of \"a long persecution\". \"This challenge must be answered and confronted,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carles_Puigdemont", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carles Puigdemont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalitat_de_Catalunya", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generalitat de Catalunya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_independence_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catalan independence movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Illa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salvador Illa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_(political_party)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vox (political party)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Catalonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Left_of_Catalonia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Left of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_S\u00e1nchez", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amnesty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://img.lemde.fr/2024/08/08/500/0/6000/3000/1440/720/60/0/eaa645f_3b95e5f1c2ab4070ad2c4da4e9a6ec99-0-b122f6240ba3440aad3c789cb229d126.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791466", "eventUri": "eng-9791466", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 159, "textEnd": 167}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-26", "textStart": 1442, "textEnd": 1451}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 1958, "textEnd": 1964}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

The political event in Barcelona is likely to gather many of Puigdemont's supporters.\n\nThe Mossos D'Esquadra, the regional police in Catalonia, say that they intend to obey court orders to arrest Puigdemont, if he does return.\n\nIn his announcement on YouTube, Puigdemont recognized that he \"cannot attend freely\" the scheduled parliamentary session and accused authorities of \"a long persecution\" over the unsuccessful breakaway attempt.\n\n\"This challenge must be answered and confronted,\" he said.\n\nPuigdemont's return is likely to generate renewed political tension over the smoldering issue of Catalan independence. The failed secession attempt triggered a protracted constitutional crisis in Spain.\n\nPuigdemont and his supporters have long taken a confrontational and at times provocative stance toward Spain's central authorities, especially the Madrid-based government.\n\nThe former Catalan leader's return threatened to complicate a deal brokered after months of deadlock between Salvador Illa's Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) and the other main Catalan separatist party and left-wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC).\n\nThat deal had ensured just enough support in Catalonia's parliament for Illa to become the next regional president in an investiture debate Thursday, scheduled shortly after Puigdemont's first planned event and which will take place amid tight security.\n\nPuigdemont, who is wanted on charges of misuse of public funds, among other offenses, during the secession attempt, has dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in northeast Spain -- a struggle which is decades-old. His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government.\n\nA contentious amnesty bill, crafted by Spain's Socialist-led coalition government, could potentially clear Puigdemont and hundreds of other supporters of Catalan independence of any wrongdoing in the illegal 2017 ballot.\n\nBut the bill, approved by Spain's parliament earlier this year, is being challenged by the Supreme Court, leaving uncertainty about what crimes would be pardoned. Puigdemont could be placed in pretrial detention.\n\nPuigdemont's escape from Spain became the stuff of legend among his followers, and a huge source of embarrassment for Spanish law enforcement. He is a celebrated figurehead for many Catalans who want to break away from the rest of Spain.\n\nEarlier this year, Puigdemont denied that he had hidden in a car trunk to avoid detection while slipping across the border after the referendum. The subsequent legal crackdown landed several of his cohorts in prison until Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez's government pardoned them.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The hunt for his whereabouts created traffic chaos in Barcelona and near the border with France as police set up roadblocks and searched car boots.\n\nPuigdemont, 61, fled to Belgium seven years ago after a failed secession bid and has been living in exile ever since.\n\nHe faces an arrest warrant for alleged embezzlement, which he denies.\n\nHis supporters hope his return will rekindle enthusiasm for the Catalan independence cause, which lost support in recent years. Senior officials of Puigdemont's Junts party, including parliament speaker Josep Rull, and members of the moderate separatist Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya which currently runs the regional government led a march to the Catalan parliament after the rally.\n\nA debate to swear in Socialist Salvador Illa as Catalonia\u00b4s new president, ending a decade of separatist rule, began amid confusion and speculation about Puigdemont's whereabouts. A Catalan Interior Ministry spokesperson confirmed Puigdemont had evaded capture. \"I can confirm Puigdemont has not been detained yet,\" he said.\n\nA Supreme Court spokesperson declined to comment on Puigdemont's disappearance in Barcelona. A government spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Puigdemont\u00b4s lawyer.\n\nOn Wednesday, Puigdemont had announced he had started his \"return trip from exile\", saying he remained committed to attending Thursday's session of the regional parliament, which is sitting to swear in the region's new leader following an election in May, in which Puigdemont's Junts party finished second.\n\nHis arrest could jeopardize the national government\u00b4s fragile alliance with Junts, on which it relies for legislative support.\n\nIn the morning, a crowd of thousands had gathered near the parliament to welcome him and hear him speak.\n\nSeveral police vans were located nearby after radical protest group CDR called on its members to attend the gathering.\n\n\"It represents the return of a symbol,\" said Xavier Vizcaino, 63, who was wrapped in an independence flag.\n\nGiven the risk of imprisonment, Vizcaino said he was unclear of Puigdemont's intentions but hoped his return would build momentum towards independence.\n\n\"I hope it is a stimulus that helps the movement recover energy and efforts,\" he said. \"I want to believe there is a well structured plan behind his return.\" The vote to invest Socialist Illa, who will be backed by the left-wing separatist ERC party after a bilateral deal last week, began an hour later.\n\nThe Socialists hope taking control in Catalonia after a decade of separatist rule will turn the page on the independence drive.\n\nThe Spanish parliament passed an amnesty law in May pardoning those involved in the failed 2017 secession bid, but the Supreme Court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and two others who were also charged with embezzlement, ruling that the amnesty law does not apply to them.\n\nThe embezzlement charges were related to the 2017 independence referendum ruled illegal by the Spanish courts.\n\nPuigdemont insists the vote was not illegal and so the charges linked to it have no basis.\n\nWearing a T-shirt and waving a flag with Puigdemont's face and the motto 'No surrender', 41-year-old Susana Masnou described his return as an act of \"democratic disobedience\" to make sure the amnesty law applies to him.\n\n\"He is a very brave man, with convictions, risk his life to move the country forward,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType":

If the judge in charge of his case issues a pre-trial imprisonment, Puigdemont is expected to appeal for his release to Spain's Constitutional Court, which has a majority of progressive-leaning judges.\n\n(Reporting by Joan Faus; editing by Charlie Devereux)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carles_Puigdemont", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carles Puigdemont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Together_for_Catalonia_(2020)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Together for Catalonia (2020)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_independence_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catalan independence movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amnesty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Catalonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embezzlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Embezzlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_S\u00e1nchez", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Illa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salvador Illa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Government_of_Catalonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of the Government of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Court_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional Court of Spain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/b3a25df/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F58%2F8cc0374296fb63dd4e0736aa150c25%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK760HJ%3A12024-08-07T114412Z_1_LYNXMPEK760HJ_RTROPTP_3_SPAIN-POLITICS-CATALONIA.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791466", "eventUri": "eng-9791466", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

We are still here because we have no right to quit.\"\n\nMr Puigdemont fled to Belgium seven years ago after a failed secession bid and has been living in exile ever since. He faces an arrest warrant for alleged embezzlement, which he denies.\n\nHis supporters hope his return will rekindle enthusiasm for the Catalan independence cause, which has lost support in recent years. \"It represents the return of a symbol,\" said Xavier Vizcaino, 63, who was wrapped in an independence flag.\n\nGiven the risk of imprisonment, Mr Vizcaino said he was unclear of Puigdemont's intentions but hoped his return would build momentum towards independence.\n\n\"I hope it is a stimulus that helps the movement recover energy and efforts,\" he said. \"I want to believe there is a well structured plan behind his return.\"\n\nAfter his speech, Mr Puigdemont was swiftly whisked through the crowd by members of his Together for Catalonia (Junts) party but was then nowhere to be seen among the politicians who later reached parliament.\n\nThe Catalan Interior Department confirmed he is on the run again and says they have set up roadblocks in a bid to arrest him. Police were stopping and searching vehicles heading towards the French border and there are traffic controls around the city centre following reports that Puigdemont was seen leaving in a car. The searches created traffic chaos in Barcelona and near the border.\n\nA Catalan Interior Ministry spokesperson confirmed Puigdemont had evaded capture. \"I can confirm Puigdemont has not been detained yet,\" she said. \"I can confirm roadblocks have been set up to find him.\"\n\nThursday's parliamentary session is set to see socialist Salvador Illa to be appointed as the new Catalan president, ending more than 10 years of separatist governments in the northeastern Spanish region.\n\nMr Puigdemont's return poses a direct challenge to Spain's judicial authorities and its delicate coalition government, risking a resurgence of tensions between Catalan separatists and Madrid.\n\nIn a video released on Wednesday, outlining his plan to return, Mr Puigdemont complained about being unable to \"attend freely\" and of \"a long persecution.\"\n\nHe said: \"That I can attend the parliament should be normal. That to do so risks an arrest that would be arbitrary and illegal is evidence of the democratic anomaly that we have the duty to denounce and fight.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear how authorities will proceed if Mr Puigdemont is arrested. Detaining him could jeopardise the national Socialist-led coalition government's fragile alliance with Junts, on which it relies for legislative support.\n\nA contentious amnesty Bill could potentially clear him and hundreds of other supporters of Catalan independence of any wrongdoing over the illegal 2017 ballot.\n\nBut the Bill, approved by Spain's parliament earlier this year, is being challenged by the Supreme Court, leaving uncertainty about what crimes would be pardoned. Mr Puigdemont could initially be placed in pre-trial detention if he is arrested.\n\nThe former Catalan leader's return threatened to complicate a deal brokered after months of deadlock between Illa's Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) and the other main Catalan separatist party and left-wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC).\n\nThat deal had ensured just enough support in Catalonia's parliament for Mr Illa to become the next regional president\n\n\"We had to see how the state allowed this criminal to hold a rally,\" Ignacio Garriga, secretary general of the far-right Vox party, told reporters outside the Catalan parliament. \"We don't understand why he hasn't been arrested yet\".", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

then disappears", "body": "Fugitive former Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont returned to Spain after seven years on Thursday before disappearing again.\n\nThe former regional leader had fled Spain over his role in a failed 2017 independence bid despite a pending arrest warrant.\n\nPuigdemont shouted \"Long live a free Catalonia!\" as he climbed onto a stage in Barcelona to address thousands gathered near the Catalan regional parliament, which is set to elect a new leader later in the day.\n\n\"I have come here to remind you that we are still here,\" he said as many in the crowd waved red, yellow and blue Catalan independence flags.\n\nAfter his brief address, Puigdemont appeared to head towards the nearby Catalan parliament but the assembly began an investiture vote to pick a new leader for the region without him being present.\n\nIt was not immediately clear where he was.\n\nPolice had set up roadblocks in Barcelona and were searching cars to try to find Puigdemont, according to Spanish media reports.\n\nContacted by AFP, police declined to comment if such an operation was underway.\n\nNuria Pujol, a woman in her fifties who came to Barcelona from the Alt Penedes region to see Puigdemont, called him \"a very noble person.\"\n\n\"(He's) the only one who believes in independence and has not stopped believing,\" she added.\n\nA small group of protesters gathered nearby, waving national Spanish flags and holding signs that read \"Catalonia is Spain,\" in a demonstration organized by far-right party Vox.\n\nPuigdemont's dramatic return came just days after Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialists struck a deal with moderate Catalan separatist party ERC - which competes with Puigdemont's more hardline JxCAT - to make the Socialist candidate, Salvador Illa, the next head of the Catalan regional government.\n\nThe Socialists won the most seats in a regional election in May but failed to get a majority and the support of the ERC is crucial.\n\nIf a new Catalan regional government is not formed by Aug. 26, fresh elections will be held in October.\n\nPuigdemont led the regional government of Catalonia in 2017 when it pushed ahead with an independence referendum despite a court ban, followed by a short-lived declaration of independence.\n\nHe fled Spain shortly after the independence bid to avoid prosecution and has since lived in Belgium and more recently France.\n\nWhile Spain's parliament in May passed an amnesty law for those involved in the botched secession bid, the Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that the measure would not fully apply to Puigdemont.\n\n\"A country that has an amnesty law and does not apply it, has a problem with democracy,\" he said in his speech.\n\nSanchez agreed to the amnesty law in exchange for JxCAT's crucial support in Spain's parliament for his fragile minority government, sparking huge street protests that were organized by the right wing.\n\nHe is now facing opposition from parts of his own Socialist party as well as the right over a proposal to give Catalonia full control of the taxes collected in the region.\n\nThe measure was promised to the ERC in exchange for the party's support for Illa in Thursday's Catalan investiture vote.\n\nThe proposal has for decades been one of the main demands of Catalan independence parties but critics argue it would deprive the central state of a substantial source of revenue.\n\nIt must still be approved by Spain's national parliament.\n\nA similar system already exists in Spain's northern Basque Country, which also has an active independence movement.\n\nIf Illa passes Thursday's investiture vote, he will be the first head of Catalonia's regional government since 2010 who does not come from the separatist camp.\n\nThe former health minister has defended the tax agreement made with the ERC, saying it was \"favorable for all Catalans.\"\n\n\"They are agreements designed to improve our finances without harming anyone and whilst respecting the principles of (fiscal) solidarity,\" he said after securing the ERC's support.\n\nBut former Socialist deputy prime minister Alfonso Guerra has said the tax agreement opens \"a path towards a federal system and the independence of Catalonia.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sabah"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Puigdemont insists the referendum was not illegal and so the charges linked to it have no basis.\n\nIn Brussels, he founded Junts, a hardline pro-independence spin-off of his more pragmatic CiU party, to run for the Catalan presidency in the first election following the referendum with the hope of governing remotely. He did not achieve that goal, but in 2019 he was elected as a member of the European Parliament.\n\n'NO SURRENDER'\n\nHis travels outside Belgium led to him being arrested in Germany and Italy, but he still managed to avoid extradition or lengthy detention.\n\nLast spring, he said he was relocating to southern France to run in the Catalan election.\n\nIn July 2023, however, the European Union's General Court stripped him of the legal immunity he had as a parliamentarian.\n\nHis supporters built an image of him as a staunch fighter against Spain's judiciary, under the motto of \"No surrender\", while he insisted he was hoping to return to Catalonia but was not seeking an individual pardon.\n\nHe ran in May's regional election, campaigning from France and hoping for an epic return, but finished second behind the Socialist candidate Salvador Illa as Catalan nationalists lost their parliamentary majority for the first time in four decades.\n\nIn a video message on Wednesday, Puigdemont said his potential arrest would be illegal and arbitrary.\n\nHe had earlier described Spain's efforts to detain him as a \"hybrid coup\", adding: \"If they succeed, I imagine what awaits me and know what I must do.\"\n\n(Reporting by David Latona and Joan Faus; Editing by Andrei Khalip and Andrew Cawthorne)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Government - UrduPoint", "body": "Madrid, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Aug, 2024) Spain faces a crucial political week with a key investiture vote expected in Catalonia which exiled Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont has vowed to attend, even though he could be arrested.\n\nTo form a government, Illa will need at least 68 votes in a first round of voting, or a simple majority in a second round.\n\nIn a letter posted on social network X on Saturday, Puigdemont repeated his plans to return to Catalonia for the upcoming investiture vote.\n\n\"I know that my return may entail arrest and imprisonment, who knows for how long,\" he wrote.\n\nPuigdemont's arrest would \"further up the stakes\" and cast doubt on Sanchez's ability to \"continue governing effectively\", said Eurasia Group senior analyst for Europe, Federico Santi.\n\n- Promised fiscal reform fails -\n\nSanchez could also lose the support of Catalan separatist parties if his government fails to grant Catalonia full control of the taxes collected in the region as promised to the ERC in exchange for its support for Illa.\n\nThe proposal still must be approved by Spain's fractured national parliament where it is opposed by the conservative opposition and faces resistance from some of Sanchez's usual allies.\n\nGlobal intelligence firm Stratfor said Galicia's BNG party and the

Spain's Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that an amnesty law for Catalan separatists that came into force earlier this year would not fully apply to him.\n\nIn a letter posted on social network X on Saturday, Puigdemont repeated his plans to return to Catalonia for the upcoming investiture vote.\n\n\"I know that my return may entail arrest and imprisonment, who knows for how long,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Just as going into exile was a political decision, returning from exile is also a political decision.\"\n\nPuigdemont's arrest would likely inflame the separatist base and could lead the investiture vote to be called off or the ERC to reconsider its support for Illa.\n\nS\u00e1nchez loses support\n\nS\u00e1nchez's minority coalition government relies on six smaller regional parties including the ERC and Puigdemont's JxCAT to pass legislation in the national parliament.\n\nJxCAT has already threatened to block the government's 2025 budget bill as long as legal challenges over the amnesty are pending.\n\nPuigdemont's arrest would \"further up the stakes\" and cast doubt on S\u00e1nchez's ability to \"continue governing effectively\", said Eurasia Group senior analyst for Europe, Federico Santi.\n\nPromised fiscal reform fails\n\nS\u00e1nchez could also lose the support of Catalan separatist parties if his government fails to grant Catalonia full control of the taxes collected in the region as promised to the ERC in exchange for its support for Illa.\n\nThe proposal still must be approved by Spain's fractured national parliament where it is opposed by the conservative opposition and faces resistance from some of S\u00e1nchez's usual allies.\n\nGlobal intelligence firm Stratfor said Galicia's BNG party and the Canary Island's Canary Coalition \"could prove particularly difficult\" since the two regions would be among those \"that may be negatively impacted by the drop in state revenue\".\n\nOther regions may demand the same arrangement and the

The parliamentary speaker has yet to confirm the date.\n\nEXCLUDED FROM AMNESTY\n\nThe Spanish parliament passed an amnesty law in May pardoning those involved in the failed 2017 secession bid, but the Supreme Court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and two others, who were also charged with embezzlement, ruling that the amnesty law does not apply to them.\n\nA source close to Puigdemont told Reuters he had \"no doubt\" that the former leader - who lived in Belgium between 2017 and 2024 while serving as a member of the European Parliament and has in recent months been based in southern France - would be arrested upon re-entering Spain and brought before the Supreme Court in Madrid.\n\nIn an open letter posted on his X account on Friday, Puigdemont described Spain's efforts to detain him as a \"hybrid coup\", adding \"if they succeed, I imagine what awaits me and know what I must do\".\n\nERC spokesperson Raquel Sans acknowledged on Tuesday that Puigdemont's arrest could delay the vote for a new Catalan leader.\n\nPolice will try to arrest Puigdemont before he reaches the heavily guarded parliament building in Barcelona, but are also authorised to enter if needed, El Periodico newspaper reported, citing police sources.\n\nOfficers were also monitoring the sewer system in case it was used for alternative entry routes.\n\nIn 2011, then-leader Artur Mas was forced to access the building's rooftop by helicopter after it was surrounded by nearly 1,000 anti-austerity activists protesting against budget cuts.

"title": "Fugitive Catalan ex-leader Puigdemont returns to Spain and vanishes again", "body": "Puigdemont led the Catalan government during Catalonia's 2017 bid for independence from Spain\n\nCarles Puigdemont, the former leader of Catalonia who fled Spain over his role in a failed 2017 independence bid for the wealthy region, returned to Spain on Thursday after seven years on the run despite a pending arrest warrant but promptly disappeared again.\n\nPuigdemont shouted \"Long live a free Catalonia!\" as he climbed onto a stage in Barcelona to address thousands gathered near the Catalan regional parliament, which is set to elect a new leader later in the day.\n\n\"I have come here to remind you that we are still here,\" he said as many in the crowd waved red, yellow and blue Catalan independence flags.\n\nAfter his brief address, Puigdemont appeared to head towards the nearby Catalan parliament but the assembly began an investiture vote to pick a new leader for the region without him being present.\n\nIt was not immediately clear where he was.\n\nPolice had set up road blocks in Barcelona and were searching cars to try to find Puigdemont, according to Spanish media reports.\n\nContacted by AFP, police declined to comment if such an operation was underway.\n\nNuria Pujol, a woman in her fifties who came to Barcelona from the Alt Penedes region to see Puigdemont, called him \"a very noble person\".\n\n\"(He's) the only one who believes in independence and has not stopped believing,\" she added.\n\nA small group of protesters gathered nearby, waving national Spanish flags and holding signs that read \"Catalonia is Spain\", in a demonstration organised by far-right party Vox.\n\n- 'Problem with democracy' -\n\nPuigdemont's dramatic return came just days after Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialists struck a deal with moderate Catalan separatist party ERC -- which competes with Puigdemont's more hardline JxCAT -- to make the Socialist candidate, Salvador Illa, the next head of the Catalan regional government.\n\nThe Socialists won the most seats in a regional election in May but failed to get a majority and the support of the ERC is crucial.\n\nIf a new Catalan regional government is not formed by August 26, fresh elections will be held in October.\n\nPuigdemont led the regional government of Catalonia in 2017, when it pushed ahead with an independence referendum despite a court ban, followed by a short-lived declaration of independence.\n\nHe fled Spain shortly after the independence bid to avoid prosecution and has since lived in Belgium and more recently France.\n\nWhile Spain's parliament in May passed an amnesty law for those involved in the botched secession bid, the Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that the measure would not fully apply to Puigdemont.\n\n\"A country that has an amnesty law and does not apply it, has a problem with democracy,\" he said in his speech.\n\n- Path to independence? -\n\nSanchez agreed to the amnesty law in exchange for JxCAT's crucial support in Spain's parliament for his fragile minority government, sparking huge street protests that were organised by the right wing.\n\nHe is now facing opposition from parts of his own Socialist party as well as the right over a proposal to give Catalonia full control of the taxes collected in the region.\n\nThe measure was promised to the ERC in exchange for the party's support for Illa in Thursday's Catalan investiture vote.\n\nThe proposal has for decades been one of the main demands of Catalan independence parties but critics argue it would deprive the central state of a substantial source of revenue.\n\nIt must still be approved by Spain's national parliament.\n\nA similar system already exists in Spain's northern Basque Country, which also has an active independence movement.\n\nIf Illa passes Thursday's investiture vote, he will be the first head of Catalonia's regional government since 2010 who does not come from the separatist camp.\n\nThe former health minister has defended the tax agreement made with the ERC, saying it was \"favourable for all Catalans\".\n\n\"They are agreements designed to improve our finances without harming anyone and whilst respecting the principles of (fiscal) solidarity,\" he said after securing the ERC's support.\n\nBut former Socialist deputy prime minister Alfonso Guerra has said the tax agreement opens \"a path towards a federal system and the independence of Catalonia\".\n\nbur-mdm/ds/gil", "source": {"uri": "wfxg.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFXG FOX54"},

Police officers checked every vehicle trying to leave the city, images shown on state broadcaster RTVE showed.\n\nIn some cases, the boots of cars were checked and motorcyclists had to remove their helmets. A white car was being searched for, reported the newspaper El Pa\u00eds.\n\nPuigdemont sought to lead Catalonia to independence in 2017 with a referendum that was declared illegal.\n\nHe risks arrest as the judiciary accuses him of personal enrichment.\n\nPuigdemont rejected the police's offer of an arranged and discreet arrest, according to earlier media reports.\n\nCatalonia to elect new leader\n\nPuigdemont said he planned to be present at the election in parliament of Socialist Salvador Illa as Catalonia's next leader.\n\nIlla, who is believed to have enough backing from Catalan lawmakers, would be the first head of the Catalan government in decades to oppose the region's secession from Spain.\n\nHis party emerged as the strongest force from a snap election in May but needs the support of the ERC, a left-wing separatist party. Illa secured a cooperation deal through concessions on financial issues and the promotion of the Catalan language.\n\nThe second-largest separatist party, Puigdemont's Junts, opposed the agreement.\n\nAccusations of enrichment against Puigdemont\n\nThe latest developments in Catalonia follow an amnesty bill passed in the Spanish parliament earlier this year. It ended legal action against Catalan separatists, but cases of personal enrichment are not immune from prosecution.\n\nPuigdemont is not accused of embezzlement.\n\nHowever, the charge is that he used public funds for his illegal political aims in the 2017 independence referendum, which is tantamount to personal enrichment.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carles_Puigdemont", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carles Puigdemont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amnesty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_independence_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catalan independence movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Together_for_Catalonia_(2020)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Together for Catalonia (2020)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Pa\u00eds", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "El Pa\u00eds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTVE", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RTVE"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Illa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salvador Illa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Catalan_independence_referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2017 Catalan independence referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalitat_de_Catalunya", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generalitat de Catalunya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snap election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortes_Generales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cortes Generales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embezzlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Embezzlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Left_of_Catalonia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Left of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catalan language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/dpa_international_526/32c5fa445862cfdbc609df7a45d203b2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791466", "eventUri": "eng-9791466", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Despite the extensive police efforts, Puigdemont remains at large. Image- Reuters\n\nFormer Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont defied an arrest warrant and appeared at a rally in Barcelona on Thursday after seven years of self-imposed exile.\n\nSpeaking to thousands of supporters from a platform near the Catalan parliament, Puigdemont vowed to reignite the independence movement that threw Spain into a political crisis seven years ago. Following his speech, he vanished before police could arrest him.\n\nCatalan police, under a heavy presence in the city, launched \"Operatiu Gabia\" (Operation Cage) to capture Puigdemont. Officers set up checkpoints at exits from Barcelona, searching for a vehicle that the former Catalan president, who has been wanted by Spanish authorities since 2017, was believed to be traveling in.\n\nThe operation to arrest Puigdemont has since expanded across Catalonia, with checkpoints on major highways, including those connecting Catalonia to France. Despite the extensive police efforts, Puigdemont remains at large.\n\n\"Today, many thought they'd be celebrating my arrest, and thought that this punishment would dissuade us - and you,\" he said. \"Today I came to remind them that we are still here! We are still here because we have no right to quit.\"\n\nSenior officials of his Junts party, including parliament speaker Josep Rull, and members of the moderate separatist Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya which currently runs the regional government led a march to the Catalan parliament after the rally as journalists tried to spot whether Puigdemont was among them.\n\nA debate to swear in Socialist Salvador Illa as Catalonia\u00b4s new president, ending a decade of separatist rule, began amid confusion and speculation about Puigdemont's whereabouts and how he could have vanished in plain sight.\n\n\"We had to see how the state allowed this criminal to hold a rally,\" said Ignacio Garriga, secretary general of the far-right Vox party, told reporters outside the Catalan parliament. \"We don't understand why he hasn't been arrested yet\".\n\nA Catalan Interior Ministry spokesperson confirmed Puigdemont had evaded capture. \"I can confirm Puigdemont has not been detained yet,\" she said. \"I can confirm roadblocks have been set up to find him.\"", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The only one who believes in independence and has not stopped believing,\" Nuria Pujol, a woman in her fifties who came from the Alt Penedes region for the event, told AFP.\n\n- 'Problem with democracy' -\n\nPolice scuffled with a small group that tried to force their way into the regional parliament, using pepper spray to disperse them. Catalan police said they arrested two people and filed charges against 15 others.\n\nPuigdemont's return came just days after Spain's governing Socialists struck a deal with the moderate Catalan separatist ERC party to make Socialist candidate Salvador Illa the next head of the Catalan regional government.\n\nERC is a political rival of Puigdemont's more hardline separatist JxCAT party.\n\nThe Socialists won the most seats in the Catalan regional election in May but failed to get a majority and the support of the ERC is crucial.\n\nIf a new Catalan government is not formed by August 26, a fresh election will be held in October.\n\nPuigdemont led the regional government in 2017, when it pushed ahead with an independence referendum despite a court ban, followed by a short-lived declaration of independence.\n\nHe fled Spain shortly after the independence bid to avoid prosecution and has since lived in Belgium and more recently France.\n\nSpain's parliament passed an amnesty law in May for those involved in the botched secession bid, but the Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that the measure would not fully apply to Puigdemont.\n\n\"A country that has an amnesty law and does not apply it, has a problem with democracy,\" he said in his speech.\n\n- 'Unbearable humiliation' -\n\nThe leader of the main opposition Popular Party, Alberto Nunez Feijoo, called Puigdemont's return to Spain an \"unbearable humiliation\" that damages the country's image.\n\nPrime Minister Pedro Sanchez agreed to the amnesty in exchange for JxCAT's crucial support in the national parliament for his fragile minority government.\n\nThe move sparked huge street protests that were organised by the right wing.\n\nSanchez is now facing opposition from parts of his own Socialist party as well as the right over a proposal to give Catalonia full control of taxes collected in the region.\n\nThe measure was promised to the ERC in exchange for the party's support for Illa in the investiture vote.\n\nThe proposal has for decades been one of the main demands of Catalan independence parties but critics argue it would deprive the central state of substantial revenue.\n\nIt must still be approved by Spain's national parliament.\n\nIf Illa passes the investiture vote, he will be the first head of Catalonia's regional government since 2010 who does not come from the separatist camp.\n\nbur-al/ds/tw", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alfons_luna@ktbs.com", "name": "Alfons Luna", "type": "author",

But ours are not normal democratic conditions.\n\nRelated: Carles Puigdemont: from self-exile to unlikely kingmaker of Spanish politics\n\n\"There are two members, former regional minister Llu\u00eds Puig and myself, who cannot attend freely. This challenge must be answered and confronted.\"\n\nIn May, Spain's parliament approved a divisive amnesty law that the country's socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, offered Catalan separatists in return for helping him back to power. The law applies to about 400 people involved in a symbolic independence referendum in November 2014 and the illegal unilateral poll that followed three years later.\n\nBut in July, Spain's supreme court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and others who are charged with misuse of public funds, ruling that the amnesty law did not apply to them.\n\n\"That I can attend the [Catalan] parliament should be normal,\" Puigdemont said in his video message. \"That to do so risks an arrest that would be arbitrary and illegal is evidence of the democratic anomaly that we have the duty to denounce and fight, not because we are pro-independence, but because we are democrats.\"\n\nPolice have reportedly been tasked with ensuring Puigdemont does not enter the Catalan parliament, limiting access to the area, carrying out room-by-room inspections and even searching the sewers.\n\n\"These are standard security procedures that are carried out before any investiture ceremony,\" a spokesperson for the Catalan force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, told Politico.\n\nIn the recent Catalan regional elections, the socialists won the most seats but failed to attain an overall majority.\n\nThe moderate pro-independence Catalan Republican Left party (ERC), the long-standing rival to Puigdemont's Junts per Catalunya, reached an agreement for the socialist former health minister Salvador Illa to be sworn in as the regional president. He will lead the first non-nationalist Catalan government in more than 20 years in a sign of the weakening of the independence movement since its heyday in 2017.\n\nPuigdemont says it is his duty as former president in exile to attend the investiture and claimed in an open letter that if he is arrested ERC must take some of the blame. ERC has retorted that it is the judicial system, not them, that will be responsible for his arrest.\n\nHis allies have argued that the trip to Spain is a necessity.\n\n\"Puigdemont comes back to Catalonia after seven years in exile. And does so for the same reason that he left: to prove that Spain's rule of law has failed when it comes to the pro-independence movement and Catalonia,\" said Aleix Sarri, Junts' secretary for international affairs and a former adviser to Puigdemont.\n\n\"Jailing him despite the amnesty law would mean that the Catalan pro-independence movement is just treated by the Spanish judiciary as an internal enemy to be repressed. If not even a pact for an amnesty law can be complied with, nothing will, and his detention and jailing would make the case for independence more obvious than ever.\"\n\nBut many see Puigdemont's move as a last throw of the dice for the separatist leader, who so far has shown little appetite for martyrdom, as most of the independence movement has concluded that his policy of el choque de trenes or train crash confrontation with the Spanish government is at a dead end.\n\nThe acting Catalan president, Pere Aragon\u00e8s, has said that even if the investiture is delayed, it will still go ahead.\n\nPuigdemont's arrival and likely arrest could create a headache for the S\u00e1nchez government. The conservative People's party (PP) came first in last year's snap general election but failed to win sufficient support to form a new government.\n\nThat allowed S\u00e1nchez's socialist party to try to bring together votes, which could only do by giving the amnesty as a concession to Catalan political parties. But the move has been highly controversial, sparking demonstrations across the country.\n\nLola Garc\u00eda, the deputy editor of the Catalan daily La Vanguardia - a paper that is historically close to Puigdemont's party - has noted that his arrival could have broader implications for Spain's politics.\n\n\"The possibility of Puigdemont being jailed might complicate things for the Spanish government, although a change of government wouldn't be in his interest at this juncture,\" she said. \"But it won't resuscitate the unity of the independence movement nor the independence process.\"\n\nDespite a formal separation of powers, the Spanish judiciary is viewed - not only by Catalan separatists - as highly politicised and an unreformed relic of the Franco dictatorship.",

Following his speech, Puigdemont fled the scene, sparking a chaotic search by authorities. His return highlights the ongoing conflict over Catalonia's independence drive.\n\nFormer Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont defied an arrest warrant to appear at a rally in Barcelona on Thursday after seven years of self-imposed exile, before fleeing the scene with the help of a local police officer. Amid a heavy police presence, Puigdemont had told a crowd of thousands of followers in the Catalan capital he aimed to revive the independence drive that plunged Spain into political crisis in 2017.\n\n\"They thought they'd be celebrating my arrest and they thought that this punishment would dissuade us,\" he said. \"Well, they are wrong.\" When he had finished speaking, Puigdemont got into a white car belonging to a police officer and left the vicinity, a Catalan government source said, sparking a frantic search by authorities to apprehend him.\n\nThe regional police, known as the Mossos d'Esquadra, said one of its officers had been arrested as part of its investigation into Puigdemont's whereabouts. The separatist leader, 61, fled to Belgium seven years ago after a failed secession bid and has been living in exile ever since.\n\nHe faces an arrest warrant for alleged embezzlement related to a 2017 independence referendum ruled illegal by the Spanish courts. Puigdemont says the vote was legal and therefore the charges linked to it have no basis. A Mossos spokesman said there was no prior arrangement with Puigdemont for his arrest and the force had decided the detention should be made \"at the most appropriate time so as not to generate public disorder.\"\n\nPuigdemont ally Laura Borras described the arrested officer on X as \"a patriot and exemplary Mosso.\" The hunt for Puigdemont created traffic chaos in Barcelona and near the border with France as police set up roadblocks and searched car boots.\n\nIn Barcelona, several Puigdemont supporters clashed with police in a bid to breach the cordon surrounding the park housing the regional parliament building. Officers clad in riot gear used batons and pepper spray to deter them.\n\nReacting to news that Puigdemont had again absconded from under the noses of a large police deployment, a Supreme Court source said a judge had been clear in his instructions that the former Catalan president was to be arrested. \"The Mossos know that they have a detention order. The judge's writ reminded the state security forces that the national arrest warrant for aggravated embezzlement remained active and they had the obligation to detain him and bring him before the courts.\"\n\nTwo national police unions also criticised the failure to arrest Puigdemont. \"Where are the Mossos? The best-paid police force in Spain incapable of doing their job, of arresting the coup-monger and fugitive from justice Puigdemont,\" police union Jusapol said on X.\n\nTwo sources with links to the Catalan government said it had identified a problem with some rogue Mossos, who appear to be loyal to Puigdemont. Alberto Nunez Feijoo, leader of the Spain's opposition People\u00b4s Party (PP) blamed Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez for the situation, describing it as \"an unbearable humiliation.\"\n\n\"It\u00b4s unforgivable to damage Spain's image like this,\" Feijoo said on X. A government spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Puigdemont\u00b4s lawyer.\n\nHis arrest could jeopardise the Socialist-led national government\u00b4s fragile alliance with Puigdemont's Junts party, on which it relies for legislative support. The Socialists hope taking control in Catalonia after a decade of separatist rule will turn the page on the independence drive.\n\nThe Spanish parliament passed an amnesty law in May pardoning those involved in the failed 2017 secession bid, but the Supreme Court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and two others who were also charged with embezzlement, ruling that the amnesty law does not apply to them. The crowd of thousands, who had gathered near the parliament to welcome him, hoped his return would help build momentum towards independence, which has lost support in recent years.\n\n\"It represents the return of a symbol,\" said Xavier Vizcaino, 63, who was wrapped in an independence flag. No-one had expected him to disappear again.\n\nFormer Barcelona Mayor Xavier Trias, who was present at the rally, marvelled at Puigdemont's flight. \"It was magic,\" he told Reuters.", "source":

"title": "Fugitive Catalan ex-leader Puigdemont returns to Spain and vanishes again", "body": "Puigdemont led the Catalan government during Catalonia's 2017 bid for independence from Spain\n\nCarles Puigdemont, the former leader of Catalonia who fled Spain over his role in a failed 2017 independence bid for the wealthy region, returned to Spain on Thursday after seven years on the run despite a pending arrest warrant but promptly disappeared again.\n\nPuigdemont shouted \"Long live a free Catalonia!\" as he climbed onto a stage in Barcelona to address thousands gathered near the Catalan regional parliament, which is set to elect a new leader later in the day.\n\n\"I have come here to remind you that we are still here,\" he said as many in the crowd waved red, yellow and blue Catalan independence flags.\n\nAfter his brief address, Puigdemont appeared to head towards the nearby Catalan parliament but the assembly began an investiture vote to pick a new leader for the region without him being present.\n\nIt was not immediately clear where he was.\n\nPolice had set up road blocks in Barcelona and were searching cars to try to find Puigdemont, according to Spanish media reports.\n\nContacted by AFP, police declined to comment if such an operation was underway.\n\nNuria Pujol, a woman in her fifties who came to Barcelona from the Alt Penedes region to see Puigdemont, called him \"a very noble person\".\n\n\"(He's) the only one who believes in independence and has not stopped believing,\" she added.\n\nA small group of protesters gathered nearby, waving national Spanish flags and holding signs that read \"Catalonia is Spain\", in a demonstration organised by far-right party Vox.\n\n- 'Problem with democracy' -\n\nPuigdemont's dramatic return came just days after Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialists struck a deal with moderate Catalan separatist party ERC -- which competes with Puigdemont's more hardline JxCAT -- to make the Socialist candidate, Salvador Illa, the next head of the Catalan regional government.\n\nThe Socialists won the most seats in a regional election in May but failed to get a majority and the support of the ERC is crucial.\n\nIf a new Catalan regional government is not formed by August 26, fresh elections will be held in October.\n\nPuigdemont led the regional government of Catalonia in 2017, when it pushed ahead with an independence referendum despite a court ban, followed by a short-lived declaration of independence.\n\nMore from this section Tim Walz: teacher, veteran, governor -- and now VP pick Defending Wyndham champ Glover chasing PGA playoffs again Hudson-Smith bids to end 100-year wait as Korda tees off at Olympics\n\nHe fled Spain shortly after the independence bid to avoid prosecution and has since lived in Belgium and more recently France.\n\nWhile Spain's parliament in May passed an amnesty law for those involved in the botched secession bid, the Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that the measure would not fully apply to Puigdemont.\n\n\"A country that has an amnesty law and does not apply it, has a problem with democracy,\" he said in his speech.\n\n- Path to independence? -\n\nSanchez agreed to the amnesty law in exchange for JxCAT's crucial support in Spain's parliament for his fragile minority government, sparking huge street protests that were organised by the right wing.\n\nHe is now facing opposition from parts of his own Socialist party as well as the right over a proposal to give Catalonia full control of the taxes collected in the region.\n\nThe measure was promised to the ERC in exchange for the party's support for Illa in Thursday's Catalan investiture vote.\n\nThe proposal has for decades been one of the main demands of Catalan independence parties but critics argue it would deprive the central state of a substantial source of revenue.\n\nIt must still be approved by Spain's national parliament.\n\nA similar system already exists in Spain's northern Basque Country, which also has an active independence movement.\n\nIf Illa passes Thursday's investiture vote, he will be the first head of Catalonia's regional government since 2010 who does not come from the separatist camp.\n\nThe former health minister has defended the tax agreement made with the ERC, saying it was \"favourable for all Catalans\".\n\n\"They are agreements designed to improve our finances without harming anyone and whilst respecting the principles of (fiscal) solidarity,\" he said after securing the ERC's support.\n\nBut former Socialist deputy prime minister Alfonso Guerra has said the tax agreement opens \"a path towards a federal system and the independence of Catalonia\".\n\nbur-mdm/ds/gil", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news",

Puigdemont insists the referendum was not illegal and so the charges linked to it have no basis.\n\nIn Brussels, he founded Junts, a hardline pro-independence spin-off of his more pragmatic CiU party, to run for the Catalan presidency in the first election following the referendum with the hope of governing remotely. He did not achieve that goal, but in 2019 he was elected as a member of the European Parliament.\n\n'NO SURRENDER'\n\nHis travels outside Belgium led to him being arrested in Germany and Italy, but he still managed to avoid extradition or lengthy detention.\n\nLast spring, he said he was relocating to southern France to run in the Catalan election.\n\nIn July 2023, however, the European Union's

The parliamentary speaker has yet to confirm the date.\n\nEXCLUDED FROM AMNESTY\n\nThe Spanish parliament passed an amnesty law in May pardoning those involved in the failed 2017 secession bid, but the Supreme Court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and two others, who were also charged with embezzlement, ruling that the amnesty law does not apply to them.\n\nA source close to Puigdemont told Reuters he had \"no doubt\" that the former leader - who lived in Belgium between 2017 and 2024 while serving as a member of the European Parliament and has in recent months been based in southern France - would be arrested upon re-entering Spain and brought before the Supreme Court in Madrid.\n\nIn an open letter posted on his X account on Friday, Puigdemont described Spain's efforts to detain him as a \"hybrid coup\", adding \"if they succeed, I imagine what awaits me and know what I must do\".\n\nERC spokesperson Raquel Sans acknowledged on Tuesday that Puigdemont's arrest could delay the vote for a new Catalan leader.\n\nPolice will try to arrest Puigdemont before he reaches the heavily guarded parliament building in Barcelona, but are also authorised to enter if needed, El Periodico newspaper reported, citing police sources.\n\nOfficers were also monitoring the sewer system in case it was used for alternative entry routes.\n\nIn 2011, then-leader Artur Mas was forced to access the building's rooftop by helicopter after it was surrounded by nearly 1,000 anti-austerity activists protesting against budget cuts.\n\n(Reporting by David Latona and Bel\u00e9n Carre\u00f1o;

However, Carles Puigdemont has decided to return to Spain after nearly seven years of exile. He announced in a video on the X website that he will be present at the inauguration of the new regional president of Catalonia, the socialist Salvador Illa.\n\n\"I am convinced that there is no other path to normal democratic life than the end of political repression,\" the separatist leader said in the video. That means he will not consider the situation in Catalonia normal again until what he calls \"repression\" ends. He believes he should not be arrested. It is not clear where the video was filmed. Puigdemont is pictured with the Catalan and European flags in the background.\n\nCarles Puigdemont has been in exile in Brussels since October 2017. He probably fled to Belgium in the boot of a car, after the independence referendum that was banned by Spanish judges. He spent most of his time as a member of the European Parliament for his Junts per Catalunya party. But all the while he wanted to return to Spain as soon as possible.\n\nAt the end of last year, it seemed for a while that Puigdemont would be granted amnesty and thus be able to return. Spanish Prime Minister S\u00e1nchez struck a deal with two Catalan independence parties. In return for their support for his coalition, an amnesty law was passed, granting amnesty to Catalan separatists, among others, who played a role in the independence referendum.\n\nBut from the beginning it was not clear whether Puigdemont would also be subject to this law. Early last month it was decided that this was not the case. The court stated that the law did not apply to the crimes he was accused of committing.\n\nHe is accused of embezzling public funds because the Catalan government paid for an illegal independence referendum. As a result, the law does not apply to Puigdemont, and he can always be arrested if he sets foot on Spanish soil.\n\nEarly elections were held in Catalonia in May. Puigdemont then ran for party leader. Despite the arrest warrant, he promised to return to Catalonia if he won and attend his inauguration as regional president. He waited for the results in the southern French city of Perpignan.\n\nBut the result was disappointing for Catalan separatists: the Socialist Party won the elections. The separatist bloc has shrunk and the two main independence parties, ERC and Junts, no longer have a majority.\n\nOn Saturday, the PSC and the ERC, among others, signed a provisional agreement to install Salvador Illa as regional president. The same day, Puigdemont announced that he would attend the inauguration. It now appears that it could be hours before the separatist leader is arrested in Barcelona.\n\nBecause he called on his supporters and fellow party members to come to the entrance gate of the park where Parliament is located an hour before the opening. From Paseo Llu\u00eds he wants to walk to Parliament.\n\nThere is a high probability that he will be caught in front of the cameras and in front of his supporters, and just before the inauguration, the focus will not be on the new regional president, but on the former regional president.\n\nIf this scenario comes to pass, Illa's inauguration will be postponed. Puigdemont himself could be taken to Madrid for questioning after his arrest. It's a moment he has been postponing for years, but now it seems to have finally arrived.", "source": {"uri": "houstonianonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "houstonianonline.com"}, "authors":

We are still here because we have no right to quit.\"\n\nMr Puigdemon defiantly appeared in Barcelona after travelling from Belgium and faces charges of embezzlement for his part in the attempt to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain by organising an illegal independence referendum in 2017.\n\nAfter his speech, Mr Puigdemont was swiftly whisked through the crowd by members of his Together for Catalonia (Junts) party but was then nowhere to be seen among the politicians who later reached parliament.\n\nThe Catalan Interior Department has since confirmed he is on the run again and says they have set up roadblocks in a bid to arrest him. Police are stopping and searching vehicles heading towards the French border and there are traffic controls around the city centre following reports that Puigdemont was seen leaving in a car.\n\nA Catalan Interior Ministry spokesperson confirmed Puigdemont had evaded capture. \"I can confirm Puigdemont has not been detained yet,\" she said. \"I can confirm roadblocks have been set up to find him.\"\n\nThursday's parliamentary session is set to see socialist Salvador Illa to be appointed as the new Catalan president, ending more than 10 years of separatist governments in the northeastern Spanish region.\n\nMr Puigdemont's return poses a direct challenge to Spain's judicial authorities and its delicate coalition government, risking a resurgence of tensions between Catalan separatists and Madrid.\n\nIn a video released on Wednesday, outlining his plan to return, Mr Puigdemont complained about being unable to \"attend freely\" and of \"a long persecution.\"\n\nHe said: \"That I can attend the parliament should be normal. That to do so risks an arrest that would be arbitrary and illegal is evidence of the democratic anomaly that we have the duty to denounce and fight.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear how authorities will proceed if Mr Puigdemont is arrested. A contentious amnesty Bill, crafted by Spain's Socialist-led coalition government, could potentially clear him and hundreds of other supporters of Catalan independence of any wrongdoing over the illegal 2017 ballot.\n\nBut the Bill, approved by Spain's parliament earlier this year, is being challenged by the Supreme Court, leaving uncertainty about what crimes would be pardoned. Mr Puigdemont could initially be placed in pre-trial detention if he is arrested.\n\nThe former Catalan leader's return threatened to complicate a deal brokered after months of deadlock between Illa's Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) and the other main Catalan separatist party and left-wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC).\n\nThat deal had ensured just enough support in Catalonia's parliament for Mr Illa to become the next regional president\n\n\"We had to see how the state allowed this criminal to hold a rally,\" Ignacio Garriga, secretary general of the far-right Vox party, told reporters outside the Catalan parliament. \"We don't understand why he hasn't been arrested yet\".", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Puigdemont returns to Spain and vanishes again", "body": "Puigdemont led the Catalan government during Catalonia's 2017 bid for independence from Spain\n\nCarles Puigdemont, the former leader of Catalonia who fled Spain over his role in a failed 2017 independence bid for the wealthy region, returned to Spain on Thursday after seven years on the run despite a pending arrest warrant but promptly disappeared again.\n\nPuigdemont shouted \"Long live a free Catalonia!\" as he climbed onto a stage in Barcelona to address thousands gathered near the Catalan regional parliament, which is set to elect a new leader later in the day.\n\n\"I have come here to remind you that we are still here,\" he said as many in the crowd waved red, yellow and blue Catalan independence flags.\n\nAfter his brief address, Puigdemont appeared to head towards the nearby Catalan parliament but the assembly began an investiture vote to pick a new leader for the region without him being present.\n\nIt was not immediately clear where he was.\n\nPolice had set up road blocks in Barcelona and were searching cars to try to find Puigdemont, according to Spanish media reports.\n\nContacted by AFP, police declined to comment if such an operation was underway.\n\nNuria Pujol, a woman in her fifties who came to Barcelona from the Alt Penedes region to see Puigdemont, called him \"a very noble person\".\n\n\"(He's) the only one who believes in independence and has not stopped believing,\" she added.\n\nA small group of protesters gathered nearby, waving national Spanish flags and holding signs that read \"Catalonia is Spain\", in a demonstration organised by far-right party Vox.\n\n- 'Problem with democracy' -\n\nPuigdemont's dramatic return came just days after Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialists struck a deal with moderate Catalan separatist party ERC -- which competes with Puigdemont's more hardline JxCAT -- to make the Socialist candidate, Salvador Illa, the next head of the Catalan regional government.\n\nThe Socialists won the most seats in a regional election in May but failed to get a majority and the support of the ERC is crucial.\n\nIf a new Catalan regional government is not formed by August 26, fresh elections will be held in October.\n\nPuigdemont led the regional government of Catalonia in 2017, when it pushed ahead with an independence referendum despite a court ban, followed by a short-lived declaration of independence.\n\nHe fled Spain shortly after the independence bid to avoid prosecution and has since lived in Belgium and more recently France.\n\nWhile Spain's parliament in May passed an amnesty law for those involved in the botched secession bid, the Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that the measure would not fully apply to Puigdemont.\n\n\"A country that has an amnesty law and does not apply it, has a problem with democracy,\" he said in his speech.\n\n- Path to independence? -\n\nSanchez agreed to the amnesty law in exchange for JxCAT's crucial support in Spain's parliament for his fragile minority government, sparking huge street protests that were organised by the right wing.\n\nHe is now facing opposition from parts of his own Socialist party as well as the right over a proposal to give Catalonia full control of the taxes collected in the region.\n\nThe measure was promised to the ERC in exchange for the party's support for Illa in Thursday's Catalan investiture vote.\n\nThe proposal has for decades been one of the main demands of Catalan independence parties but critics argue it would deprive the central state of a substantial source of revenue.\n\nIt must still be approved by Spain's national parliament.\n\nA similar system already exists in Spain's northern Basque Country, which also has an active independence movement.\n\nIf Illa passes Thursday's investiture vote, he will be the first head of Catalonia's regional government since 2010 who does not come from the separatist camp.\n\nThe former health minister has defended the tax agreement made with the ERC, saying it was \"favourable for all Catalans\".\n\n\"They are agreements designed to improve our finances without harming anyone and whilst respecting the principles of (fiscal) solidarity,\" he said after securing the ERC's support.\n\nBut former Socialist deputy prime minister Alfonso Guerra has said the tax agreement opens \"a path towards a federal system and the independence of Catalonia\".\n\nbur-mdm/ds/gil\n\nMore from this section\n\nEmpowering Youth and Adults with the Truth About Drugs\n\nLutheran Home's 'Best

He punched the air to cheers on a bright, sunny day.\n\nThe event was organised by his political party Together for Catalonia (Junts), hours before a new regional government was to take office nearby.\n\nLocal police were deployed in a security ring around a section of the park where Catalonia's parliament building is located behind walls.

Spain's Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, depends on the support of Junts per Catalunya's seven MPs in the Spanish parliament.\n\nPuigdemont, who has been living in self-imposed exile in Belgium after organising an illegal independence referendum in Catalonia, had declared earlier this week he would be at the Catalan parliament in Barcelona on Thursday as it swore in the region's new leader.\n\nSpeaking on a stage at the Arc de Triomf, symbolically close to the law courts and the Catalan parliament, he told the crowd of mainly older supporters: \"I've come here today to remind you that we're still here. We don't have the right to give in, the right to self-determination belongs to the people. Catalonia must be allowed to decide its future.\n\n\"I don't know when I'll see you again but, whatever happens, when we see each other again we can once again shout out Viva! Free Catalonia!\"\n\nPuigdemont was then whisked away, surrounded by members of his Together for Catalonia party, apparently in the direction of the parliament building. However, when the group arrived at parliament, he was not among them.\n\nDetails emerged of how Puigdemont managed to get to the stage, and then escape, despite the presence of about 300 uniformed and plainclothes police officers. A crowd of a couple of dozen people was used to shield him from view as he walked from the narrow Passatge de Sant Benet to the Arc de Triomf; once his speech was over, the crowd again shielded him as he reached a hidden screen and entered a waiting car.\n\nUnconfirmed reports on Catalan radio said Puigdemont had made a pact with the police that if officers allowed him to speak at the Arc de Triomf, he would then surrender to them.\n\nMeanwhile, an hour after the ex-president's dramatic appearance and escape, the investiture of the new Catalan president, Salvador Illa, began. Illa, a socialist and former health minister in the Madrid government, won the most seats in last month's regional election but failed to gain an overall majority.\n\nRelated: Catalans once longed for freedom from Spain. Now that doesn't look so appealing | Mar\u00eda Ram\u00edrez\n\nPro-independence parties have previously been able to put together an alliance to keep the socialists from power but lacked the support this time, however. Their options were to accept a socialist-led government, led by Illa, or go to the polls again, an option that was in no one's interest.\n\nPuigdemont's party, which came second in the election, refused to support Illa's candidacy but he won the support of the rival separatist Republican Left party in exchange for offering Catalonia greater fiscal autonomy.\n\nIf part of the aim of the Puigdemont escapade was to overshadow Illa's investiture, it succeeded. But the latter's coming to power meant that for the first time in 20 years, Catalonia will have a regional government for which social issues, rather than sovereignty, are top of the agenda.\n\nAt the investiture, Illa praised his predecessor, Pere Aragon\u00e8s, saying he had left Catalonia in better shape than he had found it. Adding that his preferred associates were Aragon\u00e8s' Republican Left party and the leftwing Catalunya en Com\u00fa, he said: \"I have come here to construct, not to dismantle, and to make the most of my predecessor's achievements.\"\n\nPuigdemont fled to Belgium in October 2017 in the boot of a car to evade arrest for his part in the failed and illegal declaration of Catalan independence. Nine members of his government received jail sentences of up to 13 years for their part in the independence push and all were pardoned three years later in 2021.\n\nA divisive amnesty law for those involved in the symbolic independence referendum in November 2014 and the illegal unilateral poll that followed three years later was passed by the Spanish parliament in May as S\u00e1nchez, struck a deal with Catalan separatist MPs to help him return to power. However, Spain's supreme court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and others who were charged with misuse of public funds, ruling that the amnesty law did not apply to them. Puigdemont insists the vote was not illegal and that the charges linked to it therefore have no basis.\n\nThe Spanish government has not commented on Puigdemont's reappearance and vanishing act, but the conservative People's party leader, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, said Thursday's events were \"an unbearable humiliation\".\n\n\"It's painful to watch this madness live - a madness for which Pedro S\u00e1nchez is chiefly responsible. Damaging Spain's image like this is unforgivable,\" he said.\n\nThe far-right Vox party's Santiago Abascal described the events as \"the destruction of the state beamed live on Spanish television\".\n\nLike so much in Catalan politics, Puigdemont's dramatic reappearance was symbolic and in many ways an act of desperation, as the movement he led is divided and in disarray, and support for independence is at its lowest in 15 years. By refusing to support Illa's investiture, his party has parked itself in the margins of Catalan politics, leaving its arch-rival, the Republican Left, to become the leading voice of Catalan nationalism.\n\nPuigdemont came to rally the troops but his forces are older and the average age of the crowd that gathered to greet him on Thursday was well above 60. Far from being a new beginning, the prevailing mood at the event was one of ecstatic nostalgia.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The only one who believes in independence and has not stopped believing,\" Nuria Pujol, a woman in her fifties who came from the Alt Penedes region for the event, told AFP.\n\n- 'Problem with democracy' -\n\nPolice scuffled with a small group that tried to force their way into the regional parliament, using pepper spray to disperse them. Catalan police said they arrested two people and filed charges against 15 others.\n\nPuigdemont's return came just days after Spain's governing Socialists struck a deal with the moderate Catalan separatist ERC party to make Socialist candidate Salvador Illa the next head of the Catalan regional government.\n\nERC is a political rival of Puigdemont's more hardline separatist JxCAT party.\n\nThe Socialists won the most seats in the Catalan regional election in May but failed to get a majority and the support of the ERC is crucial.\n\nMore from this section Dementia May Not Be as Common Among Parkinson's Patients as Thought New garden to commemorate Queen Elizabeth II Why Gen Z and millennials no longer relax while on vacation\n\nIf a new Catalan government is not formed by August 26, a fresh election will be held in October.\n\nPuigdemont led the regional government in 2017, when it pushed ahead with an independence referendum despite a court ban, followed by a short-lived declaration of independence.\n\nHe fled Spain shortly after the independence bid to avoid prosecution and has since lived in Belgium and more recently France.\n\nSpain's parliament passed an amnesty law in May for those involved in the botched secession bid, but the Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that the measure would not fully apply to Puigdemont.\n\n\"A country that has an amnesty law and does not apply it, has a problem with democracy,\" he said in his speech.\n\n- 'Unbearable humiliation' -\n\nThe leader of the main opposition Popular Party, Alberto Nunez Feijoo, called Puigdemont's return to Spain an \"unbearable humiliation\" that damages the country's image.\n\nPrime Minister Pedro Sanchez agreed to the amnesty in exchange for JxCAT's crucial support in the national parliament for his fragile minority government.\n\nThe move sparked huge street protests that were organised by the right wing.\n\nSanchez is now facing opposition from parts of his own Socialist party as well as the right over a proposal to give Catalonia full control of taxes collected in the region.\n\nThe measure was promised to the ERC in exchange for the party's support for Illa in the investiture vote.\n\nThe proposal has for decades been one of the main demands of Catalan independence parties but critics argue it would deprive the central state of substantial revenue.\n\nIt must still be approved by Spain's national parliament.\n\nIf Illa passes the investiture vote, he will be the first head of Catalonia's regional government since 2010 who does not come from the separatist camp.\n\nbur-al/ds/tw", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alfons_luna@reformer.com", "name": "Alfons

A government spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Puigdemont\u00b4s lawyer.\n\nRISK OF PRISON\n\nOn Wednesday, Puigdemont had announced he had started his \"return trip from exile\", saying he remained committed to attending Thursday's session of the regional parliament, which is sitting to swear in the region's new leader following an election in May, in which Puigdemont's Junts party finished second.\n\nHis arrest could jeopardise the national government\u00b4s fragile alliance with Junts, on which it relies for legislative support.\n\nIn the morning, a crowd of thousands had gathered near the parliament to welcome him and hear him speak.\n\nSeveral police vans were located nearby after radical protest group CDR called on its members to attend the gathering.\n\n\"It represents the return of a symbol,\" said Xavier Vizcaino, 63, who was wrapped in an independence flag.\n\nGiven the risk of imprisonment, Vizcaino said he was unclear of Puigdemont's intentions but hoped his return would build momentum towards independence.\n\n\"I hope it is a stimulus that helps the movement recover energy and efforts,\" he said. \"I want to believe there is a well structured plan behind his return.\"\n\nThe vote to invest Socialist Illa, who will be backed by the left-wing separatist ERC party after a bilateral deal last week, began an hour later.\n\nThe Socialists hope taking control in Catalonia after a decade of separatist rule will turn the page on the independence drive.\n\nThe Spanish parliament passed an amnesty law in May pardoning those involved in the failed 2017 secession bid, but the Supreme Court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and two others who were also charged with embezzlement, ruling that the amnesty law does not apply to them.\n\nThe embezzlement charges were related to the 2017 independence referendum ruled illegal by the Spanish courts.\n\nPuigdemont insists the vote was not illegal and so the charges linked to it have no basis.\n\nWearing a T-shirt and waving a flag with Puigdemont's face and the motto 'No surrender', 41-year-old Susana Masnou described his return as an act of \"democratic disobedience\" to make sure the amnesty law applies to him.\n\n\"He is a very brave man, with convictions, risk his life to move the country forward,\" she said.\n\n(Reporting by David Latona, Joan

The only one who believes in independence and has not stopped believing,\" Nuria Pujol, a woman in her fifties who came from the Alt Penedes region for the event, told AFP.\n\n- 'Problem with democracy' -\n\nPolice scuffled with a small group that tried to force their way into the regional parliament, using pepper spray to disperse them. Catalan police said they arrested two people and filed charges against 15 others.\n\nPuigdemont's return came just days after Spain's governing Socialists struck a deal with the moderate Catalan separatist ERC party to make Socialist candidate Salvador Illa the next head of the Catalan regional government.\n\nERC is a political rival of Puigdemont's more hardline separatist JxCAT party.\n\nThe Socialists won the most seats in the Catalan regional election in May but failed to get a majority and the support of the ERC is crucial.\n\nIf a new Catalan government is not formed by August 26, a fresh election will be held in October.\n\nPuigdemont led the regional government in 2017, when it pushed ahead with an independence referendum despite a court ban, followed by a short-lived declaration of independence.\n\nHe fled Spain shortly after the independence bid to avoid prosecution and has since lived in Belgium and more recently France.\n\nSpain's parliament passed an amnesty law in May for those involved in the botched secession bid, but the Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that the measure would not fully apply to Puigdemont.\n\n\"A country that has an amnesty law and does not apply it, has a problem with democracy,\" he said in his speech.\n\n- 'Unbearable humiliation' -\n\nThe leader of the main opposition Popular Party, Alberto Nunez Feijoo, called Puigdemont's return to Spain an \"unbearable humiliation\" that damages the country's image.\n\nPrime Minister Pedro Sanchez agreed to the amnesty in exchange for JxCAT's crucial support in the national parliament for his fragile minority government.\n\nThe move sparked huge street protests that were organised by the right wing.\n\nSanchez is now facing opposition from parts of his own Socialist party as well as the right over a proposal to give Catalonia full control of taxes collected in the region.\n\nThe measure was promised to the ERC in exchange for the party's support for Illa in the investiture vote.\n\nThe proposal has for decades been one of the main demands of Catalan independence parties but critics argue it would deprive the central state of substantial revenue.\n\nIt must still be approved by Spain's national parliament.\n\nIf Illa passes the investiture vote, he will be the first head of Catalonia's regional government since 2010 who does not come from the separatist camp.\n\nbur-al/ds/tw\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox28spokane.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 28 Spokane"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Now, he's back -- and elusive as ever.\n\nAfter nearly seven years on the run, exiled separatist Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has returned to Spain, flying in the face of a warrant out for his arrest.\n\nHis return comes seven years after Catalonia's unauthorised independence referendum, a vote that was not sanctioned by Spanish authorities and which attracted a notorious police crackdown.\n\nNot long after that incident, Puigdemont smuggled himself out of the country in the boot of a car to avoid arrest, setting himself up in Brussels as successive Spanish governments sought to have him extradited to stand trial.\n\nEarlier this week, Puigdemont posted a letter on social media network X, followed by a video, stating he intends to come back to Spain to prevent the Catalan parliament from voting in favour of a socialist-led regional government.\n\nThis prompted speculation on how he intends to enter the country despite the warrant. However, his brief appearance at his party Junts-organised rally in Barcelona on Thursday left many feeling like they'd seen a ghost of Spain's unresolved past.\n\nPuigdemont, who started out as a journalist for Catalonia's pro-independence newspaper El Punt, claims to have always been in favour of the rich Spanish region's independence.\n\nWhile he enjoyed professional success, rising through the ranks of El Punt to become its editor-in-chief and later founding the Catalan News Agency, his first trouble with the law came during the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, when he was arrested for participating in an organisation supporting Catalan nationalists.\n\nHis first foray into politics saw him join the Catalan nationalist coalition Convergence and Union, successfully contesting the election results to enter the regional parliament from Girona.\n\nA two-time mayor of Girona, Puigdemont ran the Association of Municipalities for Independence and was then chosen as pro-Catalan independence parties' last-minute replacement for corruption-plagued Artur Mas as the region's next president in 2016.\n\nKnown for staunch separatist stances, Puigdemont caused upheaval as the first Catalan president to refuse to take the oath of loyalty to Spain's constitution and the monarch -- standard practice prior to his appointment.\n\nBut the real trouble was only beginning to brew.\n\nIn October 2017, during his second year in office, Puigdemont decided to respond to increasingly heated exchanges with Madrid by cooking up legislation that would allow Catalonia to organise a referendum on its independence, contravening the country's constitution.\n\nThe conservative government of Mariano Rajoy, reeling from the move, put into effect a much-criticised Operation Anubis, a sprawling police action meant to prevent the referendum and restore constitutional order.\n\nInstead, things spiralled out of control: as Guardia Civil, or Civil Guard -- the country's gendarmerie -- raided a number of Catalan government offices and other locations in the run-up to the referendum, sparking protests and strikes that ended up in clashes and arrests, and general pandemonium in Barcelona streets.\n\nDespite this, the referendum went ahead. Undeterred by Catalan secession opponents' boycott and a low turnout of just 43%, Puigdemont called the vote a success, pushing for a declaration of independence by the regional parliament on 27 October 2017.\n\nThis prompted the Spanish Senate to invoke Article 155 of the constitution, dismissing Puigdemont and taking full control of Catalonia. By 30 October, the Spanish attorney general charged Puigdemont and other members of the Catalan government with rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds -- carrying maximum sentences of 30, 15 and six years in jail, respectively.\n\nThe same day the charges came down, Puigdemont found himself on the way to Belgium in the boot of a car. There, he took up his seat as an MEP in the European Parliament, claiming immunity from any extradition process.\n\nMeanwhile, the excessive use of police force to quell unrest in Catalonia tanked Rajoy's popularity, ruining his prior reputation as a quiet if sometimes clumsy leader. Socialist Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the leading opposition figure at the time, requested a vote of no confidence on an unrelated issue.\n\nIt was only the fourth such motion voted on since Spain became a democracy following fascist dictator Francisco Franco's death in 1971 -- and was the first one to pass. Rajoy's career was over.\n\nAside from Puigdemont's issues with Catalonia's new government -- which will likely be completely uninterested in the region's independence -- the politics of the Catalan issue changed somewhat earlier this year, when Spain's current government passed a highly controversial law granting amnesty to hundreds of separatists involved in the 2017 vote.\n\nFirst mooted at the end of last year, the amnesty was agreed to by Prime Minister S\u00e1nchez as part of an effort to soothe tensions between Catalan leaders and the government in Madrid, and to ease the process of forming a national government.\n\nThe proposal met with outrage from protesters who did not want to see the separatist movement legitimised or forgiven -- especially given that Puigdemont and several other leaders stand accused of committing assorted crimes, among them the alleged misuse of funds to finance the unsanctioned plebiscite.\n\nIt was heavily criticised by the country's two main right-wing parties, the Popular Party and Vox, and also had critics in the ranks of S\u00e1nchez's socialist party PSOE, some going so far as to condemn the law as unconstitutional. Nonetheless, after weeks of protest, the amnesty was finally approved by the Spanish parliament in May this year.\n\nBut soon after the law was passed, the Spanish Supreme Court ruled that it could not be applied to Puigdemont or other leaders accused of embezzlement and collaborating in a project that \"affects the financial interests of the European Union\" -- a reference to the drop in Spain's EU contributions that would presumably result from Catalan separation.\n\nYet despite this setback, Puigdemont has now suddenly returned to Spain, addressing a crowd in Barcelona before disappearing -- leaving the police to hunt him down while right-wing politicians call for him to be locked up.\n\nWhile the Spanish state's principal grievance against Puigdemont is his effort to stage the 2017 referendum and the disruptive impact his independence campaign has had, he and other separatist leaders also face longstanding allegations of unacceptable dealings with agents of the Russian government.\n\nThese stories came to the forefront in 2021, when Puigdemont was four years into his exile. One detailed report from the New York Times revealed that one of Puigdemont's closest advisers, Josep Lluis Alay, had travelled to Moscow in 2019 to seek help with the independence cause.\n\nBoth Alay and Puigdemont acknowledged to the paper that the meeting had occurred but denied they were seeking help from the Kremlin, calling that claim \"a fantasy story created by Madrid\".\n\nHowever, in 2022 investigative outlet OCCRP and others, including Bellingcat and El Peri\u00f3dico, showed that Puigdemont himself held a meeting with Russian diplomat Nikolai Sadovnikov right before the Catalan independence vote in October 2017.\n\nThe investigation and documents delivered to the Spanish judiciary are said to contain proof that Sadovnikov offered Puigdemont up to \"$500 billion and a small army\" of 10,000 troops in return for laws favouring cryptocurrencies, in what the judge in charge of the case labelled as a Kremlin attempt to assert \"political and economic influence\" over an independent Catalonia.\n\nSadovnikov is believed to be Russian President Vladimir Putin's trusted lead negotiator in southern Europe, a region he specialises in after having served at the Soviet and Russian embassies in Rome and Milan since 1984.\n\nAs it became increasingly clear that the conservative government of Mariano Rajoy would crack down on Catalan separatists' attempts to split from Spain, the Kremlin was seeking to capitalise on instability in the rest of Europe with chaos in mind -- a strategy that became apparent after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nSince Russia ramped up its all-out war against its neighbour, European capitals and Brussels are increasingly demanding thorough investigations into Russia's malign influence.\n\nThis February, the European Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of an EPP and Renew-backed resolution urging the Spanish judiciary to investigate the alleged links between Catalan MEPs and the Kremlin, including Puigdemont.\n\nThe vote came amid other Moscow-related scandals, including Russiagate, a sprawling probe into a Russian influence operation suspected to have paid sitting MEPs to spread pro-Kremlin propaganda from the heart of EU institutions in Brussels, and an investigation into Latvian MEP Tatjana \u017ddanoka -- who openly supported amnesty for Catalan leaders -- for being a Russian informant.\n\nJunts MEP Toni Com\u00edn rejected the accusations levelled in February as \"false\", claiming an independent Catalonia would have sought to become a full-fledged EU member state.\n\nMeanwhile, Spanish divisions have come to the surface once again since Puigdemont's brief appearance in Barcelona on Thursday.\n\nRight after the Junts rally, held in plain sight on one of Barcelona's busiest squares, the Catalan police, Mossos d'Esquadra, launched a search-and-arrest operation, setting up roadblocks across the city.\n\nHowever, their early efforts were not a success. Instead, Mossos ended up arresting one of their own officers for allegedly helping Puigdemont escape, according to local reports.\n\nThis prompted different law enforcement agencies in Spain to start pointing fingers at each other over their collective failure to apprehend him.\n\nThe JUPOL police union accused local officers of facilitating the arrival of the separatist leader to the event. \"Puigdemont has entered through the crowd thanks to the Mossos who act as escorts for Junts officials,\" a post on X read.\n\nAnother police union, SUP, has demanded that the Mossos should be relieved of control of the search, suggesting that Spain's National Police or Guardia Civil should be in charge instead.\n\nThe Mossos' handling of the operation has been an \"absolutely monumental failure\" that \"makes a mockery of our judicial system,\" the SUP spokesperson said, according to the domestic press.\n\nIf arrested, Puigdemont will first have to face a judge who will determine whether he will remain in custody or be granted the right to defend himself outside of jail -- according to the provisions of the new amnesty law.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType":

pardoning those involved in the failed 2017 secession bid, but the Supreme Court upheld arrest warrants for Mr Puigdemont and two others who were also charged with embezzlement, ruling that the amnesty law does not apply to them.\n\nThe court said the three obtained personal gain by charging the expenses of holding the independence referendum deemed illegal by the Spanish judiciary to the regional treasury, a move he described as not being in the public interest.\n\nMr Puigdemont insists the referendum was not illegal and so the charges linked to it have no basis.", "source": {"uri":

It still must be approved by Spain's national parliament.\n\nA similar system already exists in Spain's northern Basque Country, which also has an active independence movement.\n\nIf Illa passes Thursday's investiture vote, he will be the first head of Catalonia's regional government who does not come from the separatist camp since 2010.\n\nThe former health minister has defended the tax

Catalan premier and fugitive from justice Carles Puigdemont returned to Spain on Thursday, seven years after he fled the country to escape arrest for his role in the 2017 drive for independence in the northeastern region.\n\nOn arrival in Barcelona, he gave a speech to an estimated crowd of around 2,500 people outside the parliament building, during which he denounced the actions of the Spanish state.\n\nHe was also met with protests from supporters of far-right Vox.\n\nHe then promptly disappeared, sparking a police search with the aim of arresting him and stopping him from slipping back to a base he has in the south of France.\n\nRead more: Carles Puigdemont will return to Spain this week after seven years in exile\n\n\"For seven years now they have been persecuting us for wanting to hear the voice of the people of Catalonia,\" the politician said to the crowds. \"Very harsh repression began years ago now.\n\n\"It is not, nor will it ever be, a crime to hold a referendum,\" he said defiantly.\n\nPuigdemont was referring to the vote on independence that was organised by pro-secessionist leaders on October 1, 2017.\n\nThe vote was deemed illegal by the courts, and there were shocking scenes of police violence on that day as the central authorities tried to stop Catalans from going out to vote.\n\nDespite the lack of census and legal guarantees, those who voted chose independence for Catalunya.\n\n\"They have turned being Catalan into something that is suspicious,\" he said of the Spanish government, which after the 2017 referendum and subsequent unilateral declaration of independence sacked Puigdemont's administration and called new elections.\n\nPuigdemont, the leader of the Junts per Catalunya party, also referred in his speech to an amnesty law recently passed by the Socialist-led government of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, which aims to further calm the waters between Madrid and the region and could, potentially, be applied to Puigdemont to avoid his prosecution.\n\n\"We are not interested in being in a country in which amnesty laws do not grant amnesty,\" he said, in reference to the ongoing doubts as to whether the courts will apply those laws to his case or whether he will eventually be arrested and prosecuted.\n\nPuigdemont returned today, after seven years spent living in self-imposed exile in Belgium, to coincide with the investiture debate that will take place in the parliament in the wake of the regional elections that were held in May of this year.\n\nThe result of the vote was inconclusive, but Socialist candidate and former central health minister Salvador Illa will be standing as regional premier, and is expected to have enough votes to secure the position thanks to the support of Junts' rival party ERC (the Catalan Republican Left), and other, smaller political groups. .\n\nThe regional police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, did not arrest Puigdemont on Thursday morning when he made his speech, despite the arrest warrant out against him.\n\nThey did, however, close the exits of Barcelona after Puigdemont vanished from public view, despite the large police presence, and were reportedly seeking a car in which he was thought to be travelling.\n\nWith his appearance today, Puigdemont was seeking to reestablish himself as the leader of the independence movement, call for the amnesty law to be applied to him, and to protest against the investiture of Salvador Illa as regional premier.\n\nPro-independence support has dwindled in recent years in Catalunya, however, and his return is being viewed by many as an effort to stay relevant in both Spain and the region.\n\nAt the May regional elections, separatist parties failed to win an outright majority for the first time in decades.", "source": {"uri":

Carles Puigdemont appeared at a rally near the Catalan parliament in Barcelona on Thursday morning despite facing an outstanding arrest warrant. The AP reports he spoke \"in front of a large crowd of supporters\" and \"under the noses of police officers, who made no attempt to detain him.\" After speaking on stage, Puigdemont walked into an adjacent marquee tent, \"hurried out of an exit and jumped into a waiting car that sped away.\"\n\nPolice were caught off guard. They'd organized \"a security ring\" near parliament, where Puigdemont was expected to go after the speech, the AP reports. Police then set up roadblocks and checked vehicles around the city, including those traveling in the direction of France, in the hope of caging the former leader, who's believed to have been on foreign soil since 2017. That year, Puigdemont and other of Catalonia's pro-independence leaders organized a referendum, then declared the region independent from Spain. But Spain's constitutional court had ruled the referendum to be illegal.\n\nFacing embezzlement charges, Puigdemont fled for the Belgian capital of Brussels, though his most recent place of residence is unclear, per the AP. Earlier this week, he said he planned to return to Spain Thursday for the swearing in of Catalonia's new government, though his travel plans were kept secret. The 61-year-old fugitive shouted \"Long live a free Catalonia!\" as he took the stage in Barcelona before accusing authorities of \"a crackdown\" on the separatist movement, per AFP and the AP. \"For the last seven years we have been persecuted because we wanted to hear the voice of the Catalan people,\" he said. \"Holding a referendum is not and will never be a crime,\" he added, per the BBC.\n\nOne of his goals is to pressure authorities into applying a new amnesty law for those involved in the independence bid to him. Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez backed the legislation to gain support from Puigdemont's hardline separatist party JxCat, though the Supreme Court ruled it would not fully apply to Puigdemont, per AFP. To ensure moderate Catalan separatist party ERC backs Socialist Salvador Illa as Catalonia's next president, Sanchez also backed a proposal to give Catalonia full control of taxes collected in the region. \"If Illa passes Thursday's investiture vote, he will be the first head of Catalonia's regional government who does not come from the separatist camp since 2010,\" per AFP.

We don't have the right to give in, the right to self-determination belongs to the people. Catalonia must be allowed to decide its future.\n\n\"I don't know when I'll see you again but, whatever happens, when we see each other again we can once again shout out Viva! Free Catalonia!\"\n\nPuigdemont was then whisked away, surrounded by members of his Together for Catalonia party, in the direction of the parliament building. However, when the group arrived at parliament, he was not among them.\n\nCatalan police are stopping and searching vehicles heading towards the French border and there are traffic controls around the city centre following reports that Puigdemont was seen leaving in a car.\n\nPuigdemont, who has been living in self-imposed exile in Belgium for seven years after organising an illegal independence referendum in Catalonia, had declared this week he would be at the Catalan parliament in Barcelona on Thursday as it swore in the region's new leader.\n\nMeanwhile, an hour after the ex-president's dramatic appearance, the investiture of the new Catalan president, Salvador Illa, began. Illa, a socialist and former health minister in the Madrid government, won the most seats in last month's regional election but failed to gain an overall majority.\n\nPro-independence parties have previously been able to put together an alliance to keep the socialists from power but lacked the support this time, however. Their options were to accept a socialist-led government, led by Illa, or go to the polls again, an option that was in no one's interest.\n\nPuigdemont's party, which came second in the election, refused to support Illa's candidacy but he won the support of the rival separatist Republican Left party in exchange for offering Catalonia greater fiscal autonomy.\n\nPuigdemont fled to Belgium in October 2017 in the boot of a car to evade arrest for his part in the failed and illegal declaration of independence. Nine members of his government received jail sentences of up to 13 years for their part in the independence push and all were pardoned three years later in 2021.\n\nA divisive amnesty law that the country's socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, offered Catalan separatists in return for helping him back to power was then approved by the Spanish parliament in May. The law applies to about 400 people involved in a symbolic independence referendum in November 2014 and the illegal unilateral poll that followed three years later but in July, Spain's supreme court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and others who are charged with misuse of public funds, ruling that the amnesty law did not apply to them.\n\nLike so much in Catalan politics, Puigdemont's dramatic reappearance was symbolic and in many ways an act of desperation, as the movement he led is divided and in disarray, and support for independence is at its lowest in 15 years. By refusing to support Illa's investiture, his party has parked itself in the margins of Catalan politics, leaving its arch-rival, the Republican Left, to become the leading voice of Catalan nationalism.\n\nPuigdemont came to rally the troops but his forces are elderly and the average age of the crowd gathered to greet him here today was well above 60. Far from being a new beginning, the prevailing mood at today's event was one of ecstatic nostalgia.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors":

We don't have the right to give in, the right to self-determination belongs to the people. Catalonia must be allowed to decide its future.\n\n\"I don't know when I'll see you again but, whatever happens, when we see each other again we can once again shout out Viva! Free Catalonia!\"\n\nPuigdemont was then whisked away, surrounded by members of his Together for Catalonia party, in the direction of the parliament building. However, when the group arrived at parliament, he was not among them.\n\nCatalan police are stopping and searching vehicles heading towards the French border and there are traffic controls around the city centre following reports that Puigdemont was seen leaving in a car.\n\nPuigdemont, who has been living in self-imposed exile in Belgium for seven years after organising an illegal independence referendum in Catalonia, had declared this week he would be at the Catalan parliament in Barcelona on Thursday as it swore in the region's new leader.\n\nMeanwhile, an hour after the ex-president's dramatic appearance, the investiture of the new Catalan president, Salvador Illa, began. Illa, a socialist and former health minister in the Madrid government, won the most seats in last month's regional election but failed to gain an overall majority.\n\nRelated: Catalans once longed for freedom from Spain. Now that doesn't look so appealing | Mar\u00eda Ram\u00edrez\n\nPro-independence parties have previously been able to put together an alliance to keep the socialists from power but lacked the support this time, however. Their options were to accept a socialist-led government, led by Illa, or go to the polls again, an option that was in no one's interest.\n\nPuigdemont's party, which came second in the election, refused to support Illa's candidacy but he won the support of the rival separatist Republican Left party in exchange for offering Catalonia greater fiscal autonomy.\n\nPuigdemont fled to Belgium in October 2017 in the boot of a car to evade arrest for his part in the failed and illegal declaration of independence. Nine members of his government received jail sentences of up to 13 years for their part in the independence push and all were pardoned three years later in 2021.\n\nA divisive amnesty law that the country's socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, offered Catalan separatists in return for helping him back to power was then approved by the Spanish parliament in May. The law applies to about 400 people involved in a symbolic independence referendum in November 2014 and the illegal unilateral poll that followed three years later but in July, Spain's supreme court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and others who are charged with misuse of public funds, ruling that the amnesty law did not apply to them.\n\nLike so much in Catalan politics, Puigdemont's dramatic reappearance was symbolic and in many ways an act of desperation, as the movement he led is divided and in disarray, and support for independence is at its lowest in 15 years. By refusing to support Illa's investiture, his party has parked itself in the margins of Catalan politics, leaving its arch-rival, the Republican Left, to become the leading voice of Catalan nationalism.\n\nPuigdemont came to rally the troops but his forces are elderly and the average age of the crowd gathered to greet him here today was well above 60. Far from being a new beginning, the prevailing mood at today's event was one of ecstatic nostalgia.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

Police have said they are ready to arrest him, which would threaten to spur fresh unrest in Catalonia and potentially destabilise the governing coalition in Madrid.\n\nThe 61-year-old Puigdemont, who has been living in Belgium, did not say in his announcement when or how he would arrive in Spain. He faces several charges linked to his role in the region's 2017 independence bid, which included the organisation of an illegal referendum.\n\n\"I have started the return trip from exile,\" he said in a video posted on X, adding that he intended to attend Thursday's parliamentary session in Barcelona at which Socialist Salvador Illa is due to be appointed as the new Catalan president. That will end more than 10 years of separatist governments in the northeastern Spanish region.\n\nThe event is likely to attract a significant number of supporters for the hardline separatist.\n\nAlthough Puigdemont did not disclose how he would travel or where he would enter Spain, Catalonia's regional police said they intend to obey court orders to arrest him if he appears.\n\nPuigdemont said he recognised that he \"cannot attend freely\" the scheduled parliamentary session and accused authorities of \"a long persecution\".\n\n\"This challenge must be answered and confronted,\" he said.\n\nPuigdemont's potential arrest and imprisonment threatens to unleash fresh turmoil in Catalonia.\n\nIt could also destabilise the fragile Socialist-led coalition ruling Spain, which relies on Puigdemont's hardline Junts party to pass legislation.\n\nAs a condition set by Junts for its legislative support for Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's government, Spain's parliament in May approved an amnesty law aimed at allowing Puigdemont's return from Belgium by cancelling legal proceedings against hundreds of separatists.\n\nHowever, the Spainish Supreme Court said last month that amnesty should not apply to a charge of embezzlement against Puigdemont, and upheld the arrest warrant against him.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news",

It still must be approved by Spain's national parliament.\n\nA similar system already exists in Spain's northern Basque Country, which also has an active independence movement.\n\nIf Illa passes Thursday's investiture vote, he will be the first head of Catalonia's regional government who does not come from the separatist camp since 2010.\n\nThe former health minister has defended the tax agreement made with the ERC, saying they are \"in favour of all Catalans\".\n\n\"They are agreements to improve our financing without harming anyone and maintaining criteria of solidarity,\" he said after securing the ERC's support.\n\nBut former Socialist deputy prime minister Alfonso Guerra has warned the tax agreement opens \"a path towards a federal system and the independence of Catalonia\".\n\nbur-mdm/ds/ach", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clay Center Dispatch On-Line"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He addressed a fired up crowd of supporters, saying he planned to attend a vote on a new Catalan president in the regional parliament later in the day.\n\nCatalan regional police have surrounded the parliament building since Wednesday in anticipation of his return and legal experts say they are obliged to execute the arrest warrant.\n\n\"It has been seven years since they persecuted us for wanting to listen to the voice of the people of Catalonia,\" Puigdemont, 61, said. \"Despite the fact they wanted to do us harm, despite the fact they have shown their face as repressers, today I came here to remind you that we are still here.\"\n\nThe return of Puigdemont, a man seen by many as a symbol of the long-running separatist struggle against the Spanish state, is set to roil national politics and re-energise parts of the Catalan independence movement loyal to him.\n\nIf he is arrested the stability of the government will be cast into doubt as Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez needs the votes of Puigdemont's party to reach a parliamentary majority in Madrid.\n\nS\u00e1nchez had struck an amnesty deal with Catalan leaders in return for their votes, but the Supreme Court earlier this year said the amnesty would not apply to the charge of misuse of funds against Puigdemont even though it eliminated another charge of disobedience.\n\nThat leaves S\u00e1nchez open to accusations that he has not fulfilled his side of the bargain.\n\nIf Puigdemont's party, Junts per Catalunya, boycotts any S\u00e1nchez initiatives, the prime minister will end up hobbled in parliament and unable to pass any legislation.\n\nThe Catalan leader's arrest could trigger a \"radicalisation within Junts\", said Joan Botella, emeritus professor at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. There had been a growing \"wave of demands\" for moderation inside the separatist party, but his arrest was likely to embolden hardliners, he said.\n\nPuigdemont fled the country in October 2017, crossing the border into France crouched down on the back seat of a \u0160koda. A few days later Spanish authorities issued an arrest warrant for him.\n\nPuigdemont said on Wednesday that he must return to Spain to \"confront\" the judges. \"We cannot remain silent in the face of the attitude of rebellion in which some judges of the Supreme Court have indulged,\" he said in a video posted on X.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carles_Puigdemont", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carles Puigdemont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Government_of_Catalonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of the Government of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_S\u00e1nchez", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_independence_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catalan independence movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amnesty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Together_for_Catalonia_(2020)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Together for Catalonia (2020)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_University_of_Barcelona", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autonomous University of Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252Fd5f6f55c-eb70-49bd-bd2c-1c83dcba3407.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791466", "eventUri": "eng-9791466", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-10-", "textStart": 2440, "textEnd": 2452}], "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Police also checked vehicles heading on highways to neighbouring France.\n\nMr Puigdemont faces charges of embezzlement for his part in an attempt to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain in 2017. As regional president and separatist party leader at the time, he was a key player in an independence referendum that was outlawed by the central government but went ahead anyway.\n\nThose events triggered a political crisis that unsettled Spain for months.\n\nMr Puigdemont's appearance in Barcelona, Catalonia's capital, and his game of cat-and-mouse with police stole the show on a day when a new government was being sworn in at the regional parliament.\n\nLocal police were deployed in a security ring around a section of the park where Catalonia's parliament building is located behind walls.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Puigdemont, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and tie, walked with supporters to the nearby stage where he gave his speech.\n\nAddressing the crowd in the park and at times pumping his fist, he accused Spanish authorities of \"a crackdown\" on the Catalan separatist movement.\n\n\"For the last seven years we have been persecuted because we wanted to hear the voice of the Catalan people,\" he said. \"They have made being Catalan into something suspicious.\"\n\nHe added: \"All people have the right to self-determination.\"\n\nThe turn of events is likely to bring political recriminations.\n\nThe leader of the Popular Party, the main opposition to Spain's left-of-centre coalition government which has long rebuffed Catalonia's independence movement, condemned Mr Puigdemont's return.\n\nAlberto Nunez Feijoo posted on X, formerly Twitter, that Mr Puigdemont's reappearance is an \"unbearable humiliation\" that damages Spain's reputation.\n\nSpain's government encouraged a deal brokered after months of deadlock between Salvador Illa's Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) and the other main Catalan separatist party and left-wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC). That deal had ensured just enough support in Catalonia's parliament for Mr Illa to become the next regional president on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking to Catalan politicians before the vote, Mr Illa called for reconciliation and respect for Spain's controversial amnesty Bill. He vowed to govern for all Catalans after years of bitter divisions between those in favour of independence and those against it.\n\nMr Puigdemont has dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in north-east Spain - a struggle which is decades-old. His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government.\n\nA contentious amnesty Bill, crafted by Spain's Socialist-led coalition government, could potentially clear him and hundreds of other supporters of Catalan independence of any wrongdoing in the 2017 ballot. Spain's central government and the Constitutional Court declared at the time that the referendum was illegal.\n\nBut the Bill, approved by Spain's Parliament earlier this year, is being challenged by the Supreme Court, which argues that the pardon does not apply to embezzlement, unlike other crimes that Mr Puigdemont had previously been charged with.\n\nMr Puigdemont could be placed in pre-trial detention if he is arrested.", "source": {"uri": "expressandstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Express & Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Puigdemont insists the referendum was not illegal and so the charges linked to it have no basis.\n\nIn Brussels, he founded Junts, a hardline pro-independence spin-off of his more pragmatic CiU party, to run for the Catalan presidency in the first election following the referendum with the hope of governing remotely. He did not achieve that goal, but in 2019 he was elected as a member of the European Parliament.\n\nHis travels outside Belgium led to him being arrested in Germany and Italy, but he still managed to avoid extradition or lengthy detention.\n\nLast spring, he said he was relocating to southern France to run in the Catalan election.\n\nIn July 2023, however, the European Union's General Court stripped him of the legal immunity he had as a parliamentarian.\n\nHis supporters built an image of him as a staunch fighter against Spain's judiciary, under the motto of \"No surrender\", while he insisted he was hoping to return to Catalonia but was not seeking an individual pardon.\n\nHe ran in May's regional election, campaigning from France and hoping for an epic return, but finished second behind the Socialist candidate Salvador Illa as Catalan nationalists lost their parliamentary majority for the first time in four decades.\n\nIn a video message on Wednesday, Puigdemont said his potential arrest would be illegal and arbitrary.\n\nHe had earlier described Spain's efforts to detain him as a \"hybrid coup\", adding: \"If they succeed, I imagine what awaits me and know what I must do.\"\n\n(Reporting by David Latona and Joan Faus; Editing by Andrei Khalip and Andrew Cawthorne)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But ours are not normal democratic conditions.\n\n\"There are two members, former regional minister Llu\u00eds Puig and myself, who cannot attend freely. This challenge must be answered and confronted.\"\n\nIn May, Spain's parliament approved a divisive amnesty law that the country's socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, offered Catalan separatists in return for helping him back to power. The law applies to about 400 people involved in a symbolic independence referendum in November 2014 and the illegal unilateral poll that followed three years later.\n\nBut in July, Spain's supreme court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and others who are charged with misuse of public funds, ruling that the amnesty law did not apply to them.\n\n\"That I can attend the [Catalan] parliament should be normal,\" Puigdemont said in his video message. \"That to do so risks an arrest that would be arbitrary and illegal is evidence of the democratic anomaly that we have the duty to denounce and fight, not because we are pro-independence, but because we are democrats.\"\n\nPolice have reportedly been tasked with ensuring Puigdemont does not enter the Catalan parliament, limiting access to the area, carrying out room-by-room inspections and even searching the sewers.\n\n\"These are standard security procedures that are carried out before any investiture ceremony,\" a spokesperson for the Catalan force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, told Politico.\n\nIn the recent Catalan regional elections, the socialists won the most seats but failed to attain an overall majority.\n\nThe moderate pro-independence Catalan Republican Left party (ERC), the long-standing rival to Puigdemont's Junts per Catalunya, reached an agreement for the socialist former health minister Salvador Illa to be sworn in as the regional president. He will lead the first non-nationalist Catalan government in more than 20 years in a sign of the weakening of the independence movement since its heyday in 2017.\n\nPuigdemont says it is his duty as former president in exile to attend the investiture and claimed in an open letter that if he is arrested ERC must take some of the blame. ERC has retorted that it is the judicial system, not them, that will be responsible for his arrest.\n\nHis allies have argued that the trip to Spain is a necessity.\n\n\"Puigdemont comes back to Catalonia after seven years in exile. And does so for the same reason that he left: to prove that Spain's rule of law has failed when it comes to the pro-independence movement and Catalonia,\" said Aleix Sarri, Junts' secretary for international affairs and a former adviser to Puigdemont.\n\n\"Jailing him despite the amnesty law would mean that the Catalan pro-independence movement is just treated by the Spanish judiciary as an internal enemy to be repressed. If not even a pact for an amnesty law can be complied with, nothing will, and his detention and jailing would make the case for independence more obvious than ever.\"\n\nBut many see Puigdemont's move as a last throw of the dice for the separatist leader, who so far has shown little appetite for martyrdom, as most of the independence movement has concluded that his policy of el choque de trenes or train crash confrontation with the Spanish government is at a dead end.\n\nThe acting Catalan president, Pere Aragon\u00e8s, has said that even if the investiture is delayed, it will still go ahead.\n\nPuigdemont's arrival and likely arrest could create a headache for the S\u00e1nchez government. The conservative People's party (PP) came first in last year's snap general election but failed to win sufficient support to form a new government.\n\nThat allowed S\u00e1nchez's socialist party to try to bring together votes, which could only do by giving the amnesty as a concession to Catalan political parties. But the move has been highly controversial, sparking demonstrations across the country.\n\nLola Garc\u00eda, the deputy editor of the Catalan daily La Vanguardia - a paper that is historically close to Puigdemont's party - has noted that his arrival could have broader implications for Spain's politics.\n\n\"The possibility of Puigdemont being jailed might complicate things for the Spanish government, although a change of government wouldn't be in his interest at this juncture,\" she said. \"But it won't resuscitate the unity of the independence movement nor the independence process.\"\n\nDespite a formal separation of powers, the Spanish judiciary is viewed - not only by Catalan separatists - as highly politicised and an unreformed relic of the Franco dictatorship.",

Former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont addressed his supporters in the center of Barcelona and then disappeared in the crowd. Although the event was filmed by a large number of journalists, the politician's whereabouts are now unknown, the El Mundo newspaper reported.\n\nAccording to the media, the police have not yet arrested Puigdemont. He returned to Spain for the first time since he fled about seven years ago. Puigdemont, who is subject to a national arrest warrant, wanted to attend the regional parliamentary debate that has begun on whether to approve the candidacy of Socialist Salvador Illa to lead the autonomous community. The Cadena SER radio station reported, in turn, that Catalan police have launched a special operation to prevent Puigdemont's possible escape, including controls at the exits of Barcelona.\n\nIt is not yet known how Puigdemont managed to reach Barcelona unhindered. After addressing hundreds of supporters, the crowd surrounded him to escort him to the regional parliament and prevent him from being arrested, as originally planned. However, it soon became clear that Puigdemont was not among those making their way to the chamber.\n\nIn June, Spain enacted an amnesty law for those involved in the Catalan separatist process. However, Spain's Supreme Court did not grant amnesty to Puigdemont and left in force the national warrant for his arrest. The Supreme Court deemed that embezzling public funds, the crime which the politician is accused of, does not fall under amnesty.\n\nThe 61-year-old Puigdemont headed the Catalan government from 2016 to 2017. Under his leadership, the region held a separatist referendum on October 1, 2017, which Madrid initially called illegal.

He punched the air to cheers on a bright, sunny day.\n\nThe event was organised by his political party Together for Catalonia (Junts), hours before a new regional government was to take office nearby.\n\nLocal police were deployed in a security ring around a section of the park where Catalonia's parliament building is located behind walls. Mr Puigdemont walked towards the building followed by masses of supporters.\n\nHe had earlier announced publicly that he was returning to Spain, though he gave no travel details.\n\nMr Puigdemont's presence in Spain is likely to generate renewed political tension over the smouldering issue of Catalan independence. The failed secession attempt triggered a protracted constitutional crisis.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how authorities will proceed if he is arrested.\n\nA contentious amnesty Bill, crafted by Spain's Socialist-led coalition government, could potentially clear him and hundreds of other supporters of Catalan independence of any wrongdoing over the illegal 2017 ballot.\n\nBut the Bill, approved by Spain's parliament earlier this year, is being challenged by the Supreme Court, leaving uncertainty about what crimes would be pardoned. Mr Puigdemont could initially be placed in pre-trial detention if he is arrested.\n\nThe former Catalan leader's return threatened to complicate a deal brokered after months of deadlock between Salvador Illa's Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) and the other main Catalan separatist party and left-wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC).\n\nThat deal had ensured just enough support in Catalonia's parliament for Mr Illa to become the next regional president in an investiture debate on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carles_Puigdemont", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carles Puigdemont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Together_for_Catalonia_(2020)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Together for Catalonia (2020)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embezzlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Embezzlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Council_of_Catalonia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive Council of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_independence_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catalan independence movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Illa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salvador Illa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Government_of_Catalonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of the Government of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialists'_Party_of_Catalonia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Socialists' Party of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Left_of_Catalonia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Left of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amnesty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8478/4239169_2_articlelarge_85baada5286d47369745f106101311ff.jpg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791466", "eventUri": "eng-9791466", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

It still must be approved by Spain's national parliament.\n\nA similar system already exists in Spain's northern Basque Country, which also has an active independence movement.\n\nIf Illa passes Thursday's investiture vote, he will be the first head of Catalonia's regional government who does not come from the separatist camp since 2010.\n\nThe former health minister has defended the tax agreement made with the ERC, saying they are \"in favour of all Catalans\".\n\n\"They are agreements to improve our financing without harming anyone and maintaining criteria of solidarity,\" he said after securing the ERC's support.\n\nBut former Socialist deputy prime minister Alfonso Guerra has warned the tax agreement opens \"a path towards a federal system and the independence of Catalonia\".\n\nbur-mdm/ds/ach", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alfons_luna@reformer.com", "name": "Alfons Luna", "type":

We don't have the right to give in, the right to self-determination belongs to the people. Catalonia must be allowed to decide its future.\n\n\"I don't know when I'll see you again but, whatever happens, when we see each other again we can once again shout out Viva! Free Catalonia!\"\n\nMr Puigdemont was then whisked away, surrounded by members of his Together for Catalonia party, apparently in the direction of the parliament building. However, when the group arrived at parliament, he was not among them.\n\nDetails emerged of how Mr Puigdemont managed to get to the stage, and then escape, despite the presence of about 300 uniformed and plainclothes police officers. A crowd of a couple of dozen people was used to shield him from view as he walked from the narrow Passage de Sant Benet to the Arc de Triomf; once his speech was over, the crowd again shielded him as he reached a hidden screen and entered a waiting car.\n\nUnconfirmed reports on Catalan radio said Mr Puigdemont had made a pact with the police that if officers allowed him to speak at the Arc de Triomf, he would then surrender to them.\n\nMeanwhile, an hour after the ex-president's appearance and escape, the investiture of the new Catalan president, Salvador Illa, began. Mr Illa, a socialist and former health minister in the Madrid government, won the most seats in last month's regional election but failed to gain an overall majority.\n\nPro-independence parties have previously been able to put together an alliance to keep the socialists from power but lacked the support this time, however. Their options were to accept a socialist-led government, led by Illa, or go to the polls again, an option that was in no one's interest.\n\nMr Puigdemont's party, which came second in the election, refused to support Mr Illa's candidacy but he won the support of the rival separatist Republican Left party in exchange for offering Catalonia greater fiscal autonomy.\n\nIf part of the aim of the Puigdemont escapade was to overshadow Illa's investiture, it succeeded. But the latter's coming to power meant that for the first time in 20 years, Catalonia will have a regional government for which social issues, rather than sovereignty, are top of the agenda.\n\nAt the investiture, Mr Illa praised his predecessor, Pere Aragon\u00e8s, saying he had left Catalonia in better shape than he had found it. Adding that his preferred associates were Aragon\u00e8s' Republican Left party and the left-wing Catalunya en Com\u00fa, he said: \"I have come here to construct, not to dismantle, and to make the most of my predecessor's achievements.\"\n\nMr Puigdemont fled to Belgium in October 2017 in the boot of a car to evade arrest for his part in the failed and illegal declaration of Catalan independence. Nine members of his government received jail sentences of up to 13 years for their part in the independence push and all were pardoned three years later in 2021.\n\nA divisive amnesty law for those involved in the symbolic independence referendum in November 2014 and the illegal unilateral poll that followed three years later was passed by the Spanish parliament in May as Spain's socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, struck a deal with Catalan separatist MPs to help him return to power. However, Spain's supreme court upheld arrest warrants for Mr Puigdemont and others who were charged with misuse of public funds, ruling that the amnesty law did not apply to them. Mr Puigdemont insists the vote was not illegal and that the charges linked to it therefore have no basis.\n\nThe Spanish government has not commented on Puigdemont's reappearance and vanishing act, but the conservative People's party leader, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, said Thursday's events were \"an unbearable humiliation\".\n\n\"It's painful to watch this madness live - a madness for which Pedro S\u00e1nchez is chiefly responsible. Damaging Spain's image like this is unforgivable,\" he said.\n\nThe far-right Vox party's Santiago Abascal described the events as \"the destruction of the state beamed live on Spanish television\".\n\nLike so much in Catalan politics, Puigdemont's dramatic reappearance was symbolic and in many ways an act of desperation, as the movement he led is divided and in disarray, and support for independence is at its lowest in 15 years. By refusing to support Illa's investiture, his party has parked itself in the margins of Catalan politics, leaving its arch-rival, the Republican Left, to become the leading voice of Catalan nationalism.\n\nMr Puigdemont came to rally the troops but his forces are older and the average age of the crowd that gathered to greet him on Thursday was well above 60. Far from being a new beginning, the prevailing mood at the event was one of ecstatic nostalgia. - Guardian", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"},

All you need to know about the exiled Catalan separatist leader - Olive Press News Spain", "body": "THE Mossos d'Esquadra, Catalunya's police force, launched 'Operation Cage' this morning in an attempt to locate and arrest Carles Puigdemont, the separatist leader who has lived in exile for seven years.\n\nBut who is Carles Puigdemont and why has his brief reappearance in Barcelona prompted a massive manhunt that has seen police officers block off exits from the city and search underground sewers?\n\nBorn in Amer, a small village in the province of Girona, a young Carles dropped out of university to pursue a career in journalism.\n\nHe quickly rose through the ranks at El Punt, a Catalan language newspaper with a fiercely nationalist outlook, where he soon became editor-in-chief.\n\nPuigdemont left journalism in 2006 to enter the world of politics where he joined Convergence and Union (CiU), a center-right pro-independence alliance including the Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC) which ruled Catalonia for 23 consecutive years until 2003 under the leadership of Jordi Pujol.\n\nREAD MORE: Chaos in Spain's Catalunya: Police hunt exiled former leader Carles Puigdemont after speech near parliament declaring independence referendum legal\n\nHe was elected as an MP for the constituency of Girona, a role he held until 2017.\n\nPuigdemont's rise coincided with a radicalisation of Catalan nationalism - in 2010, Spain's Constitutional Court rejected an amendment of Catalunya's State of Autonomy approved by the Spanish parliament, effectively ruling that there is only one new nation within Spain, and threw out a new fiscal pact proposed by Artur Mas, the former regional premier, designed to produce a fairer tax system.\n\nIn 2011, he became the Mayor of Girona. Five years later, after an agreement was struck between Junts pel S\u00ed (JxS\u00ed) and the Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP), Puigdemont was elected as the 130th President of the Government of Catalunya.\n\nAs President, Puigdemont followed a 'road-map' for independence initiated by his predecessors.\n\nOn September 7, 2017, despite the steadfast opposition of the conservative Partido Popular (PP) Madrid government led by Mariano Rajoy, he approved laws permitting an independence referendum.\n\nREAD MORE: Spain's Supreme Court rejects amnesty for Carles Puigdemont: Arrest warrant remains for ex-President of Catalunya\n\nOn October 1, 2017, the referendum took place, with 92% of voters opting for independence, albeit with a turnout of just 43%.\n\nThe referendum hit headlines across the world after videos and pictures spread of the Policia Nacional and Guardia Civil violently shutting down polling stations and removing voters.\n\nAcross Catalunya, over 1,000 civilians were injured in the violence.\n\nThe Constitutional Court declared the referendum to be a breach of the Spanish Constitution and, therefore, illegal.\n\nOn October 27, after much deliberation, the Catalan parliament, known as the Generalitat, unilaterally declared independence, prompting the most significant political crisis in Spain since the Franco dictatorship.\n\nThe Rajoy-led government immediately dismissed Puigdemont and his allies, and imposed direct rule on Catalunya before calling new elections.\n\nCriminal charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds were brought against Puigdemont and other members of his government, prompting him to flee Spain in the boot of a car over the French border.\n\nEver since, Puigdemont has lived in Belgium. In 2019, he was elected as an MEP (Member of European Parliament), allowing him to continue his political work from Brussels.\n\nREAD MORE: Socialist ally of Pedro Sanchez set to be named as new President of Catalunya after summer of negotiations with separatist parties\n\nHe is now leader of Junts per Catalunya, a conservative, pro-independence party that features many former members of Puigdemont's government.\n\nAfter an inconclusive national election in July 2023, Pedro Sanchez, leader of the socialist PSOE, turned to Puigdemont's separatists to source the votes needed to command a majority within the Cortes, the parliament, and thus become Prime Minister.\n\nAs part of the deal, Sanchez agreed to approve an amnesty law designed to quash criminal charges against those involved in the independence drive in 2017.\n\nPuigdemont was expected to be the most high-profile beneficiary of the controversial pact, which was fiercely criticised by the PP and far-right Vox, but a court ruling last month judged that the amnesty did not apply to the charge of embezzlement of public funds.\n\nAs such, an arrest warrant against him remains active.\n\nIn May's Catalan regional election, Puigdemont's Junts party came second with 35 seats in the Generalitat, behind the pro-unity Socialists led by Salvador Illa.\n\nEarlier this month, Illa successfully negotiated a deal with the pro-independence, left-wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC) to support his investiture as new regional president in exchange for key concessions including a new financial modelling system described as a step towards 'fiscal sovereignty'.\n\nREAD MORE: Mossos police officer is arrested after 'helping separatist Carles Puigdemont disappear in Spain' following his return from exile\n\nDuring the election campaign, Puigdemont had promised to attend the investiture debate in person, even with the arrest warrant hanging over his head.\n\nThis morning, Puigdemont returned to Spain for the first time since 2017.\n\nFlanked by members of his Junts party, Puigdemont gave a brief speech to thousands of pro-independence supporters outside the regional parliament building, located in the Parc de la Ciutadella in the centre of Barcelona.\n\nAfter the speech, Puigdemont quickly disappeared, prompting police to attempt to block all exits out of the Catalan capital to impede him from fleeing Spain once more.\n\nAccording to reports, police are searching for the location of a white Honda, owned by a now-arrested Mossos officer accused of aiding the escape, which they believe Puigdemont used to escape the city and likely head towards the French border.\n\nIt appears that, for now, Puigdemont has yet again successfully eluded the police.", "source": {"uri": "theolivepress.es",

With an arrest warrant in force against Puigdemont for his part in organizing a referendum on independence in the northern Spanish region in 2017, which was declared illegal by the central government and the Constitutional Court, everything points to the fact that the leader of the Together for Catalonia (JuntsxCat) political formation, who has been in exile in Belgium, has reneged on his promise to appear at the investiture debate to install Salvador Illa as the new regional premier after a deal brokered between the Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) and the left-wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC). The Catalan police had been expected to arrest Puigdemont, who has been on the run for seven years, before the investiture. Puigdemont alleged latest escape act, televised in the presence of police deployment of over 300 agents in Barcelona, has left the Mossos in a state of stupefaction with commanders themselves describing the incident as an \"historic ridicule.\"\n\nThe former Catalan leader -- who was at the helm of the Generalitat regional administration from 2016 until he was removed from office by the central government after the October 2017 unilateral declaration of Catalan independence -- reappeared at around 9 a.m. in Barcelona before a crowd of around 3,500 people gathered at the gates of the regional parliament building. \"For the last seven years we have been persecuted because we wanted to hear the voice of the Catalan people,\" Puigdemont said. \"They have made being Catalan into something suspicious. All people have the right to self-determination.\" Puigdemont also accused the Spanish authorities of launching a \"crackdown\" on the Catalan separatist movement.\n\nAlthough the Socialist-led coalition government led by Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez pushed through an amnesty bill earlier this year as a way to move past the 2017 secession attempt and to secure the backing of two Catalan separatist parties to form a government after inconclusive general elections in July 2023 turned them into kingmakers. S\u00e1nchez has already pardoned nine jailed Catalan independence leaders but the bill is being challenged in the Supreme Court, which argues the pardon does not apply to the charge of embezzlement, which Puigdemont faces. \"We are not interested in being in a country where amnesty laws did not provide amnesty,\" Puigdemont said Thursday.\n\nSources of the Supreme Court explain that the Mossos \"knew\" they were under the obligation to arrest Puigdemont. These sources stress that the order of the investigating judge Pablo Llarena, who agreed not to apply the amnesty, was \"very \"clear.\"\n\nEverything now points to the fact that Puigdemont has once again managed to give the Mossos d'Esquadra the slip, after he vanished when he was expected to walk to the regional parliament building escorted by the masses of his supporters. The police suspect that Puigdemont is traveling in a white Peugeot, according to sources from the Mossos, who have withheld all official information about their plans to arrest the former Catalan premier.\n\nThe operation has led to serious traffic problems in Catalonia while the police carry out controls in the vicinity of Barcelona, as well as one the main highways, the region's borders, on trains and at the port. A police helicopter has been scrambled as part of the effort to locate Puigdemont. \"The force does not deserve this embarrassment. The chief commissioner, Eduard Sallent, the general director, Pere Ferrer, and the councilor himself, Joan Ignasi Elena, must all provide explanations,\" one of the main labor unions representing the Mossos, the Sap-Fepol, told EL PA\u00cdS through its spokesman, Toni Castej\u00f3n.\n\nThe security services have for weeks been planning Puigdemont's detention after he announced that he would attend the investiture. An arrest plan was outlined, awaiting confirmation of the manner in which Puigdemont would choose to return. Police sources suspect that the former regional leader has been in Catalonia since Tuesday. Unofficially, police force commanders have insisted that their mission was not to track Puigdemont's exact whereabouts 24 hours a day, but to arrest him the moment he emerged in public. \"There is no active search,\" they insisted.\n\nDuring the negotiations over Puigdemont's reappearance, officials from the Mossos contacted the former president's lawyer, Gonzalo Boye, to discuss the possibility of agreeing on a discreet arrest. Puigdemont rejected the offer. His detention was delegated to a commander of the General Police Station of Information. It would then pass to judicial disposition for Judge Llarena to decide the future of the former regional premier, which could include pre-trial detention or a court appearance and the application of bail conditions. \"We are being made to look ridiculous,\" said another commander of the Mossos. \"This paints us all in a bad light,\" added another, while the search for Puigdemont remains active.",

Illa came first in May's regional election but without an overall majority. In recent days he had secured the support of left-wing separatist ERC's regional MPs in a controversial political deal in order for him to become Catalan Leader.\n\nPuigdemont, leader of the rival main independence party to ERC in Catalonia, right-of-centre Junts per Si, won a seat in the May election despite living outside Spain. He had long promised to return as a regional MP for the investiture debate despite an arrest warrant still being active for him in Spain. The Supreme Court has said that the national government's recent amnesty law for those involved in the illegal Catalan independence process does not apply to charges against Puigdemont for embezzlement.\n\nHow Puigdemont was going to manage to attend the investiture debate on Thursday without being arrested was the main topic of conversation nationally this week. If police had tried to hold him inside the regional parliament in Barcelona, the speaker of the parliament, who is from the same party as Puigdemont, had promised to suspend the investiture debate.\n\nIn the end, Puigdemont opted for a high-profile speech outside while police stood by before disappearing again.

Other Catalan separatist parties and civil society groups said they would also attend.\n\nBut television talk show hosts and radio pundits have spent the last few days speculating about the 61-year-old's return, suggesting he could wear a disguise or use a hot air balloon to land on the building's roof.\n\nFar-right Vox was set to hold a counter-protest outside the parliament. Its secretary general, Ignacio Garriga, said on X that \"we will not tolerate the humiliation of seeing a criminal and fugitive from justice enter parliament\".\n\nThe route connecting the parliament building to the city's zoo has also been shut and guarded to prevent access\n\nThe vote to invest Socialist Salvador Illa, who will be backed by the left-wing separatist ERC party after a bilateral deal last week, is slated to kick off at 10 a.m.\n\nMr Puigdemont decided against taking part in the European elections in June so that he could stand for the Catalan presidency.\n\nThe vote to invest Socialist Salvador Illa, who will be backed by the left-wing separatist ERC party after a bilateral deal last week, is slated to kick off at 10 a.m.\n\nHowever, he came second to Socialist candidate Salvador Illa, who has made a deal to form a minority government. The vote to invest Illa who will be backed by the Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) is slated to start at 10am.\n\nHe believes his presence in the city could encourage elected members to ditch the deal.\n\nERC, the moderate socialist party currently governing the region, said Mr Puigdemont's return would be an 'exceptional moment'.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

It still must be approved by Spain's national parliament.\n\nA similar system already exists in Spain's northern Basque Country, which also has an active independence movement.\n\nIf Illa passes Thursday's investiture vote, he will be the first head of Catalonia's regional government who does not come from the separatist camp since 2010.\n\nThe former health minister has defended the tax agreement made with the ERC, saying they are \"in favour of all Catalans\".\n\n\"They are agreements to improve our financing without harming anyone and maintaining criteria of solidarity,\" he said after securing the ERC's support.\n\nBut former Socialist deputy prime minister Alfonso Guerra has warned the tax agreement opens \"a path towards a federal system and the independence of Catalonia\".\n\nbur-mdm/ds/ach\n\nMore from this section\n\nGoogle illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules\n\nAttorney Jenna Sutter Joins All Injuries Law Firm\n\nSecured

Maybe he'll try to get smuggled in like Cleopatra in a carpet.'\n\nCarles Puigdemont plans to sneak back into Spain -- and into the Catalan parliament -- even though he risks almost certain arrest.\n\nIn an audacious move, Puigdemont wants to make the journey from the French border to Barcelona by Thursday in a last-ditch attempt to remain leader of the Catalan separatist movement. His problem: If he's spotted by the police, he'll be detained immediately.\n\n\"Puigdemont can't just sneak in through a backdoor or through the kitchen ... Maybe he'll try to get smuggled in like Cleopatra in a carpet: With him, anything is possible,\" said an official from the outgoing Catalan government who was granted anonymity in order to discuss the sensitive matter.\n\nPuigdemont hasn't set foot on Spanish soil since 2017 after being found guilty of helping orchestrate an illegal independence referendum. Back then, he evaded the Spanish authorities by sneaking across the border and fleeing to self-declared exile in Belgium. Now he's trying to pull the same stunt in reverse.\n\nIt's hard to see how he can achieve his goal.\n\nWhile Spain's border with France is open and cars crossing from one country to another are not subject to controls, Puigdemont will still have to cross the 170 kilometers that separate the French border and the Catalan parliament. Officials from Catalonia's autonomous police force -- the Mossos d'Esquadra -- told Spanish media they had been in contact with members of Puigdemont's entourage and attempted to hammer out a negotiated surrender, but that the separatist politician rejected that option outright.\n\n\"We're talking about a secure installation, with police guards and security checkpoints,\" said the same official.\n\nPuigdemont's team told POLITICO that he is intent on making what could be his last stand in the parliament, a former arsenal and royal palace. Outside of his entourage, few think he'll be able to pull it off.\n\nLast May, he was lead candidate of the separatist Junts party in a regional election, hoping to stage a triumphant return by being elected president for a second time. But Socialist Salvador Illa, Spain's health minister during the Covid pandemic, scored the most votes.\n\nAlthough Illa fell short of a governing majority, last week he secured the support of the Republican Left of Catalonia, a pro-independence party that was once allied with Puigdemont but which broke ties with him due to his constant attacks on their leaders. In exchange for Republican Left votes, Illa has promised to attempt to revise the region's fiscal relationship with the rest of Spain -- a longstanding demand of the separatist movement.\n\nPuigdemont published a letter this past weekend vowing to be present in the Catalan parliament's hemicycle when the new Illa administration is sworn in this Thursday -- presumably in the hope of shaming his former separatist allies into breaking their agreement with the Socialists.\n\nThe politician accused the Republican Left of selling out the separatist movement, blasting the party for backing a government that \"has no real negotiating capacity to resolve a historical conflict.\"\n\nA disruptive force\n\nPuigdemont and his team appear convinced that if the politician makes it to the hemicycle, Spanish authorities will be unable to arrest him because the Catalan parliament's regulations prohibit the detention of its lawmakers. But legal experts widely agree that an arrest warrant trumps the body's rules, and that the police will not be impeded from taking him into custody.\n\nIf the arrest takes place, Puigdemont may achieve his goal of stopping Illa from taking office -- at least temporarily. The Catalan parliament's president, Josep Rull, belongs to the Junts party and is expected to suspend the session if the detention takes place.\n\nIt's nearly certain that lawmakers would convene again within days, because if a new president is not chosen before August 26, new elections will have to be held. The Republican Left has already said that their agreement to back the Socialist is binding, no matter what happens.\n\nA prison cell would be a big change for Puigdemont, who has been living in Waterloo, a leafy suburb of Brussels, since being granted safe haven in Belgium. The politician even campaigned for a seat in the European Parliament in 2019 and succeeded in getting elected from the site made famous by Napoleon and Wellington.\n\nPuigdemont declined to stand for last June's European Election in order to make a bid for the Catalan presidency, hoping to stage a triumphant return to the region he had fled seven years before. He expected to be able to do so without fear of arrest thanks to the broad amnesty law recently passed by the Spanish parliament, which ends legal action against all those involved in the Catalan independence effort.\n\nBut Spain's judiciary has challenged that legislation, and the arrest warrant issued for Puigdemont remains in effect. That means the separatist politician's latest stunt could end up costing him dearly. Pablo Sim\u00f3n, a political scientist at Madrid's Carlos III University, said that once he is arrested, he's likely to be sent to prison and not let out anytime soon.\n\n\"Judge [Pablo] Llarena -- the magistrate overseeing his cases -- could theoretically agree to a conditional release, but given the flight-risk precedence in this case, I think we can assume that he'll be imprisoned until his case goes to trial,\" Sim\u00f3n said.\n\n\"Since the Supreme Court considers that the crimes of which Puigdemont is accused -- among them, embezzlement -- are not subject to the amnesty law, he could be released ... But he could also be kept there for a while.\"", "source": {"uri": "politico.eu", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aitor_hernandez_morales@politico.eu", "name": "Aitor

"SALVADOR Illa, a former health minister and key ally of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, appears set to be named as the new President of Catalunya this week after members of the left-wing, pro-independence Esquerra Republicana (ERC) voted to endorse their party's pact with Illa's Socialists.\n\nHaving gained the support of the ERC and the far-left Comuns Sumar alliance, Illa will head to the Generalitat this week with 68 supporters, the exact number required to command a majority within the regional chamber and become invested as president.\n\n53.5% of votes cast by the ERC's members were in favour of endorsing a deal brokered between party representatives and Illa's PSC, the Catalan branch of Sanchez's ruling PSOE socialists.\n\nAs part of the pact, MPs from ERC will vote to support Illa's investiture in return for several concessions.\n\nAmong them, the Catalan government will assume 100% responsibility for the collection of taxes within the region, a move described as an 'advance towards fiscal sovereignty'.\n\nREAD MORE: Socialist ally of Pedro Sanchez set to be named as new President of Catalunya after summer of negotiations with separatist parties\n\nThe pact also includes the creation of a National Convention for the Resolution of the Political Conflict, a cross-party committee which will seek to resolve the Catalan independence question, a Department for Catalan Language, a new Airport Authority of Catalunya and the raising of taxes on casinos.\n\nThe move looks likely to put an end to months of uncertainty after an inconclusive regional election in May led to a frantic summer of negotiations.\n\nIlla was one of two candidates - alongside the former president and fugitive from Spanish justice Carles Puigdemont - of the two parties who secured the most seats in the vote.\n\nPuigdemont's separatist Junts party won 35 seats, whilst Illa's PSC Socialists won 42 seats, with both falling well short of the 68 seats required to form a majority.\n\nREAD MORE: Spain's Supreme Court rejects amnesty for Carles Puigdemont: Arrest warrant remains for ex-President of Catalunya\n\nNow Illa appears destined to reach the presidency after striking a deal with the ERC, who became kingmakers after securing 20 seats in the election.\n\nJosep Rull, the speaker of the Catalan parliament who spent three years in prison for his role in the independence movement, will hold talks with parties on Tuesday ahead of an investiture debate which could take place on Thursday.\n\nThere, MPs will vote to approve Illa's programme, which includes a vow to expand Barcelona's El-Prat airport, improve the commuter rail network, invest in new highways and build over 4,000 new homes per year to solve the housing crisis.\n\nHowever, plans to invest Illa as the first pro-unity Catalan president since 2010 could be derailed by the return of Puigdemont from exile.\n\nDuring the election campaign, the provocative Junts leader vowed that he would attend the investiture debate in person, marking his first visit to Spain since he escaped to Belgium in the boot of a car in 2017 after the central government launched criminal charges against him for his role in the illegal referendum and unilateral declaration of independence.\n\nREAD MORE: Thousands take to the streets of Spain's Barcelona: Catalunya separatists rally against

ruled that the crime of misuse of public funds was not included in the amnesty law, a controversial piece of legislation introduced by Sanchez in exchange for separatist support in Congress that promised to grant amnesty to political leaders convicted for their roles in the independence movement, known in Spain as the proces.\n\nTherefore, arrest warrants remain in force for Puigdemont, alongside fellow exiled leaders Lluis Puig and Toni Comin.\n\nSpeculation has arisen that if Puigdemont is arrested on his return, the investiture debate would be suspended.\n\nMarta Rovira, the

He punched the air to cheers on a bright, sunny day.\n\nTens of thousands of Puigdemont's supporters have gathered, some seen readying V for Vendetta-style Puigdemont masks to be worn during the event. The rally was organised by his political party Together for Catalonia (Junts), hours before a new regional government was to take office nearby.\n\nEarlier this week, the separatist leader announced that he would return to Spain and that he intended to attend the plenary session of the Catalan Parliament and prevent the vote on the new government led by socialist Salvador Illa.\n\n\"In normal democratic conditions, for a deputy like me to announce his intention to attend the session would be unnecessary and irrelevant, but ours are not normal democratic conditions,\" said the secessionist leader on the lam since the 2017 referendum.\n\nPuidgemont left Spain mere days after the failed referendum on Catalan independence and has since resided in Belgium while serving as an MEP in the European Parliament.\n\nPuidgemont's homecoming will almost certainly result in his arrest, experts told Euronews.\n\n\"When he enters Spain he will be very simply located and if there really is a will to arrest him, the police will do it\", said C\u00e9sar Alvarado, one of the spokespersons of the Spanish A Police for the 21st Century association.\n\nWhile the regional parliament might have some tools at its disposal to prevent Puidgemont's immediate arrest, this cannot go on indefinitely, Lawyer Antonio G\u00f3mez de Olea told Euronews.\n\n\"In the end, as it is national territory, he will end up being arrested sooner or later, because a parliament does not have the same legal status as an embassy of an EU or third country\", G\u00f3mez de Olea said.\n\nOnce he has been taken to the court, \"a decision will be taken on the release of Puigdemont and it is most likely that his lawyer will invoke the Amnesty Law to defend the freedom of the person under investigation,\" he explained.\n\nIn May, Spain's national parliament approved to a controversial amnesty law for hundreds of Catalan separatists involved in the illegal and unsuccessful 2017 secession bid that might also benefit Puigdemont -- a decision blasted by conservatives and the far right.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Therefore in recent weeks he has been negotiating around the clock with political parties to gain power.\n\nGiven that Illa's party, the PSC, does not fully share a separatist ideology, he and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, (PSOE/S&D), have been forced to make generous concessions to the closest ideological party with whom they can work with: the left-wing separatist Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC).\n\nThe stability of Sanchez's progressive executive and the left-wing platform Sumar, now depends on both the ERC's seven lawmakers in the Spanish Parliament, and the seven of Puigdemont's faction.\n\nThe separatists' very high price\n\nJust as S\u00e1nchez had to a few months ago promise Puigdemont and the ERC an amnesty law, in addition to broader concessions to strengthen Catalan's self-government. Illa has had to also follow the Spanish prime minister, agreeing to what Madrid euphemistically calls financiaci\u00f3n singular, or a special financing model for Catalonia.\n\nThis yet-to-be-finalised concept, however, has come as a bitter pill to swallow for those provinces governed by Partido Popular (PP/EPP). Their regional presidents warned that - if implemented, it will create \"first and second class regions,\" undermining the principles of equity and solidarity among regions.\n\nSpain is highly decentralised, with some experts describing it as quasi-federal, with 17 'Autonomous Communities' having power over providing key public services, including housing, education and health.\n\nTherefore, Spain has two basic models for financing regions.\n\nOne is called the 'common' system, in which covers almost all regions, including the Canary Islands and the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla (in Northern Africa).\n\nThe other is called the \"foral regime\" (regimen foral), which includes the Basque Country and Navarre (north), which have special fiscal privileges for historical reasons.\n\nIn addition to theses transfers from the central government, regions can raise additional money from their own resources, including numerous local taxes, or applying for EU grants.\n\nThe main difference between the two models, is that in the 'common regime' system it is the central administration that collects a large part of the taxes and distributes them among the regions, on the basis of a principle of solidarity between the richer and poorer regions.\n\nBut in the \"foral regime\" (r\u00e9gimen foral), it is the regions that collect the taxes to finance their investments, paying a contribution to the central state.\n\nAlthough the agreement signed 30 July between S\u00e1nchez and the ERC, facilitating Illa's inauguration, includes a significant improvement in transfers from Madrid to Catalonia, including the funding for the regional police and research and development, the separatist party is now demanding much more.\n\nThis \"price to be paid\" by S\u00e1nchez seems likely to be very high, as behind the euphemism of \"singular financing\" hides the demand that Catalonia, a region with 7.6 million people, should keep all the taxes it collects in the future.\n\nIf the proposal goes ahead, many experts warn that it could spell the end of the current financing system, which is based on equity and solidarity between regions, in favour of a variable-geometry or \"multi-speed\" model if the region of Catalonia is able to collect all its taxes in the future.", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"},

Seven years ago they began a harsh repression that has led us to prison and exile, this has affected the lives of thousands and thousands of people, for the fact of being pro-independence, sometimes just for the fact of speaking Catalan, and they have turned the fact of being Catalan into something suspicious,\" Puigdemont denounced.\n\nMuch anticipated by the Spanish and international media, Puigdemont, leader of the right-wing separatist party Together for Catalonia (JxCat), announced a few days ago that he intended to enter the Catalan parliament in Barcelona on Thursday.\n\nThe reason is the inauguration of Salvador Illa, leader of the Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSC), as the new president of the regional executive (Generalitat).\n\n\"Today, many will celebrate my arrest and think that the scorn will deter us, that it is worth breaking even a law passed by your Parliament to make a mockery of me. But they are wrong. And in their mistake they will once again drag down the credibility of Spanish democracy, although we know that this matters very little to them,\" Puigdemont added.\n\nAccording to the JxCat leader, \"it is not, nor was it, nor it will ever be a crime to hold a referendum and obey the mandate of the Parliament of Catalonia,\" he stressed referring to the illegal pro-independence referendum of 1 October 2017.\n\nHowever, according to state broadcaster RTVE, Puigdemont did not enter Catalan Parliament, nor - as of 11.00 am - was there any news that he had been arrested.\n\nCatalan regional police has deployed an extensive operation - Operation Jaula (Cage, in Spanish) - throughout Barcelona in an attempt to arrest the separatist leader, EFE reported.\n\nAlthough Illa won the snap regional elections on 12 May, he did not gather a sufficient majority to govern alone. To win key parliamentary support from the left-wing separatist Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) party, he was forced to make concessions, including more self-governing powers for Catalonia.\n\nDespite the amnesty law promoted by Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez (PSOE/S&D), which pardons crimes committed by separatist activists between 2011 and 2023, the crime of embezzlement - and personal enrichment in Puigdemont's case - is not covered by the amensty.\n\nPuigdemont is still under a Spanish national arrest warrant for that crime.\n\nBoth JxCat and the ERC each have seven lawmakers in the Spanish national parliament, on whose support the S\u00e1nchez coalition government with the left-wing Sumar platform depends.\n\nPuigdemont fled Spain in 2017, going into self-exile initially in Waterloo, near Brussels, until April this year, then he settled in the south of France, from where he crossed the border into Spain.", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com",

Supporters formed a human barrier around him. The politician is subject to an active arrest warrant and police forces are under orders to detain him if they see him.\n\n\"Despite all the efforts to do us harm, I have come here today to remind them that we are still here and that we do not have to give up,\" Puigdemont told the crowd. \"Long live Free Catalonia!\"\n\nThe former Catalan president announced his intention to return to Barcelona on Wednesday, saying he intended to be back in Barcelona for a vote on Socialist Salvador Illa becoming regional president, which would put an end to 14 years of separatist governments.\n\nPuigdemont intends to march to the Catalan parliament accompanied by his supporters. Police forces have sealed off the building and are guarding the entrances.\n\nExpectation was high ahead of Puigdemont's promised appearance. In the hour before the event's scheduled start at 9 a.m., booming music and large screens recounted the past seven years of the Catalan leader's political trials and tribulations.\n\nAttendees chanted \"Puigdemont, our president!\" and \"independence!\" while waiting for his arrival, with some wearing masks depicting the former Catalan president's face.\n\n\"I'm not happy. Because I would have liked to avoid this unpleasant situation of seeing him taken by the police. I'd love to see him make a grand entrance,\" one supporter in the crowd told POLITICO. \"But now I am afraid that it will be a humiliating situation, maybe they will take him to Madrid just like prey in a major hunt.\"\n\nShould Puigdemont be arrested, he will likely be transferred to Madrid to appear before the Supreme Court, when a judge will decide whether to send him to prison until trial, or release him on bail.\n\nPuigdemont hadn't set foot on Spanish soil since 2017 when authorities ordered his arrest for organizing the region's illegal independence referendum.

It still must be approved by Spain's national parliament.\n\nA similar system already exists in Spain's northern Basque Country, which also has an active independence movement.\n\nIf Illa passes Thursday's investiture vote, he will be the first head of Catalonia's regional government who does not come from the separatist camp since 2010.\n\nThe former health minister has defended the tax agreement made with the ERC, saying they are \"in favour of all Catalans\".\n\n\"They are agreements to improve our financing without harming anyone and maintaining criteria of solidarity,\" he said after securing the ERC's support.\n\nBut former Socialist deputy prime minister Alfonso Guerra has warned the tax agreement opens \"a path towards a federal system and the independence of Catalonia\".", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carles_Puigdemont", "type": "person",

He left to avoid prison for spearheading an illegal attempt to create an independent Catalonia.\n\nThe 61-year-old spoke in Catalan to a crowd of supporters under Barcelona's L'Arc de Triomf monument on Thursday and was expected to walk to the nearby Catalan parliament to attend a debate on the selection of a new president for the region.\n\n\"We're still here!

It argued that the unlawful use of public money to organise a referendum constituted a personal benefit for Mr Puigdemont.\n\nThe former regional leader insists the vote was not illegal and therefore the charges linked to it have no basis.\n\n\"A country where amnesty laws do not [mean] amnesty has a democratic problem,\" Mr Puigdemont said in his speech before he left the stage and melted into

Former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has returned to Spain for the first time since fleeing the country about seven years ago, according to a broadcast on the politician's YouTube channel.\n\nThe ex-leader still has an outstanding warrant for his arrest in the region. He appeared in the Catalan capital, Barcelona, where hundreds of the politician's supporters gathered to greet him. Some of those who came brought pictures of Puigdemont and esteladas (the unofficial flag of the Catalan states, which is the symbol of the region's independence supporters). The politician intends to attend a debate in the region's parliament on whether to approve the candidacy of Socialist Salvador Illa to lead the autonomous community. Many speculate that Puigdemont will be be arrested if he shows.\n\nAhead of his return, the former Catalan leader said that his arrest would be illegal.\n\nIn June, Spain enacted an amnesty law for those involved in the Catalan separatist process. However, Spain's Supreme Court did not grant amnesty to Puigdemont and left in force the national warrant for his arrest. The Supreme Court deemed that embezzling public funds, the crime which the politician is accused of, does not fall under amnesty.\n\nThe 61-year-old Puigdemont headed the Catalan government from 2016 to 2017. Under his leadership, the region held a separatist referendum on October 1, 2017, which Madrid initially called illegal. The politician was removed from office by a decision of the Spanish government, which then resorted to the unprecedented measure of partially stripping the region of its right to self-governance.\n\nPuigdemont later fled Spain to Belgium. The Spanish judicial authorities failed to secure his extradition, even though Puigdemont was detained in Germany and Italy. He also won a seat as an MEP in 2019.", "source": {"uri": "tass.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TASS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carles_Puigdemont", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carles Puigdemont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catalan language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Illa", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Salvador Illa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_independence_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catalan independence movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_communities_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Autonomous communities of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amnesty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalitat_de_Catalunya", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generalitat de Catalunya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-governance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-governance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embezzlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Embezzlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of the European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Beach_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Beach Basketball", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791466", "eventUri": "eng-9791466", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 174, "textEnd": 182}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-10-01", "textStart": 1556, "textEnd": 1571}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

He appeared on Thursday on a stage, addressing a welcome rally in Barcelona called by his separatist party.\n\nHis return represents a direct challenge to Spain's judicial authorities and the country's fragile coalition government, as it threatens to renew tensions between Catalan separatists and Madrid.\n\nPuigdemont, 61, had been based primarily in Belgium since the 2017 breakaway referendum. He was a member of the European Parliament from 2019 until last month. He successfully avoided extradition, including after being detained in Italy and in Germany.\n\nBut this week he announced his intention to show up at Catalonia's parliament in Barcelona for the scheduled induction of a political rival as the new regional president.\n\nAt the rally of his supporters Thursday, which began shortly before the parliamentary sessions, some people carried masks of Puigdemont's face.\n\nThe regional police had warned that they intended to obey orders to arrest him. In anticipation, they sealed off most entrances to the park where the parliament building is located, and planned to deploy riot police on Thursday, Spanish media reported.\n\nIn a video released Wednesday, previewing his plan to return, Puigdemont lamented that he \"cannot attend freely\" and complained of \"a long persecution.\"\n\n\"That I can attend the parliament should be normal,\" he said. \"That to do so risks an arrest that would be arbitrary and illegal is evidence of the democratic anomaly that we have the duty to denounce and fight.\"\n\nPuigdemont, a former journalist who was first elected to the Catalan parliament in 2006, has centered his political career on the aspiration for the wealthy northeast region to exert independence from Spain.\n\nHe was the regional president at the time of the 2017 referendum that Spain's Constitutional Court and centralized government in Madrid determined was illegal. Afterward, the Spanish government imposed direct rule and arrested his allies, while Puigdemont escaped.\n\nLast year, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez's Socialist Party struck a contentious deal to remain in power, offering amnesty to those involved in organizing referendums in 2014 and 2017.\n\nBut the legislation has been challenged by the Supreme Court, raising questions about whether the amnesty deal would allow the pardoning of Puigdemont, who is wanted on charges of misuse of public funds.\n\nSome analysts assessed that his return reflected an attempt to restore relevance, which had waned while in exile.\n\nHe campaigned from France for the most recent regional election, in May. But pro-independence parties lost their governing majority.\n\nSalvador Illa, a Socialist, got the nod as the next regional president as a result of a deal brokered with a moderate pro-independence party. He would be the first non-separatist leader of Catalonia in about a decade.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Police also checked vehicles heading on highways to neighbouring France.\n\nThose events triggered a political crisis that unsettled Spain for months.\n\nMr Puigdemont's appearance in Barcelona, Catalonia's capital, and his game of cat-and-mouse with police stole the show on a day when a new government was being sworn in at the regional parliament.\n\nLocal police were deployed in a security ring around a section of the park where Catalonia's parliament building is located behind walls.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Puigdemont, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and tie, walked with supporters to the nearby stage where he gave his speech.\n\nAddressing the crowd in the park and at times pumping his fist, he accused Spanish authorities of \"a crackdown\" on the Catalan separatist movement.\n\n\"For the last seven years we have been persecuted because we wanted to hear the voice of the Catalan people,\" he said. \"They have made being Catalan into something suspicious.\"\n\nHe added: \"All people have the right to self-determination.\"\n\nThe turn of events is likely to bring political recriminations.\n\nAlberto Nunez Feijoo posted on X, formerly Twitter, that Mr Puigdemont's reappearance is an \"unbearable humiliation\" that damages Spain's reputation.\n\nSpain's government encouraged a deal brokered after months of deadlock between Salvador Illa's Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) and the other main Catalan separatist party and left-wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC). That deal had ensured just enough support in Catalonia's parliament for Mr Illa to become the next regional president on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking to Catalan politicians before the vote, Mr Illa called for reconciliation and respect for Spain's controversial amnesty Bill. He vowed to govern for all Catalans after years of bitter divisions between those in favour of independence and those against it.\n\nMr Puigdemont has dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in north-east Spain - a struggle which is decades-old. His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government.\n\nA contentious amnesty Bill, crafted by Spain's Socialist-led coalition government, could potentially clear him and hundreds of other supporters of Catalan independence of any wrongdoing in the 2017 ballot. Spain's central government and the Constitutional Court declared at the time that the referendum was illegal.\n\nBut the Bill, approved by Spain's Parliament earlier this year, is being challenged by the Supreme Court, which argues that the pardon does not apply to embezzlement, unlike other crimes that Mr Puigdemont had previously been charged with.\n\nMr Puigdemont could be placed in pre-trial detention if he is arrested.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They have made being Catalan into something suspicious.\"\n\nWatching police made no attempt to arrest him, perhaps planning to wait until his expected arrival at the nearby regional parliament, presumably to avoid confrontation with the crowd, some of whom clashed with officers.\n\nBut, instead of heading for the building, Mr Puigdemont went into an adjacent marquee after his speech, then dashed out and jumped into a waiting car that sped away, an Associated Press photographer who witnessed his departure, said.\n\nPolice, who had set up a cordon at the nearby regional parliament where Mr Puigdemont had been expected to go afterwards, soon realised he had slipped away.\n\nOfficers started stopping traffic and checking vehicles across the city to search for him, including some of those using highways to head to neighbouring France.\n\nMr Puigdemont faces charges of alleged embezzlement for his part in an attempt to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain in 2017.\n\nAs regional president and leader of the Junts separatist party at the time, he was a key player in an independence referendum that was outlawed by the central government but went ahead anyway.\n\nThose events triggered a political crisis that unsettled Spain for months.\n\nRead more from Sky News:\n\nTeenagers wanted to kill 'many people' at Taylor Swift gig\n\nPolice search sewers for

government was being sworn in at the regional parliament.\n\nSalvador Illa, leader of the Catalan Socialist Party (PSC), was sworn in as president thanks to a government-brokered deal with the other main Catalan separatist party and left-wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC).\n\nSpeaking before the vote, Mr Illa called for reconciliation and vowed to govern for all Catalans after years of bitter divisions between those in favour of independence and those against it.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He is now likely to be detained over an outstanding arrest warrant for alleged embezzlement, which he denies.\n\nOn Wednesday, Puigdemont announced he had started his \"return trip from exile\", saying he remained committed to attending Thursday's session of the regional parliament, which is sitting to swear in the region's new leader following an election in May, in which Puigdemont's Junts party finished second.\n\n\"That in order to do so I would risk an arbitrary and illegal detention is evidence of the democratic anomaly that we have a duty to denounce and fight against,\" he said in a video posted on social media.\n\nHis arrest could delay the swearing-in of a Socialist government in Catalonia and jeopardise the national government\u00b4s fragile alliance with Junts, on which it relies for legislative support.\n\nThe building in central Barcelona housing the regional parliament was fenced off and surrounded by officers of the Catalan police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra.\n\nSeveral police vans were located nearby after radical protest group CDR called on its members to attend the gathering.\n\nAmong the crowd were top officials from Junts, including the regional parliament's speaker, Josep Rull.\n\nRISK OF PRISON\n\n\"It represents the return of a symbol,\" said Xavier Vizcaino, 63, who was wrapped in an independence flag.\n\nGiven the risk of imprisonment, Vizcaino said he was unclear of Puigdemont's intentions but hoped his return would build momentum towards independence.\n\n\"I hope it is a stimulus that helps the movement recover energy and efforts,\" he said. \"I want to believe there is a well structured plan behind his return.\"\n\nFar-right Vox was set to hold a counter-protest outside the parliament. Its secretary general, Ignacio Garriga, said on X that \"we will not tolerate the humiliation of seeing a criminal and fugitive from justice enter parliament\".\n\nThe vote to invest Socialist Salvador Illa, who will be backed by the left-wing separatist ERC party after a bilateral deal last week, was slated to kick off at 10 a.m. (0800 GMT).\n\nThe Socialists hope taking control in Catalonia after a decade of separatist rule will turn the page on the independence drive, which has been losing support in recent years.\n\nThe Spanish parliament passed an amnesty law in May pardoning those involved in the failed 2017 secession bid, but the Supreme Court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and two others who were also charged with embezzlement, ruling that the amnesty law does not apply to them.\n\nPuigdemont insists the referendum was not illegal and so the charges linked to it have no basis.\n\nWearing a T-shirt and waving a flag with Puigdemont's face and the motto 'No surrender', 41-year-old Susana Masnou described his return as an act of \"democratic disobedience\" to make sure the amnesty law applies to him.\n\n\"He is a very brave man, with convictions, putting at risk his life to move the country forward,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "swissinfo.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "SWI swissinfo.ch"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Police also checked vehicles heading on highways to neighbouring France.\n\nMr Puigdemont faces charges of embezzlement for his part in an attempt to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain in 2017. As regional president and separatist party leader at the time, he was a key player in an independence referendum that was outlawed by the central government but went ahead anyway.\n\nThose events triggered a political crisis that unsettled Spain for months.\n\nMr Puigdemont's appearance in Barcelona, Catalonia's capital, and his game of cat-and-mouse with police stole the show on a day when a new government was being sworn in at the regional parliament.\n\nLocal police were deployed in a security ring around a section of the park where Catalonia's parliament building is located behind walls.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Puigdemont, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and tie, walked with supporters to the nearby stage where he gave his speech.\n\nAddressing the crowd in the park and at times pumping his fist, he accused Spanish authorities of \"a crackdown\" on the Catalan separatist movement.\n\n\"For the last seven years we have been persecuted because we wanted to hear the voice of the Catalan people,\" he said. \"They have made being Catalan into something suspicious.\"\n\nHe added: \"All people have the right to self-determination.\"\n\nThe turn of events is likely to bring political recriminations.\n\nThe leader of the Popular Party, the main opposition to Spain's left-of-centre coalition government which has long rebuffed Catalonia's independence movement, condemned Mr Puigdemont's return.\n\nAlberto Nunez Feijoo posted on X, formerly Twitter, that Mr Puigdemont's reappearance is an \"unbearable humiliation\" that damages Spain's reputation.\n\nSpain's government encouraged a deal brokered after months of deadlock between Salvador Illa's Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) and the other main Catalan separatist party and left-wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC). That deal had ensured just enough support in Catalonia's parliament for Mr Illa to become the next regional president on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking to Catalan politicians before the vote, Mr Illa called for reconciliation and respect for Spain's controversial amnesty Bill. He vowed to govern for all Catalans after years of bitter divisions between those in favour of independence and those against it.\n\nMr Puigdemont has dedicated his career to the goal of carving out a new country in north-east Spain - a struggle which is decades-old. His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government.\n\nA contentious amnesty Bill, crafted by Spain's Socialist-led coalition government, could potentially clear him and hundreds of other supporters of Catalan independence of any wrongdoing in the 2017 ballot. Spain's central government and the Constitutional Court declared at the time that the referendum was illegal.\n\nBut the Bill, approved by Spain's Parliament earlier this year, is being challenged by the Supreme Court, which argues that the pardon does not apply to embezzlement, unlike other crimes that Mr Puigdemont had previously been charged with.\n\nMr Puigdemont could be placed in pre-trial detention if he is arrested.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "barry_hatton@irishexaminer.com", "name": "Barry Hatton",

one of their own officers for his alleged involvement in helping Carles Puigdemont, the separatist leader, to escape from Barcelona following his return from a seven-year exile.\n\nThe arrested male is accused of being the owner of a vehicle which investigators believe Puigdemont used to flee the city after making a brief speech in front of thousands of supporters next to the iconic Arc de Triomf.\n\nPuigdemont, the leader of the pro-independence Junts per Catalunya party, has lived in exile ever since he fled Spain in the boot of a car seven years ago after the Spanish government launched criminal charges for his role in the 2017 independence drive.\n\nAs Catalan president, Puigdemont organised a botched independence referendum, which was deemed illegal, and unilaterally declared Catalunya as an independent state, provoking Spain's most significant political crisis since the Franco dictatorship.\n\nREAD MORE: Chaos in Spain's Catalunya: Police hunt exiled former leader Carles Puigdemont after speech near parliament declaring independence referendum legal\n\nThis morning, Puigdemont crossed the Spanish border for the first time since 2017 to coincide with the investiture debate of Salvador Illa, a Socialist ally of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez who appears set to become the region's first pro-unity president in 14 years.\n\nFlanked by members of his Junts party, including the regional parliamentary speaker Josep Rull, Puigdemont gave a brief speech to 2,500 pro-independence supporters outside the parliament building.\n\nVideos emerged on social media of supporters clashing with counter-protesters from far-right Vox and Spanish police who launched tear gas as tensions boiled over.\n\nAfter the speech, Puigdemont quickly disappeared, prompting police to launch 'Operation Cage', an attempt to block all exits out of Barcelona so that police can arrest the former regional president.\n\nAccording to reports, police are searching for the location of a white car, the vehicle owned by the arrested Mossos officer, which they believe Puigdemont used to escape the city and likely head towards the French border.\n\nPuigdemont is currently subject to an arrest warrant regarding the alleged embezzlement of public funds whilst he was regional premier.\n\nA highly controversial amnesty law passed earlier this year by the Socialist-led government of Pedro Sanchez was deemed to not apply to the charge laid against Puigdemont, meaning any return to Spain was fraught with the risk of arrest.\n\nHowever, it appears that Puigdemont has successfully eluded the police, who had vowed to arrest him upon his return.", "source": {"uri": "theolivepress.es", "dataType": "news", "title": "Olive Press News Spain"}, "authors": [{"uri":

A government spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Puigdemont\u00b4s lawyer.\n\nOn Wednesday, Puigdemont had announced he had started his \"return trip from exile\", saying he remained committed to attending Thursday's session of the regional parliament, which is sitting to swear in the region's new leader following an election in May, in which Puigdemont's Junts party finished second.\n\nHis arrest could jeopardise the national government\u00b4s fragile alliance with Junts, on which it relies for legislative support.\n\nIn the morning, a crowd of thousands had gathered near the parliament to welcome him and hear him speak.\n\nSeveral police vans were located nearby after radical protest group CDR called on its members to attend the gathering.\n\n\"It represents the return of a symbol,\" said Xavier Vizcaino, 63, who was wrapped in an independence flag.\n\nGiven the risk of imprisonment, Vizcaino said he was unclear of Puigdemont's intentions but hoped his return would build momentum towards independence.\n\n\"I hope it is a stimulus that helps the movement recover energy and efforts,\" he said. \"I want to believe there is a well structured plan behind his return.\"\n\nThe vote to invest Socialist Illa, who will be backed by the left-wing separatist ERC party after a bilateral deal last week, began an hour later.\n\nThe Socialists hope taking control in Catalonia after a decade of separatist rule will turn the page on the independence drive.\n\nThe Spanish parliament passed an amnesty law in May pardoning those involved in the failed 2017 secession bid, but the Supreme Court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and two others who were also charged with embezzlement, ruling that the amnesty law does not apply to them.\n\nThe embezzlement charges were related to the 2017 independence referendum ruled illegal by the Spanish courts.\n\nPuigdemont insists the vote was not illegal and so the charges linked to it have no basis.\n\nWearing a T-shirt and waving a flag with Puigdemont's face and the motto 'No surrender', 41-year-old Susana Masnou described his return as an act of \"democratic disobedience\" to make sure the amnesty law applies to him.\n\n\"He is a very brave man, with convictions, risk his life to move the country forward,\" she said.\n\n(Reporting by David Latona, Joan Faus, Horaci Garcia,

His hard-line separatist party, Together for Catalonia, played the kingmaker in last year's Spanish election, obtaining in return an amnesty law for alleged crimes linked to the 2017 failed bid for independence. The law, which passed earlier this year, partly paved the way for Mr. Puigdemont's return.\n\nIt is still unclear whether Mr. Puigdemont will be detained and whether the amnesty law, which would potentially affect many separatists, will apply to him. From the start, judges have criticized the amnesty law, saying that it infringes on the separation of powers.\n\nMr. Puigdemont is also still facing trial on accusations of embezzlement, even though judges dropped the terrorism investigation against him.\n\nWhat is for sure, experts say, is that his return is a last-ditch effort to remain relevant in Spain and in Catalonia, where pro-independence support has dwindled and where for the first time in decades separatist parties did not win an outright majority in Parliament in May.\n\nThe Republican Left of Catalonia -- another, more moderate separatist party -- has backed a Socialist leader as the regional government's next president, and experts said Mr. Puigdemont was hoping his return could push the party to pull from the coalition, and potentially have new elections.\n\n\"It's Mr. Puigdemont's last dance,\" said Ignacio Lago, a professor of political science at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona.\n\nBefore his arrival, Mr. Puigdemont, formerly a mayor from the Spanish hinterland, said that he was aware of his likely arrest, but that it was the only solution to what he called a democratic crisis in Spain. During his time in exile, Mr. Puigdemont was summoned by the authorities in several European countries and detained in Italy and Germany.\n\nHe also continued to insist on \"the necessity of independence as the only alternative\" for the \"survival of Catalonia.\"\n\nMr. Puigdemont was the president of the Catalan government when a 2017 referendum in defiance of the Spanish government shook the country, and he issued a sort of unilateral declaration of independence. Amid unrest and police crackdown, two nationalist movements -- Spanish and Catalan -- came at odds, digging a deep fissure within the country.\n\nPro-independence Catalans never saw their dream of living in an independent state come so near. Other Spaniards saw an existential threat to their nationhood, reviving among conservatives the Spanish nationalism that was considered taboo in the aftermath of the Francisco Franco dictatorship, and bolstering right-wing hard-liners.\n\nEven as his 2017 secessionist bid failed, and after years in self-imposed exile in Belgium, Mr. Puigdemont returned to be relevant when the Spanish prime minister sought his support last year and offered the polarizing amnesty law in return.\n\nExperts said the amnesty law made it harder for Mr. Puigdemont to remain abroad.\n\n\"The amnesty law has created the conditions for him to return,\" said Pablo Sim\u00f3n, a political scientist at Carlos III University in Madrid. \"Returning is the only thing he can do in order to continue to play the victim.\"\n\nThe secessionist parties have for years accused judges of being politically motivated, and in a letter he wrote on Saturday, Mr. Puigdemont said that his return would provide more evidence that \"amnesties do not amnesty,\" and that \"there are judges willing to disobey the law.\"\n\nThe grievances of the pro-independence movement are centuries-old and deep rooted. They were bolstered by the victory of independence parties in the region's Parliament and kept alive by a severe clampdown by the Spanish government.\n\nCatalans are evenly divided between pro-and anti-independence feelings, with both sides of the debate ranging from 40 to 50 percent of popular support in recent years. But in since 2017, pro-independence sentiment has declined, partly because of disillusionment with the separatist movements, and because global events, including the pandemic, have given Catalans other things to worry about, and perhaps a reason to stick together.\n\nWitnessing all of this, Mr. Mr. Puigdemont decided to \"press the nuclear button\" by returning to Spain, said Mr. Sim\u00f3n, the political analyst. \"He shot his last bullet.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

REUTERS/Jon Nazca\n\nBy Joan Faus\n\nMADRID (Reuters) - Defying an arrest warrant against him, former Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont appeared in the Spanish city of Barcelona on Thursday after seven years of self-imposed exile, as he sought to reignite a flagging independence movement.\n\nPuigdemont spoke to a crowd of thousands of followers in the Catalan capital, who had gathered near the regional parliament, waving Catalan independence flags and holding up signs showing his face.\n\nThe politician, 61, fled to Belgium seven years ago after a failed secession bid and has been living in exile ever since. He is now likely to be detained over an outstanding arrest warrant for alleged embezzlement, which he denies.\n\nOn Wednesday, Puigdemont announced he had started his \"return trip from exile\", saying he remained committed to attending Thursday's session of the regional parliament, which is sitting to swear in the region's new leader following an election in May, in which Puigdemont's Junts party finished second.\n\n\"That in order to do so I would risk an arbitrary and illegal detention is evidence of the democratic anomaly that we have a duty to denounce and fight against,\" he said in a video posted on social media.\n\nHis arrest could delay the swearing-in of a Socialist government in Catalonia and jeopardise the national government\u00b4s fragile alliance with Junts, on which it relies for legislative support.\n\nThe building in central Barcelona housing the regional parliament was fenced off and surrounded by officers of the Catalan police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra.\n\nSeveral police vans were located nearby after radical protest group CDR called on its members to attend the gathering.\n\nAmong the crowd were top officials from Junts, including the regional parliament's speaker, Josep Rull.\n\nRISK OF PRISON\n\n\"It represents the return of a symbol,\" said Xavier Vizcaino, 63, who was wrapped in an independence flag.\n\nGiven the risk of imprisonment, Vizcaino said he was unclear of Puigdemont's intentions but hoped his return would build momentum towards independence.\n\n\"I hope it is a stimulus that helps the movement recover energy and efforts,\" he said. \"I want to believe there is a well structured plan behind his return.\"\n\nFar-right Vox was set to hold a counter-protest outside the parliament. Its secretary general, Ignacio Garriga, said on X that \"we will not tolerate the humiliation of seeing a criminal and fugitive from justice enter parliament\".\n\nThe vote to invest Socialist Salvador Illa, who will be backed by the left-wing separatist ERC party after a bilateral deal last week, was slated to kick off at 10 a.m. (0800 GMT).\n\nThe Socialists hope taking control in Catalonia after a decade of separatist rule will turn the page on the independence drive, which has been losing support in recent years.\n\nThe Spanish parliament passed an amnesty law in May pardoning those involved in the failed 2017 secession bid, but the Supreme Court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and two others who were also charged with embezzlement, ruling that the amnesty law does not apply to them.\n\nPuigdemont insists the referendum was not illegal and so the charges linked to it have no basis.\n\nWearing a T-shirt and waving a flag with Puigdemont's face and the motto 'No surrender', 41-year-old Susana Masnou described his return as an act of \"democratic disobedience\" to make sure the amnesty law applies to him.\n\n\"He is a very brave man, with convictions, putting at risk his life to move the country forward,\" she said.\n\n(Reporting by David Latona, Joan Faus, Horaci Garcia and Michael Gore; writing by David Latona and Charlie Devereux;

In a statement, the Mossos also confirmed the arrest of one of their agents, suspected of aiding Puigdemont's getaway. ALSO READ: Puigdemont announces 'return journey from exile' for Catalan investiture debate.\n\nThe events on Thursday took place nearly seven years after Puigdemont fled Spain after a failed independence bid, with an outstanding arrest warrant pending against him.\n\nPuigdemont had previously announced his intention to be in Spain on a day that the Catalan Parliament was due to swear in a new president. The 61-year-old initially lived in Belgium after fleeing Spain in 2017, but his latest place of residence wasn't known.\n\nPuigdemont kept his travel plans secret before setting out to Barcelona, stating on Wednesday in a video posted on social media that he was commencing his 'return journey from exile'. Shortly after 9am on Thursday, he gave a speech in front of a large crowd of supporters in central Barcelona under the eyes of police officers, who made no attempt to detain him.\n\nAfter his speech, Puigdemont went into an adjacent marquee tent. There, he hurried out of an exit and reportedly jumped into a waiting white car that sped away. Spanish media has reported that the vehicle was the property of the Mossos agent detained.\n\nIn their statement issued mid-afternoon, the Mossos said that their force 'carried out a special device to guarantee the celebration of the Investiture Plenum in the Parliament of Catalonia ... the main objective of the Mossos d'Esquadra'.\n\nIn relation to Puigdemont's appearance and his expected attempt to enter the Catalan Parliament, the Mossos said:\n\n'Carles Puigdemont made an appearance in the Arc de Triomf area and, through the people gathered there, he accessed the stage where he made a speech. Then, protected by various authorities in the country and surrounded by the crowds, he started the march towards the main access gate to the Parc de la Ciutadella', where the Catalan Parliament is located.\n\n'During this march and taking advantage of the number of people surrounding him, he fled the scene in a vehicle that the police tried to stop but failed to do so,' the statement said.\n\n'It should be noted that the device that had been designed established that the arrest [of Puigdemont] should be made proportionately and at the most appropriate time so as not to generate public disorder,' the Mossos said.\n\nThey concluded their statement denying 'that there was any prior agreement or conversation with Carles Puigdemont's entourage'.\n\n'Since the escape, the police have activated the [manhunt] device in different parts of Catalonia. In relation to this escape, the agents have arrested a police officer who is the owner of the vehicle used.'\n\nOnce Puigdemont vanished, roadside police units checked vehicles across the city of around 1.6 million people in an effort to detain him, bringing traffic to a halt. Police also checked vehicles heading on highways towards France.\n\nPuigdemont faces charges of embezzlement for his part in an attempt to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain in 2017. As regional president and pro-independence party leader at the time, he was a key player in an referendum that was outlawed by the central government but went ahead anyway.\n\nIn his speech in Barcelona on Thursday, Puigdemont shouted 'Long live a free Catalonia!' as he climbed onto the stage to address hundreds gathered near the Catalan Parliament - set to elect a new leader later in the day.", "source": {"uri": "spainenglish.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spain in English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carles_Puigdemont", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carles Puigdemont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossos_d'Esquadra", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mossos d'Esquadra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Catalonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Exile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Government_of_Catalonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of the Government of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_independence_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catalan independence movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_de_la_Ciutadella", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parc de la Ciutadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embezzlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Embezzlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Spain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.spainenglish.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-08-at-16.51.28.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791466", "eventUri": "eng-9791466", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

However, with the session underway, the former president is not in attendance in the chamber.\n\nSpeculation was widespread that the investiture debate would be called off should Puigdemont be arrested, especially as the parliament speaker, Josep Rull, is a close confidant of Carles Puigdemont from the same Junts party, but it has started as scheduled.\n\nSocialist candidate Salvador Illa started the session by outlining his vision for the next term as president of Catalonia.\n\nIf Illa is confirmed as Catalan president, as is expected, it will mark a significant shift in the tide of Catalan politics, as it will be the first time a president in favor of Spanish unity will lead the regional administration since 2010.\n\nAdditionally, Illa's candidacy will be propped up by pro-independence ERC, who have been in power either alone or in coalition with Junts for years.", "source": {"uri": "catalannews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "catalannews.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carles_Puigdemont", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carles Puigdemont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Government_of_Catalonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "President of the Government of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Illa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salvador Illa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Together_for_Catalonia_(2020)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Together for Catalonia (2020)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Catalan_independence_referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2017 Catalan independence referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_independence_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catalan independence movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Catalonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Left_of_Catalonia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Left of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josep_Rull", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josep Rull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Communication", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Communication", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://cdn-acn.watchity.net/acn/images/5eb65c1e-2623-44bf-a38c-e8becf9b7ddf/2a0ca946-e26d-4407-9a75-9ff44ee98d66/2a0ca946-e26d-4407-9a75-9ff44ee98d66_medium.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791466", "eventUri": "eng-9791466", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

"Carles Puigdemont will return to Spain this week after seven years in exile: Former Catalan president could be arrested on arrival - Olive Press News Spain", "body": "CARLES Puigdemont, the former Catalan president, has revealed his intention to return to Spain this week after seven years of self-imposed exile in Belgium.\n\nIn a video posted on X, Puigdemont confirmed he will make the journey to Catalunya to participate in the investiture debate of Salvador Illa, a Socialist ally of Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who is set to be named as the region's first pro-unity president in 14 years.\n\nIlla, a former national health minister, won the most seats in May's regional election, but fell well short of the 68 required to command a majority within the regional chamber, known as the Generalitat.\n\nAfter a frantic summer of negotiations, Illa finally struck a deal with the pro-independence, left wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC), who agreed to support his investiture in exchange for several concessions, including an agreement for Catalunya to assume '100% responsibility' for the collection of taxes within the region, ending what many Catalans view as an unjust fiscal system whereby the region, one of Spain's most affluent, effectively subsidises public services elsewhere.\n\nREAD MORE: Socialist ally of Pedro Sanchez set to be named as new President of Catalunya after summer of negotiations with separatist parties\n\nS\u00e1nchez, who has pursued a more conciliatory approach towards the Catalan question than his predecessors from the conservative Partido Popular (PP), described the deal as 'good news' for Spain and a 'step towards federalisation'.\n\nDuring the election campaign Puigdemont, who leads the separatist Junts per Catalunya party which came second in the regional election, vowed to return to Catalunya to participate in the investiture debate, which takes place this Thursday.\n\nHowever, Puigdemont's return across the border will be fraught with danger as Spanish authorities still hold an arrest warrant for the former MEP after the nation's Supreme Court judged that the controversial amnesty law did not apply to alleged crimes of the misuse of public funds.\n\nThe amnesty law, approved earlier this year, had formed part of an agreement which saw Puigdemont's Junts party prop up Sanchez's government in the national congress in exchange for the quashing of criminal charges against leaders involved in the Catalan separatist movement.\n\nPuigdemont infamously fled Spain hidden in the boot of a car after organising the botched 2017 Catalan independence referendum, which was deemed illegal, and unilaterally declaring Catalunya as an independent state, provoking Spain's most significant political crisis since the Franco dictatorship.\n\nUpon his return, Puigdemont faces the very serious risk of arrest, which would likely itself provoke a new crisis, potentially derailing Illa's investiture, sparking mass protests and causing a fresh headache for S\u00e1nchez.\n\nThe general secretary of Junts, Jordi Turull, has said he will ask the parliamentary speaker, who himself spent three years in prison for his role in the failed independence bid, to suspend the investiture debate if Puigdemont is arrested.\n\nTurull has also suggested that such a move could jeopardise Junts' support for S\u00e1nchez's Socialists in Madrid. \"We will act accordingly\", he warned.\n\nOfficials from the ERC, the party on which Illa's investiture depends, have also hinted that an arrest could force them to reconsider their support given that only 53.5% of the party's rank-and-file members voted to endorse the pact.", "source": {"uri": "theolivepress.es", "dataType": "news", "title": "Olive Press News Spain"}, "authors":

Despite a new amnesty law, he could still face arrest.\n\nCarles Puigdemont, Catalonia's separatist leader-in-exile, returned to Barcelona on Thursday after seven years, defying an arrest warrant issued by the Spanish authorities, and potentially facing arrest.\n\nMr. Puigdemont's return is a turning point in the political journey of a man who has presided over one of Spain's most fraught political issues -- the independence bid of the prosperous northeastern region of Catalonia.\n\nWrapped in red and yellow Catalan flags, pro-independence supporters gathered by Barcelona's Arc de Triomf, a towering brick memorial arch, to welcome him, chanting \"Puigdemont is our president,\" and hoping his comeback would energize a movement whose popularity has been dwindling.\n\n\"I hope with him our strength returns,\" said Francesc Menorca, 64, a Catalonian flag hanging from his backpack.\n\nIn 2017, Mr. Puigdemont drove the independence referendum that provoked Spain's most severe constitutional crisis in decades. His hard-line separatist party, Together for Catalonia, played the kingmaker in last year's Spanish election, obtaining in return an amnesty law for alleged crimes linked to the 2017 failed bid for independence. The law, which passed earlier this year, partly paved the way for Mr. Puigdemont's return.\n\nIt is still unclear whether Mr. Puigdemont will be detained and whether the amnesty law, which would potentially affect many separatists, will apply to him. From the start, judges have criticized the amnesty law, saying that it infringes on the separation of powers.\n\nMr. Puigdemont is also still facing trial on accusations of embezzlement, even though judges dropped the terrorism investigation against him.\n\nWhat is for sure, experts say, is that his return is a last-ditch effort to remain relevant in Spain and in Catalonia, where pro-independence support has dwindled and where for the first time in decades separatist parties did not win an outright majority in Parliament in May.\n\nThe Republican Left of Catalonia -- another, more moderate separatist party -- has backed a Socialist leader as the regional government's next president, and experts said Mr. Puigdemont was hoping his return could push the party to pull from the coalition, and potentially have new elections.\n\n\"It's Mr. Puigdemont's last dance,\" said Ignacio Lago, a professor of political science at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona.", "source": {"uri":

Former Catalan President Carles Puigdemont has announced that he will return to the country despite facing immediate arrest for allegedly \"taking responsibility\" for organizing the illegal independence referendum in 2017.\n\nDespite the passage of a controversial amnesty bill last May, his arrest warrant remains in effect as he prepares to return to cause a political earthquake.\n\nThe separatist leader said the trip home was his last resort to try to avoid what he described as a pro-Spanish regional government in Catalonia, which is due to take office this week. He intends - how - to attend the Catalan parliament when it votes on a new regional president on Thursday (08/08).\n\nA day before the vote, he took to social media to announce his plan, saying of the vote in parliament: \"I have to be there and I want to be there. That's why I started my journey back from exile.\"\n\nEarlier this week he published a three-page letter saying that after seven years in exile in Belgium and France, he would immediately return to his homeland \"to stand in the way of Spanish repression.\"\n\nThe Mossos d'Esquadra - Catalonia's autonomous police force - has taken it upon itself to make sure that doesn't happen.\n\nThe plan to prevent Puigdemont from entering parliament takes into account all criteria. According to Politico, in the neoclassical palace of the Catalan parliament, only one entrance to the garden will be open and only accredited MPs and their staff will be allowed in.\n\nAs part of the security operation, police are also searching room by room in parliament. Catalan police are also conducting searches even in the basement of the nearly 400-year-old Catalan parliament building to ensure that no one is hiding there.\n\nThey also searched the sewers and agents closed the door connecting the parliament to the Barcelona Zoo, which surrounds the building on three sides.\n\nPuigdemont faces immediate arrest if he returns to the country he fled in October 2017. He travelled to Belgium three days after Catalonia's failed declaration of independence to avoid jail. The failed referendum led to days of protests and hundreds of arrests, including of fellow politicians.\n\nThe separatist politician declined to stand in June's European elections, hoping to make a triumphant return to the region he fled seven years ago. But Socialist candidate Salvador Illa won the most votes and last week reached a deal that will allow him to form a minority government.", "source": {"uri": "thevalleypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Valley Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Government_of_Catalonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "President of the Government of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carles_Puigdemont", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carles Puigdemont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Council_of_Catalonia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive Council of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Catalonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amnesty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neoclassical architecture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossos_d'Esquadra", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mossos d'Esquadra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Illa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salvador Illa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona_Zoo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona Zoo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Declaration of independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.in.gr/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/99331759_042617575-1-620x350.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791466", "eventUri": "eng-9791466", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-10-", "textStart": 2009, "textEnd": 2021}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

A hunt paid with public money to please the powers in Madrid. This is not what a democracy does,\" Aleix Sarri, former adviser and Junts' secretary for international affairs, wrote on X.\n\nIn 2021, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez approved pardons for nine separatists imprisoned in 2019 for their part in the Catalonia independence movement, commuting their prison sentences and banning them from public office.\n\nSanchez said the pardons were aimed at trying to heal the rift between Spain and those in autonomous Catalonia who wanted to secede, but the move satisfied no one.\n\nThe conservative People's Party slammed Sanchez for appeasing the Catalan Republican Left Party, accusing him of pardoning those who had mounted an illegal coup who had not asked to be pardoned, were not sorry and had threatened to do it again.\n\nPro-independence politicians were unhappy because pardoning the secessionists, instead of overturning their conviction and declaring an amnesty, meant Puigdemont and several others who fled Spain after warrants were issued for their arrest remained wanted men.\n\nThe row rumbled on, culminating in huge People's Party-organized demonstrations in September and November to try to force Sanchez to resign over an amnesty deal proffered in exchange for the support of Catalan Independence parties after he failed to win a majority in a July 2023 snap general election.", "source": {"uri": "islandpacket.com",

He has now vowed to return to attend a parliamentary session on Thursday.\n\nPolice are searching sewers and closing zoo doors after a Catalonian separatist promised to return from exile.\n\nCarles Puigdemont announced he is heading back to Spain following seven years in exile to attend a parliamentary session on Thursday, where the next leader of Catalonia will be sworn in.\n\nThe 61-year-old would likely be arrested upon returning to Spain over his role in the region's 2017 bid for independence, which saw Spain sack the local government after an \"unconstitutional\" independence referendum was held.\n\nRegional police, the Mossos D'Esquadra said it intended to obey court orders to arrest him and will limit access to the Palace of the Catalan Parliament to ensure he does not attend.\n\nThe force has deployed additional officers and locked down Barcelona's Ciutadella park, where parliament is located.\n\nAll but one entrance to parliament has been closed, including one to the Barcelona Zoo which surrounds the palace, Politico reports.\n\nThe building has also been searched from top to bottom - including its sewers - to ensure security.\n\nA regional police spokesperson told Politico the measures are \"standard security procedures that are carried out before any investiture ceremony\".\n\nRead more:\n\nMan charged with stealing Bluey coins\n\nBlack Panther actress

He took to social media Wednesday to make his plan public, saying of the vote in the parliament: \"I have to be there and I want to be there. That is why I have embarked on the return journey from exile.\"\n\nThe Mossos d'Esquadra -- Catalonia's autonomous police force -- has been tasked with making sure that doesn't happen.\n\nThe neoclassical Palace of the Catalan Parliament is located within the 31-hectare Parc de la Ciutadella. To keep Puigdemont out, only one entrance to the park will be open, and only accredited members of the parliament and their staff will be allowed to enter.\n\nAs part of the security operation, police are also carrying out a room-by-room search of the parliament. Emulating the royal guards who searched the bowels of London's Palace of Westminster to seize Guy Fawkes and the piles of explosives with which he sought to blow up the House of Lords in 1605, Catalan police have been sent into the basement of the nearly 400-year-old Catalan parliament building to ensure no one is hiding down there.\n\nThey have also searched the sewers, and agents have sealed a door that connects the parliament -- a formal arsenal and royal palace -- with the Barcelona Zoo, which surrounds the building on three sides. The closest animal enclosures to the parliament contain impalas, porcupines and -- perhaps fittingly -- hyenas.\n\n\"These are standard security procedures that are carried out before any investiture ceremony,\" a spokesperson for the Mossos d'Esquadra told POLITICO.\n\nBut the spokesperson admitted that if officers were to encounter someone with an outstanding arrest warrant in their name -- as is the case with Puigdemont -- they would \"evidently\" be obliged to take them into custody.\n\n\"Our duty is to enforce the law,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nPuigdemont's planned return after seven years in self-declared exile in Belgium has Spain talking. Pundits on radio and television talk shows have spent the week drawing up fanciful scenarios, with some insisting that the politician will attempt to sneak into the parliament in disguise and others suggesting he could attempt to evade police by landing on the building's roof in a hot air balloon.\n\nPuigdemont famously fled Spain after authorities ordered his detention for organizing an illegal independence referendum in 2017, and despite the passage of a controversial amnesty bill last May, the warrant for his arrest remains active.\n\nThe separatist politician declined to stand in June's European election in order to make a bid for the Catalan presidency, hoping to stage a triumphant return to the region he had fled seven years earlier. But Socialist candidate Salvador Illa scored the most votes and last week struck a deal that will allow him to form a minority government.\n\nPuigdemont's determination to make it to Thursday's investiture session is based on his theory that he'll be able to shame other lawmakers in the parliament into backing out of their deal with Illa. While his arrest would likely delay the vote on the Illa's leadership, enough lawmakers have said that they'll back him anyway.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carles_Puigdemont", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carles Puigdemont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Catalonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossos_d'Esquadra", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mossos d'Esquadra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Government_of_Catalonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of the Government of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_de_la_Ciutadella", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parc de la Ciutadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neoclassical architecture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona_Zoo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona Zoo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impala", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Impala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palace of Westminster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "House of Lords"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guy Fawkes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Illa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salvador Illa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investiture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investiture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Catalan-police-search-sewers-seal-off-Barcelona-Zoo-looking-for.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791466", "eventUri": "eng-9791466", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

His largely uncompromising approach has brought political conflict with other separatist parties as well as with Spain's central government.\n\nA contentious amnesty bill, crafted by Spain's Socialist-led coalition government, could potentially clear Puigdemont and hundreds of other supporters of Catalan independence of any wrongdoing in the illegal 2017 ballot.\n\nBut the bill, approved by Spain's parliament earlier this year, is being challenged by the Supreme Court, leaving uncertainty about what crimes would be pardoned. Puigdemont could be placed in pretrial detention.\n\nPuigdemont's escape from Spain became the stuff of legend among his followers, and a huge source of embarrassment for Spanish law enforcement. He is a celebrated figurehead for many Catalans who want to break away from the rest of Spain.\n\nEarlier this year, Puigdemont denied that he had hidden in a car trunk to avoid detection while slipping across the border after the referendum.

But when we see each other again, we can shout together the cry with which I will now end: Long live free Catalonia,\" Puigdemont stated.\n\nAfter his speech, he was last seen heading through the crowd toward the regional parliament building, but has since \"disappeared\".\n\nMeanwhile, Catalan police on Thursday arrested an officer accused of helping Puigdemont to flee in a car, after he addressed the JxCat rally, Euractiv\u00b4s partner EFE reported.\n\nThe Mossos d'Esquadra has now launched Operation 'Jaula' (Spanish for cage) to track down the separatist former leader, with roadblocks set up around the city.\n\nEmbarrassingly for the Spanish authorities, the separatist leader was able to walk around Barcelona's city center freely like a tourist, despite being under a national arrest warrant.\n\nThough charges of treason and terrorism against him were dropped as part of the highly controversial amnesty deal with the government of Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez (PSOE/S&D) and the left-wing platform Sumar, Puigdemont still faces charges of embezzling public funds and illicit enrichment, relating to the organisation of the illegal independence referendum held on 1 October 2017.\n\nThe Spanish Supreme Court ruled in July that the crime of embezzlement was not covered by the amnesty law, which shields pro-independence leaders from prosecution for their roles in the secession attempt of that year.\n\nHowever Puigdemont's arrest could have threaten the stability of Sanchez's government.\n\nThe stability of the PSOE-Sumar coalition government depends on the support of the seven deputies of JxCat and the seven deputies of the pro-independence left-wing rival, Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), in the national parliament.\n\nA new \"humiliation\" for Spanish democracy\n\nWhile the coalition government or the PSOE did not comment on Puigdemont's return, the leader of Spain's main opposition People's Party (Partido Popular, PP/EPP), Alberto Nu\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, slammed the scenes in Barcelona as an \"unbearable humiliation.\"\n\n\"It is painful to watch this madness live, for which Pedro Sanchez is primarily responsible. It is unforgivable to damage Spain's image like this,\" said Feijoo on X.\n\nThe Secretary General Ingacio Garriga of the far-right VOX party, the third largest force in the Spanish parliament, accused S\u00e1nchez of allowing Spain to be \"humiliated\" by tolerating a \"rally\" by Puigdemont just a few meters from the Catalonian parliament, without having been arrested.\n\n\"We have had to witness an absurdity, a democratic anomaly, to see a criminal, a fugitive from justice, who has been able to hold a rally a few meters from parliament, before the passivity of the Government of the nation, which has shown once again that it drags the pride of a homeland for a personal interest,\" said Garriga.\n\nBut, like Houdini, who was christened Harry 'Handcuff', everything indicated this Thursday afternoon that Puigdemont had managed to \"escape\" from the police, after his fleeting appearance in Barcelona, once again mocking justice.\n\nThis is the second time that the JxCat leader managed to evade police and justice.\n\nOn 30 October 2017, shortly after the secessionist attempt in Catalonia, the separatist leader fled Spain at night, hiding in the boot of a car, thanks to the help of a small group of regional police officers sympathetic to the pro-independence cause.", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"}, "authors": [],

Former President of the fiercely independent Catalonia region in Spain, Carles Puigdemont, has pledged to attend parliament on Thursday - despite a warrant out for his arrest.\n\nLast week, the Catalan separatist MP said he would return from exile and attend the investiture of socialist opponent Salvador Illa, in a defiant stand after seven years evading authorities in Belgium. In response, Spanish police have scoured sewers in Barcelona and locked off all but one of the doors into the Catalan parliament building.\n\nHowever, in a video posted just 24 hours before the major political event, the exiled former President revealed that he was already in Spain and would attend the major political event, regardless of the arrest warrant for his role in Catalonia's illegal 2017 independence referendum. Puigdemont said in a cryptic video posted on Wednesday: \"I have to be there and I want to be there . That is why I have undertaken the return trip from exile.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Mum, 47, dead after twin daughters, 16, run her over with jet ski on dream family France trip\n\nBut the local police, the Mossos D'Esquadra, have pledged to arrest him on site and keep him from entering the parliament building on Thursday, August 8. This has led to a week of feverish speculation in the Spanish media, with people suggesting the 61-year-old could enter the building in disguise, or as Politico reports, using a hot air balloon to land on the roof of the building.\n\nMr Puigdemont is one of just two Catalan separatists still facing the prospect of arrest and imprisonment, after an amnesty law was passed by socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to heal the divisions that led to the 2017 illegal referendum and the riots that followed. However, the former President was found by Spanish judges to still face charges of misusing public funds, a separate crime.\n\nThe Catalan separatist is hoping to disrupt the voting in of Salvador Illa, who beat him in Catalonia's presidential election, but failed to reach a majority. Illa ultimately won enough support in parliament with help from left-wing separatists, much to the anger of Puigdemont's allies.\n\nIn his public statement of intent, the exiled politician said: \"If they arrest me, it won't be the first time. I have been in a German prison and another in Italy, I have been arrested in a Belgian police station and I have been summoned by the French anti-terrorist police. All this, of course, by order of the Spanish judicial apparatus.\"\n\n\"It should be normal for me to be able to attend Parliament. The fact that I am able to do so would risk arrest, which would be arbitrary and illegal, is evidence of the democratic anomaly that we have a duty to denounce and combat, not because we are pro-independence, but because we are democrats,\" he warned in this morning's video.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Puigdemont gave a speech at a separatist rally in central Barcelona before fleeing the scene, prompting police to launch a manhunt for him across the city. (New York Times)\n\nPuigdemont has been in self-imposed exile since 2017, when as Catalonia's regional president he led the charge to hold an illegal independence referendum. The voting ended up taking place amid scenes of violence and chaos, as the national government forcibly tried to prevent it. Madrid then issued a warrant for Puigdemont's arrest, and despite a subsequent general amnesty for crimes related to the referendum -- more on that later -- he still faces charges that the amnesty may not cover.\n\nPuigdemont's dramatic return to Barcelona, then, is surprising -- some might even say courageous. But it is also an act of desperation. Since his departure in 2017, the salience of Catalan independence has receded substantially, with support for secession not as strong in the region anymore. That was on display in the most recent regional elections in May, in which separatist parties failed to win an absolute majority in the Catalan parliament for the first time in decades.\n\nInstead, Salvador Illa, a Socialist allied with Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez, looks set to become the region's next leader with the backing of the Republican Left of Catalonia, or the ERC, a separatist party that is nonetheless more moderate than Puigdemont's Together for Catalonia, or Junts. Puigdemont's dramatic return today amounts to a last-ditch effort to prevent that looming coalition from forming.\n\nThat strategy is unlikely to work, though, largely because the events of the past year have shifted the Catalan nationalist movement even further away from the hard-line separatism that Puigdemont espouses. Last year, Junts played kingmaker in Spain's parliament, supporting Sanchez's reelection bid in exchange for the controversial amnesty mentioned above, which covered hundreds of convicted Catalan activists and politicians involved in the 2017 referendum, as well as other concessions. Though that plan is now in legal limbo, the ERC has also extracted some pro-Catalan policies in its recent deal to support Illa.\n\nPut simply, a reformist approach to addressing regional grievances based on compromise with the national government is now the name of the game for Catalan separatists, to the detriment of Puigdemont.\n\nThat's not to say his hardline separatism no longer has its share of supporters. Today's rally -- and the arrest of a local police officer who allegedly helped him escape from it -- makes that clear. But his political stunt in Barcelona highlights the weakness of his cause compared to seven years ago, rather than his remaining strength.\n\nTunisian President Kais Saied fired PM Ahmed Hachani, who had served in the position for just one year, and appointed the country's social affairs minister as his replacement yesterday.\n\nThe firing is unexpected, but unexpected firings of government officials have become so common under Saied that it is difficult to understand what they actually mean when they happen. As Francisco Serrano wrote in June, the high turnover in Tunisia's government is Saied's way of finding scapegoats for his own lack of solutions for the country's problems, including an economic crisis and worsening drought.\n\nDeforestation of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil slowed by nearly half in the past 12 months compared to the year before, according to government satellite data. That marks the largest reduction since the Brazilian government began using the current method of measurement in 2016.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has made protecting the Amazon a pillar of his presidency, a welcome development after deforestation rates increased nearly 60 percent under his predecessor, former President Jair Bolsonaro. As James Bosworth wrote in 2022, because Brazilian politics determines deforestation rates, it has an enormous impact on climate change globally.\n\nBorder police in Panama said yesterday they had arrested 15 people who were allegedly running an operation smuggling Chinese migrants through the Darien Gap, a dangerous jungle region that straddles the border with Colombia. Read more about how Panama's new president, Jose Raul Mulino, is adopting a hard-line approach to migration in this recent briefing by Cristina Guevara.\n\nPolice fired tear gas at protesters taking part in an anti-government demonstration in central Nairobi today, the latest in a youth-led movement that has gripped Kenya for more than a month. As Sefa Ikpa wrote recently, the protests are reminiscent of those in Nigeria four years ago, raising the question: Could this be the start of an \"African Spring\"?", "source": {"uri":

Nearly seven years after initially fleeing, Puigdemont's reappearance sparked political controversy and intensified the ongoing debate over Catalan independence.\n\nPolice in Barcelona launched a manhunt on Thursday for Carles Puigdemont, the ex-Catalonia leader and celebrated advocate for Catalan independence. Puigdemont, who fled Spain nearly seven years ago following a failed independence bid, made a sudden and sensational return, only to escape right after his speech with alleged assistance from a local officer.\n\nPuigdemont had kept his visit secret until the very last moment, coinciding with the swearing-in of a new Catalan president. He delivered his address in central Barcelona under the watchful eyes of police, who abstained from detaining him. Following his speech, he made a swift getaway to a waiting vehicle, as captured by an Associated Press photographer.\n\nThe Catalan police arrested one of their officers, accused of facilitating Puigdemont's escape. With no further details disclosed, the manhunt was called off three hours later. This episode came against the backdrop of strained relations between Catalonia's police force and Spain's central government, adding another layer to the protracted political turmoil over the region's independence movement.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carles_Puigdemont", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carles Puigdemont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_independence_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catalan independence movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Government_of_Catalonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of the Government of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catalan language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/11_03_2020_13_22_31_2034832.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791466", "eventUri": "eng-9791466", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

After the round of consultations, do you see clearly that Salvador Illa will be president of Catalonia tomorrow?\n\n-- We don't know if it will be this Thursday. We know there is a solid majority of 68 deputies to elect him.\n\n-- I understand you say you don't know if it will be tomorrow because President Carles Puigdemont has announced he will return for the inauguration. You said that if Puigdemont arrived at the parliament, you would not allow him to be arrested, that they would have to arrest you first. Do you stand by that?\n\n-- I reaffirm it. We have many legal arguments, but there's also a political decision that is unyielding. As long as I am president of the parliament, I will do everything I can to prevent a deputy from being arrested while exercising their duties, because the parliament has an immunity that transcends the strictly normative framework. It's a sacred place. In any advanced and democratic country, the seat of parliament is sacred, democratically sacred, and no deputy's rights can be limited in terms of deprivation of liberty. This happened to me in the Spanish Congress of Deputies. I was a deputy for one day, along with Jordi S\u00e1nchez, Jordi Turull, and Oriol Junqueras. I recall a very impactful image: when the inaugural session ended, we were forced to stay in the chamber, and the police, probably armed, entered to remove us. That will never happen in the Parliament of Catalonia.\n\n-- How will you ensure this?\n\n-- We will guarantee it first with a series of solid legal arguments: from what the Statute of Catalonia says to the parliament's own regulations, as well as two protocols we have already approved and are in force, which state that no deputy can be arrested within the parliament. Beyond that, there are more arguments. The process of a parliamentary activity, in this case as solemn and significant as the inauguration of a president, cannot be interfered with in any way. Therefore, from the moment the plenary session is formally convened, which I will sign, until it is concluded, no one can be arrested because it would disrupt the parliamentary activity. But the guarantees I want to present as president of the parliament go beyond that. There are various levels: from the most legally robust to the most politically determined. And here, it is not only about the law but also the political determination. There is a law that supports us, but also the political determination of the parliament's presidency, and this is not a minor element.\n\n-- Has the Catalan Interior Minister contacted you?\n\n-- We have spoken. I have simply upheld what the law and the parliament's protocols state. I have told him what I have already said publicly.\n\n-- And what did he respond?\n\n-- I can't say, I don't think it's appropriate to disclose the conversation.\n\n-- Some media outlets claim that the Spanish police are already inspecting the parliament's sewers. Are you aware of any unusual activity?\n\n-- No, personally, I haven't noticed anything. It's true that for significant events, there is some control. Not to prevent someone from entering through the sewers, but to ensure the parliament's security. I understand that the police's role, in this case, is to guarantee the parliament's integrity and the security of the 135 deputies.\n\n-- What would happen if the police entered the parliament?\n\n-- If that were to happen, I would try to place President Puigdemont in the safest possible location within the parliament, which would be my office. I am very clear about this. The political determination, in this case, exists. I don't believe we need to reach that situation, but for me, it is an absolutely sacred and non-negotiable element.\n\n-- Therefore, do you trust that Puigdemont will be in the parliament tomorrow?\n\n-- It should be normal for him to be there. In a normal democracy, it should be normal. But we have seen that at this moment there is a part of the Spanish state, the judiciary, specifically the top of the judiciary, that is out of control, it is rampaging.\n\n-- If Puigdemont ultimately cannot reach the parliament, should the plenary session be suspended? Your party would ask you to suspend it...\n\n-- If President Puigdemont is arrested, I cannot accept that the plenary session proceeds normally. Therefore, postponing the plenary session would be an ideal and appropriate approach.\n\n-- And would that depend on you or the Permanent Deputation?\n\n-- Initially, it would depend on me. There are precedents of plenary sessions that have been postponed due to absolutely exceptional circumstances. If President Puigdemont is arrested, which means a deputy is arrested while performing his duties, and with such a significant debate, we should postpone the plenary session. My role is to guarantee the rights of all deputies. In this case, it is the right of a deputy who would be deprived of his freedom, but also the right of the candidate for the presidency, Salvador Illa, to face a complete debate in which he can confront his political program with all the leaders elected by the people of Catalonia. Therefore, it is not only the right of Deputy Carles Puigdemont to participate in this debate in person but also the right of candidate Salvador Illa to confront his political program with all the leaders of all political parties.\n\n-- But the Board and the Spokespersons' Committee would also need to agree, right?\n\n-- Initially, it depends on me. Then, of course, I would have to consolidate the decision, negotiate, and agree with the Board. This has already been implemented twice. The plenary session for President Puigdemont's inauguration on January 30, 2018, and the inauguration that did not happen for candidate Jordi S\u00e1nchez were postponed. In those cases, there was a postponement, not a cancellation, because the plenary session had not yet begun.\n\n-- In those two cases, the postponement was indefinite. I understand this time it would not be exactly the same.\n\n-- We need to determine that with the Board and the parliamentary groups. And today [yesterday, for the reader], during this round of consultations, this option has already started to take shape. Therefore, we will have to discuss it extensively. But what would be unacceptable is doing nothing in such a serious situation as the arrest of a deputy. Especially under the specific conditions in which this arrest would occur, with an amnesty law already approved. Moreover, if we were talking about imprisonment, a precautionary measure of deprivation of liberty, we would be talking about an exceptional situation. We would be discussing preventive detention requested by Vox, not the prosecution, with a crime that almost never leads to deprivation of liberty and with an accused returning and entering the Spanish state. Therefore, the risk of flight does not exist. It's worth noting that President Puigdemont has never fled justice. Neither have Minister Com\u00edn nor Minister Puig, as they left before any orders were issued, and when they were, they appeared before European justices. They have always been subject to justice, in this case, European justice, which is infinitely more protective than Spanish justice.\n\n-- So, how long should this suspension of the plenary session last? As long as Puigdemont is detained? And if he is imprisoned?\n\n-- I don't want to speculate. We will have to see under what terms it happens. If it is an arrest and release, if it is an arrest with a precautionary measure of provisional imprisonment...\n\n-- And if Puigdemont were imprisoned, could he continue voting?\n\n-- Yes, we approved a modification of the regulations where there is the figure of delegated voting. Therefore, when it comes to voting, President Puigdemont will still vote. His vote will be recognized and counted. Could there be legal reprisals from some state body regarding the Board? I take that responsibility.", "source": {"uri": "vilaweb.cat", "dataType": "news", "title": "VilaWeb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carles_Puigdemont", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carles Puigdemont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plenary_session", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plenary session"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Illa", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Salvador Illa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Autonomy_of_Catalonia_of_2006", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 2006"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordi_S\u00e1nchez_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordi S\u00e1nchez (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Government_of_Catalonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of the Government of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Deputies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Congress of Deputies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordi_Turull", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordi Turull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriol_Junqueras", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oriol Junqueras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Catalonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Guard_(Spain)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil Guard (Spain)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_(political_party)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vox (political party)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_detention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preventive detention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amnesty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://imatges.vilaweb.cat/nacional/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/josep_rull_010824_031-01123535-1024x682.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791466", "eventUri": "eng-9791466", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-01-30", "textStart": 5698, "textEnd": 5714}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

He is now likely to be detained over an outstanding arrest warrant for alleged embezzlement, which he denies.\n\nOn Wednesday, Puigdemont announced he had started his \"return trip from exile\", saying he remained committed to attending Thursday's session of the regional parliament, which is sitting to swear in the region's new leader following an election in May, in which Puigdemont's Junts party finished second.\n\n\"That in order to do so I would risk an arbitrary and illegal detention is evidence of the democratic anomaly that we have a duty to denounce and fight against,\" he said in a video posted on social media.\n\nHis arrest could delay the swearing-in of a Socialist government in Catalonia and jeopardise the national government\u00b4s fragile alliance with Junts, on which it relies for legislative support.\n\nThe building in central Barcelona housing the regional parliament was fenced off and surrounded by officers of the Catalan police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra.\n\nSeveral police vans were located nearby after radical protest group CDR called on its members to attend the gathering.\n\nAmong the crowd were top officials from Junts, including the regional parliament's speaker, Josep Rull.\n\nRISK OF PRISON\n\n\"It represents the return of a symbol,\" said Xavier Vizcaino, 63, who was wrapped in an independence flag.\n\nGiven the risk of imprisonment, Vizcaino said he was unclear of Puigdemont's intentions but hoped his return would build momentum towards independence.\n\n\"I hope it is a stimulus that helps the movement recover energy and efforts,\" he said. \"I want to believe there is a well structured plan behind his return.\"\n\nFar-right Vox was set to hold a counter-protest outside the parliament. Its secretary general, Ignacio Garriga, said on X that \"we will not tolerate the humiliation of seeing a criminal and fugitive from justice enter parliament\".\n\nThe vote to invest Socialist Salvador Illa, who will be backed by the left-wing separatist ERC party after a bilateral deal last week, was slated to kick off at 10 a.m. (0800 GMT).\n\nThe Socialists hope taking control in Catalonia after a decade of separatist rule will turn the page on the independence drive, which has been losing support in recent years.\n\nThe Spanish parliament passed an amnesty law in May pardoning those involved in the failed 2017 secession bid, but the Supreme Court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and two others who were also charged with embezzlement, ruling that the amnesty law does not apply to them.\n\nPuigdemont insists the referendum was not illegal and so the charges linked to it have no basis.\n\nWearing a T-shirt and waving a flag with Puigdemont's face and the motto 'No surrender', 41-year-old Susana Masnou described his return as an act of \"democratic disobedience\" to make sure the amnesty law applies to him.\n\n\"He is a very brave man, with convictions, putting at risk his life to move the country forward,\" she said.\n\n(Reporting by David Latona, Joan Faus, Horaci Garcia and Michael Gore; writing by David Latona and Charlie Devereux;

He said he does not explain how the escape could have taken place, and reiterated his indignation at the non-arrest.\n\n\"The police are obliged, before following political orders, to follow judicial orders. We are at the service of judges and prosecutors. This is what the Criminal Procedure Act says. Arrest should have been the priority of the Catalan police.\"\n\nThe Spanish government delegated the arrest operation to the regional police force, despite the synergies it may have with the pro-independence movement. The Mossos d'Esquadra operate under the oversight of the Ministry of the Interior -- which in turn is run by a provincial government led by pro-independence party Esquerra.\n\nInma Viudes, a member of this police force, assures that they will ask the minister for explanations and that they themselves are concerned about the image that is being given and the \"mistake\" that thenon-arrest of Puigdemont implies.\n\nAccording to the police union JUPOL, only the political will of the Ministry of the Interior would explain the apparent laziness of the autonomous police force when confronted by the return of Puigdemont -- who may have been escorted by off-duty Mossos officers.\n\n\"If this is so, it would be extremely serious and they would be incurring in several crimes,\" says Rodr\u00edguez.\n\nThe spokeswoman for the Mossos union confirms that several of her colleagues are alleged to have cooperated with Puigdemont to facilitate his escape. One agent has already been arrested, and the organisation expects more agents to be apprehended.\n\nSpain's Unified Police Union has called for an investigation. \"Things have not been done properly here. There has to be at least a political responsibility behind it, a dismissal, something,\" says its spokesman.\n\nHowever, Puigdemont's entourage denies any suggestion that an order was given not to arrest him, given the serious legal implications this would have.\n\nAccording to ElNacional.cat, the fugitive's own lawyer, Jordi Cabr\u00e9, doubts that there have been no attempts to arrest his client.\n\nIndeed, Cabr\u00e9 stated that there have been attempts to arrest Puigdemont, citing \"searches on the roads, pepper spray thrown against the population, or drones\".\n\nIt should be remembered that Puigdemont has returned to Spain to attend the investiture plenary session of Salvador Illa in the Parliament in his capacity as an autonomous deputy, something his lawyer insists is legitimate.\n\n\"The mission was neither to get himself arrested, nor to boycott any investiture session; it was simply to exercise his right as a citizen and as an elected deputy as much as he can, and he still has the right to vote on this investiture,\" says Cabr\u00e9.\n\nBut the reality is that Puigdemont has managed to escape justice once again, dodging the arrest warrant, a fact that Mossos' Viudes regrets.\n\nFor now, the sequence of events remains unexplained. The leading hypothesis is that the police planned to arrest him on his way from the Arc de Triomf to parliament.\n\nAt 8.58am on Thursday, the pro-independence leader got out of a vehicle surrounded by supporters and ran towards the stage set up by Junts, his party, at the Arc de Triomf in Barcelona.\n\nAmong those present were several uniformed and plain clothes agents of the Mossos, as confirmed to Euronews by reliable sources, but for reasons of public order, he was not detained.\n\nThe agents assumed that after his speech, he would go to parliament to attend the investiture session of Salvador Illa, which began at 10:00. He did not do so -- and when he failed to follow the expected route, they lost track of him.\n\nBarcelona is now facing \"Operation Cage\", a protocol designed to ringfence the city and stop Puigdemont leaving. Controls are in place at all main access points, which Viudes says is causing \"inconvenience to citizens, difficulties and long traffic jams on the roads of the Catalan territory\". So far, it is all for nothing.\n\nThe Unified Police Union's Jacobo Rodr\u00edguez has described the operation as \"useless and ineffective as long as his whereabouts are unknown\".\n\nEverything suggests that Puigdemont has fled in the boot of a vehicle, as he did in 2017 after briefly declaring the Catalan Republic and being indicted by the courts.\n\nImages are circulating of a vehicle intercepted by the Mossos showing the spare wheel of the vehicle on the front seat. This wheel would normally have been in the boot, unless the driver needed space to accommodate something -- or someone.\n\nThis is only a hypothesis at the moment, but it is being investigated.\n\n\"It's feasible that it could be in the boot, it could be,\" Rodriguez told Euronews. \"However, normally in an 'Operation Cage', the boot is a part of the vehicle that is always looked at\".\n\nIt seems this fugitive from justice has done it again. For the moment, Puigdemont's whereabouts remain unknown. This is the second time he has flouted Spanish justice and evaded arrest, giving a kick to Spanish democracy, the rule of law and equality among citizens: as the agents consulted by Euronews said, anyone else in his situation would be at the disposal of the courts by now.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Anticipating his return, Spanish law enforcement officers have meticulously combed through Barcelona's sewers and sealed all entrances to the Catalan parliamentary building, except one.\n\nYet, in a formidable twist just one day prior to the significant event, the ousted ex-leader divulged that he was already back in Spain and would attend this significant political gathering regardless of the standing warrant. In a cryptic video uploaded on Wednesday, Puigdemont affirmed: \"I have to be there and I want to be there . That is why I have undertaken the return trip from exile.\"\n\nNonetheless, the regional police force Mossos D'Esquadra has committed to apprehending him upon arrival and preventing his entry into the parliament this Thursday, August 8.

Last year, Puigdemont negotiated a controversial amnesty law with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez. In exchange for supporting S\u00e1nchez's new government, it was promised that all legal actions and penalties against those involved in the illegal referendum for Catalan independence and the subsequent declaration of a new state would be dropped. Puigdemont fled to Belgium in 2017 and aimed to return to Barcelona as a hero and potentially resume his role as President.\n\nHowever, his plans were thwarted twice. In the May Catalonian elections, separatist parties lost their majority. The Catalonian social democrats, led by Salvador Illa, emerged victorious. Today, the Catalonian Parliament is set to approve Illa as the new President, but Puigdemont's return is likely to steal the spotlight and potentially delay the session.\n\nPuigdemont does not return as a free man; his goal is to embarrass Spain and disrupt the formation of the new Catalonian government.\n\nThe Spanish Supreme Court complicated matters by ruling that not all crimes qualify for amnesty. Specifically, the court decided that the misuse of public funds remains punishable, one of the charges Puigdemont faces, which could lead to over ten years in prison. Consequently, the arrest warrant against him remains active.\n\nIn a four-page letter posted on X, Puigdemont described the court's decision as a \"coup.\" Aware that his return might lead to his arrest and imprisonment, he seems prepared for this eventuality.\n\nHis potential arrest could provide a dramatic photo opportunity, thwarting the installation of the new Catalonian government and criticising the Spanish authorities and judiciary.\n\nPuigdemont's return appears to be his last political gambit, aiming to remain relevant and avoid fading into political obscurity. Speculation surrounds his fate, as the court may require him to await trial in prison due to his flight risk -- a politically sensitive decision.\n\nPuigdemont's messages on X were also translated into English, highlighting his strategy to internationalise the Catalonian independence issue, which has been effective in the past. However, the Catalonia he returns to has changed. The left-wing separatists have formed an agreement with the social democrats to allow Illa to become President, in exchange for a new Catalonian funding law. This agreement signifies an end to the unity among separatist parties that previously masked their ideological differences.\n\nThe recent elections revealed a desire among Catalans for a new political direction after years of economic strain and polarisation caused by the independence conflict.\n\nThe public's reaction to this unexpected political drama remains to be seen. Puigdemont has been a polarising figure, oscillating between ridicule and reverence. His return at a time when a new Catalonian government is set to take office is controversial. Journalist Jos\u00e9 Luis Sastre remarked on radio Ser, \"Puigdemont is very concerned with Catalonia, but he prefers the region paralysed without a government.\"\n\nPuigdemont's return is not just a regional issue; it has significant implications for Spanish politics as well. The Supreme Court's decision to deny amnesty for certain crimes undermines the agreement that helped form S\u00e1nchez's coalition government.\n\nJosep Rull, the President of the Catalonian Parliament, stated that if Puigdemont is arrested, it would disrupt the parliamentary session meant to invest Salvador Illa as President of the Generalitat. Puigdemont's potential arrest and the subsequent political upheaval could destabilise both the Catalonian and national governments.\n\nRight-wing parties in Spain have seized on the situation. The Popular Party has criticised S\u00e1nchez's government, suggesting that his investiture was purchased at the cost of Spanish unity.\n\nEsteban Gonzalez Pons, an MEP from the Popular Party, stated that both S\u00e1nchez's and Illa's positions were secured through questionable means.\n\nVox leader Santiago Abascal has been more direct, calling for Puigdemont's imprisonment and organising a counter-protest at the Catalonian Parliament.\n\nThe return of Puigdemont has also raised concerns about potential unrest in Catalonia. The police are on high alert, prepared for possible disturbances if Puigdemont's return leads to mass gatherings at the border or in Barcelona.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by allegations against Puigdemont's chief of staff, who is accused of contacting Russian spies concerning prisoner exchanges.\n\nPrime Minister S\u00e1nchez faces additional pressure from an ongoing investigation involving his wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez. This, combined with the political turmoil Puigdemont's return might cause, places S\u00e1nchez's government in a precarious position.\n\nAs Puigdemont's dramatic return unfolds, it threatens to reignite the Catalonian independence debate and complicate the region's political future. His actions will undoubtedly test the resolve of the Spanish government and judiciary, while also influencing the sentiment of Catalonians and the broader international community.", "source": {"uri":

Thanks to El Nacional, our Catalan sister paper, for supplying this reporting.\n\nPresident Carles Puigdemont has not been arrested. He has fulfilled his duty, he appeared at the Arc de Triomf in Barcelona, he gave a speech in front of some 5000 people, and then he disappeared.\n\nNobody knows how, but he got into a white Honda vehicle and, after making several passes around the Parliament, where he was detected by the Mossos d'Esquadra, he disappeared.\n\nNobody knows how, but the vehicle in which President Puigdemont was travelling has vanished in front of a Mossos d'Esquadra force of more than 300 police officers, with a helicopter and drones activated.\n\nThe Mossos d'Esquadra had sealed off the entrances to the Parc de la Ciutadella, and one could only enter through two doors, which were completely sealed off by the Mossos. The Catalan police had predicted that when Carles Puigdemont wanted to enter the Parliament, with the president of the Parliament, Josep Rull , and the other Junts deputies, he would be intercepted, identified and arrested.\n\nREAD MORE: Police hunt ex-Catalan president Carles Puigdemont after return to Spain\n\nCarles Puigdemont speaks at a rally in Barcelona before disappearing (Image: AP)\n\nThe deputies have entered the Parliament and have been checked one by one to prevent the president from entering. In addition, the vehicles entering the Parliament were inspected and their windows were lowered, but there was no sign of the president. Puigdemont's legal team, led by Gonzalo Boye, has entered the Parliament grounds, in the Parc de la Ciutadella, a fact that has made the Mossos imagine that the arrest would be imminent, but nothing. Everything was prepared, but something, which still no one can explain, has failed. The white vehicle has made another turn and they have lost sight of it.\n\nNerves have taken hold at the Mossos headquarters. The regional and general police commanders, who were in the Coordination Centre (CECOR) and in the same building of the Parliament, have seen that the script was not going as they had thought - that not agreed, Puigdemont's defence did not accept the president's surrender - and other resources have been activated to try to catch him. They knew what car he had used to leave the event and it was decided to activate, first in Barcelona, and then throughout the country, a device reserved for serious crimes, such as shootings or murders, to find him, the so-called Jaula device, road controls at various points to close the perimeter of the city of Barcelona and be able to intercept him; so far, without luck.\n\nPolice block roads around Barcelona (Image: AP)\n\nWith the Jaula in motion, with road controls in progress, with vehicle inspections in various parts of the country looking for a man, the nerves were growing in the top of the Mossos, who had lost the objective and who, even now, do not know where he may be. The Mossos Information Services expected the president to be inside the Parliament building, to appear when it was Junts' turn to respond to Illa, but it was the Vallense spokesman, Albert Batet, who replied to the candidate for president, and that was when it was confirmed that Puigdemont is not inside the Parliament either.\n\nAll the sources consulted by ElNacional.cat, both police and Junts, admit that they have no idea where President Puigdemont is.\n\nHe has escaped from a maximum-scale Mossos operation, with more than 300 police officers , and with controls also from the air, and right now no one knows where he is, or how he got to the Arc de Triomf.\n\nCarles Puigdemont speaks in Barcelona (Image: AP)\n\nThe Junts deputies assure that it is not over and that not everything is yet written about this return and disappearance of President Puigdemont on this hot August 8, 2024. Within the Mossos, however, no one dares, yet, to make assessments. Something has failed and we will have to find out what.", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carles_Puigdemont", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carles Puigdemont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossos_d'Esquadra", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mossos d'Esquadra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_de_la_Ciutadella", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parc de la Ciutadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_de_Triomf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arc de Triomf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catalan language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Together_for_Catalonia_(2020)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Together for Catalonia (2020)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josep_Rull", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josep Rull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palace of Westminster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.thenational.scot/resources/images/18399949/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791466", "eventUri": "eng-9791466", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 105, "textEnd": 113}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

The workers were cleaning up around 1 a.m. June 5 \u2014 not long after country music star Ian Munsick took the stage \u2014 when they spotted a dark metallic disk appear. \u201cOne of our coworkers suddenly said to us, \u2018Hey, what is that over there? It looks like a spaceship,'\u201d the anonymous tipster wrote in their report. \u201cWe all turned to look in the direction he was pointing and sure enough, there was a UFO hovering about a half a mile to a mile north of red rocks,\u201d the poster continued. \u201cA dozen of us saw it. We all kept asking each other, \u2018Are you seeing this too?\u2019 It was a resounding \u2018yes\u2019 from everyone in the group.\u201d The UFO hovered above the treetops near the Golden venue for about 30 seconds before it \u201cdisappeared into thin air,\u201d according to the witness. The craft was disc-shaped with three levels of windows resembling a three-storied office building, the poster wrote. The entire UFO spanned several hundred feet and was illuminated by lights. Even more eerie, the unidentified flying object was totally silent. \u201cWhat\u2019s even crazier is that as soon as we all started noticing it and stopped what we were doing to pay attention to it, the craft tipped at an angle and slowly started moving belly-first to the east. Then it started fading away until it was invisible. It didn\u2019t shoot off into the distance. It simply dissolved into the ether. We all watched it vanish,\u201d the post states. The reason for the sudden departure? \u201cWe all saw it fade into nothing as soon as it knew it was being watched,\u201d the witness speculated. The UFO believer emphatically denied that they and their 11 colleagues might have mistaken the object for a satellite or a drone. And it sure wasn\u2019t Munsick hitting the road for his next tour stop. \u201cThere was no mistaking what this was.\u201d There have been 3320 UFO sightings reported in Colorado this year, earning it a 12th spot ranking for states with the most reports, according to the National UFO Reporting Center.", "summary": "They just wanted to catch some Nep-tunes.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/29/us-news/dozen-spot-ufo-soaring-above-red-rocks-amphitheater/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/GettyImages-1396215006.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/gFOBCrxt-RyIcpnTz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:23:13", "author": "Katherine Donlevy", "authors": ["Katherine Donlevy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.211}

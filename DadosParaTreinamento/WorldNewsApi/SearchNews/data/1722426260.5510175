{"id": 243339602, "title": "\u2018The Bear\u2019: Jeremy Allen White Talks Season 2\u2019s Most Debated Scene", "text": "(Slight spoilers for The Bear Season 3 follow.) Television\u2019s most hotly debated scene last year appeared in the The Bear\u2019s Season 2 finale. In it, chef Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) has a panic attack amidst the opening of his new fine dining restaurant, The Bear. Carm tries to envision happier times with his current fling, Claire (Molly Gordon), but that only makes him spiral harder. And then, poof! All of his nerves go away the second he imagines his co-chef, Sydney (Ayo Edebiri), walking through the restaurant doors on her first day. Fans spent nearly a year trying to figure out what this scene meant. Is Carmy crushing harder on Sydney than he is on Claire? Are they soulmates? Or is Carm\u2019s relationship with Sydney entirely platonic, and that vision represented something else entirely\u2014perhaps Carmy setting his sights on his restaurant\u2019s future? Although fans are all entitled to their own read of the moment, White himself is ready to set the record straight. \u201cSyd and Carm have a really powerful relationship,\u201d White tells The Daily Beast\u2019s Obsessed over Zoom. \u201cWe\u2019re shooting down romance stuff left and right, but this isn\u2019t to say there isn\u2019t a real platonic intimacy to their relationship. They\u2019re incredibly reliant on one another. That\u2019s a beautiful thing, too.\u201d In Season 3, Carmy has a similar moment with Sydney. While facing some intense anxiety during service at the restaurant, Carm tries to calm himself down by envisioning the people he loves most in the world. Again: This doesn\u2019t work. As his hands shake and he loses focus, the only person who can break him out of his own head is Sydney. This time, she literally speaks to him, telling him to get himself back on track. \u201cOftentimes, I feel like Syd\u2019s voice can get through to him because he sees her potential,\u201d White continues. \u201cHe has a lot of respect for her abilities. In a lot of ways, she is so many things that Carmy is not.\u201d Sitting beside White as he explains the characters\u2019 connection is Abby Elliott, who plays Carmy\u2019s sister Natalie, nodding in agreement. \u201c[Sydney] knows how to do that,\u201d Elliott says. \u201cShe knows how to get [Carmy\u2019s] attention. And sometimes that\u2019s yelling at [him] to snap out of it.\u201d Sydney and Carmy\u2019s dynamic also reflects Syd\u2019s authority in the restaurant, Elliott adds. When Carmy isn't in control of his own restaurant, it\u2019s Sydney who takes charge. \u201cOur characters really do listen to her because she is a leader,\u201d Elliott adds. \u201cWe all know that she is integral to The Bear team, and that she really makes us work.\u201d But White says there is something special about Sydney and Carmy\u2019s relationship, some cosmic connection that brings them together time and time again. White mentions the first episode of Season 3\u2014in a flashback, we see Carmy preparing a dish while working at a fine dining establishment before The Bear even existed. After the meal is plated, a server delivers it to Sydney, who is dining at the restaurant. \u201cThere is this connection between these two people that existed before they even met,\u201d White says. \u201cThen, that gets you thinking about, like, what a beautiful thing it is to prepare food for someone. How you\u2019re connected forever, in some way, dining in these restaurants.\u201d", "summary": "<figure><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/240628-peters-the-bear-debated-scene-hero_iw2we9\"/><figcaption>Photo Illustration by Erin O'Flynn/The Daily Beast/FX</figcaption></figure><p>(Slight <strong>spoilers</strong> for <em>The Bear </em>Season 3 follow.)</p><p>Television\u2019s most <a href=\"https://time.com/6289867/the-bear-sydney-carmy-ship/\">hotly debated scene last year</a> appeared in the <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/tag/title/the-bear\"><em>The Bear</em></a>\u2019s<em> </em>Season 2 finale.

Bolt had to work hard to close the gap.\n\nHe eased up only over the last few strides and though it was only a semi-final he will not be happy to have been beaten across the line in a 100m race for the first time in four years.\n\nBolt clocked 9.98 - the second-fastest time of the night - but initially Andrew Fisher of Bahrain was shown as second with Bolt not in the first six.", "eventUri": "eng-3340111", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Breaking: Usain Bolt loses to Gatlin in last 100m race - News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-05", "id": "15604165", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3340111", "time": "21:26:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "id": "233", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "id": "86522", "location": {"label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport", "label": {"eng": "Doping in sport"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302773"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "307762"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313033"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}, "type": "person", "id": "316574"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}, "type": "person", "id": "320483"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "320499"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_race", "label": {"eng": "Relay race"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "332246"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_2012_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_100_metres", "label": {"eng": "Athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 100 metres"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "670875"}], "url": "http://www.nan.ng/news/breaking-usain-bolt-loses-gatlin-last-100m-race/", "timeCrawl": "21:26:00", "image": "http://18694-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/DGfoDg_WsAAX9-S-e1501967208224.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-05T21:26:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.7921568751335144}

It's been a wonderful experience as always.\"\n\nGatlin was afforded the same rough reception as he had in the heats and semi-finals, loud boos and jeering ringing around the same stadium where in 2012 his rivalry with Bolt was presented as \"good against evil\", given the American's doping-tainted past.\n\nBut Gatlin has form as the last man to beat Bolt over 100m -- by a hundredth of a second in Rome in 2013 -- and at the age of 35, can still produce the goods, something he has in the past ironically credited with his four years of forced exile from the track.\n\nUSAIN Bolt may have finished third in his final competitive 100m race, but he also carved out another slice of history.\n\nHis bronze medal, ironically his first ever at a major event, was his 14th medal at a World Championships. This tied him for most ever by a Jamaican athlete, joining Merlene Ottey.\n\nBolt still has the opportunity to claim the record on his own, when he compete in the 4 x 100m relay next week.\n\nUsain Bolt did win his 14th World Championships medal (and 1st bronze), tying fellow Jamaican Merlene Ottey for the most by any athlete. \u1f1ef\u1f1f2 -- Paul Carr (@PCarrESPN)\n\nAugust 5, 2017\n\n'THE CHEAT' CONDEMNDED\n\nJustin Gatlin's shock win in the Men's 100m final silenced the London Stadium, but not social media.

I think if you're a drugs cheat you shouldnt be back in the sport -- Ian Abrahams (Moose) (@BroadcastMoose)\n\nAugust 5, 2017\n\nUntil cheats are ineligible for major championships forever as part of their ban, results like Gatlin's win will keep happening. #IAAFWorlds -- David Culbert (@Culbert_Report)\n\nAugust 5, 2017\n\nGlad to hear the crowd BOOING Gatlin. Well deserved, you should never have been allowed to be compete in the first place. -- John Jackson (@JohnJacksonGB)\n\nAugust 5, 2017\n\nThe London crowd savaged the man who has served two bans for doping violations after his victory. The American was booed during his introduction, and when he was announced as the winner. The crowd even began a chant of 'Bolt' post-race. But Gatlin said he paid little attention to their taunts.\n\n\"The people who love me are here cheering for me, they're at home cheering,\" Gatlin said post-race. \"My countrymen are cheering for me and that's what I've been focusing on.\"\n\nUsain Bolt showed his class in defeat, congratulating Gatlin and reassuring the American amid the crowds jeers.\n\n\"The first thing he said to me was congratulations,\" Gatlin told reporters. \"He said, 'You don't deserve all these boos'.

But it was not quite enough.\n\nTeeth gritted and eyes glued on the big screen of the Trevor Brooking Stand, Bolt streaked through the finish line but any fairytale individual finish to a startling career was dashed by Gatlin and young pretender Coleman.\n\nFor the IAAF, could there have been a worse outcome?\n\nRussia remains banned from international competition over doping and now their prized athlete, destined for some kind of future ambassadorial role within the body, bows out beaten by a two-time, largely unrepentant drugs cheat\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "eventUri": "eng-3340111", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Jeered Gatlin gatecrashes Bolt's 100m farewell party - Times of India", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-05", "id": "15609201", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3340111", "time": "22:28:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "id": "111", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "id": "233", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "id": "86522", "location": {"label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "id": "153454", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport", "label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302606"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport", "label": {"eng": "Doping in sport"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302773"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303026"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadium", "label": {"eng": "Stadium"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303933"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304566"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305673"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "307762"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_of_Athletics_Federations", "label": {"eng": "International Association of Athletics Federations"}, "type": "org", "id": "308138"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athlete", "label": {"eng": "Athlete"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "308238"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310872"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313033"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_governing_body", "label": {"eng": "Sport governing body"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "314936"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "316567"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}, "type": "person", "id": "316574"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}, "type": "person", "id": "320483"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolt_(2008_film)", "label": {"eng": "Bolt (2008 film)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "322557"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Brooking", "label": {"eng": "Trevor Brooking"}, "type": "person", "id": "395169"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1053871"}], "url": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/athletics/jeered-gatlin-gatecrashes-bolts-100m-farewell-party/articleshow/59936570.cms", "timeCrawl": "22:28:00", "image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-59936581/59936581.jpg?61916", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-05T22:28:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.772549033164978}

He was just stunned.\n\nAt the end of a career in which he has dominated his sport for a decade, Bolt was beaten in his final 100-meter race by an American almost five years his senior -- Justin Gatlin.\n\nCalling it quits at the age of 30 and looking for a golden farewell in his last individual race at the world championships, Bolt lost to a man who produced a comeback not only on Saturday but also through a doping-tainted career.\n\nIn a tight finish, Bolt was punished for his slow start and Gatlin fought back to nip everyone at the line in 9.92 seconds. Christian Coleman took silver in 9.94 seconds while Bolt got bronze in 9.95.\n\n\"My start is killing me,\" Bolt said. \"Normally it gets better during the rounds but it didn't come together.\"\n\nGatlin knows what Bolt has meant to the sport, graciously bowing in admiration in front of him -- even after beating him. The two men, never really friends, warmly embraced and spoke.\n\n\"It's just so surreal right now,\" Gatlin said. \"Usain has accomplished so much in our sport and inspired others.\"\n\nWhen his victory sank in, Gatlin let out an almighty roar and then put a finger in front of his mouth for silence as the crowd continued to show him disrespect.\n\nIt was an amazing turnaround for Gatlin, who was the Olympic champion in 2004 before Bolt emerged and won an unprecedented three straight 100-meter titles at the Olympics. Thirteen years later, Gatlin bounced back to win in the Jamaican's last individual race.\n\nIn between, Gatlin's career was stopped twice for doping suspensions. Yet fighting controversy all the way since, he got perhaps his greatest gold at 35.\n\n\"It was almost like 2004 all over again,\" Gatlin said. \"I won by a little margin, and to be able to come across the line is amazing.\"\n\nThe 60,000-sellout crowd at the Olympic Stadium, ready for a party in a race they were convinced Bolt would win, had to acknowledge a champion they relentlessly booed over the opening two days of the championships.\n\nIt turned into awkward scenes with the champion being overlooked for the bronze medalist.\n\n\"It's not about the crowd,\" Gatlin said. \"I tuned it out through the rounds and stayed the course.\"\n\nBolt didn't smile any less afterward.\n\n\"It is just one of those things,\" Bolt said, showing his carefree demeanor even in defeat. \"It has been brilliant.\"\n\nBolt was again slow out of the blocks in the final and came back strong, but he ended up short. When he ran out of steam, Gatlin gathered more.\n\n\"He knows how hard I work,\" Gatlin said. \"Tonight was all about the W (win) and I managed to sneak it.\"\n\nNotre Dame's Molly Huddle takes eighth in 10,000\n\nNotre Dame graduate Molly Huddle, the American record-holder, finished eighth in the women's 10,000 meters in 31:24.78.

Thirteen years later, Gatlin bounced back to win in the Jamaican's last individual race.\n\nIn between, Gatlin's career was stopped twice for doping suspensions.

Bolt closed and closed and no-one was immediately certain who had won but it was the American who crossed the line first. Christian Coleman, also of the US, came second.\n\nComing into the race, one of the pre-Championships favourites was ruled out with injury. Andre de Grasse suffered a hamstring injury in training that meant he was unable to compete.\n\nBut Bolt, who had won gold at every major athletics event since the 2008 Olympics in Beijing (bar 2011 when he false started) was still the hot favourite.\n\nThat was despite struggling in the build-up to the final. In both his heat on Friday and his semi-final earlier on Saturday evening, Bolt was sluggish out the blocks and had to work to get through. In the semi-final he came second, losing by 0.01sec to Christian Coleman.\n\nBolt's 100m gold record\n\n2008 Beijing Olympics\n\n2009 World Championships in Berlin (set with world record 19.58 time)\n\n2012 London Olympics\n\n2013 World Championships in Moscow\n\n2015 World Championship in Beijing\n\n2016 Rio Olympics\n\nThe crowd were left stunned by the result, almost seeming unsure how to react to seeing their hero fail to deliver. Considering no one has ever seen it before, it was understandable.\n\nWhat they did do was boo Gatlin, who has a history of doping.\n\nThere is still a chance however that Bolt can leave London and the track in glory - and able to pull his trademark 'Lightning Bolt' pose one last time.

Reuters\n\nBolt suffered a dreadful start and could only claim bronze in 9.95sec.\n\n\"I'm sorry I couldn't end it on a winning note, but I want to thank you for your support,\" said Bolt, who embraced Gatlin after they streaked through the line with no clear victor immediately apparent.\n\n\"It's been a wonderful experience as always.\"\n\nGatlin was afforded the same rough reception as he had in the heats and semi-finals, loud boos and jeering ringing around the same stadium where in 2012 his rivalry with Bolt was presented as 'good against evil', given the American's doping-tainted past.\n\nThat continued unabated after it became clear Gatlin, a sprinter whose past divides track and field, had gatecrashed Bolt's party.\n\nBut Gatlin has form as the last man to beat Bolt over 100m - by a hundredth of a second in Rome in 2013 - and at the age of 35, can still produce the goods, something he has in the past ironically credited with his four years of forced exile from the track.\n\nThe evening was all supposed to be about the 30-year-old Bolt claiming a remarkable 12th world gold to add to his eight Olympic golds in what has been a glittering career.\n\nAnd what a gaping hole his absence will leave, no matter how brave a face track and field's governing body the IAAF try to put on it.\n\nOf his 19 global golds, 13 have come in individual events and allied with a charismatic personality, it has guaranteed Bolt recognition as one of the world's most successful sportsmen.\n\nKingston in Stratford\n\n\"It feels like most of Kingston is in Stratford tonight,\" the stadium announcer said of the welcome afforded Bolt in the eastern London stadium now home to West Ham United in the English Premier League.\n\nIn temperatures of 19 degrees Celsius (68F), Bolt the showman demonstrated exactly what athletics will miss when he bows out.\n\nThe sell-out 60,000 crowd roared as he entered the stadium to do his final warm-up on the track.\n\nStripped to a vest and tight shorts in the black, green and yellow of Jamaica, chants of \"Usain Bolt\" rang around in a surprisingly tense atmosphere.\n\nGatlin, on the other hand, was emotionless as loud jeers welcomed him.\n\nStarting in lane four, Bolt was incredibly slow to react out of the blocks, the 100 and 200m world record holder behind Coleman in the lane outside from the off.\n\nThe crowd, on their feet, roared, and so Bolt responded as he has so many times before.\n\nAfter 50 metres, he moved into his famed \"drive phase\", head coming slowly up as part of the process that unleashes the full power from his long legs. But it was not quite enough.\n\nTeeth gritted and eyes glued on the big screen of the Trevor Brooking Stand, Bolt streaked through the finish line but any fairytale individual finish to a startling career was dashed by Gatlin and young pretender Coleman.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 06, 2017 03:23 am | Updated Date: Aug 06, 2017 03:24 am\n\nTags :#America#Athletics#Christian coleman#Iaaf world athletics championships 2017#Iaaf world championships 2017#India#Jamaica#Justin gatlin#London#Sports#Theysaidit#United states#Usa#Usain bolt", "eventUri": "eng-3340111", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "IAAF World Athletics Championships 2017: Justin Gatlin spoils Usain Bolt's 100m swansong to claim gold", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-05", "id": "15607422", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-06", "textStart": 3287, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3299, "freq": 2}], "storyUri": "eng-3340111", "time": "22:05:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "id": "111", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "id": "233", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "id": "86522", "location": {"label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "id": "153454", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}, "type": "org", "id": "302588"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport", "label": {"eng": "Doping in sport"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302773"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303026"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadium", "label": {"eng": "Stadium"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303933"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304566"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305673"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "307762"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_of_Athletics_Federations", "label": {"eng": "International Association of Athletics Federations"}, "type": "org", "id": "308138"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athlete", "label": {"eng": "Athlete"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "308238"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310872"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313033"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_governing_body", "label": {"eng": "Sport governing body"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "314936"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "316567"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}, "type": "person", "id": "316574"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}, "type": "person", "id": "320483"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolt_(2008_film)", "label": {"eng": "Bolt (2008 film)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "322557"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Brooking", "label": {"eng": "Trevor Brooking"}, "type": "person", "id": "395169"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1053871"}], "url": "http://www.firstpost.com/sports/iaaf-world-athletics-championships-2017-justin-gatlin-spoils-usain-bolts-100m-swansong-to-claim-gold-in-london-3899039.html", "timeCrawl": "22:05:00", "image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Gatlin-wins-.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-05T22:05:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.7450980544090271}

Gone was the big gear, that top end speed.\n\nWhen he dipped for the line Bolt was chest-level with Coleman, in the lane next to him, but nailing the win outside them both in lane seven was Gatlin, clocking 9.92. Nothing world-beating about that but still good enough on the night, and his fastest of the season too.\n\nColeman won silver in 9.94, Bolt the slimmest of margins behind in 9.95, also his fastest of the season. Just not fast enough.\n\nBolt had, remember, only won this title the last time by .01 ahead of Gatlin, in 2015, and that was the fifth successive global silver medal for the American who won this World title in Helsinki back in 2005 - and kept that title despite failing a doping test a year later, which saw him banned from 2006-2010.\n\nIt was Bolt's last monologue on the global stage and in the mad flashing of cameras and phones it took a while for the result to sink. Gatlin had been sarcastically booed on his entrance into the stadium, the realisation he had won greeted with a stunned silence.\n\nNot without an air of sentimentality about Bolt either, as if we'd just watched Ali miss with his last ever punch, or Pele shoot wide with his last ever score goal chance.\n\nBecause Bolt is unquestionably of that status too, not just because we may never witness his likes again but because of the indelible mark his has left on sprinting and all of sport. Nothing about this result will change that.\n\nHe still retires largely unbeatable, although maybe the warning signs were there. A few weeks shy of 31, just over two hours earlier Bolt had also lost his semi-final, narrowly, to Coleman, the fastest man in the world this year with his 9.82. Bolt didn't necessarily press it on that occasion, but was beaten across the line in a 100m race for the first time in four years.\n\nStill Bolt's race record since his breakthrough year in 2008 now reads 143-8; he's only lost one 200m race in those nine years, that record standing at 49-1.\n\nAiming for his fourth World championship 100m title, he must now be content with three - and six overall in the 100, plus still 11 World Championship gold medals - not to mention his eight Olympic gold medals in there as well.\n\nBolt is back here on Saturday evening with the Jamaican 4x100m relay team for the hip-hip-hooray, but this was his proper swansong, his last individual race before retiring. Gatlin had spoiled the party and although Bolt was gracious in defeat, praising the London crowd, no one expected him to go out like this. Least of all himself.\n\nBefore, the only person who could beat Bolt on this stage was himself - which is exactly what happened, at the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, when he false-started in the 100m final.\n\nThat had been his sole championship 'defeat' coming in here, and he'd won a sprint triple at every major championship since, including last summer's Rio Olympics.\n\nAlthough there was no doubt he's slowing down. His 9.81 in Rio was the slowest of his Olympic titles, his 9.95 here by far the slowest of all his major finals.\n\nBolt still retires with both his 100m and 200m world records - his 9.58 and 19.19 - fully intact and, for now at least, appearing unbreakable.\n\nIn another lifetime they might talk about Usain Bolt and wonder what it was like to see him run. And what it must have been like to see him lose his last race.

Bolt suffered a dreadful start and could only claim bronze in 9.95sec.\n\n\"I'm sorry I couldn't end it on a winning note, but I want to thank you for your support,\" said Bolt, who embraced Gatlin after they streaked through the line with no clear victor immediately apparent.\n\n\"It's been a wonderful experience as always.\"\n\nGatlin was afforded the same rough reception as he had in the heats and semi-finals, loud boos and jeering ringing around the same stadium where in 2012 his rivalry with Bolt was presented as 'good against evil', given the American's doping-tainted past.\n\nThat continued unabated after it became clear Gatlin, a sprinter whose past divides track and field, had gatecrashed Bolt's party.\n\nBut Gatlin has form as the last man to beat Bolt over 100m -- by a hundredth of a second in Rome in 2013 -- and at the age of 35, can still produce the goods, something he has in the past ironically credited with his four years of forced exile from the track.\n\nThe evening was all supposed to be about the 30-year-old Bolt claiming a remarkable 12th world gold to add to his eight Olympic golds in what has been a glittering career.\n\nAnd what a gaping hole his absence will leave, no matter how brave a face track and field's governing body the IAAF try to put on it.\n\nOf his 19 global golds, 13 have come in individual events and allied with a charismatic personality, it has guaranteed Bolt recognition as one of the world's most successful sportsmen.\n\nKingston in Stratford\n\n\"It feels like most of Kingston is in Stratford tonight,\" the stadium announcer said of the welcome afforded Bolt in the eastern London stadium now home to West Ham United in the English Premier League.\n\nIn temperatures of 19 degrees Celsius (68F), Bolt the showman demonstrated exactly what athletics will miss when he bows out.\n\nThe sell-out 60,000 crowd roared as he entered the stadium to do his final warm-up on the track.\n\nStripped to a vest and tight shorts in the black, green and yellow of Jamaica, chants of \"Usain Bolt\" rang around in a surprisingly tense atmosphere.\n\nGatlin, on the other hand, was emotionless as loud jeers welcomed him.\n\nStarting in lane four, Bolt was incredibly slow to react out of the blocks, the 100 and 200m world record holder behind Coleman in the lane outside from the off.\n\nThe crowd, on their feet, roared, and so Bolt responded as he has so many times before.\n\nAfter 50 metres, he moved into his famed \"drive phase\", head coming slowly up as part of the process that unleashes the full power from his long legs. But it was not quite enough.\n\nTeeth gritted and eyes glued on the big screen of the Trevor Brooking Stand, Bolt streaked through the finish line but any fairytale individual finish to a startling career was dashed by Gatlin and young pretender Coleman.", "eventUri": "eng-3340111", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "World Athletics Championships: Justin Gatlin Rains On Usain Bolt's 100m Parade - NDTV Sports", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-05", "id": "15606234", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3340111", "time": "21:35:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "id": "111", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "id": "233", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "id": "86522", "location": {"label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "id": "153454", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport", "label": {"eng": "Doping in sport"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302773"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303026"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadium", "label": {"eng": "Stadium"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303933"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304566"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305673"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "307762"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_of_Athletics_Federations", "label": {"eng": "International Association of Athletics Federations"}, "type": "org", "id": "308138"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athlete", "label": {"eng": "Athlete"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "308238"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310872"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313033"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_governing_body", "label": {"eng": "Sport governing body"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "314936"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "316567"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}, "type": "person", "id": "316574"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}, "type": "person", "id": "320483"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolt_(2008_film)", "label": {"eng": "Bolt (2008 film)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "322557"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1053871"}], "url": "https://sports.ndtv.com/athletics/world-athletics-championships-justin-gatlin-rains-on-usain-bolts-100m-parade-1734019", "timeCrawl": "21:50:00", "image": "https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2017-08/usain-bolt-bye-bye-afp_806x605_81501968563.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-05T21:35:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.7411764860153198}

He matched the collegiate record for the 60m and just missed out on the 200m mark.\n\nHe also made something of a name for himself when John Ross claimed he was quicker than Usain Bolt after setting a new NFL scouting record for the 40-yard dash. Ross ran 4.22secs. Coleman responded to that by running 4.12.\n\nChristian Coleman made it a USA one-two finishing behind Justin Gatlin in the 100m final\n\nColeman impressed throughout the race but was pipped on the line by his compatriot Gatlin\n\nOn Saturday night, Coleman upstaged the wide receiver for the Cincinnati Bengals again, actually beating Bolt over the longer distance of 100m in a semi-final that somehow felt significant despite his failure to then deny Justin Gatlin a world title that was met with a sense of horror by a stunned London crowd.\n\nIt was not just the manner in which Coleman streaked away from the finest sprinter we have ever seen. Or indeed the way he led Bolt again in the final only to tie up in the closing metres and succumb to a late surge for the line by a twice-convicted drugs cheat.\n\nIt was the way he so confidently glanced back at Bolt when the treble Olympic champion was trying to hide the fact that he was being beaten for the first time in four years by giving him an intimidatory stare.\n\nIt brought gasps of concern from athletics fans so desperate to see Bolt sign off in style but it was not entirely surprising even if it was only last year that Coleman was at the Rio Olympic Games as a junior member of the American relay squad.\n\nAll eyes were on Usain Bolt in his final individual race but he was stunned by his old foe Gatlin\n\nThe 35-year-old Gatlin - in lane eight - tore up Bolt's farewell script with a towering display\n\nBolt could not provide the perfect ending to a perfect career where he won Olympic gold\n\nThe US collegiate record of 9.82secs that 21-year-old Coleman set in June was not only the ninth quickest in history but the fastest in the world this year. And while Coleman is a diminutive figure compared to the towering Jamaican - a whole nine inches shorter - there is no denying this kid might just be the future of world sprinting.\n\nSure, he has not arrived on the international scene in the manner Bolt did at the same tender age back in 2008. Bolt, already a world junior record holder over 200m with a time of 19.93 that he actually ran at 17, set a new world record of 9.72 in New York and then lowered it to 9.69 at the Beijing Olympics the following month.\n\nHe would go faster still in Berlin a year later, and that time of 9.58 is one that will probably remain beyond the reach of Coleman and his contemporaries for a good while yet. 'Forever Faster,' was the slogan on Bolt's tracksuit top on Saturday night and it might just turn out to be true in his case.\n\nIt would be some achievement if anyone manages to secure the second or third fastest times in history, given that they too belong to Bolt (Yohan Blake's 9.69 is joint third).\n\nBut in Coleman the sport at least has another precociously gifted young speed merchant. Second on Saturday night, he looks a sure bet to improve on that in the years to come.\n\nGatlin was quick to console Bolt and congratulate him at the end of his individual career\n\nBolt had still been favourite to secure his 20th global gold but Gatlin had not read the script", "eventUri": "eng-3340111", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Christian Coleman shows future may be in safe hands ", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-05", "id": "15605309", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3340111", "time": "21:39:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "id": "233", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "id": "86522", "location": {"label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "id": "111334", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "id": "218051", "location": {"label": {"eng": "New York"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302553"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport", "label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302606"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304566"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304978"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305661"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics", "label": {"eng": "2008 Summer Olympics"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305770"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "307762"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Summer_Olympics", "label": {"eng": "1996 Summer Olympics"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "309423"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310130"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40-yard_dash", "label": {"eng": "40-yard dash"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "311044"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tennessee", "label": {"eng": "University of Tennessee"}, "type": "org", "id": "312870"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313033"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "316567"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}, "type": "person", "id": "316574"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}, "type": "person", "id": "320483"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracksuit", "label": {"eng": "Tracksuit"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "322339"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolt_(2008_film)", "label": {"eng": "Bolt (2008 film)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "322557"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter)", "label": {"eng": "Michael Johnson (sprinter)"}, "type": "person", "id": "323812"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_metres", "label": {"eng": "60 metres"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "324913"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yohan_Blake", "label": {"eng": "Yohan Blake"}, "type": "person", "id": "343533"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world_junior_records_in_athletics", "label": {"eng": "List of world junior records in athletics"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "411928"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1053871"}], "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/~/article-4764420/index.html", "timeCrawl": "21:39:00", "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/05/22/42FFDC9A00000578-0-image-a-12_1501968317520.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-05T21:39:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.7254902124404907}

He was just stunned.\n\nAt the end of a career in which he has dominated his sport for a decade, Bolt was beaten in his final 100-meter race by an American almost five years his senior -- Justin Gatlin.\n\nCalling it quits at the age of 30 and looking for a golden farewell in his last individual race at the world championships, Bolt lost to a man who produced a comeback not only on Saturday but also through a doping-tainted career.\n\nIn a tight finish, Bolt was punished for his slow start and Gatlin fought back to nip everyone at the line in 9.92 seconds.

Thirteen years later, Gatlin bounced back to win in the Jamaican's last individual race.\n\nIn between, Gatlin's career was stopped twice for doping suspensions.

The two men, never really friends, warmly embraced and spoke.\n\n\"It's just so surreal right now,\" Gatlin said. \"Usain has accomplished so much in our sport and inspired others.\"\n\nWhen his victory sank in, Gatlin let out an almighty roar and then put a finger in front of his mouth for silence as the crowd continued to show him disrespect.\n\nIt was an amazing turnaround for Gatlin, who was the Olympic champion in 2004 before Bolt emerged and won an unprecedented three straight 100-meter titles at the Olympics.\n\nThirteen years later, Gatlin bounced back to win in the Jamaican's last individual race.In between, Gatlin's career was stopped twice for doping suspensions. Yet fighting controversy all the way since, he got perhaps his greatest gold at 35.\n\n\"It was almost like 2004 all over again,\" Gatlin said. \"I won by a little margin, and to be able to come across the line is amazing.\"\n\nThe 60,000-sellout crowd at the Olympic Stadium, ready for a party in a race they were convinced Bolt would win, had to acknowledge a champion they relentlessly booed over the opening two days of the championships.\n\nIt turned into awkward scenes with the champion being overlooked for the bronze medalist.\"It's not about the crowd,\" Gatlin said. \"I tuned it out through the rounds and stayed the course.\"\n\nBolt didn't smile any less afterward.\"It is just one of those things,\" Bolt said, showing his carefree demeanor even in defeat. \"It has been brilliant.\"\n\nBolt was again slow out of the blocks in the final and came back strong, but he ended up short. When he ran out of steam, Gatlin gathered more.\"He knows how hard I work,\" Gatlin said. \"Tonight was all about the W (win) and I managed to sneak it.\"\n\nThe 100 final was overwhelming, and so was the women's 10,000 as Almaz Ayana tries to turn massive victories into a tradition.After winning the Olympic title in Rio de Janeiro with a runaway world record, the Ethiopian made sure that her margin was even bigger at the worlds - make that three times as big.\n\nAyana won in 30 minutes, 16.32 seconds, 46.37 seconds ahead of Ethiopian teammate Tirunesh Dibaba.

Yet somehow he found the speed and composure to be crowned the best sprinter in the world.\n\nWhen it was confirmed that Gatlin had won gold in 9.92sec - 0.02 clear of his fellow American Christian Coleman, who took silver, and Bolt who claimed bronze a further 0.01sec back, almost all of the 56,000 people in the stadium booed in disgust.

You may not like me, but I'm needed.\" Given his previous doping bans few in the London Stadium were celebrating the rising again of this self-styled Dark Knight.\n\nBolt's reaction, however, showed the class of the man. The first thing he did was hug Gatlin. Then he told the crowd: \"It is one of those things\", before describing their reaction to him as \"wonderful\".\n\n\"I never expected this, as always,\" he told them. \"London, I really appreciate the support you gave me.\" Despite the defeat he also did his traditional lap of honour, posing for selfies as if he had just claimed his 12th world title and not suffered one of the most painful defeats of his career.\n\nTwo years ago, at the world championships in Beijing, Bolt and Gatlin had gone head to head in an epic showdown. With 20m to go the two men were locked together in a desperate tango, stretching and straining for the line. But then Gatlin over-reached, stumbled and, in a flash of 50,000 camera-phones and a whoosh of cheers, Bolt had him - just.\n\nThis time Gatlin kept his composure. Coleman made a superb start and was leading after 70 metres. But feeling the heat of Bolt closing in on him, he started to tie up. That gave Gatlin his chance - and in the very last strides he came through to take gold.\n\nBefore the start the sprinters came onto the track one by one. Britain's Reece Prescod, who finished seventh in 10.17, was first. Gatlin, forever the pantomime villain, was booed. For Bolt, meanwhile, there was nothing but love.\n\nAs each of the eight finalists were introduced to the sound of a thumping heartbeat, Bolt smiled and put his fingers to his lips. Coleman puffed out his cheeks, trying to blow out the tension. Gatlin, meanwhile was stoic and focused in the face of yet more booing.\n\nAs the sprinters set into their blocks the chants began to grow \"Usain Bolt! Usain Bolt!\" It was reminiscent of the crowd in Zaire chanting \"Ali Bombaye!\" before his bout with George Foreman in 1974. And, once again, the underdog applied a knockout blow.\n\nNo wonder the crowd were stunned. After all, Bolt's record since he blitzed and charmed his way into the public's consciousness at the Beijing Olympics, when he obliterated the 100m and 200m world records, has been staggering.\n\nBefore Saturday's semi-finals and finals he had run 142 races since the start of 2008 - and won all but seven of them. Yet throughout 2017 there had been the nagging feeling that he was uniquely vulnerable. He had missed three weeks of the season after his close friend Germaine Mason was killed in a road accident. His back had troubled him. His 100m times were no longer immortal. The door was open for someone to take him. The question was, could anyone step up?\n\nThat was answered in the semi-finals as Coleman surged out of his blocks and held his form and his nerve to win in 9.97 sec, with Bolt, who again made a wretched start, 0.01 sec back. It was Bolt's first defeat for over four years since losing to Gatlin in Rome in June 2013. And with no other athlete breaking 10 seconds, the final looked set to be an immediate rematch between the pair.\n\noleman looked the man in form, having run 9.82sec in Eugene in June. He had also just become only the second person in history to complete the double-double of NCAA titles - 60 and 200m indoor and 100m and 200m outdoors. The first man to do it, however - Gatlin himself - had other ideas.\n\nAlso in the lineup was Prescod, who had travelled by stealth into these championships before deservedly earning a place in the final. Before 2017 the 21-year-old from Walthamstow had run only three senior 100m races due to growing pains and a focus on the 200m.\n\nIncredibly Prescod only turned professional at the end of 2015 when offered a two-year Nike sponsorship. Before then he worked late shifts in a golf club bar before arising early for training.\n\nHe had given a hint of his potential when he ran 10.04sec at an English inter-county meet in Bedford, the same day the British team flew to Brazil for the Rio Olympics, and had been referred to as \"the British Bolt\". Now he was up against his hero. It wasn't to be his night. But with Bolt soon retiring into the good night, Prescod is one to watch in the future. - theguardian.com", "eventUri": "eng-3340111", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Justin

Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach /Reuters\n\nUsain Bolt booked his place in the World Championships 100 metres final on Saturday but he was given a double scare by American Christian Coleman, who beat him in their semi, and the stadium scoreboard, which initially left him off the results.\n\nThe Jamaican, seeking his fourth gold in the event before retiring next week after the sprint relay, had a better start than in the heats but it was made to look awful by the explosion of Coleman.\n\nThe American, fastest man in the world this year with 9.92 seconds, poured on the pressure and crossed first in 9.97.

How do you replace him - as a sports star and a human being? Usain Bolt treats you the same whether you are a dignitary or the poorest man in the world. That's a unique skill.\"\n\nThere is so much more sport will miss about Bolt than his record-breaking speed.\n\nIndeed it is now eight years since he set his jaw-dropping world record of 9.58 seconds in Berlin.\n\nBolt may have been the ultimate big-stage performer, delivering year after year, defying doubters again and again, but he has also provided bags of sporting theatre.\n\nSprinters of the past used to prowl around the start line, sporting their best menacing looks, before a race. Bolt has made them all look just a little bit foolish.\n\nIt has always been about so much more than the race with Bolt. It is the whole show.

Normally, I would get it through the rounds and get better through the rounds, but it didn't come together, and that's what killed me.\n\n\"I knew if it didn't come together (I would struggle), but I felt that it was there so the fact I didn't get it, that's the reason I lost, but it's one of those things.\n\n\"It was rough. Up and down and a little bit stressed but I came out here, and take it as any other championship, and that's why I came out here and did my best. You can't complain about what you get. For me I just did my best.\"\n\nThe result was not immediately clear, with the crowd waiting to see the scoreboard, but when it showed the result it left the London Stadium in stunned silence before they began to chant Bolt's name as Gatlin celebrated and was in tears on the track.\n\nBolt added: \"He is a great competitor. I've always said that about Justin Gatlin. You have to be at your best and I wasn't and that's what I respect about him because he competes and I really appreciate competing with him.\n\n\"He's an excellent person, as far as I'm concerned. He's good at it and just a good person.\"\n\nGatlin's celebrations were a sideshow as Bolt still took the plaudits and did a lap of honour, still playing to the crowd when the stadium was emptying.\n\nThe American was the pantomime villain throughout the competition, having previously been banned for doping violations in 2001 and 2006.\n\nBut the 2004 100m Olympic champion insisted he blocked out the jeers and thanked Bolt.\n\n\"The crowd, I tuned out through the rounds. I stayed the course, I kept my energy through the semi and did what I had to do,\" Gatlin told BBC Two.\n\n\"The people who love me are here cheering for me, they're at home cheering, my countrymen are cheering for me and that's what I've been focusing on.\n\n\"It's just a surreal moment. I thought about the things I would do if I did win -- I did none of that. It was 2004 all over again. I won by a little margin so to be able to come across the line and have that excitement... It's still an amazing night.\n\n\"It's Usain Bolt's last race. To be able to run against him through the years is just amazing.\n\n\"We're rivals on the track but in the warm-up area we're joking and the first thing he said to me was, 'Congratulations'.

He was stunned by an emotional Justin Gatlin of USA and Christian Coleman of USA who took home the gold and silver medals respectively with times of 9.92 and 9.94 seconds. Bolt was eyeing a fourth gold medal at the World Athletics Championship. However he will look to finish on a high next week with the sprint relay team event.\n\n\"It wasn't a perfect race. My start let me down ... it's just one of those things & it happens. It was brilliant, a great career,\" said Bolt in an interaction with French TV after the race.\n\nIn the semifinals earlier, Bolt only qualified for the finals after finishing second in Heat 3 with a time of 9.98 qualified. He finished only 0.01 seconds slower than Coleman in the third heat. In the end, Coleman's time of 9.97 seconds was the best of the semifinals with Bolt finishing second. Other key contenders for the medals were Yohan Blake (10.04 seconds), Gatlin (10.09 seconds). Gatlin matched Coleman's 9.92 seconds which was the season's best coming into the Championship. On the same day, Bolt had been beaten twice and it was only the first time in four years that Bolt had been beaten in 100 metres.\n\nMEN'S 100m FINAL\n\n\u1f947JUSTIN GATLIN\u1f1fa\u1f1f8 9.92\n\n\u1f948CHRISTIAN COLEMAN\u1f1fa\u1f1f8 9.94\n\n\u1f949USAIN BOLT\u1f1ef\u1f1f2 9.95#London2017 #IAAFWorldChamps #IAAFWorldChampionships pic.twitter.com/LG8783tSTY\n\n-- \u2605Sports4Life\u2605 (@Sports4Life007) August 5, 2017\n\nNew British champion Reece Prescod had given the 56,000 crowd a reason to cheer when he blitzed in the last 20 metres to seize automatic qualification for his first major final.

Bolt, 30, will bring down the curtain on his glittering career at the end of this season, leaving a gaping hole at the heart of track and field built as much around his charismatic personality as his accolades. And his trophy haul is nothing short of miraculous: 11 world and eight Olympic gold medals, 13 of which have come in individual events. Apart from a false start in the 100m at the Daegu world championships in 2011, Bolt has made the blue riband event his own since winning at the Beijing Olympics in 2008.\n\nHis world-record setting victory at the Berlin champs a year later was the first of three world wins along with Moscow 2013 and Beijing 2015, peppered by Olympic golds in London 2012 and Rio 2016. \"You won't be particularly surprised when I say I'm sad he's going,\" IAAF president Sebastian Coe said this week. \"I'm an athletics fan, I take my federation hat off, the guy has been a sensation.\" Bolt was made to work in Friday's first round, blaming the \"worst ever\" starting blocks for a botched opening half before he turned on the afterburners to settle everyone's nerves. \"That was very bad,\" Bolt said. \"I'm not fond of these blocks. \"I have to get this start together because I can't keep doing this. It's shaky.\" Bolt will race in the third and final semi-final, scheduled at 1819 GMT, with the final slated for 2045 GMT.\n\nThe Jamaican will be up against American Christian Coleman, the world's fastest over 100m this year with 9.82sec, in his semifinal. But he avoids Coleman's veteran teammate and his arch-rival Justin Gatlin, who races in the first semi alongside Bolt's compatriot Julian Forte, the sole sprinter to dip under 10sec in qualification with a 9.99. Gatlin was afforded a rough reception on Friday, loud boos and jeering ringing around the same stadium where in 2012, his rivalry with Bolt was presented as 'good against evil', given the American's dopingtainted past. Gatlin, the last man to beat Bolt over 100m-by a hundredth of a second in Rome in 2013 -- said he was focused on himself. \"I'm not worried about the crowds. I just focus on my start and my race,\" said Gatlin, silver medallist behind Bolt at the last two world champs, having also picked up a silver and bronze at the last two Olympics to go with his 2004 gold. In eight individual finals at the past four worlds (as well as in four 4x100m relay finals), Bolt has only suffered one that one hiccup in Daegu and it would be a brave person to bet against the Jamaican adding to his honours. Even Gatlin conceded that \"Bolt looks good\". -- AFP", "eventUri": "eng-3340111", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Bolt targets 12th world title in London 100m - Kuwait Times",

I did what I had to do,\" Gatlin said.\n\n\"The people who love me are here cheering for me and cheering at home.\n\n\"It is Bolt's last race. I have had many victories and many defeats down the years. It is an amazing occasion.\n\n\"We are rivals on the track but in the warm-down area we joke and have a good time.\n\n\"The first thing he did was congratulate me and say that I didn't deserve the boos. He is an inspiration.\"\n\nBolt was disappointed he wasn't able to rectify issues with his start in the final.\n\n\"It's just one of those things,\" he said.\n\n\"My start is killing me. Normally, it gets better during the rounds but it didn't come together.\"\n\nGatlin, who won the 2004 Olympic 100m gold medal and the 2005 world title, was suspended for four years in 2006 for doping, the second time in his career he'd been busted for taking drugs.\n\nMany believe the 35-year-old shouldn't be allowed to be competing but over the past three years he's been Bolt's closest rival.\n\nAt the 2015 world championships in Beijing, he got within .01sec of the Jamaican and was also the silver medallist in Rio last year.\n\nDespite the shock result, Bolt did a victory lap as he savoured the second-last race of his career.\n\nHe will return later in the week in the 4x100m relay, seeking his 20th gold medal.\n\nThe last time Bolt wasn't the owner of a 100m crown in the past decade was at the 2011 world championship in Daegu where he beat himself, false-starting in the final.\n\nThere had been signs all year that the eight-time Olympic champion was struggling.\n\nLeading into London he'd only ran three 100m races and only once went under 10 seconds with a workmanlike 9.95sec in Monaco last month his best result.\n\nBolt had also been forced to visit his doctor in Germany after issues with his troublesome back.\n\nIn his first run at the world championships in the heat, he had trouble in the blocks and produced one of the worst starts of his career before eventually getting going to win in 10.07sec.\n\nThen in the semi-final he was again slow out and couldn't catch Coleman, this time in 9.98sec.\n\nIt was his inability to get a clean getaway, a problem he's had all his career, which came back to bite him in the final.\n\nColeman was clearly infront at the half-way point of the final and with 20 metres to go Bolt, who was on his inside in lane four, started to surge with all eyes on the pair as they charged at the line.\n\nBut it was the man over in lane eight who'd found another gear with Gatlin producing a season's best performance to snatch victory.\n\nThe result is a PR disaster for sport which was already nervous about life without Bolt.\n\nGiven the drug scandals which have engulfed track and field of recent times, including the banning of Russia from competing, having a convicted drug cheat claim the sport's biggest crown is as bad as it gets.", "eventUri": "eng-3340111", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title":

I thought about all my supporters back at the hotel or my countrymen watching at home,\" Gatlin said after the race. \"I didn't do it for me, all the times I've lost to Usain and gotten silver and bronzes, today I just did it for others who really wanted me to go out there and do it.\"\n\nAfter he was shown as the winner on the jumbotron in the stadium, Gatlin fell to his knees in front of Bolt, bowing to him as a sign of respect.\n\n\"I couldn't see anything from lane 8 and I know at the starting line, it was a Usain Bolt show,\" Gatlin said. \"I knew I had some of an advantage because I was in lane 8 but I also had a disadvantage because I couldn't see them, so I just ran for my life.\n\n\"I dreamed about this day.

Our previous story is below.\n\nThe Jamaican-born Bolt does have one more race in him -- next Saturday's men's 4x100m final - but today is the race many fans will be glued to.\n\nThe 11-time world champion , who turns 31 later this month, is widely expected to win. He's not been beaten in the 100-metre at either the Olympics or the world championships since 2008.\n\nBut he will face serious competition, particularly from fellow Jamaican Julian Forte, 24 and Christian Coleman, 21, of the United States.\n\nDuring the semi-final heats Saturday afternoon, Bolt was slow out of the blocks, and though he came back strong, Coleman got the win in 9.97 seconds - just .01 seconds ahead of Bolt.\n\nAt a news conference earlier this week, Bolt was asked about the possibility of rethinking his plans to leave the sport if he loses Saturday's race.\n\nHe replied: \"It's not going to happen, so we won't have that problem. Don't worry.\"\n\nBolt plans to don gold-and-purple shoes for his final championships. The purple is for his school colours back home at William Knibb Memorial High School. The gold, well, the gold is for the medal he's expecting to take home.\n\nOne competitor who won't be there to test Bolt is Canadian superstar sprinter Andre De Grasse, who suffered a hamstring injury last week while training in Jamaica.\n\nThe injury was a huge blow for De Grasse, who won a silver and two bronze medals at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro last year.\n\nAs for what lies ahead for Bolt, the superstar has said he's looking forward to a life of motivational speaking, and maybe trying out for a few action movies.\n\nThere is also the possibility that Puma, which has sponsored Bolt since he was 15, could make him the head of its Caribbean business.\n\nBolt said earlier this week it will hard to leave sprinting behind.\n\n\"It's going to be hard, as track and field has been everything for me since I was 10, and it's been a rush,\" he said, \"but we'll see where life takes me.\"", "eventUri": "eng-3340111", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title":

and unfortunately two-time drug cheat Justin Gatlin finally delivered.\n\nThe American stunned the London Olympic Stadium when he upstaged Usain Bolt in his final ever 100m race.\n\nBolt again got a horrible start and for the first time in a decade he wasn't able to recover with Gatlin claiming the world title in 9.92sec.\n\nFellow American Christian Coleman took the silver medal in 9.94sec with Bolt relegated to bronze in 9.95sec.\n\nThe greatest sprinter in history dived desperately at the line and waited anxiously for the result to come up on the electronic scoreboard.\n\nWhen it did, a chorus of boos rang out as the realisation that Bolt had been beaten by the one man no-one wanted to see ruin his farewell party.\n\nGatlin, who won the 2004 Olympic 100m gold medal and the 2005 world title, was suspended for four years in 2006 for doping, the second time in his career he'd been busted for taking drugs.\n\nMany believe the 35-year-old shouldn't be allowed to be competing but over the past three years he's been Bolt's closest rival.\n\nAt the 2015 world championships in Beijing, he got within .01sec of the Jamaican and was also the silver medallist in Rio last year.\n\nDespite the shock result, Bolt did a victory lap as he savoured the second-last race of his career.\n\nHe will return later in the week in the 4x100m relay, seeking his 20th gold medal.\n\nThe last time Bolt wasn't the owner of a 100m crown in the past decade was at the 2011 world championship in Daegu where he beat himself, false-starting in the final.\n\nThere had been signs all year that the eight-time Olympic champion was struggling.\n\nLeading into London he'd only ran three 100m races and only once went under 10 seconds with a workmanlike 9.95sec in Monaco last month his best result.\n\nBolt had also been forced to visit his doctor in Germany after issues with his troublesome back.\n\nIn his first run at the world championships in the heat, he had trouble in the blocks and produced one of the worst starts of his career before eventually getting going to win in 10.07sec.\n\nThen in the semi-final he was again slow out and couldn't catch Coleman, this time in 9.98sec.\n\nIt was his inability to get a clean getaway, a problem he's had all his career, which came back to bite him in the final.\n\nColeman was clearly infront at the half-way point of the final and with 20 metres to go Bolt, who was on his inside in lane four, started to surge with all eyes on the pair as they charged at the line.\n\nBut it was the man over in lane eight who'd found another gear with Gatlin producing a season's best performance to snatch victory.\n\nThe result is a PR disaster for sport which was already nervous about life without Bolt.\n\nGiven the drug scandals which have engulfed track and field of recent times, including the banning of Russia from competing, having a convicted drug cheat claim the sport's biggest crown is as bad as it gets.", "eventUri": "eng-3340111", "isDuplicate": false,

He is an inspiration,\" Gatlin said of Bolt.\n\nThe evening was all supposed to be about the 30-year-old Bolt claiming a remarkable 12th world gold to add to his eight Olympic golds in what has been a glittering career.\n\nAnd what a gaping hole his absence will leave, no matter how brave a face track and field's governing body the IAAF try to put on it.\n\nOf his 19 global golds, 13 have come in individual events and allied with a charismatic personality, it has guaranteed Bolt recognition as one of the world's most successful sportsmen.\n\n- Kingston in Stratford -\n\n\"It feels like most of Kingston is in Stratford tonight,\" the stadium announcer said of the welcome afforded Bolt in the eastern London stadium now home to West Ham United in the English Premier League.\n\nGatlin, on the other hand, was emotionless as loud jeers welcomed him.\n\nStarting in lane four, Bolt was incredibly slow to react out of the blocks, the 100 and 200m world record holder behind Coleman in the lane outside from the off.\n\nThe crowd, on their feet, roared, and so Bolt responded as he has so many times before.\n\nAfter 50 metres, he moved into his famed \"drive phase\", head coming slowly up as part of the process that unleashes the full power from his long legs. But it was not quite enough.\n\nTeeth gritted and eyes glued on the big screen of the Trevor Brooking Stand, Bolt streaked through the finish line but any fairytale individual finish to a startling career was dashed by Gatlin and young pretender Coleman.\n\nFor the IAAF, could there have been a worse outcome?\n\nRussia remains banned from international competition over doping and now their prized athlete, destined for some kind of future ambassadorial role within the body, bows out beaten by a two-time, largely unrepentant drugs cheat.", "eventUri": "eng-3340111", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Jeered Gatlin gatecrashes Bolt's 100m farewell party", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-05", "id": "15609683", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3340111", "time": "22:32:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "id": "86522", "location": {"label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "label": {"eng": "Gold"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302577"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303026"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadium", "label": {"eng": "Stadium"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303933"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304566"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305673"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "307762"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_of_Athletics_Federations", "label": {"eng": "International Association of Athletics Federations"}, "type": "org", "id": "308138"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athlete", "label": {"eng": "Athlete"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "308238"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310872"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_governing_body", "label": {"eng": "Sport governing body"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "314936"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "316567"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolt_(2008_film)", "label": {"eng": "Bolt (2008 film)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "322557"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "label": {"eng": "World record"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "331648"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Brooking", "label": {"eng": "Trevor Brooking"}, "type": "person", "id": "395169"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Edward_Stuart", "label": {"eng": "Charles Edward Stuart"}, "type": "person", "id": "465830"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_metres", "label": {"eng": "50 metres"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "599153"}], "url": "https://www.afp.com/en/news/207/jeered-gatlin-gatecrashes-bolts-100m-farewell-party", "timeCrawl": "22:32:00", "image": null, "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-05T22:32:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.658823549747467}

Sure, it helps that he has one of the coolest names in sports, but he's one of the boldest personalities the sport has ever seen, and he has obliterated records in some of track and field's most hallowed events, including the 100m and 200m races.\n\nSo the scene in London, where the 2017 World Championships were being held, was electric for Bolt's final individual race, one last 100m dash as a professional sprinter. He had a couple strong competitors in the field to challenge him, including a young upstart American, 21-year-old Christian Coleman. But he was clearly the star of the show, with the London crowd showering him in applause from the moment he emerged from the tunnel.\n\nAnd in the end, Coleman wasn't the only sprinter who got the better of Bolt. Longtime U.S. track star Justin Gatlin -- who was soundly booed by the London crowd before and after the race -- finally triumphed over the Jamaican sprinter, handing Bolt his first legitimate loss in a major race. In a photo finish, the 35-year-old American came out on top, with Coleman and Bolt finishing second and third respectively.\n\nNo fairytale - but Usain Bolt is legends and he will always be. #London2017 pic.twitter.com/KJ3NFbksjV -- Luca Rimoldi (@LucaRimo)\n\nAugust 5, 2017\n\nTo put the third-place finish into perspective, the only two non-wins in Bolt's major-event career were the result of things that took place before or after a race, never during one. A false start took him out of the running at the 2011 World Championships, and after relay teammate Nesta Carter tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs, Bolt's 4x100 relay team was stripped of their gold medals from the 2016 Rio Olympics. Aside from that, Bolt has been perfect between the lines.\n\nYet even in defeat, love for Bolt would not subside. Rather than diminish what he'd accomplished by mocking his third-place finish at the World Championships, many fans saluted a track icon who had already proven himself many times over.\n\nNot the ending that anybody wanted but Usain Bolt, the greatest track and field athlete.... EVER!! Enjoy retirement, live like a KING! -- Anthony Ogogo (@AnthonyOgogo)\n\nAugust 5, 2017\n\nThere will never be another athlete like Usain Bolt. 9 years of greatness. \u270a\u1f3fe pic.twitter.com/fdQaOnUl0o -- Crystal Johnson (@Crystal1Johnson)\n\nAugust 5, 2017\n\nThat 100m just shows how good @usainbolt has been over so many years.

It was as if Bolt and the audience finally had to face the slow creep of Father Time, showing that even super humans have a limit to their powers.\n\nDespite having every reason to pout, however, Bolt was gracious in defeat, embracing Gatlin with a hug and pacing slowly around the stadium, saying goodbye to his fans one final time. Confronted by his own mortality, Bolt was gregarious and personable as ever, not forgetting why those fans loved him in the first place.\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSo while the third-place finish was a disappointing way to see him go out, particularly after he could have retired on top after the 2016 Rio Olympics, it was wonderful to see nothing could kill Bolt's spirit. Years from now, when his ability to hit top speeds has long since diminished, him remaining upbeat will be a lot more important than where he finished in his final race.\n\nSend all complaints, compliments, and tips to sportstips@complex.com.", "eventUri": "eng-3340111", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Usain Bolt's Final Race Was a Disappointing But Fitting Farewell", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-05", "id": "15606221", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-05", "textStart": 1294, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1308, "freq": 7}], "storyUri": "eng-3340111", "time": "21:50:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "id": "233", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "id": "86522", "location": {"label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "type": "org", "id": "302546"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport", "label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302606"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Summer_Olympics", "label": {"eng": "2016 Summer Olympics"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302788"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304566"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "307762"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "308972"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313033"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "316567"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}, "type": "person", "id": "316574"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}, "type": "person", "id": "320483"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "320499"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_start", "label": {"eng": "False start"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "330211"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "333582"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nesta_Carter", "label": {"eng": "Nesta Carter"}, "type": "person", "id": "460437"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Brownlee", "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Brownlee"}, "type": "person", "id": "461693"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Ogogo", "label": {"eng": "Anthony Ogogo"}, "type": "person", "id": "478864"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Campbell", "label": {"eng": "Alastair Campbell"}, "type": "person", "id": "513865"}], "url": "http://www.complex.com/sports/2017/08/usain-bolt-final-race-track-legend", "timeCrawl": "21:50:00", "image": "http://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,g_center,h_640,w_640/fl_lossy,pg_1,q_auto/s7w40fl2tlgdm9pjugoj/usain_bolt", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-05T21:50:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.658823549747467}

The 35-year-old is regarded by many as the sport's villain after twice being banned for doping offenses. He was also jeered in the heats and semifinals.\n\nBut the 2004 Olympic champion said he \"tuned out\" the supporters' din to claim a victory which wrecked Bolt's farewell.\n\nA glorious career\n\nGatlin genuflected to the Jamaican after his victory. Despite failing to claim a 12th world title, the night still belonged to the fastest man in history.\n\nIt was Bolt who was the last athlete to leave the track as he treated the 50,000-strong capacity crowd, and a throng of photographers, to his celebratory \"To Da World\" pose.\n\nThe crowd had come expecting Bolt to secure a 20th Olympic and world gold medal, but with his 31st birthday fast approaching this was a season too far.\n\nHe had only dipped under 10 seconds once this season prior to these championships and -- though earlier in the week he declared himself ready to defend his world crown -- he did not seem like the Bolt of old.\n\nThere was a little fooling around on the start line, but not with the same gusto as in the past.\n\nThroughout his career the sprinter has made winning look effortless, but on a floodlit evening in the English capital he had to work for his medal.\n\nAfter a disappointing start the Jamaican, for the first time in his career at a major championship he was grimacing as he dipped for the line, straining for a glorious end to his individual career.\n\nAn athlete like no other\n\nBolt is expected to compete in the 4x100m relay on August 12 and should he and his teammates retain their title, his tally of World Championships golds will rise to 12, two more than long-distance runner Mo Farah, who is second on the all-time list.\n\nAfter that there will be no more and his sport will never be the same.\n\nNo sprinter has ever run as quickly or won as many gold medals, and done so with such easy charm.\n\nFor nearly a decade he has been the undoubted superstar of track and field, his electric personality and incredible feats illuminating a sport darkened by doping.\n\nBolt told CNN earlier this week that it will take more than one athlete to fill the vibrant void he will leave behind and the sport now faces a period of transition without its main man.\n\nA legend like Ali\n\nHe has been likened to three-time heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali but, in some ways, the Jamaican's career has surpassed that of the legendary American boxer, even though his last solo race ended with a bronze.\n\nOnly twice has Bolt failed to triumph on the grandest stage -- this bronze in London and a false start in the 2011 100m World Championships final.\n\nThe Jamaican's longevity has been as remarkable as the times he produced in his early twenties.\n\nAt last summer's Rio Olympics, Bolt became the first man to win three 100m Olympic titles, securing his status as one of sport's greats.\n\nHe achieved an unprecedented Olympic \"triple-triple\" in the sprint events (winning the 100m, 200m and sprint relay,) but the 4x100m gold won in Beijing 2008 was taken away from him following teammate Nesta Carter's retrospective positive doping test earlier this year.\n\nAll four of the fastest 100m times in history belong to Bolt and his sensational world record of 9.58 seconds, achieved in Berlin in 2009, will live long in the memory.\n\nThe age of Bolt is now over, but the baton has been passed not to a new generation but an American four years the Jamaican's senior.", "eventUri": "eng-3340111", "isDuplicate": false,

opponents down the final 40m but with a grimace rather than his trademark smile etched across his face, he was unable to chase down Coleman who led until Gatlin snuck up on the field to claim the title.\n\nColeman, 21, completed an American 1-2 by claiming the silver medal while Britain's Reece Prescod came seventh in his first major final, having been only one of three Brits to progress from the semi-finals.\n\nBolt's farewell was the story but Gatlin's past will ensure headlines continue.\n\nThe result was booed by the huge crowd at London Stadium when it was flashed up on the screen but as is his way, Bolt embraced Gatlin before taking a lap of farewell of his own but a stunned stadium were struggling to believe what they had just seen.", "eventUri": "eng-3340111", "isDuplicate":

Christian Coleman completed an American one-two in 9.94sec, with Bolt crossing the line in 9.95.\n\nBolt was aiming to claim a fourth 100m world title after victories in Berlin, Moscow and Beijing, but had another shocking start. In what was his final global individual race, Bolt again failed to get going after having poor starts in his heat and semi-final - fiercely criticising the blocks after Friday night's heat. The IAAF had dismissed his complaints, insisting the blocks are the same model as used in Beijing two years ago.\n\nThe Jamaican recovered in the second half of the race again but could not bring in Gatlin or Coleman - the fastest man in the world going into what was his first international championships.\n\nThe result was not immediately clear, with the crowd waiting on the scoreboard, but it left the stadium in stunned silence before they began to chant Bolt's name as Gatlin celebrated and was in tears on the track. Gatlin's celebrations were a sideshow as Bolt still took the plaudits and did a lap of honour, still playing to the crowd when the stadium was emptying.\n\nHe said in a trackside interview: \"It's wonderful [the crowd's reception], I never expected this.

Normally, it gets better during the rounds but it didn't come together.\"\n\nWhen the results flashed up on the giant screen the crowd immediately began repeating the booing with which Gatlin's name had been greeted since the heats on Friday.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, his first response was to put his finger to his lips to indicate silence.\n\nThe crowd responded instead by chanting Bolt's name.\n\n\"I tuned it out (the boos) through the rounds and stayed the course. I did what I had to do,\" Gatlin said.\n\n\"The people who love me are here cheering for me and cheering at home.\n\n\"It is Bolt's last race.

Bolt is also scheduled to run the 4x100 relay heats Aug. 12 at 5:55 a.m. ET, with the final slated for 4:50 p.m.\n\nBolt finished third in his 100 swan song on Saturday, close behind Americans Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman.\n\n\"Bolt's going to be remembered as the greatest sprinter that ever lived,\" says Bailey, a former world-record holder who won the Olympic 100 at Atlanta in 1996 and the world title the year before.\n\n'The great thing with Usain Bolt is he fell into great coaching, so his talent was exceptional from Day 1.'\n\nA native of Manchester, Jamaica, Bailey remembers Bolt doing \"phenomenal\" things as a schoolboy, long before a monster stride helped him reshape the record book.\n\nIn 2002, a 15-year-old Bolt won gold in the 200 and silver in the 4x100 and 4x400 at the junior championships in Kingston, Jamaica, and two years later became the first junior to run under 20 seconds in the 200, clocking 19.93.\n\n\"His top speed and speed endurance in the 200 showed as a kid,\" says Bailey, now a CBC Sports track analyst. \"The great thing with Usain Bolt is he fell into great coaching, so his talent was exceptional from Day 1. You can coach technique and structure, but not talent.\"\n\nYears ago, Bolt was a speed endurance runner but told New York reporters he asked his coach, Glen Mills, for two years to race the 100 to avoid the more grueling and technical 400.\n\nBolt won a long and spirited debate with Mills, his coach since 2005, about which race he would combine with the 200 to make part of his program.\n\nAccording to Bailey, Bolt's exploits became more apparent because he was placed in a structured environment where nutrition, weightlifting and technical training ruled the day.\n\n\"You put a very talented kid in a structured environment, where they get to understand and believe how talented they are, and you'll see some great results,\" he says.\n\nBolt captured his first Olympic medal in Beijing on Aug. 17, 2008, covering the 100 in a stunning 9.69 seconds to become the first sprinter to set the world record at the Olympics since Bailey ran 9.84 in Atlanta. Richard Thompson of Trinidad and Tobago crossed the line second, more than a body length behind Bolt.\n\nThree days later, on a hot, humid night with 91,000 people crammed inside Bird's Nest Stadium, Bolt ran 19.30 in the 200 final to shove Michael Johnson's seemingly unbreakable world record of 19.32 to the side and become the first man since Carl Lewis 24 years earlier to complete the men's sprint Olympic double. He was also the first since Jamaica's Don Quarrie in the 1970s to hold the world 100 and 200 marks simultaneously.\n\nBolt later teamed with Nesta Carter, Michael Frater and Powell in Beijing to win the 4x100 relay in a world-record 37.10 that was wiped from the record book this past January after a re-analysis of Carter's drug test turned up a banned stimulant.\n\n\"When [Bolt] won the double sprint gold medals and then the relay gold also in record time, it had an effect right across the spectrum in Jamaica because all the high schools reported that the number of athletes coming out to train to make their school teams for boys and girls championships doubled,\" said Warren Blake, president of the Jamaica Athletics Administrative Association.\n\nBolt went on to transcend his sport, winning an unprecedented treble of consecutive Olympic golds in the 100, 200 and 4x100 in 2012 in London, England and again last summer in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\"He has served the sport well and the sport has served him well and we'll miss him,\" said Mills.\n\nBolt's world-record times from the 2009 world championships in the 100 and 200 that he lowered to 9.58 and 19.19, respectively, still stand. Six times Bolt was named International Association of Athletics Federations male athlete of the year and he is also a three-time recipient of the Laureus World Sports Award for sportsman of the year.\n\n\"What I love about Bolt is he continued to tweak, he continued to improve, he continued to work on his technical skills, lift weights,\" Bailey says. \"He's managed to strengthen all his weaknesses. You have to appreciate his persistence and work ethic.\"\n\nAlong the way, he was a real showman that danced, smiled, flashed a peace sign, blew kisses to the crowd and mugged for the cameras, making many forget about a sport that has been ravaged over the years by doping violations.\n\n\"Wherever I left the bar,\" adds Bailey, \"he has taken it and made the sport a globally-watched event, not only during the Olympics. He's been the No. 1 marketer for our sport.\"\n\nGatlin, who defeated Bolt to claim the 100 title on Saturday, has said he always wanted to battle the guys with the records. A 2013 Diamond League matchup in Rome had previously been his lone victory over Bolt in 10 career matchups.\n\n\"I'll be sad to see someone like him go,\" said Gatlin. \"He's the kind of guy who always will be a competitor when he steps onto the line.\"\n\nIn Rio, sprinter Andre De Grasse from Markham, Ont., befriended Bolt and made a statement with his three-medal showing at his Olympic debut that included a bronze and personal-best 9.91 in the 100 and silver in the 200.\n\nHis 2017 season had been geared towards a much-anticipated rematch in the 100 at London Stadium on Saturday -- De Grasse had said repeatedly he wanted one last chance to beat Bolt -- but that plan was scuttled when De Grasse suffered a Grade 2 strain of his right hamstring in the days leading up to the world championships.\n\n\"It's not like we're brothers and we chill every day,\" the 23-year-old De Grasse told CBC Sports' Anson Henry in reference to the so-called bromance the two struck in Brazil. \"He's the best in the world, a legend, and I'm just a kid trying to go out there and prove myself that I could be one of the best. I'm excited for the future.\"\n\nA future on the track that will feature a healed and rising Canadian star, but no longer the man nicknamed \"Lightning Bolt.\"", "eventUri": "eng-3340111",

As he knelt down in tears on the track, 56,000 voices jeered him unmercifully. In the outside world, within minutes, his Wikipedia profile had become Justin \"the Cheat\" Gatlin.\n\nIn the history of sport, you were forced to ponder, had there ever been a champion more universally unloved than Gatlin, the twice doping offender who by winning world 100 metres gold on Saturday had ruined one of sport's great fairytale farewells.\n\nIt was supposed to be all about Usain Bolt. The idea of the world's greatest athlete not winning his final individual race was like Olivier fluffing his lines in his final Hamlet or Nureyev taking a tumble in his farewell performance of Swan Lake. Unthinkable.\n\nYet what was really unimaginable, the sport's doomsday scenario almost, was that as the sport's spotless \"saviour\" was bowing out with his first defeat in any 100m final for four years, it would be the much-maligned Gatlin who would cash in.\n\nOnly two years ago, at the Beijing World Championships when Bolt outpaced Gatlin for the same title, it was hailed almost as good prevailing over evil.\n\n\"He saved his title, he saved his reputation, he may have even saved his sport,\" screamed Steve Cram, the former 1,500 metres world record holder in the BBC commentary box.\n\nSo what had changed two years on?\n\nIn a world where drugs offenders are hardly thin on the ground, the 35-year-old American is still the bete noire of the anti-doping lobby, the man who has never shown any remorse and has thus received special opprobrium.\n\nYet hasn't it reached almost farcical proportions? On Friday night in the first round, the stadium MC had noted amid all the cat-calling that the pantomime season was Christmas not in August. No matter; Gatlin was already cast in stone as their villain.\n\nSTONY-FACED\n\nYohan Blake, who has also served a drugs ban, was cheered to the rafters when he was introduced for the final but Gatlin just remained stony-faced through all the jeering. He has long become used to it. \"I tuned it out,\" he said.\n\n\"I did what I had to do. The people who love me are here cheering for me and my fellow countrymen are cheering at home.\"\n\nOf course, not all Americans will have been but even Bolt recognised after Gatlin had won in 9.92 seconds, just three-hundredths of a second ahead of him in the bronze medal position, that this reception did not feel fair.\n\nIndeed, in this rarest of defeats, we may have seen the real greatness of Bolt revealed in a way we had never witnessed before.\n\nYes, the world has loved his once-in-a-century gift and his unmatched showmanship in all his triumphs. They have shown him as a great winner. Yet here he showed the world how to lose. With grace and honour. And, yes, forgiveness too.\n\nEarly in their career, Gatlin had once tried to psyche out Bolt when racing in an adjacent lane by spitting in it. So right from the start, Bolt could have been forgiven for really having it in for the American.\n\nYet even when anti-Gatlin feeling was most rife in the sport a couple of years ago, Bolt never sought to rub it in his foe's face. Who was the first man congratulate Gatlin on Saturday?

Normally, it gets better during the rounds but it didn't come together.\"\n\nWhen the results flashed up on the giant screen the crowd immediately began repeating the booing with which Gatlin's name had been greeted since the heats on Friday.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, his first response was to put his finger to his lips to indicate silence.\n\nThe crowd responded instead by chanting Bolt's name.\n\n\"I tuned it out (the boos) through the rounds and stayed the course. I did what I had to do,\" Gatlin said.\n\n\"The people who love me are here cheering for me and cheering at home.\n\n\"It is Bolt's last race. I have had many victories and many defeats down the years. It is an amazing occasion. We are rivals on the track but in the warm-down area we joke and have a good time.

Here is some reaction to his win and Bolt's surprise defeat:\n\nBolt: \"It's just one of those things. My start is killing me. Normally it gets better during the rounds but it didn't come together. And that is what killed me. I felt it was there.\n\n\"It was rough. A little bit stressed. But I came out like at any other championships and did my best.\n\n\"I am not fully comfortable in those blocks but you have to work with what you have. I can't complain about that.\n\n\"He (Gatlin) is a great competitor. You have to be at your best against him. I really appreciate competing against him and he is a good person.\"\n\n* * *\n\nGatlin: \"It's not about doing it to Usain... Usain's the man. If you imagine him not being in the sport, where would it be?\n\n\"He's a character, he's funny, he's loveable, it's hard to be focused against him because you want to wish him the best and I'm happy to be one of his top rivals throughout the years.\n\n\"He's pushed me to be the runner I am today and I'm happy to be in his last race and so many races before that. The night is still his night.\n\n\"I tuned it (the boos) out through the rounds and stayed the course. I did what I had to do.\n\n\"We are rivals on the track but in the warm-up area we have a good time. He congratulated me and the first thing he said was I didn't deserve all these boos.\"\n\n* * *\n\nBolt's team mate Yohan Blake, who finished fourth: \"I'm surprised at what happened because Bolt came third -- he's a man for winning and his start has been letting him down.\"\n\n* * *\n\nColeman: \"It's an historic moment... (Bolt) is somebody I looked up to when I was coming up and watching him run. He's an icon, I was just happy to be on a line with him and it's a humble feeling.\"\n\n* * *\n\nDenise Lewis, Olympic gold medallist in the heptathlon in 2000: \"Justin Gatlin has been through the mill and whatever side of the fence you sit on, it is sport. He was crying and that moved me. He has worked hard. He still has to train as hard as everyone else and turn up and deliver.\"\n\n(Reporting by Gene Cherry, Kayon Raynor and Brian Homewood, edting by Neil Robinson)", "eventUri": "eng-3340111", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Athletics-What they said about the men's 100 metres final", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-05", "id": "15608305", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 8, "amb": false, "textEnd": 13, "date": "2017-08-05"}], "storyUri": "eng-3340111", "time": "22:17:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "id": "233", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "id": "86522", "location": {"label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302553"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}, "type": "org", "id": "302588"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport", "label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302606"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport", "label": {"eng": "Doping in sport"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302773"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304566"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denise_Lewis", "label": {"eng": "Denise Lewis"}, "type": "person", "id": "306416"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running", "label": {"eng": "Running"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "308955"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313033"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}, "type": "person", "id": "316574"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition", "label": {"eng": "Competition"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "317082"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptathlon", "label": {"eng": "Heptathlon"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "318391"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAAF_World_Championships_in_Athletics", "label": {"eng": "IAAF World Championships in Athletics"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "319309"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}, "type": "person", "id": "320483"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yohan_Blake", "label": {"eng": "Yohan Blake"}, "type": "person", "id": "343533"}], "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/~/article-4764458/index.html", "timeCrawl": "22:17:00", "image": null, "location": {"label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "dateTime": "2017-08-05T22:17:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.6000000238418579}

Britain's Reece Prescod was seventh.\n\nIn stark contrast to the euphoria of Friday night's joyous climax when Mo Farah won the 10,000m, boos rang around the London Stadium as they had all weekend for the eventual champion. The sour mood lifted somewhat as Bolt took a lap of honour with his name being chanted, but the sense of deflation lingered. Bolt warmly embraced Gatlin after the race and was keen to put a positive spin on his last hurrah in the distance he has dominated for so long.\n\n\"I never expected this, the way they have come out and supported me,\" he said. \"London, I really appreciate it. It didn't end on a winning note but that's one of these things.\"\n\nBolt had looked shaky in the opening rounds and continued his run of poor starts in the final, leaving himself with too much to do.\n\n\"The start killed me. It usually gets better through the rounds but I couldn't get it together,\" he said.\n\nThe ageless brilliance of Roger Federer would be Bolt's only contemporary rival, but such is the sprinter's incandescent charisma he is more often viewed as the inheritor of Muhammad Ali's mantle when it comes to transcendental impact.\n\nAs with politicians, the careers of boxers normally end in failure. That was the case for Ali when he was beaten on a technical knockout by Trevor Berbick, a Jamaican ironically, in 1981.\n\nIt was not a fate the world could bear to witness happening to Bolt and yet, while not in such a brutal fashion, this felt like Ivan Drago beating Rocky.\n\nWith the 4x100m still to come the roll of honour still stands at an extraordinary 11 world titles and eight Olympic. The only blots before this on an otherwise perfect global championships record since he shot to prominence in Beijing almost a decade go are the 2008 relay gold, which was stripped after team-mate Nesta Carter was found guilty of doping, and the false start disqualification at the 2011 worlds in Daegu, which saw compatriot Blake claim the 100m title. His world records of 9.58 in the 100 and 19.19 in the 200 are likely to stand for some time.\n\nLightning crackled in the London skies during the morning session. A portent of things to come later? Famously in the Moscow 2013 final, lightning struck at the very moment Bolt crossed the line for his second 100m world crown - redemption for the Daegu blip two years previously.\n\nIt was warm, sunny and dry come evening, with Bolt expected to produce the pyrotechnics in an electrically charged London Stadium. In this most global of cities a truly international event is taking place with more than 2,000 athletes from over 200 countries competing. The build-up, however, has focused largely on two men - Bolt and Farah, who kept his part of the bargain on opening night.\n\nThe \"Del Boys\" that peppered the walk from Stratford station to the stadium flogging flags - \"free pand each, two for the fiver\" - certainly knew where their bread was buttered with only two to choose from - the Union Flag and, or ideally for sellers both, the black, gold and green of Jamaica.\n\nIn the semi-finals the crowd witnessed Bolt go under ten seconds, something of a rare occurrence this year, but he was beaten by Coleman, who had registered the best time of 2017 going into this meet on 9.82.\n\nBolt got another shocking start but recovered and eased off, eyeballing the American as he followed him over the line a hundredth of a second behind on 9.98. There was a comical moment when the scoreboard initially failed to register Bolt in the placings, which he greeted with mock panic. Nobody was laughing a few hours later.", "eventUri": "eng-3340111", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Justin Gatlin gatecrashes Usain Bolt's farewell party", "dateCrawl":

champion, who will retire at the end of the championships following the 4x100m relay next weekend, clocked in at 9.95 seconds but it wasn't enough to defend his 2015 title as his American stormed to victory in 9.92 secs.\n\nChristian Coleman of America took silver with 9.94 secs.\n\nThis marks the first time that Bolt has failed to take gold in any 100m final at the Olympics and World Championships.\n\nUsain Bolt was unable to end his solo career on a high (Getty)\n\nMichael Johnson had said ahead of the competition that Bolt was \"more vulnerable\" than ever in his bid to retain his title as 'the fastest man on earth'.\n\nOn the big occasion here at the London Stadium, the American's words proved prescient as the 30-year-old struggled to reach the same stellar heights of five years ago that saw him clinch Olympic gold in the 100m and 200m finals.\n\nAfter a disappointing performance in the first-round heats, which Bolt described as \"very bad\", the 30-year-old qualified as second fastest for tonight's final behind Coleman, with a time of 9.98 seconds.\n\nUsain Bolt's best moments 10 show all Usain Bolt's best moments 1/10 200m final (19.78 second, Rio 2016

season's personal best to elicit widespread boos from the London audience who expected anything but a shock Gatlin victory.\n\nBolt's attention now turns to Saturday's relay race as he looks to bow out with one final gold medal.\n\nMore to follow.\n\nMore about: Usain Bolt World Athletics Championships Reuse content", "eventUri": "eng-3340111", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05",

And he only lost to Christian Coleman of the United States by 0.01 of a second (9.98 seconds to 9.97 seconds).\n\nBut still: It's the first time Bolt has lost a 100-meter semifinal at the world championships or the Olympics. Ever.\n\n[Usain Bolt blames starting blocks for 'very bad' first-round sprint at worlds]\n\nHe's clearly taking it hard.\n\nWhen Usain Bolt doesn't win his 100m semi-final.https://t.co/ss8pwsyf0Q #London2017 #bbcathletics pic.twitter.com/wiQjqOgNOx\n\n-- BBC Sport (@BBCSport) August 5, 2017\n\nColeman is just 21 years old and only recently turned pro after winning the 100 meters and 200 meters at the NCAA championships for Tennessee. Saturday's sprint was his first race against Bolt, who holds the 100-meter world record (9.58 seconds) and is an eight-time Olympic gold medalist and 11-time world champion.\n\n\"You can't call yourself the best if you don't go against the best,\" Coleman told the AP earlier this week. \"I'll be ready to compete.

A chorus of boos from a crowd unhappy with Gatlin's doping past rang around the arena in a slightly surreal conclusion to the blue-chip event.\n\nGatlin was banned for one year after testing positive in 2001 for an amphetamine contained in attention deficit disorder medication (ADD), and for four years after failing a test for the banned steroid testosterone in 2006.\n\nMany voiced there unease about the result on social media, and asked whether athletics' post-Bolt era would only herald bring more uncertainty and controversy.\n\nFormer Olympic heptathlete Kelly Sotherton and others summed up the mood of many.\n\nNo one saw that happening no one wanted that to happen #Gatlin -- Kelly Sotherton (@KellySotherton)\n\nAugust 5, 2017\n\nImagine becoming world champion only to have the fans boo you and chant the name of the guy in 3rd place.

The Jamaican amassed 19 global gold medals, eight Olympic victories and 11 from the World Championships, and still has a chance to secure one more in the 4x100m relay before retirement.\n\nGatlin's celebrations were a sideshow as Bolt still took the plaudits and did a lap of honour, still playing to the crowd when the stadium was emptying.\n\nHe said in a trackside interview: \"It's wonderful (the crowd's reception), I never expected this. It's just a wonderful experience. London I really appreciate the support you have given me. I'm just really sorry I couldn't end up winning.\"\n\n\"My start is killing me.

I have had many victories and many defeats down the years. It is an amazing occasion. We are rivals on the track but in the warm-down area we joke and have a good time.

Photo by Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters\n\nUsain Bolt, the global track superstar from Jamaica, ran the last race of his career on Saturday at the 2017 World Championships in London, placing third. The race punctuates a record-breaking career spanning three Olympic Games.\n\nBolt, 30, ends his reign with nearly every award a runner can win. He holds world records in the 100- and 200-meter sprints. His fastest 100-meter time - 9.58 seconds in Berlin in 2009 - was a full tenth of a second ahead of the second-place finisher. He has set records with Jamaica's 4\u00d7100-meter relay team, and is the only individual to win both the 100 and 200 in three consecutive Olympic Games. In total, he has placed first at 11 world championships.\n\nBolt's final 100-meter race, which he finished in 9.96 seconds, was several tenths off his personal record. He placed behind Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman, only the second time in his career that he has lost a championship race (the other was in 2011, when he was disqualified after a false start).\n\nThe runner has endured scoliosis and back problems throughout his career. On Friday, he ran the preliminary sprint in 10.07 seconds. Though he placed first in that race, he called his performance \"very bad.\"\n\nWhile it was his running that first attracted attention, it's his persona - free-wheeling, joyful, celebratory - that locked the world's attention for nearly a decade, elevating the runner to a level of global stardom reached by few athletes. After races, and sometimes even in the middle of them, he was known to look directly into the camera and grin.\n\nBut with his diminishing performance came diminishing enjoyment in the spectacle of the race. In the 2016 documentary \"I Am Bolt,\" he said, \"It's not as fun as it used to be.

I'm here to perform and do what I have to do.\"\n\nOn Saturday he reacted in a very similar way, as Gatlin held a finger to his lips after taking the gold in remarkable fashion.\n\nThe Jamaican walked straight over to his rival moments after the race and pulled him in for a celebratory hug.\n\nHe then spoke to the BBC about the American, saying: \"He is a great competitor.

Gatlin claimed his first world championship in 12 years, while Bolt finished third behind American Christian Coleman.

However, USA Track and Field celebrated the victory:\n\nThe London crowd made no secret of its distaste for the result, as football writer Amar Singh illustrated:\n\nIt was only hundredths of a second that separated the top three, and although Bolt's bronze will be the first medal he collects at a world championship that isn't gold or silver, there's no doubting his place as the greatest of all time.\n\nBolt still holds the 100-metre world record for the 9.58-second sprint he recorded in Berlin in 2009, and ESPN paid tribute to his incredible medal tally:\n\nEarlier in the evening, Bolt had to settle for second in his semi-final after Coleman blasted through and made the Jamaican look forward across the finish line to spot his nearest rival in a rare twist of events -- albeit by just one hundredth of a second.\n\nThis was the first time Bolt had ever been beaten in the semi-final of a 100-metre race at either the World Athletics Championships or an Olympics, evidence of just how unique a talent Coleman could be.\n\nReece Prescod was a sole British representative in the final after Chijindu Ujah and James Dasaolu finished fourth and fifth in their respective semi-finals.\n\nManyonga was jubilant in triumph after Lawson's late bid to catch up to his winning distance of 8.48 metres fell short in the long jump, the South African's rags-to-riches tale from a drug addiction to world champion reaching its conclusion, per BBC Sport:\n\nGudzius of Lithuania also joined in the winners' celebrations after throwing for 69.21 metres in the men's discus final -- his last competition before retiring -- while Sweden's Daniel Stahl took silver.\n\nAyana stormed to victory in the women's 10,000 metres with a time of 30 minutes, 16.33 seconds, completing an Ethiopian one-two with countrywoman Tirunesh Dibaba.\n\nKenya's Agnes Tirop broke up the national monopoly to take third, but The Guardian's Sean Ingle could hardly believe Ayana's dominant run to gold, acres ahead of her competition:\n\nFaith Kipyegon won the first semi-final in the women's 1,500 metres, where Britain's Laura Muir advanced but had to leave behind team-mate Jess Judd, who was upbeat talking to BBC Sport after an early assault on the lead eventually saw her legs turn to jelly:\n\nAnother Briton, Laura Weightman, advanced to the final after finishing fourth in the next semi, and she told BBC Sport after a fine performance: \"I knew it would take a great race to get into final and down the home straight I have never been in a position when I am gaining places. I love competing in this stadium and can't wait until Monday.\"\n\nAfter 21-year-old Prescod's run to the 100-metre final earlier on Saturday, 20-year-old Daryll Saskia Neita was another British youngster to qualify from the first round of the women's equivalent sprint:\n\nHeptathlete Katarina Johnson-Thompson had a mixed day but made up for disappointing performances in the shot put and high

Atenas-2004 y el mundial en Helsinki-2005, antes de cumplir una sanci\u00f3n de cuatro a\u00f1os por dopaje, gan\u00f3 con un tiempo de 9.92, delante del tambi\u00e9n estadounidense Christian Coleman (9.94) y Bolt, que logr\u00f3 el bronce (9.95).\n\nBolt igual\u00f3 su mejor tiempo de la temporada logrado el pasado 21 de julio en M\u00f3naco, pero no le fue suficiente para ganar, pese a que en su \u00faltimo esfuerzo meti\u00f3 la cabeza y el pecho y dej\u00f3 dudas sobre su posici\u00f3n final, mientras el p\u00fablico del Ol\u00edmpico de Londres esperaba impaciente el resultado.\n\nCuando se anunci\u00f3 como ganador a Gatlin, el estadio se llen\u00f3 de abucheos, debido a su pasado con el dopaje.\n\nLa carrera sirvi\u00f3 de venganza al atletismo estadounidense respecto a los velocistas jamaicanos, despu\u00e9s del dominio absoluto de la isla caribe\u00f1a en la prueba, con Bolt como estandarte.\n\nMientras que el veterano Gatlin se llev\u00f3 el oro, con la plata para el joven Coleman (21 a\u00f1os), que tiene en su poder la mejor marca de la temporada, Jamaica se tuvo que conformar con el tercer puesto de Bolt y el cuarto de Yohan Blake (9.99).\n\nUsain Bolt, de casi 31 a\u00f1os, el mejor atleta de todos los tiempos, se qued\u00f3 de este modo sin un final completamente feliz, cediendo su corona en los 100 metros.\n\nEs la primera vez que pierde en esta prueba

A partir de all\u00ed siempre consigui\u00f3 el oro en los 100, 200 metros y en la posta 4x100: as\u00ed lo hizo en los Juegos de Londres 2012, en los mundiales de Mosc\u00fa 2013 y Beijing 2015, y en los Juegos Ol\u00edmpicos de R\u00edo 2016. Imparable.\n\nMir\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n Otra leyenda del atletismo empez\u00f3 su despedida de las pistas con un oro\n\nGatlin volvi\u00f3 de su suspensi\u00f3n en 2010 y poco a poco fue recuperando su mejor nivel. Fue bronce en los 100 metros y plata en los 4x100, en Londres 2012; y en el Mundial de Beijing 2015 qued\u00f3 segundo -detr\u00e1s de Bolt- en los 100 y 200 metros.\n\nJustin Gatlin se arrodilla ante Usain Bolt. (AP)\n\nEste s\u00e1bado, el estadounidense recuper\u00f3 el oro y obtuvo su revancha en Londres. Por el andarivel 8 logr\u00f3 una marca de 9.92 segundos y venci\u00f3 a Bolt, que qued\u00f3 tercero, en su \u00faltima funci\u00f3n. Gatlin se arrodill\u00f3 ante el jamaiquino y le rindi\u00f3 pleites\u00eda tras la carrera. Se abrazaron y cada uno sigui\u00f3 su camino. Para el estadounidense fue momento de llorar y descargar frustraciones que ten\u00eda atragantadas desde hac\u00eda m\u00e1s de una d\u00e9cada. Y volvi\u00f3 a ba\u00f1arse de oro en la competencia m\u00e1s espectacular del atletismo.\n\n\"Es todo tan irreal. Usain ha conseguido tanto en nuestro deporte que ha inspirado a otros como (Christian) Coleman para competir. me ha dicho: 'Felicidades, te lo has merecido'. \u00c9l sabe bien lo mucho que he trabajado para esto\", coment\u00f3 Gatlin, que fue silbado por el p\u00fablico antes y despu\u00e9s de la carrera.", "eventUri": "eng-3340111", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title":

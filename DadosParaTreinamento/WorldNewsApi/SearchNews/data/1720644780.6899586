The Oilers come in at +120 on the moneyline against the Panthers on ESPN BET, with 56.4 percent of bets and 38.9 percent of the money on the Oilers moneyline. So, the betting public likes the underdog, but the Sharps appear to be on the Panthers. An ESPN BET spokesperson told The Post that 61.1 percent of the money is on the home team at -140 odds. So, where does that leave us for Game 1? Oilers vs. Panthers prediction (8 p.m. ET, ABC) The Oilers had only 10 shots on goal in Game 6 compared to 34 for the Stars. Connor McDavid is that special. He\u2019s been showcasing it for several years, and it seems to be hitting its peak in these playoffs. McDavid and side-kick Leon Draisaitl will be roughed up in this series but are two of the best scorers that the league has to offer. Panthers goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky will have his hands full in Game 1 as he attempts to hold down the league\u2019s No. 1 offense in expected goal percentage (58.17 percent). While the Panthers allowed the least goals against in the NHL, something will have to give in this matchup. Oilers goaltender Stuart Skinner looked excellent against the Stars at the back end of the series, but the Panthers were second in shot attempt percentage (55.68 percent) during the regular season at five on five.

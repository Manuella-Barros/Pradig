Ukraine will prevail.\"\n\nUS officials said the air defence aid includes Patriot missiles and their components. In coming months, the allies also will provide Ukraine with dozens of other tactical air defence systems.\n\nMr Biden spoke for about 13 minutes on Tuesday afternoon in a clear voice, a marked difference from his fumbling and softly spoken tone during last month's presidential debate.\n\nHis speech took place at a fraught moment in his political career. He faces calls to step aside as the Democratic Party's presidential nominee following a disastrous performance at last month's presidential debate.\n\nMr Biden's team has responded by trying to show that the 81-year-old remains vigorous enough to handle the demands of the presidency.\n\nHis administration highlighted his role hosting the Nato summit this week in Washington DC as the alliance celebrates its 75th anniversary.\n\nLeaders from the 32 member countries, including the UK's new Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, gathered on Tuesday evening for Mr Biden's address.\n\nBefore leaving for Washington, Sir Keir said he was pleased to \"confirm and reaffirm Labour's strong support, unshakeable support for Nato\".\n\nThe Nato trip is \"all about standing together with our allies, discussing practically how we provide further support to Ukraine, and send a very, very clear message to Putin that we will stand against Russian aggression wherever it is in the world,\" he said.\n\nThe event was steeped in the alliance's history.\n\nIt was held in the very venue where the original treaty was signed decades ago, which Mr Biden invoked in his speech.\n\nAfter the leaders posed for a group photograph, the audience watched a video celebrating Nato, featuring archival footage of Nato troops and rousing speeches from world leaders.\n\nIn opening remarks, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg celebrated the creation of a group \"with a clear purpose to preserve peace and safeguard freedom\".\n\nThe group of nations currently faces a major challenge as Russia continues its war against Ukraine.\n\nMr Stoltenberg called it the \"biggest security crisis in generations.\"\n\nNear the conclusion of his speech, Mr Biden called Mr Stoltenberg back to the stage, calling him \"a man of integrity and intellectual rigour.\"\n\nHe awarded Mr Stoltenberg the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honour.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

Before leaving for Washington, he said he was pleased to \"confirm and reaffirm Labour's strong support, unshakeable support for Nato\".\n\nAsked by reporters traveling with him to the summit for his message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Sir Keir said the gathering \"should be seen as a clear and united resolve by Nato allies... to stand with Ukraine and stand up to Russian aggression\".\n\nHe said a deadly attack on a children's hospital in Kyiv earlier this week \"strengthens the resolve and that is a very important if tragic backdrop to this summit\".\n\nSir Keir added the package of support for Ukraine the UK was seeking to advance at the summit \"goes beyond the support that's been put in before\".\n\nSir Keir is due to meet Biden on Wednesday, as well as Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress.\n\nTuesday's event was steeped in the alliance's history.\n\nIt was held in the very venue where the original treaty was signed decades ago, which Biden invoked in his speech.\n\nNear the conclusion of his speech, Biden called Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on to the stage to award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honor.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Trump, 78, criticized Nato allies during a campaign rally at his golf club in Doral, Florida.\n\nThe event was attended by all three of his sons, including his youngest, Barron, who was at his first-ever Trump rally, according to his father, and received more applause from the audience than his brothers, Eric and Don.\n\nTrump has repeatedly lambasted Nato member states for failing to meet an agreed goal of spending at least 2% of gross domestic product on defense. Many more Nato countries now meet that benchmark since Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nTrump told supporters that these countries were contributing \"hundreds of billions of dollars\" more because when he was president he had warned them \"No, I will not protect you from Russia\" unless they paid more to the alliance. -- BBC", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Saudi

Russia denied responsibility for the attack, but the UN - and analysts who spoke to BBC Verify - pinned the blame on Moscow.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has spent months pleading with his Western allies to step up supplies of air defences.\n\nIn total, Nato plans to donate five strategic air defence systems and dozens of smaller, strategic anti-air batteries over the coming year.\n\n\"The war will end with Ukraine remaining a free and independent country,\" Mr Biden said on Tuesday afternoon. \"Russia will not prevail.

Blinken told the summit the jets will be in use \"this summer\".\n\nNato members agreed to set up a new unit to coordinate military aid and training for the Ukrainian army as part of measures designed to deepen ties between the alliance and Ukraine.\n\nThe joint statement said these measures, combined with aid commitments from individual members, \"constitute a bridge to Ukraine's membership in Nato\".\n\nIt said Ukraine had made \"concrete progress\" on \"required democratic, economic, and security reforms\" in recent months -- but that a formal membership invitation would only be extended when \"conditions are met\".\n\n\"As Ukraine continues this vital work, we will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including Nato membership,\" the statement added.\n\nIt also accused China of being a \"decisive enabler\" for Russia's war against Ukraine, in some of its harshest remarks yet on Beijing's involvement.\n\nThis prompted an angry response from Beijing's mission to the EU, which called on Nato to \"stop hyping up the so-called China threat, and provoking confrontation and rivalry\".\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was invited to the Nato summit and had meetings with world leaders, including his first with Sir Keir Starmer since he became prime minister of the United Kingdom.\n\nSir Keir told Zelensky there would be \"no change in support\" for Ukraine's war effort despite there being a new government in London.\n\nZelensky also met US politicians from both the Democrat and Republican parties, a move designed to shore up cross-party support for Ukraine after a stand-off in Congress earlier this year saw a large military aid package delayed for several months.\n\nNato leaders had hoped this week's summit would provide an opportunity to present a united front on Ukraine after modest Russian gains on the battlefield in recent months.\n\nHowever, there may be some disappointment in Kyiv that there was no clear public indication on how long it would be until Ukraine is offered full membership.\n\nThe summit -- which marked the 75-year anniversary of the alliance's foundation -- came months ahead of an election which could see Donald Trump, a Nato critic, return to the White House, and amid political troubles for US President Joe Biden.\n\nAs Biden, 81, met other Nato leaders on Wednesday, some influential Democrats publicly called for him to quit the race over fears he is too old to perform against Trump, 78, in what is likely to be a closely fought campaign.\n\nResponding to a question from the BBC, Stoltenberg refused to be drawn on whether the US's domestic politics could impact the alliance.\n\nHe said: \"Nato is the most successful alliance in history because we have been able to stay out of domestic political debates.\n\n\"It's important for me to continue to do what I can to ensure that that continues to be the case.\"\n\nBiden used the summit to reaffirm his support for Ukraine and call for more defense investment from other members which have lagged behind on spending.\n\nHe said Russia is on a \"wartime footing\" in terms of defense production with support from Russia, North Korea and Iran -- and leaders \"cannot allow the alliance to fall behind\".\n\n\"We can and will defend every inch of Nato territory\", the president added. -- BBC", "source": {"uri":

When the bullies threatened the block, you stepped up.\"\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the F-16 transfer \"concentrates Vladimir Putin's mind on the fact that he will not outlast Ukraine, he will not outlast us.\"\n\nBut White House challenger Donald Trump, who is edging out Biden in polls leading up to November's presidential election, has mused about bringing a quick peace settlement by pushing Ukraine to surrender territory to Russia.\n\nThe Republican mogul has repeatedly questioned the utility of Nato -- formed in 1949 as collective defense against Moscow -- which he sees as an unfair burden on the United States.\n\n'Terror must fail'\n\nOn the eve of the summit, Russia fired a barrage of missiles on Ukraine, killing dozens, including in Kyiv where a children's hospital was reduced to debris.\n\nBiden invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the summit, who voiced gratitude for the F-16s.\n\nThe new aircraft will \"bring just and lasting peace closer, demonstrating that terror must fail,\" Zelensky wrote on social media.\n\nThe summit aimed in part to \"Trump-proof\" the alliance including by giving Nato a greater role, rather than the United States, in coordinating arms delivery into Ukraine.\n\nIn a joint declaration, Nato leaders promised to give Ukraine 40 billion euros ($43 billion) in military aid \"within the next year\" -- part of efforts to increase stability after Trump's allies in Congress held up US assistance for months.\n\nTrump's aides have also discussed conditioning aid to Ukraine on forcing Kyiv to the negotiating table and said that China, not Russia, is a larger concern to US interests.\n\nThe Nato leaders' statement took aim at China as well, voicing \"profound concern\" over its industrial support to Russia.\n\nChina's reaction was swift.\n\n\"Nato should stop hyping up the so-called China threat and provoking confrontation and rivalry, and do more to contribute to world peace and stability,\" a spokesman for Beijing's mission to the EU said, adding that \"China's position on Ukraine is open and aboveboard.\"\n\nBiden invited four key Pacific partners to the summit -- Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand -- as he seeks to increase Nato's role in Asia.\n\n'Irreversible' Ukraine path to Nato\n\nThe summit also stepped up promises to Ukraine, saying that it was on an \"irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including Nato membership.\"\n\nUkraine has for years sought but failed to win membership in Nato, which as an alliance considers an attack on one an attack on all.\n\nBut Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have led concerns that bringing in Kyiv now would effectively be entering war with nuclear-armed Russia as it occupies swathes of Ukrainian territory.\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, visiting days after his Labour Party swept to power, promised Zelensky that Britain -- unlike the United States -- was united across partisan lines on supporting Ukraine.\n\nStarmer made clear he had no issue with Ukraine using UK missiles to strike into Russian territory, remarks that drew a rebuke from Moscow.\n\nThe summit, Starmer told reporters, is showing Putin that Nato is \"bigger now than it's ever been, more united than it's ever been, and absolutely clear-eyed about the threat of Russian aggression.\"", "source": {"uri":

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World Tonight programme, Hank Johnson, a congressman from Georgia, said it was time to \"break the circular firing squad\" around Mr Biden.\n\nMr Johnson is a member of the influential Congressional Black Caucus. While admitting Mr Biden had a \"horrible\" debate with Trump, he said the overwhelming majority of voters of colour wanted him as their candidate.\n\nThe caucus - a group of about 60 lawmakers - reportedly backed the president during a call on Monday.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Mr Biden gave brief but vociferous remarks to open the Nato summit, declaring the alliance to be \"more powerful than ever\". Observers said he struck a markedly different tone to his fumbling performance in the 27 June debate.\n\nBut elsewhere, the dissent continues to trickle through.\n\nOn Tuesday, congressional Democrats emerged from their private talks. Some chose to speak to reporters, touting Mr Biden's record in the White House or speaking of Democratic unity.\n\nBut the same day, a seventh House Democrat - Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey - publicly called on Mr Biden not to run for re-election, saying the stakes were \"too high\".\n\nShe joined other dissenting voices in Congress that include Adam Smith, who told the BBC earlier this week that the party needed to install a \"stronger messenger\" as its candidate.\n\nIn his comments to CNN, Mr Bennet said the question of whether to carry on in the race was \"something for the president to consider\". But he said Trump was \"on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide\".\n\nThe Colorado Democrat framed the issue as \"a moral question about the future of our country\".\n\nTwo other senators are reported by CNN to believe that Mr Biden cannot win the White House again, although neither has publicly broken ranks.\n\nThe same day, George Stephanopoulos, a former Democratic operative turned ABC News anchor who interviewed Mr Biden last week, said he does not think the president \"can serve four more years\".\n\nThe audio was captured by TMZ as Mr Stephanopoulos made the comment to a passerby.\n\nAlthough Mr Stephanopoulos did not rescind the comment, he later acknowledged he should not have made it.\n\nMr Biden reportedly also faces doubts from diplomats visiting Washington for the Nato meeting, one of whom anonymously told Reuters they could not see him staying in post for another four years.\n\nAs the debate lingers - and the White House faces questions about its approach to disclosing information about Mr Biden's health - speculation continues to grow over who would replace Mr Biden if he chose to step down.\n\nVice-President Kamala Harris is earning some high-profile backers, despite her ongoing vocal support for the president. During a rally in Las Vegas on Tuesday, Ms Harris insisted her boss was a \"fighter\".\n\nMr Biden himself has dared his doubters to either challenge him or unite behind his candidacy, although he has admitted he \"screwed up\" in the Trump debate.\n\nHis performance in the head-to-head has been ridiculed by his rival, who has suggested Ms Harris would be a \"better\" competitor for the White House.\n\nBut in his latest comments on the matter, Trump said he expected his adversary to stay in the race: \"He's got an ego, and he doesn't want to quit.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com",

during Nato's 75th anniversary summit in Washington, on July 10, 2024. --- Reuters\n\nNato countries at their summit in Washington on Wednesday came up with what alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg called a \"substantial package\" of support for Ukraine.\n\nBut what exactly is Nato offering the war-torn country two and half years into Russia's attack?\n\nNato will take a greater role from the United States in coordinating training and weapons deliveries for Ukraine by setting up a centralized command.\n\nThe move is aimed at shielding supplies to Kyiv from a potential return to the White House by Donald Trump after November's presidential election.\n\nThe change will see hundreds of personnel from different Nato members stationed at a base in Germany, and key hubs along the alliance's eastern flank.\n\nThe switch is quite modest -- and a three-star US General looks likely to take the lead.\n\nBut its an important step for an alliance that has so far steered clear of having a direct role in arming Ukraine for fears it would drag Nato closer to war with Russia.\n\nNato countries have pledged to maintain support for Ukraine for a further year at the rate they have been doing since Russia attacked -- a minimum of 40 billion euros ($43 billion).\n\n\"Through proportional contributions, allies intend to provide a minimum baseline funding of 40 billion euros within the next year, and to provide sustainable levels of security assistance for Ukraine to prevail,\" a summit declaration said.\n\nThe political promise is designed to put aid on a firmer footing -- but it is not legally binding and could be ignored by future leaders.\n\nInitially, Stoltenberg had hoped to get allies to make it a multi-year commitment but the US demanded a review next year.\n\nNato didn't give Ukraine what it really wants: a clear invite to join the alliance in the near future.\n\nInstead leaders reaffirmed the commitment that Kyiv will one day become a member \"when allies agree and conditions are met.\"\n\nTo offer Ukraine some encouragement, leaders did agree to say that Kyiv's path to membership is \"irreversible.\"\n\nThey also declared that the Nato package \"constitutes a bridge\" to joining.", "source": {"uri": "khaleejtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khaleej times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@khaleejtimes.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type":

Trump, he said, was \"on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide\".\n\nHe added that the issue was \"a moral question about the future of our country\".\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Nancy Pelosi signalled her uncertainty about Mr Biden's future, when asked \"does he have your support?\" in a TV interview.\n\n\"I want him to do whatever he decides to do,\" Ms Pelosi told MSNBC's Morning Joe programme. \"And that is the way it is. Whatever he decides to go with.\"\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he's going to run. We are all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short.\n\n\"I said to everyone - let's just hold off. Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week. But I am very proud of the president.\"\n\nThe president had stated his commitment to staying in the race on the same show on Monday, and wrote to congressional Democrats on the same day to say he was \"firmly committed to staying in this race\".\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Biden gave brief but vociferous remarks to open the Nato summit in Washington, declaring the alliance to be \"more powerful than ever\". He struck a markedly clearer tone compared with his debate performance.\n\nOther Democrats have emphasised the importance of party solidarity. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World Tonight programme, Hank Johnson, a congressman from Georgia, said it was time to \"break the circular firing squad\" around Mr Biden.\n\nMr Johnson, a member of the influential Congressional Black Caucus, admitted that Mr Biden had had a \"horrible\" debate but said the overwhelming majority of voters of colour wanted him as their candidate.\n\nThe caucus of about 60 politicians reportedly backed the president during a call on Monday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, meanwhile, stated \"I'm with Joe\" on Tuesday. Others touted Mr Biden's record in the White House or spoke of Democratic unity.\n\nOn the same day, however, a seventh Democrat in the House of Representatives - Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey - publicly called on Mr Biden to withdraw, saying that the stakes were \"too high\".\n\nShe joined others in Congress that include Adam Smith, who told the BBC earlier this week that the party needed to install a \"stronger messenger\" as its candidate.\n\nTwo other senators are reported by CNN to believe that Mr Biden cannot win the White House again, although neither has publicly broken ranks.\n\nMeanwhile George Stephanopoulos, a former Democratic operative turned ABC News presenter who interviewed Mr Biden last week, said he does not think the president \"can serve four more years\".\n\nThe audio was captured by TMZ. Mr Stephanopoulos did not rescind the comment, he later acknowledged he should not have made it.\n\nMr Biden reportedly also faces doubts from diplomats visiting Washington for the Nato meeting, one of whom anonymously told Reuters they could not see him staying in post for another four years.\n\nSpeculation continues to grow over who would replace Mr Biden, with Vice-President Kamala Harris the favourite.\n\nShe has remained loyal to her running mate, insisting during a rally this week that he was a \"fighter\".\n\nMr Biden himself has dared his doubters to either challenge him or unite behind his candidacy, although he has admitted he \"screwed up\" in the Trump debate.\n\nTrump has suggested Ms Harris would be a \"better\" competitor but said he expected his adversary to stay in the race.\n\nIf you have any stories or news that you would like to share with the global online community, please feel free to share it with us by contacting us directly at [email protected]",

Mr Blinken told the summit the jets will be in use \"this summer\".\n\nNato members agreed to set up a new unit to coordinate military aid and training for the Ukrainian army as part of measures designed to deepen ties between the alliance and Ukraine.\n\nThe joint statement said these measures, combined with aid commitments from individual members, \"constitute a bridge to Ukraine's membership in Nato\".\n\nIt said Ukraine had made \"concrete progress\" on \"required democratic, economic, and security reforms\" in recent months - but that a formal membership invitation would only be extended when \"conditions are met\".\n\n\"As Ukraine continues this vital work, we will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including Nato membership,\" the statement added.\n\nIt also accused China of being a \"decisive enabler\" for Russia's war against Ukraine, prompting an angry response from Beijing's mission to the EU, which called on Nato to \"stop hyping up the so-called China threat, and provoking confrontation and rivalry\".\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was invited to the Nato summit and had meetings with world leaders, including his first with Sir Keir Starmer since he became prime minister of the United Kingdom.\n\nSir Keir told Mr Zelensky there would be \"no change in support\" for Ukraine's war effort despite there being a new government in London.\n\nMr Zelensky also met US politicians from both the Democrat and Republican parties, a move designed to shore up cross-party support for Ukraine after a stand-off in Congress earlier this year saw a large military aid package delayed for several months.\n\nNato leaders had hoped this week's summit would provide an opportunity to present a united front on Ukraine after modest Russian gains on the battlefield in recent months.\n\nHowever, there may be some disappointment in Kyiv that there was no clear public indication on how long it would be until Ukraine is offered full membership.\n\nThe summit - which marked the 75-year anniversary of the alliance's foundation - came months ahead of an election which could see Donald Trump, a Nato critic, return to the White House, and amid political troubles for US President Joe Biden.\n\nAs Mr Biden, 81, met other Nato leaders on Wednesday, some influential Democrats publicly called for him to quit the race over fears he is too old to perform against Mr Trump, 78, in what is likely to be a closely fought campaign.\n\nResponding to a question from the BBC, Mr Stoltenberg refused to be drawn on whether the US's domestic politics could impact the alliance.\n\nHe said: \"Nato is the most successful alliance in history because we have been able to stay out of domestic political debates.\n\n\"It's important for me to continue to do what I can to ensure that that continues to be the case.\"\n\nMr Biden used the summit to reaffirm his support for Ukraine and call for more defence investment from other members which have lagged behind on spending.\n\nHe said Russia is on a \"wartime footing\" in terms of defence production with support from Russia, North Korea and Iran - and leaders \"cannot allow the alliance to fall behind\".\n\n\"We can and will defend every inch of Nato territory\", the president added.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType":

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World Tonight programme, Hank Johnson, a congressman from Georgia, said it was time to \"break the circular firing squad\" around Mr Biden.\n\nMr Johnson is a member of the influential Congressional Black Caucus. While admitting Mr Biden had a \"horrible\" debate with Trump, he said the overwhelming majority of voters of colour wanted him as their candidate.\n\nThe caucus - a group of about 60 lawmakers - reportedly backed the president during a call on Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Biden gave brief but vociferous remarks to open the Nato summit, declaring the alliance to be \"more powerful than ever\". Observers said he struck a markedly different tone to his fumbling performance in the 27 June debate.\n\nElsewhere in Washington, congressional Democrats emerged from their private talks. Some chose to speak to reporters, touting Mr Biden's record in the White House or speaking of Democratic unity.\n\nBut the same day, a seventh House Democrat - Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey - publicly called on Mr Biden not to run for re-election, saying the stakes were \"too high\".\n\nShe joined other dissenting voices in Congress that include Adam Smith, who told the BBC earlier this week that the party needed to install a \"stronger messenger\" as its candidate.\n\nIn his comments to CNN, Mr Bennet said the question of whether to carry on in the race was \"something for the president to consider\". But he said Trump was \"on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide\".\n\nThe Colorado Democrat framed the issue as \"a moral question about the future of our country\".\n\nTwo other senators are reported by CNN to believe that Mr Biden cannot win the White House again, although neither has publicly broken ranks.\n\nMr Biden reportedly also faces doubts from diplomats visiting Washington for the Nato meeting, one of whom anonymously told Reuters they could not see him staying in post for another four years.\n\nAs the debate lingers - and the White House faces questions about its approach to disclosing information about Mr Biden's health - speculation continues to grow over who would replace Mr Biden if he chose to step down.\n\nVice-President Kamala Harris is earning some high-profile backers, despite her ongoing vocal support for the president. During a rally in Las Vegas on Tuesday, Ms Harris insisted her boss was a \"fighter\".\n\nMr Biden himself has dared his doubters to either challenge him or unite behind his candidacy, although he has admitted he \"screwed up\" in the Trump debate.\n\nHis performance in the head-to-head has been ridiculed by his rival, who has suggested Ms Harris would be a \"better\" competitor for the White House.\n\nBut in his latest comments on the matter, Trump said he expected his adversary to stay in the race: \"He's got an ego, and he doesn't want to quit.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

Mr Blinken told the summit the jets will be in use \"this summer\".\n\nNato members agreed to set up a new unit to coordinate military aid and training for the Ukrainian army as part of measures designed to deepen ties between the alliance and Ukraine.\n\nThe joint statement said these measures, combined with aid commitments from individual members, \"constitute a bridge to Ukraine's membership in Nato\".\n\nIt said Ukraine had made \"concrete progress\" on \"required democratic, economic, and security reforms\" in recent months - but that a formal membership invitation would only be extended when \"conditions are met\".\n\n\"As Ukraine continues this vital work, we will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including Nato membership,\" the statement added.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was invited to the summit and had meetings with world leaders, including his first with Sir Keir Starmer since he became prime minister of the United Kingdom.\n\nSir Keir told Mr Zelensky there would be \"no change in support\" for Ukraine's war effort despite there being a new government in London.\n\nMr Zelensky also met US politicians from both the Democrat and Republican parties, a move designed to shore up cross-party support for Ukraine after a stand-off in Congress earlier this year saw a large military aid package delayed for several months.\n\nNato leaders had hoped this week's summit would provide an opportunity to present a united front on Ukraine after modest Russian gains on the battlefield in recent months.\n\nHowever, there may be some disappointment in Kyiv that there was no clear public indication on how long it would be until Ukraine is offered full membership.\n\nThe summit - which marked the 75-year anniversary of the alliance's foundation - came months ahead of an election which could see Donald Trump, a Nato critic, return to the White House, and amid political troubles for US President Joe Biden.\n\nAs Mr Biden, 81, met other Nato leaders on Wednesday, some influential Democrats publicly called for him to quit the race over fears he is too old to perform against Mr Trump, 78, in what is likely to be a closely fought campaign.\n\nResponding to a question from the BBC, Mr Stoltenberg refused to be drawn on whether the US's domestic politics could impact the alliance.\n\nHe said: \"Nato is the most successful alliance in history because we have been able to stay out of domestic political debates.\n\n\"It's important for me to continue to do what I can to ensure that that continues to be the case.\"\n\nMr Biden used the summit to reaffirm his support for Ukraine and call for more defence investment from other members which have lagged behind on spending.\n\nHe said Russia is on a \"wartime footing\" in terms of defence production with support from Russia, North Korea and Iran - and leaders \"cannot allow the alliance to fall behind\".\n\n\"We can and will defend every inch of Nato territory\", the president added.", "source": {"uri": "voiceofvienna.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "voiceofvienna.org"}, "authors": [],

And of course, we've got to be incredibly careful.\n\n\"But what's most important is that in concert with our Nato allies, we work together to make sure that President Zelensky and Ukraine have got the material support they need to defend themselves against Russia.\n\n\"It is an illegal invasion, the consequences of which are massive for the whole world.\"\n\nMr Jarvis told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The deployment of those weapons systems ultimately will be a matter for the Ukrainian government but our strong guiding principle with all of these things is that it is incredibly important that the legal framework that governs conflict is followed.\"\n\nSpeaking to ITV's Good Morning Britain, he said: \"We should be under no illusion that our own national security is at stake here.\"\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir, who met Mr Zelensky at the margins of the Nato summit on Wednesday, is expected to tell members of the alliance that they need to send a \"clear message\" to Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\n\nBritain has also confirmed it will contribute \u00a340 million to Nato's comprehensive assistance package for Ukraine and the UK-administered international fund for Kyiv will place a new order, worth \u00a3300 million, for 120,000 rounds of 152mm Soviet-era ammunition.\n\nFollowing his meeting with Sir Keir, Mr Zelensky said in a post on X, formerly Twitter: \"This morning, I learned about the permission to use Storm Shadow missiles against military targets in Russian territory.\n\n\"Today, we had the opportunity to discuss the practical implementation of this decision. I'm grateful to the UK for its unwavering support for Ukraine and our people.\"\n\nThe summit is expected to cement Ukraine's progress towards Nato membership.\n\nBut because of Nato's Article V, which commits to mutual defence, the allies will not allow Ukraine to join while it is still at war as that would trigger an immediate conflict with Russia.\n\nNato allies are stepping up commitments on Ukraine while they await the results of November's US presidential election, where Donald Trump has threatened to reduce American support.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nClooney said that Biden would lose the presidential election, and Democrats would also lose both chambers of Congress.\n\nBiden has insisted that he is committed to running in November, and with the Democratic party primary votes under his belt there is no real way of forcing him out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is widely seen to be the frontrunner to replace Biden if he steps aside, but any move would have to be before the Democratic convention in Chicago in August.\n\nZelenskyy to take centre stage\n\nMeanwhile, Nato leaders will today hold talks with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and turn their attention to the challenge from China at a meeting with Asian partners, as they wrap up a three-day summit in Washington.\n\nZelenskyy will join his Nato counterparts after getting promises of new weaponry to bolster the defence of the skies over Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meets with Speaker of the US House of Representatives Mike Johnson in the Capitol Building in Washington DC yesterday. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo\n\nBut he has called on Kyiv's backers, especially the United States, to go further - including by giving his outgunned forces greater scope to strike inside Russia.\n\n\"Imagine how much we can achieve when all limitations are lifted,\" Zelensky said on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nNato's leaders once again yesterday demurred from issuing his war-torn country a clear invitation to join their alliance.\n\nZelenskyy unleashed a diplomatic firestorm at a summit in Lithuania last year by lambasting Nato's reluctance on membership.\n\nIn a bid to soften any disappointment this time around, Nato leaders called Ukraine's path to membership \"irreversible.\"\n\nThey also pledged to provide Kyiv a minimum of \u20ac40 billion in military support \"within the next year.\"\n\nChina 'enabling' Russia\n\nAhead of the sit-down with Zelenskyy, Nato will switch its focus to the growing challenge from China as it welcomes the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nNato leaders have expressed their \"profound concern\" about the deepening ties between Beijing and Moscow.\n\nA declaration from the summit released yesterday called China a \"decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine\" through its supplies of dual-use goods such as microchips that can help Moscow's military.\n\nBeijing has already angrily rejected the accusations from Nato and says the US-led alliance is seeking an excuse to expand its influence eastwards.\n\nThe United States has been pushing its European allies for years to pay closer attention to the threats posed by China.\n\nThe summit in Washington will be the third such gathering attended by leaders from the four Asia-Pacific partners.\n\nSeveral initiatives including bolstering cooperation against cyberattacks and disinformation with the partner countries are expected to be announced.\n\nBut the Pacific leaders' presence is more about signalling Nato's greater interest in the region at a time of growing competition between Washington with Beijing.\n\nWorried by the potential return of Donald Trump to the White House after November elections, European allies see increasing their focus on China as a way of keeping the United States engaged.\n\n\"I think the message sent from Nato, from this summit, is very strong and very clear, and we are clearly defining China's responsibility when it comes to enabling Russia's war,\" Nato's outgoing secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said.\n\n- \u00a9 AFP 2024", "source": {"uri": "thejournal.ie", "dataType": "news",

NATO leaders are meeting in Washington this week to discuss future strategies and commitments, and to mark the 75th anniversary of the alliance's founding. Agence France-Presse\n\nWASHINGTON -- Nato countries at their summit in Washington on Wednesday came up with what alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg called a \"substantial package\" of support for Ukraine.\n\nBut what exactly is Nato offering the war-torn country two and half years into Russia's invasion?\n\n'Trump-proofing' arms supplies\n\nNato will take a greater role from the United States in coordinating training and weapons deliveries for Ukraine by setting up a centralized command.\n\nREAD: NATO boosts Ukraine air defenses as doubts over Biden cloud summit\n\nThe move is aimed at shielding supplies to Kyiv from a potential return to the White House by Donald Trump after November's presidential election.\n\nThe change will see hundreds of personnel from different Nato members stationed at a base in Germany, and key hubs along the alliance's eastern flank.\n\nThe switch is quite modest -- and a three-star US General looks likely to take the lead.\n\nBut its an important step for an alliance that has so far steered clear of having a direct role in arming Ukraine for fears it would drag NATO closer to war with Russia.\n\n40-billion-euro pledge\n\nNato countries have pledged to maintain support for Ukraine for a further year at the rate they have been doing since Russia invaded -- a minimum of 40 billion euros ($43 billion).\n\nREAD: Nato turns 75 with Ukraine and future on line\n\n\"Through proportional contributions, allies intend to provide a minimum baseline funding of 40 billion euros within the next year, and to provide sustainable levels of security assistance for Ukraine to prevail,\" a summit declaration said.\n\nThe political promise is designed to put aid on a firmer footing -- but it is not legally binding and could be ignored by future leaders.\n\nInitially, Stoltenberg had hoped to get allies to make it a multi-year commitment but the US demanded a review next year.\n\n'Irreversible path' to membership\n\nNato didn't give Ukraine what it really wants: a clear invite to join the alliance in the near future.\n\nInstead leaders reaffirmed the commitment that Kyiv will one day become a member \"when allies agree and conditions are met.\"\n\nTo offer Ukraine some encouragement, leaders did agree to say that Kyiv's path to membership is \"irreversible.\"\n\nThey also declared that the Nato package \"constitutes a bridge\" to joining.\n\nAir defenses\n\nMore concretely, US President Joe Biden announced a major package of advanced air defenses to help Kyiv repel Russia's attacks.\n\nMuch of it was already known -- including Germany and Romania sending a Patriot battery each, Netherlands providing parts for one and Italy giving a similar system.\n\nOn top of that the United States will now add one more Patriot system of its own.\n\nThe commitments still see Nato falling short of giving Ukraine the seven Patriot systems that it has been desperately pleading for since April.\n\nBiden and other leaders said they would provide Ukraine dozens of shorter-range systems in the coming months.\n\nFighter jets\n\nThe US, Netherlands and Denmark announced that the long-promised transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine was \"now underway\" and they would be operational in the skies this summer.\n\nDenmark and the Netherlands had already said they were aiming to get the aircraft to Kyiv in the near future.\n\nIn total, Nato allies have promised to deliver dozens of F-16 jets to Kyiv in the coming years.\n\nThat is still well short of the roughly 120 that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says his country needs.", "source": {"uri": "globalnation.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@globalnation.inquirer.net", "name": "Agence France-Presse",

The White House followed up by saying that Denmark and the Netherlands had begun sending F-16 jets to Ukraine.\n\nNorwegian premier Jonas Gahr Store said at the Nato summit that Norway will begin delivering six F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine later this year.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said the F-16 transfer \"concentrates Vladimir Putin's mind on the fact that he will not outlast Ukraine, he will not outlast us and, if he persists, the damage that will continue to be done to Russia and its interests will only deepen\".\n\n\"The quickest way to get to peace is through a strong Ukraine,\" Blinken said.\n\nBiden said in a speech on Tuesday that Nato was \"stronger than it's ever been\" and that Ukraine can and will stop Russian President Vladimir Putin \"with our full, collective support\".\n\nHowever, November's US presidential election could presage a sharp change in Washington's support for Ukraine and Nato. Republican candidate Donald Trump, 78, has questioned the amount of aid given to Ukraine to fight Russia's invasion, and US support for allies generally.\n\nBiden, 81, has faced questions about his fitness for office after fumbling a June 27 debate and hopes the Nato spotlight will help him stage a comeback of sorts, surrounded by allied leaders he has spent his three years in office cultivating.\n\nUncertainty about US leadership has unsettled Nato allies.\n\n\"If there's one thing that I'm concerned about with the United States, it's the polarisation of the political climate -- it is, I have to admit, very toxic,\" Alexander Stubb, president of new Nato ally Finland, told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n\"But when I meet 15 senators, as I just did at the Senate, there's strong bipartisan support for Ukraine and also for Nato.\"\n\nWhile Biden has been seeking to rally allies and domestic support, several high-ranking European officials met a top foreign policy adviser to Trump during the summit.", "source": {"uri": "dawn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dawn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score":

As Russia's war in Ukraine grinds on, China, Iran and North Korea continue to provide support to Moscow drawing the autocratic governments of these four countries ever closer.\n\nIn short, the threats Nato faces in Europe and Asia are now inextricably linked, making for a potential reshaping of the geopolitical and security landscape not seen in decades.\n\nTroubling as this is for Nato leaders, there is then the question of the alliance's internal wrangling.\n\nThis is compounded by the prospect of a US presidential election in November that could well see Donald Trump back heading up the alliance's most powerful member - the US. Leaders of Nato's European members will be acutely aware of what happened the last time Trump was in the White House.\n\nBut if Trump was right about one thing when last in office, it was that Nato's members needed to up their financial commitment to meet that figure of 2% of GDP on defence, before bolstering it to 2.5%.\n\nNow, as Keir Starmer makes his first international trip since winning power, he will be under pressure to confirm a timetable for the UK to boost defence spending to meet that figure.\n\nIt's all very well for Starmer to give assurances of Britain's \"cast-iron\" commitment to Nato, but as every political leader knows, saying things and making them happen are often two very different things.\n\nI mentioned earlier that more often than not there are two conflicting takes on the value of Nato membership. Personally, I fall into the former, believing as I do that in our increasingly dangerous world the need for such an alliance is paramount.\n\nThose who argue that the very presence of Nato itself only adds to that danger are entitled to such view, but I'm forever curious as to what they would suggest as an alternative security apparatus when confronted by the ambitions of the likes of Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un.\n\nThough China is often presented as part of that threat to Nato, it's curious that when Putin had a recent get-together with Kim last month to sign a mutual defence assistance deal, even Beijing was said to be rather twitchy. China's fear is that the North Korean leader will be less beholden to them and might become even more of a loose cannon in an already tense region.\n\nMy point here is that such is the dangerous state of flux in which the global geopolitical and security landscape finds itself that it would be folly to think that by turning our back on Nato that somehow clear and present threats would simply disappear.\n\nIt's precisely that kind of naive thinking that autocrats and dictators sit in readiness to exploit whenever they can.\n\nThis is not to say that Nato is some kind of knight in shining armour ready to stand fast for all its members, even if Article 5 of the alliance pact calls for whatever means necessary to assist an ally.\n\nAs any thinking person knows, politics are full of double standards and geopolitics and security are no different.\n\nSometimes though rather than just chucking arms at a situation as is the case in Ukraine, it's equally important never to lose sight of diplomatic or other alternatives to bring pressure on Putin's regime.\n\nA case in point was a report yesterday in the Financial Times that revealed how the type of Russian cruise missile that destroyed a Kyiv children's hospital this week relied on Western-designed components that the Kremlin has managed to procure by evading Western sanctions.\n\nWhile sanctions have cut off Russia from some advanced components like those needed for its KH-101 missiles, the Kremlin is able to buy these microprocessors and other parts made primarily for civilian use on the open market and import them via China.\n\nIn other words, while Nato continues to provide Ukraine with more weaponry to defend itself, a lot more could still be done here in the West to plug such loopholes and prevent Russia bypassing sanctions.\n\nWhile it would be naive to imagine that closing down such gaps would totally disable Russia's missile attacks, surely such approaches should be exhausted before always resorting to more arms, or at least work in tandem.\n\nBut going back to Nato, how interesting it is that just ahead of this week's 75th annual summit a major multi-country survey by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) made for some curious findings.\n\nIt showed that there was sustained public support for the delivery of weapons and ammunition to Ukraine but also divisions on how the war will end - and the purpose of European aid.\n\nIt showed too that Nato leaders are unlikely to find domestic backing for troop deployments or increases in defence spending to assist the war effort with 66% of people in the UK opposed to the idea of sending troops to fight in Ukraine.\n\nSome 36% also reject the proposition that defence spending should be \"increased\" at the expense of key areas, like health, education, and crime prevention.\n\nThis stands in contrast to the survey's finding that almost two and half years into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a majority of Ukrainians 58%, believe they can secure a battlefield victory, and that confidence in Ukraine's armed forces and the country's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, remains high.\n\nPut in a nutshell - as the report's authors conclude - this means that \"looming divergences of opinion between European and Ukrainian publics could make finding agreement on how the war should end extremely challenging and have significant impacts on Kyiv's pathway to Nato and EU accession.\"\n\nAnd so it's against this backdrop that Mr Starmer goes to Washington and finds himself in at the deep end.

At the same time the alliance is pondering how to proceed in the face of \"the most dangerous security situation since the Cold War\". The commentaries in Europe's opinion sections range from historical tributes to reflections on Ukraine and its prospects for NATO membership.\n\n\"The Russian attack on Ukraine has destroyed any illusion that the world had changed for the better since the fall of the Berlin Wall, that Russia is now a partner that the West needn't fear and that Nato is no longer needed. Moscow is now seen as the biggest of all threats, not as the capital of the communist bloc but as the capital of a country that attacks neighbouring sovereign states and believes it can conquer them quickly owing to its superiority. ... This is why Nato is also forging partnerships outside the Euro-Atlantic area with countries that share democratic and liberal laws, such as Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea.\"\n\nDefinitely not brain-dead\n\nThe alliance is still going strong at 75, the Financial Times notes:\n\n\"Having been diagnosed 'brain-dead' in 2019 by no less an eminence than the president of France, Nato is now wider, in that Sweden and Finland have joined, and deeper, in that member states are spending more on defence. Some are even mulling the revival of conscription. Whatever is missing from the alliance that convenes in Washington this week - a vigorous US president, for example - it isn't a raison d'\u00eatre. The Kremlin has seen to that.\"\n\nA \"bridge\" instead of accession for Ukraine\n\nUkrainska Pravda can't hide a certain sense of disappointment:\n\n\"In order to reaffirm Ukraine's readiness to become part of the alliance while avoiding the word 'invitation', which is a red line for Joe Biden personally, the US State Department proposed announcing something called a 'bridge to Nato'. ... So the final declaration of the North Atlantic Council will include a clause stating that the Alliance's policy towards Ukraine will create a 'bridge to membership' that is to eventually lead to our country joining the alliance. And this will be 'sold' at the summit as a success for Ukraine.\"\n\n\"Ukraine's path towards Nato membership is 'irreversible'. ... The final communiqu\u00e9 of the Nato summit is expected to confirm these words by outgoing Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. ... This represents a clear turning point and is a response to Vladimir Putin's increasingly desperate gestures, such as the bombing of a children's hospital. A turning point, especially in comparison to the Vilnius summit last year, when Nato made no effort to chart out a clear path for Ukraine's accession.\"\n\nPutin already rubbing his hands with glee\n\nLe Soir voices concern about political developments on both sides of the Atlantic:\n\n\"In the current toxic climate, Nato will be trying to secure its position and 'institutionalise' its support for Ukraine. But against this backdrop, the more or less pro-Russian sovereigntist and extremist movements are causing concern among Kyiv's steadfast supporters. A victory for Donald Trump on 5 November could drive a serious wedge into the European unity which our Ukrainian neighbours have so far been shown in the face of the Russian aggressor. Putin is already rubbing his hands with glee.\"", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KyivPost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

At the same time, they watched his every move for another gaffe that would further undermine his electoral hopes.\n\n\"I saw yesterday a strong president,\" Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said after the speech. \"He's the president, he's the man we do business with.\"\n\nOrban's meeting with Trump, less than a week after he sat down with Putin in Moscow, is likely to fan concerns that the Hungarian leader is working as an intermediary between the two men.\n\nThe former president has said he believes he could convince Putin to end his war in Ukraine and release Americans detained in Russia if he were elected to a second term.\n\nTrump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has not asked the Hungarian leader to lay the groundwork for some sort of Ukraine-Russia peace deal, according to one of the people familiar with the Orban visit, who was granted anonymity to discuss it. The person described the visit, days before the Republican National Convention, as more of an informal get-together.\n\nOrban, who took over the European Union's rotating presidency on July 1, also met with President Xi Jinping in China this week and his diplomatic initiatives have provoked anger elsewhere in Europe, where officials say he is going way beyond his remit.\n\n\"We know that we are a small country, so we try to play above our weight,\" Balazs Orban, the Hungarian premier's political director, told Bloomberg Wednesday in Washington. \"Hungary is now the only country which can talk to everybody at such short notice. We are involved and I think it's a value whether we like it or not.\"\n\nGrowing doubts\n\nWith polls showing Trump has a sizeable lead over Biden, allied doubts about his prospects are growing, according to officials and diplomats. All eyes are on whether Biden can get through a press conference set for Thursday without a major gaffe, they said.\n\nAt Tuesday's ceremony, some said they watched nervously as Biden hung a medal around the neck of outgoing Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, fearing that the US leader might slip.\n\nOne official warned that the focus on Biden distracted from the summit's key goal of ensuring continued support for Ukraine. The allied diplomats and officials asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive matters about another Nato leader.\n\nBiden faced new calls on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to step aside. Even actor George Clooney went public with an opinion piece Wednesday calling on him not to run. It was an irony of sorts: after a summit in Italy last month, Biden said goodbye to many of the same leaders and joined a California fundraiser hosted by Clooney instead of attending a Ukraine peace summit.\n\nProspects of a change\n\nMany Nato and European Union nations have asked for meetings with officials who served under Trump, as well as with prominent Republican legislators seen to be close to him, according to people familiar with the planning.\n\nAmong the targets were former US ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, former US Trade Representative Bob Lighthizer, former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, former National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien, and former acting National Security Adviser Keith Kellogg, the people said, requesting anonymity to discuss the conversations.\n\nDiplomats assume that these officials, along with former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, would serve in the next Trump administration. The allied officials are also reaching out to members of Congress who have Trump's ear on foreign policy, including Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio and Mike Lee, among others, the people said. Many countries are also sending ambassadors to the GOP convention in July to try to make contact with future Trump administration officials, they said.\n\nHristjian Mickoski, the prime minister of North Macedonia, had dinner with Grenell, saying on social media the discussion was \"fruitful and friendly.\"\n\nEuropean officials tried to be sanguine about the prospects of a change of US administration, calling it a normal part of the democratic process. Other leaders touted increased defence spending, something Trump has long demanded. And others seemed to tailor their remarks in language that Trump might understand, as when Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur compared Nato to a golf club.\n\n\"When you pay your fee in the golf club, you can play,\" Pevkur said at an event Monday. \"It doesn't matter how big is your wallet.\"\n\nEven Ukrainian Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Nato allies to act quickly to help his country repel Russia's attacks instead of waiting for the election results in November. \"Don't wait months -- America can be great every day,\" he said in a riff on Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan.\n\n'Trump-proofing'\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to pull out of Nato and expressed admiration for Putin. His advisers have floated the idea of a two-tiered alliance in which the common defence commitments would only apply to countries that have met defende spending targets.\n\nOne European official said talk of \"Trump-proofing\" Nato and support for Ukraine would be counterproductive. Latvian Foreign Minister Baiba Braze also sought to play down concerns, telling Bloomberg Television in an interview that her country \"worked very well with Trump administration before.\"\n\nNato has been working to ensure that allies' weapons deliveries to Ukraine are insulated from political change in Washington. Part of the Ukraine package leaders will sign off this week will include a greater role for Nato to coordinate the deliveries and allies' training initiatives.\n\n\"It's actually in Europe's interest to 'America-proof' their defence and to start operating on the assumption that the United States has other, more urgent national security priorities, and domestic ones as well,\" said Dan Caldwell, a policy adviser at the think-tank Defensce Priorities who worked in the former Trump administration. He said he wasn't speaking for the campaign.\n\n\"We recognice that even though the United States is the most powerful country in the world, our power is still limited and must be used judiciously,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GULF NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Orb\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score":

Though its rival alliance, the Warsaw Pact, was dissolved at the end of the Cold War, Nato continued to expand, particularly eastward, and today it has 32 permanent members and maintains partnerships with the African Union and states in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nAs Nato grows, so too does its military budget, which according to SIPRI hit a record high of $1.341 trillion [\u20ac1.2 trillion], accounting for 55 percent of global military expenditure in 2023.\n\nNato spending is governed by its defence investment guideline - a political agreement and not a legal obligation, which stipulates that members must commit two percent of their GDP to \"help ensure the Alliance's continued military readiness\".\n\nSince Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Nato has called on all members to increase spending to meet this two-percent target -- even though the Alliance's budget and its military capability are already vastly superior to that of any potential aggressor or rival.\n\nIn advance of the 2024 summit an exuberant Stoltenberg, sitting alongside US president Joe Biden, announced that a record 23 of Nato 32 members had hit the two-percent target, which he clarified is no longer \"the ceiling, but the floor\".\n\nAligning a state's military budget with a percentage of its GDP says precisely nothing about that state's military capability. It is an entirely arbitrary figure established by a purely economic criterion. For example, landlocked Luxembourg with a population of just over 672,000 could invest two percent of its GDP in submarines, though it would have no use for them, and the Nato target would have been met.\n\nThough the two-percent rule is devoid of any rationale or logic beyond boosting militarism and fuelling war, non-Nato members are now also beginning to apply this standard, establishing an unofficial global norm for military spending.\n\nAt least one-fifth (20 percent) of the 'two-percent floor' must be invested in major equipment and associated R&D. In other words, hundreds of billions of taxpayer money should be directly invested in highly lucrative private arms companies to produce weapons of war.\n\nAccording to Nato 2024 spending report, all but two members (Belgium and Canada) fell short of the 20 percent target, with Albania, Finland, Hungary, Luxembourg and Poland spending over 40 percent of their military budgets on equipment and R&D.\n\nApplying the '20 percent of two percent' rule to SIPRI's 2023 figure of $1.341 trillion would see arms companies cashing into the tune of $268bn, though considering that at least five Nato members are already spending over twice this amount on equipment and R&D, this sum is likely much higher.\n\nBy comparison, the UN's Department of Peacekeeping Operations has an annual budget of a mere $6bn to oversee its global operations indicating that states have relegated peace-keeping, diplomacy and multilateralism to the dustbin and are hellbent on pursuing a hawkish war agenda instead.\n\nStill not content with current spending levels however, Stoltenberg announced that Nato would be rolling out a new defence industrial pledge during this summit with a \"better outlook for the arms industry\" meaning more spending on bigger contracts for longer-term investments. In short -- more war.\n\nHe lauded Nato's trans-Atlantic F-35 collaboration as a Nato success story though he failed to mention that these fighter jets are being used by Israel in its genocidal war on Gaza, where UN experts have repeatedly called on states to impose an arms embargo.\n\nBetween banter about baseball, US secretary of state Anthony Blinken said at the summit that Nato is stronger, larger, more fit for purpose, and ready to deal with the challenges of our time.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges however is global warming, which is worsened by war with 5.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions being produced by the military.\n\nNew research from the Transnational Institute, Stop Wapenhandel and others found that Nato's overall military spending last year produced an estimated 233 million metric tonnes of CO2, more than Colombia or Qatar's entire annual greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nNato is a war alliance. Far from promoting peace and stability as it claims, it is the single most destructive alliance in history having participated in several wars over previous decades resulting in millions of deaths and driving unprecedented levels of forced displacement and devastation.\n\nIf world leaders were truly interested in addressing the challenges of our time then dissolving Nato should be number one on their list of priorities.", "source": {"uri": "euobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EU Observer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget", "type":

The event assumes added significance because this is the 75th anniversary of Nato\n\nFounded on 4 April 1949, Nato is a military and political alliance that emerged after the end of World War II. It had twelve founding members, ten from Europe and two from North America.\n\nToday, that number has swelled to thirty-two. Given that the two North American members, the US and Canada remain constant, Nato has added twenty more members from Europe. An expanding Nato, as some would put it, encircling the wounded Russian bear?\n\nThat, in a nutshell, leads directly to the biggest challenge facing Nato in decades, which is also expected to be the focal point of the 2024 summit. The ongoing war in Ukraine. Nato, naturally, is expected to take a strong position condemning Russia and supporting Ukraine during the summit.\n\nThe costly war in Ukraine has been a source of global tension, with far-reaching implications for international security and economic stability.\n\nRead more by Prof Makarand R. Paranjape Insights from a yoga retreat in Greenville NEET exam scandal shakes India's education system India: Call for reform amid Karunapuram's heart-wrenching loss Calling for dialogue\n\nThe conflict has drawn sharp lines between Russia and the West, with sanctions and counter-sanctions affecting economies worldwide. India's position on the war has been one of cautious neutrality, calling for dialogue and a peaceful resolution whilst abstaining from condemning Russia's actions outright.\n\nInformed sources indicate that Nato is likely to extend membership to Ukraine.\n\nAs major international leaders from member countries, along with thousands of support staff and the press descend on DC, the summit will also turn the spotlight on President Joe Biden's leadership during a crucial election year.\n\nDespite all the coaching and propping, Biden has been captured in dozens of videos somewhat disoriented and incoherent. Not quite at his best, to put it bluntly.\n\nThe American public and the world will be watching carefully if he -- and the United States -- can still lead the free world. His challenger, former President Donald Trump, on the other hand, has seldom concealed his disappointment with Nato\n\nAs the world's eyes turn to the Nato summit in Washington, D.C., another significant political manoeuvre is also unfolding simultaneously. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on an official visit to Russia for a summit meeting with President Vladimir Putin.\n\nModi doctrine\n\nThis concurrence can hardly be scheduling coincidence. Rather, it represents a profound assertion of India's emerging role as a pivotal player in international politics.\n\nIndia, traditionally non-aligned, finds itself in a unique position. It is a nation that has fostered strong ties with both Russia and the West. Modi's visit to Russia, particularly at a time when the Nato summit is addressing pressing global security concerns, including Russia's actions in Ukraine, is indicative of India's balancing power dynamics under what has been termed the \"Modi doctrine\" in its foreign policy.\n\nThe West has reacted cautiously to Modi's Russia visit, calling India an important friend and ally.\n\nIndia's relationship with Russia has historical roots that date back to the Cold War era. Despite the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the camaraderie has persisted, with India being a significant consumer of Russian military hardware and an ally in international forums.\n\nIndia has also benefited by cheap Russian oil after the West's embargo. But India's relations with Western nations, especially the United States, have also strengthened over the years, with shared democratic values and mutual concerns about a rising China in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe silver lining in India's gambit is that it might serve as a golden opportunity for Modi as global peacemaker.\n\nIf he can leverage his country's long-standing relationship with Russia and its growing clout with the West to try to mediate a resolution to the conflict in Ukraine, it would be a great diplomatic victory.\n\nMakarand R.

Sweden became a member in March 2024.\n\nBoth had applied to join in May 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, having been neutral for decades.\n\nUkraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Georgia also hope to join Nato.\n\nRussia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine joining Nato, fearing it would bring the alliance's forces too close to its borders.\n\nHowever, in 2008, Nato said that Ukraine could eventually join.\n\nAfter Russia's invasion in 2022, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky asked for his country to be admitted as soon as possible.\n\nOutgoing Nato secretary-general Mr Stoltenberg previously said it was \"inevitable\" that Ukraine would become a member, but not until its war with Russia ends.\n\nSince July 2023, the US-led Ukraine Defense Contact Group has been co-ordinating efforts to give Ukraine weapons and training to defend itself against Russia.\n\nNato is proposing to take over that role by creating a $100bn (\u00a377.3bn) fund to support Ukraine over the next five years.\n\nAlthough the Washington summit did not agree a formal timeline for Ukraine to join the alliance, member countries restated their \"unwavering\" backing for the country.\n\n\"Support to Ukraine is not charity,\" Mr Stoltenberg said. \"It is in our own security interest.\"\n\nNato said Russia's invasion of Ukraine posed the \"most significant and direct threat to allies' security\".\n\nThe body has not sent troops to Ukraine or enforced a no-fly zone over the country, for fear of being pulled into a direct conflict with Russia.\n\nHowever, individual members have supplied arms to help Ukraine defend itself.\n\nThe German research organisation the Kiel Institute says the US has allocated 50.4bn euros (\u00a342.6bn) for military support to Ukraine, while European countries - Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and the UK - have allocated 32bn euros (\u00a327bn).\n\nThe US, UK, Germany and Turkey and others have provided anti-tank weapons, missile defence systems, artillery guns, tanks and military drones. The US, UK and France have also supplied long-range missiles.\n\nSpeaking at the Washington summit, President Joe Biden said the US would partner with Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Romania to donate Patriot missile batteries and other systems to bolster Ukraine's air defences.\n\nThis follows Russian air attacks across Ukraine on 8 July which destroyed a children's hospital in Kyiv and killed 43 people across the country, according to officials.\n\nMr Zelensky has spent months pleading with his Western allies for more weapons.\n\nEarlier in 2024, supplies of US munitions dried up after a bill to give more military support to Ukraine was delayed for several months. European weapons makers were unable to fill the gap.\n\nThe US is letting two Nato countries, Denmark and the Netherlands, send US-made F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine. The first planes are expected to arrive later this summer.\n\nIn 2023, Nato commanders agreed detailed plans for countering possible Russian attacks anywhere in the Arctic and north Atlantic, central Europe, or the Mediterranean region.\n\nIt has increased the number of troops in Europe on high alert from 40,000 to more than 300,000.\n\nThe alliance has also bolstered its defences on Russia's borders with eight battlegroups.\n\nNato asks every member country to spend at least 2% of its national income on defence, and 23 of them are projected to meet that target in 2024. Only three did in 2014.\n\nThe biggest spenders (in proportion to the size of their economies) are the US and countries close to Russia, such as Poland and the Baltic Republics.\n\nNato's European members and Canada collectively increased their defence spending by an estimated 9% in 2023, and are forecast to increase it by another 18% in 2024.\n\nFormer Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak previously committed the UK to increasing its military budget to 2.5% of national income from the current 2.3%.\n\nSpeaking while travelling to the Washington summit, Sir Keir Starmer insisted the Labour government will honour that pledge.\n\nHowever, the new armed forces minister, Luke Pollard, has not said when the target will be met.\n\nWhen he was US President, Donald Trump pushed European Nato members to boost their defence spending.\n\nDuring the current presidential election campaign, Mr Trump - who is the presumptive Republican nominee - warned that if he was re-elected, he might encourage Russia to attack Nato countries which failed to spend enough.\n\nMr Stoltenberg said his suggestion \"undermines all of our security\".\n\nAt a campaign rally ahead of the summit, Mr Trump told supporters that Nato countries were now contributing \"hundreds of billions of dollars\" more because he had warned them: \"No, I will not protect you from Russia\" unless they paid more to the alliance.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5,

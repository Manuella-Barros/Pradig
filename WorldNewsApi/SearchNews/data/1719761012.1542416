{"id": 225050184, "title": "Brad Pitt, George Clooney Reunite as Dueling Fixers in &#8216;Wolfs&#8217; Trailer", "text": "Brad Pitt and George Clooney are \u201cbasically the same guy\u201d in the trailer for Wolfs, an action thriller set to hit theaters Sept. 20. The movie marks the actors\u2019 first time back onscreen together since 2008\u2019s Burn After Reading (Ocean\u2019s Thirteen arrived in 2007). In the trailer for the film, directed by Jon Watts, Clooney plays an experienced fixer called in to deal with a dead body. Everything is going according to plan until another fixer, played by Pitt, shows up. Hijinks ensue, of course, and the two lone wolves are forced to partner up in order to survive. Wolfs also stars Amy Ryan, Austin Abrams, and Poorna Jagannathan and was produced by Clooney, Pitt, and Watts alongside Grant Heslov, Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner, and Dianne McGunigle. Last year, Clooney told Deadline that there are already conversations about a Wolfs sequel. \u201cIt was a great shoot, and Jon is an extraordinarily talented guy who\u2019s also really joyful,\u201d Clooney said. \u201cHe loves what he does. We had a blast doing it and we\u2019ve seen it. It\u2019s an off the charts great film and it\u2019s fun to work with Brad again. We had a really good time.\u201d Clooney and Pitt previously appeared together in the Ocean\u2019s franchise, starting with 2001\u2019s Ocean\u2019s Eleven. They co-starred in two sequels before handing the series off to Sandra Bullock in the 2018 spin-off Ocean\u2019s 8. Last year, Clooney directed The Boys in the Boat. He is currently acting in Noah Baumbach\u2019s next film. Watts is best known as the director of Spider-Man: Homecoming, Spider-Man: Far From Home, and Spider-Man: No Way Home.", "summary": "The action thriller was directed by <em>Spider-Man</em>'s Jon Watts", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/brad-pitt-george-clooney-wolfs-trailer-1235029264/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wolfs-trailer.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:52:00", "author": "Emily Zemler", "authors": ["Emily Zemler"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.32}

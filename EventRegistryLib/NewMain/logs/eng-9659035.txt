They were pleased with the progress on carbon credit cooperation in line with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and look forward to the signing of the implementation agreement at an early date.\n\nThe two Prime Ministers emphasised the growing importance of ICT and digital technology cooperation. They jointly witnessed and applauded the official launch of the Financial Transparency Corridor initiative by the National Bank of Cambodia and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, which aims to establish supporting digital infrastructures to facilitate trade and financial access for SMEs in Cambodia and in Singapore.\n\nConcurrently, they welcomed the signing of the MoU on Cooperation in Digital Government between the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications of Cambodia and the Ministry of Communications and Information of Singapore during the visit.\n\nBoth Prime Ministers also exchanged views on major regional and international issues of common concern. They shared the view that maintaining ASEAN unity and centrality is crucial for peace, stability and prosperity in the region, and are committed to work closely together to navigate through the geopolitical complexity to ensure that ASEAN unity and centrality remains strong and ASEAN continues to stay on the path of growth.\n\nThey also highlighted the urgent need to expedite conclusion of the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea.\n\nMr Hun Manet also visited the Nanyang Polytechnic and Centre of Innovation for Electronics & Internet of Things, and the Keppel's Infrastructure@Changi building yesterday. On the first day in Singapore, the Premier visited the National Orchid Garden, where a new orchid hybrid was named \"Vanchoanthe Hun Manet\" after him.\n\nMr Hun Manet expressed deep appreciation to Wong for the cordial hospitality extended to the Cambodian delegation.

The initial batch of participating financial institutions is currently being onboarded, with the first live financing transactions set to begin in the second half of 2024.\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr Hun Manet received a ceremonial welcome at the Istana and called on President Tharman Shanmugaratnam.\n\nDuring their meeting, President Tharman and Mr Hun Manet reaffirmed the warm and longstanding ties between Singapore and Cambodia, as both countries look towards the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations next year.\n\nThey discussed strengthening cooperation in areas such as trade and investment, financial transparency, and food and water security.\n\nMr Hun Manet also met PM Wong, who then hosted an official dinner for him.\n\nIn his speech at the dinner, PM Wong welcomed growing economic ties between Singapore and Cambodia.\n\nHe pointed out that Singapore is one of Cambodia's top investors, with investments in key sectors like real estate, logistics, agribusiness and finance.\n\nEconomic cooperation between both countries has expanded to new areas like renewable energy and carbon credits, said PM Wong.\n\nHe cited examples like the conditional approval to export one gigawatt of electricity from Cambodia to Singapore, an agreement on carbon credits transfer, and a regional working group to facilitate cross-border electricity trade.\n\n\"Such bilateral and multilateral cooperation between our countries contributes to our respective energy transitions and economic goals. They also form an important component of our shared vision of an integrated Asean Power Grid, which will strengthen energy resilience and security for the region,\" said PM Wong.\n\nPM Wong said that while Cambodia and Singapore are at different stages of economic development, both countries face common challenges and share similar perspectives and interests on many issues.\n\nPM Wong said: \"We both have to navigate a more dangerous and troubled geopolitical environment. We both have a stake in making Asean a strong and robust grouping in the international arena.\n\n\"I firmly believe that our two countries can benefit tremendously from greater cooperation. Through Asean, we can also work together to maintain stability and peace in the region, and to ensure continued progress and prosperity for our countries and our peoples.\"\n\nPM Wong also added that Singapore stands ready to support Cambodia's development priorities as it puts in place a long-term socio-economic plan to become a high-income nation by 2050.\n\nMr Hun Manet said in his speech: \"Singapore has been a pivotal partner of Cambodia across various sectors, including trade, economy, infrastructure, development, and people-to-people linkages. Moving forward, we aim to deepen this partnership by exploring new avenues in human capital development, food security, energy security and other vital areas aligned with shared priorities and future aspirations.\"\n\nMr Hun Manet will meet Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong on June 19.\n\nHe is also scheduled to attend the Cambodia-Singapore Business Forum, organised by the Cambodia Chamber of Commerce, the Singapore Business Federation, the Singapore Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia and the Singapore Alumni Association of Cambodia, and visit Nanyang Polytechnic and Keppel Infrastructure@Changi.\n\nSource: Straits Times \u00a9 SPH Media Limited.

Prime Minister Hun Manet was in Singapore for a two-day official visit to the country.\n\nAccording to an official press release, during the wide range of discussions, the two leaders also agreed to continue the cooperation for energy security.\n\nBoth Prime Ministers expressed confidence that by operating more direct flights, they could bring more tourists to both destinations from other countries as well.\n\nRegarding energy security cooperation, the two leaders welcomed the outcome of the Cambodia-Laos-Singapore Ministerial Meeting that decided to establish a Ministerial Working Group of the three countries and increase the participation of stakeholders.\n\nDuring the meeting, Mr Wong extended a warm welcome to Prime Minister Hun Manet to Singapore. Accompanied by a high-level Cambodian delegation, this was the first official visit of Mr Hun Manet to Singapore as Prime Minister.\n\nThe Prime Minister of Singapore highlighted the long-standing relationship between Singapore and Cambodia. Both countries will celebrate the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations in 2025.\n\nIn response, Mr Hun Manet thanked the Singapore Prime Minister and the Government of Singapore for the warm hospitality and congratulated Mr Wong on his appointment as Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore.\n\nThe Cambodian Prime Minister also invited the Prime Minister of Singapore to pay an official visit to the Kingdom at an appropriate time and wished Mr Wong and the Council of Ministers of the Government of Singapore all success in leading the country.\n\nMeanwhile, during a meeting between Chea Vuthy, Secretary General of the Cambodian Investment Board (CIB) of the Council for the Development of Cambodia, and Kow Juan Tiang, Executive Director of Enterprise Singapore (ESG), both sides agreed to increase investments in priority areas such as agri-business.\n\nChea Vuthy was part of the Cambodian delegation for the two-day official visit of Prime Minister Hun Manet in Singapore.\n\nThe CIB Secretary General laid stress on the possibility of working with ESG to boost investment cooperation to raise awareness of opportunities in Cambodia's priority sectors such as automobiles, electronics, logistics, and agricultural processing including rubber, cashew and cassava for the domestic market and exports, said a press release.\n\nTiang emphasised the need to continue to strengthen investment cooperation between the two countries by encouraging Singaporean companies to look into the possibility of investing in Cambodia in agricultural processing, agri-food and infrastructure.\n\nWhile reacting to the strengthening economic ties between the two countries, Ky Sereyvath, Senior Economist and Director General of the Institute of China Studies at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, told Khmer Times yesterday that the proposed joint working group could make a huge difference, especially considering the fact Singapore is a world trade hub and a famous tourist site.\n\n\"The joint working group will improve both countries' trade and tourism during this hard time of the world economy,\" he said.\n\nThe latest report of the General Department of Customs and Excise (GDCE) showed that trade between the two countries rose to $393 million in the first five months of this year, an increase of 18 percent compared to the same period last year.\n\nExports from Cambodia to Singapore increased by 134.6 percent while imports to Cambodia registered a growth of 11.5 percent.", "source": {"uri": "khmertimeskh.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khmer Times"},

The aim is to boost trade and cross-border related financial services between local SMEs.\n\nThe launch of the corridor builds on the memorandum of understanding signed in July last year between the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the National Bank of Cambodia.\n\nThe initiative is currently in its first phase, with the initial batch of participating FIs being onboarded. The goal is to execute the first live financing transactions in the second half of this year.\n\nParticipating FIs from Singapore are Anext Bank, Liquid Group, as well as Sing Investments & Finance. Those from Cambodia include Advanced Bank of Asia, Acleda Bank, Phillip Bank, Sathapana Bank and Wing Bank.\n\nThe launch of the initiative was held in conjunction with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet's two-day official visit to Singapore from Jun 18, at the invitation of Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.\n\nThis is Hun Manet's first visit to Singapore as his country's prime minister, after he took office in August last year.\n\nThe Cambodian leader also witnessed the ceremonial exchange of a memorandum of understanding on digital government cooperation between the kingdom's Ministry of Post and Telecommunications and Singapore's Ministry of Communications and Information.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Wong hosted an official dinner at the Istana banquet hall in Hun Manet's honour.\n\nIn his toast speech, he said: \"Cambodia and Singapore are at different stages of economic development. But as two countries in South-east Asia, we face common challenges, and we share similar perspectives and interests on many issues.\"\n\nWong added: \"We both have a stake in making Asean a strong and robust grouping in the international arena.\"\n\nRelations between the two Asean member states - which will commemorate 60 years of diplomatic ties next year - were formally established on Sep 15, 1965.\n\n\"Singapore was one of the early believers of Cambodia's potential,\" said Wong, adding that trade and investment are key pillars of bilateral ties.\n\nSingapore's investments in Cambodia span a range of sectors, including real estate, energy, agri-business, education and finance.\n\nIn 2023, Singapore was Cambodia's second-largest source of foreign direct investment. The Republic was also Cambodia's eighth-largest trading partner from January to May this year, according to statistics from Cambodia's General Department of Customs and Excise. Conversely, Cambodia was Singapore's 26th-largest trading partner in merchandise from January to April this year, data from Singapore's Department of Statistics revealed.\n\nThe eldest son of long-time ruler Hun Sen made an earlier visit to the Republic in June 2019 in his capacity as then-deputy commander-in-chief of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces and commander of the Royal Cambodian Army. He also visited as the 64th Lee Kuan Yew Exchange Fellow in June 2018.\n\nOn the first day of his visit, Hun Manet received a ceremonial welcome at the Istana and called on President Tharman Shanmugaratnam.\n\nA hybrid orchid, Vanchoanthe Hun Manet, was then named in honour of the Cambodian leader.\n\nOn display at Gardens by the Bay is also an exhibition showcasing a replica of famed temple complex Angkor Wat adorned with more than 50 species of Cambodian orchids.\n\nThe kingdom's prime minister will receive a call from Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Wednesday.

The event was organised in conjunction with the first official visit of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet to Singapore.\n\nMr Hun Manet told the 300 or so business leaders and government officials from both countries: \"Singapore's investment has played a pivotal role in Cambodia's development, fuelling growth in various sectors such as manufacturing, real estate, hospitality, and more.\"\n\nHe also outlined the Cambodian government's steps to increase the ease of doing business, such as streamlining regulation, improving trade connections and providing incentives like tax breaks of up to 15 years for priority sectors.\n\nMr Hun Manet, who was giving a keynote address at the event, noted that the green economy and digitalisation were key areas in which Singapore investors could advance Cambodia's progress.\n\nDr Tan See Leng, Singapore's Second Minister for Trade and Industry and Manpower Minister, said the forum's strong turnout demonstrated the continued interest by Singapore companies to explore opportunities in Cambodia.\n\nHe noted that Singapore and Cambodia businesses, and the partnerships they have formed, have substantially contributed to the growth in foreign direct investment (FDI) in Asean as supply chains shift.\n\nSingapore was Cambodia's second-largest source of FDI in 2023.\n\nBilateral trade grew to more than $2.5 billion in the first four months of 2024, which Singapore Business Federation (SBF) chairman Lim Ming Yan noted in a speech was a 42 per cent increase over the same period in 2023.\n\nDr Tan also cited examples of successful partnerships across the aviation and waste management sectors and the green economy, adding that Singapore will further advance collaboration on renewable energy and sustainability.\n\nOne initiative is to continue to facilitate the development of projects to realise the vision of an Asean-wide power grid, such as the import of renewable energy.\n\nSingapore and Cambodia are also working on finding a legally-binding implementation agreement for collaboration on carbon credits under the Paris Agreement, which was the subject of a memorandum of understanding signed in May 2023.\n\nDr Tan said: \"This collaboration will advance both countries' climate ambition and channel financing towards additional mitigation efforts.\"\n\nLater in the day, Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong called on Mr Hun Manet at the Shangri-la Hotel.\n\nThe ties between the two nations were also cemented via agreements struck at the forum, which was organised by the Cambodia Chamber of Commerce (CCC), SBF, the Singapore Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia and the Singapore Alumni Association of Cambodia.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors":

In doing so, it empowers them to better assess risks and provide enhanced and faster financing for small to medium-sized enterprises trading across borders, the SBF said in a statement.\n\nA panel discussion on investment opportunities in Cambodia followed the speeches.\n\nThe panellists were Suon Sophal, deputy secretary-general of the Cambodian Investment Board; Sok Piseth, vice-president of the CCC and chief executive of G Gear Group; Atul Temurnikar, co-founder and chairman of Global Schools Foundation; and Goh Chee Kiong, chief executive of Charge+.\n\nThey touched on how investors could qualify for government incentives, what is needed to set up a business there, and the allure of Singapore as a destination for Cambodian firms seeking to internationalise, among other topics.\n\nCharge+ was cited as one Singapore firm that has established a foothold in Cambodia by providing charging services for electric vehicles since 2023.\n\nGoh of Charge+ told The Straits Times that the firm intends to expand its footprint in Cambodia from around 30 charging stations to 3,000 in the next five years or so.\n\nHe added that Cambodia was \"a very natural choice\" due to the government's plans for sustainability and energy use, and the rapid growth in adoption of these vehicles.\n\nEntrepreneur Dennis Ng said Singapore's longstanding relationship with Cambodia, which was among the first countries to recognise the Republic's independence at the United Nations, contributed to his decision to set up the non-profit Kent Ridge International School in Phnom Penh in 2013.\n\nMost of the about 200 students in the school are Cambodian students on scholarships.\n\n\"(Cambodia) was the first place we were going to... to show the Singapore spirit,\" said Ng.\n\n\"We need our Asean neighbours, and it is good for the future generation to build relationships.\" - The Straits Times/ANN", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "},

Prime Minister Hun Manet's visit to Singapore from June 18 provides an opportunity to explore new avenues for collaboration.\n\nSingapore has contributed greatly to Cambodia's development. Singaporean institutions have partnered with Cambodian universities to enhance educational standards and provide scholarships. Singapore trains Cambodia's medical professionals and helps develop its healthcare infrastructure. The Cambodia-Singapore Cooperation Centre in Phnom Penh trains thousands of Cambodians in such skills as clean energy and food safety. Singaporean firms have contributed to significant infrastructure projects in Phnom Penh.\n\nIn return, Cambodia has been a consistent supporter of the Asean framework, backing Singapore's initiatives on trade and economic integration. Cambodia has actively engaged with Singaporean experts to develop eco-friendly practices and policies that benefit both nations.\n\nSingapore is one of Cambodia's top trading partners. Cambodia's agricultural products, textiles and garments find a ready market in Singapore, while it benefits from Singapore's high-quality machinery, electronics and consumer goods. Both governments have worked diligently to create an environment conducive to trade by reducing tariffs and simplifying Customs procedures.\n\nSingaporean companies have invested heavily in Cambodian real estate, manufacturing and finance. Singapore accounts for 10 per cent of Cambodia's overseas investment, ranking as the third-largest contributor of foreign capital, creating jobs, stimulating economic growth, and contributing to the transfer of knowledge and technology.\n\nI encourage more Singaporean businesses to explore the vast untapped opportunities in Cambodia. Cambodia offers a strategic location, a young and dynamic workforce, and a government committed to a business-friendly environment that enables investors to thrive. Its special economic zones provide attractive incentives, streamlined regulations and world-class infrastructure.\n\nLikewise, Cambodia must invest more in Singapore, particularly in new areas of collaboration, such as the digital economy and green technology.\n\nThe partnership between Cambodia and Singapore is a testament to what can be achieved through cooperation and collaboration. While there may be occasional differences in perspectives, both governments' ability to address these constructively and in the spirit of mutual respect will strengthen their bond.\n\nPrime Minister Hun Manet's visit to Singapore is an opportunity to reinforce the commitment to mutual growth and prosperity.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cambodia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cambodia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phnom_Penh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Phnom Penh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phnom Penh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cambodia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hun_Manet", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hun Manet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentally_friendly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmentally friendly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_economic_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special economic zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Services", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659035", "eventUri": "eng-9659035", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 178, "textEnd": 185}], "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

digital transformation with all stakeholders including digital government, digital business and digital citizen which comply with the Pentagonal Strategy phase one in which the fifth strategy involves

State Attorney General Letitia James is now tasked with crafting rules to determine mechanisms for verifying a user's age and parental consent. After the rules are finalized, social media companies will have 180 days to implement the regulations.\n\n\"We can protect our kids. We can tell the companies that you are not allowed to do this, you don't have a right to do this, that parents should have say over their children's lives and their health, not you,\" Hochul said at a bill signing ceremony in Manhattan.\n\nThe signing is the first step in what is expected to be a drawn out process of rule making, and a probable lawsuit from social media companies to block the law.\n\nNetChoice, a tech industry trade group that includes X and Meta, has criticized the legislation as unconstitutional.\n\n\"This is an assault on free speech and the open internet by the State of New York,\" Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel of NetChoice, said in a statement. \"New York has created a way for the government to track what sites people visit and their online activity by forcing websites to censor all content unless visitors provide an ID to verify their age.\"\n\nMost of the biggest social media platforms send users a steady stream of suggested videos, photographs and other content, using a computer to try and predict what will keep users entertained and engaged for as long as possible. The algorithms use a variety of factors to curate that content, including what a user has clicked on before and interests of other people with similar preferences.\n\nThe bill marks the latest attempt by a state to regulate social media as part of concerns over how children interact with the platforms.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom this week announced plans to work with the Legislature on a bill to restrict smartphone usage for students during the school day, though he didn't provide exact details on what the proposal would include. Newsom in 2019 signed a bill allowing school districts to limit or ban smartphones while at school.\n\nThere hasn't been broad legislation on the subject at the federal level but it is a common point of discussion in Washington. This week the U.S. surgeon general called on Congress to put warning labels on social media platforms similar to those on cigarettes, citing mental health dangers for children using the sites.\n\nSome tech companies, with pressure mounting, have decided to set up parental controls on their platforms. Last year, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, created tools that allowed parents to set time limits on the apps for children.\n\n\"Social media platforms manipulate what our children see online to keep them on the platforms as long as possible,\" said James, a Democrat who pushed for the bill. \"The more time young people spend on social media, the more they are at risk of developing serious mental health concerns.\"\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

The second will put additional limitations on the collection, use, sharing, and selling of personal data of anyone under the age of 18.\n\n\"We can protect our kids. We can tell the companies that you are not allowed to do this, you don't have a right to do this, that parents should have say over their children's lives and their health, not you,\" Hochul said at a bill-signing ceremony in Manhattan.\n\nUnder the first bill, the Stop Addictive Feeds Exploitation (Safe) For Kids Act, apps like TikTok and Instagram would be limited for people under age 18 to posts from accounts they follow, rather than content recommended by the app. It would also block platforms from sending minors notifications on suggested posts between midnight and 6am.\n\nBoth provisions could be turned off if a minor gets what the bill defines as \"verifiable parental consent\".\n\nThursday's signing is just the first step in what is expected to be a lengthy process of rulemaking, as the laws do not take effect immediately and social media companies are expected to challenge the new legislation.\n\nState attorney general Letitia James is now tasked with crafting rules to determine mechanisms for verifying a user's age and parental consent. After the rules are finalized, social media companies will have 180 days to implement changes to comply with the regulation.\n\n\"Addictive feeds are getting our kids hooked on social media and hurting their mental health, and families are counting on us to help address this crisis,\" James said at the ceremony. \"The legislation signed by Governor Hochul today will make New York the national leader in addressing the youth mental health crisis and an example for other states to follow.\"\n\nSocial media companies and free speech advocates have pushed back against such legislation, with NetChoice - a tech industry trade group that includes Twitter/X and Meta - criticizing the New York laws as unconstitutional.\n\n\"This is an assault on free speech and the open internet by the State of New York,\" Carl Szabo, vice-president and general counsel of NetChoice, said in a statement. \"New York has created a way for the government to track what sites people visit and their online activity by forcing websites to censor all content unless visitors provide an ID to verify their age.\"\n\nNew York's new laws come after California governor Gavin Newsom announced plans to work with his state's legislature on a bill to restrict smartphone usage for students during the school day, though he didn't provide exact details on what the proposal would include. Newsom in 2019 signed a bill allowing school districts to limit or ban smartphones on campuses.\n\nA similar measure proposed in South Carolina this month would ban students from using cellphones during the school day across all public schools in the state. Most schools in the United Kingdom prohibit the use of smartphones during school hours.\n\nAlthough there hasn't been broad legislation on the subject at the federal level, pressure from Washington is mounting.

We can tell the companies that you are not allowed to do this, you don't have a right to do this, that parents should have say over their children's lives and their health, not you,\" Hochul, a Democrat, said at a bill signing ceremony in Manhattan.\n\nThe signing is the first step in what is expected to be a drawn out process of rule making, and a probable lawsuit from social media companies to block the law.\n\nNetChoice, a tech industry trade group that includes X and Meta, has criticized the legislation as unconstitutional.\n\n\"This is an assault on free speech and the open internet by the State of New York,\" Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel of NetChoice, said in a statement. \"New York has created a way for the government to track what sites people visit and their online activity by forcing websites to censor all content unless visitors provide an ID to verify their age.\"\n\nMost of the biggest social media platforms send users a steady stream of suggested videos, photographs and other content, using a computer to try and predict what will keep users entertained and engaged for as long as possible. The algorithms use a variety of factors to curate that content, including what a user has clicked on before and interests of other people with similar preferences.\n\nThe bill marks the latest attempt by a state to regulate social media as part of concerns over how children interact with the platforms.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom this week announced plans to work with the Legislature on a bill to restrict smartphone usage for students during the school day, though he didn't provide exact details on what the proposal would include. Newsom in 2019 signed a bill allowing school districts to limit or ban smartphones while at school.\n\nThere hasn't been broad legislation on the subject at the federal level but it is a common point of discussion in Washington. This week the U.S. surgeon general called on Congress to put warning labels on social media platforms similar to those on cigarettes, citing mental health dangers for children using the sites.\n\nSome tech companies, with pressure mounting, have decided to set up parental controls on their platforms. Last year, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, created tools that allowed parents to set time limits on the apps for children.\n\nThe New York legislation, debuted last October, had faced major pushback in the Legislature from the tech industry.\n\n\"Social media platforms manipulate what our children see online to keep them on the platforms as long as possible,\" said James, a Democrat who pushed for the bill. \"The more time young people spend on social media, the more they are at risk of developing serious mental health concerns.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Kathy Hochul to sign bill targeting social media platforms' algorithm toward teens: \"Our kids are in distress\"", "body": "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Thursday that social media algorithms have negatively affected children and teens, saying \"our kids are in distress\" as she is set to sign into law a bill aimed at protecting kids online.\n\n\"They're not living carefree lives because they are being held captive to powerful forces outside their own control -- algorithms that are intentionally addictive, intended to pull them in and keep their attention,\" Hochul told CBS News in an exclusive interview.\n\nThe \"Safe for Kids Act,\" which Hochul is set to sign Thursday, requires social media companies to restrict \"addictive feeds\" for social media users under the age of 18. It would also bar notifications from social media platforms related to the feeds between the hours of midnight and 6 a.m. without parental consent. And it would require new age verification and parental consent tools to be set by the state's attorney general.\n\nHochul said the measure targets algorithms in particular because \"in order to liberate our children, we have to get right to the source of the trauma that's being inflicted on them.\"\n\nBut a group representing tech companies has pushed back, arguing that the law will violate the Constitution's First Amendment by censoring free speech online. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, told CBS News in a statement that while it doesn't support every aspect of this bill, it supports legislation requiring app stores to obtain parental approval to obtain apps. TikTok declined to comment.\n\nThe Democratic governor said that although the approach is \"novel,\" she added that \"we've checked to make sure we believe it's constitutional.\"\n\nHochul said that with the change to the law, the social media companies will be put \"on notice.\"\n\n\"The first start is to just change the law, put the companies on notice that it's a new day in New York,\" she said. \"We're here standing with our children.\"\n\nThe new law is set to take effect 180 days after New York Attorney General Letitia James solidifies its exact rules and guidelines. James can then fine social media platforms that are out of compliance up to $5,000 per violation.\n\nThe development comes as related issues have gained traction elsewhere in recent days, amid a broader push to address social media use among children. The U.S. surgeon general earlier this week suggested that Congress should create a warning label, like it would for addictive products like cigarettes, on social media for teens. And the board of the Los Angeles Unified School District, the second-largest public school system in the country, voted to ban students from using cell phones during school hours.\n\nBut the moves haven't been without pushback, as opponents have argued that parents should be the ones making the decisions about their child's social media use. Hochul said that in New York, the effort has been parent-backed.\n\n\"The parents are the ones helping lead the charge,\" Hochul said. \"They're the ones who started this whole effort.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Hochul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kathy Hochul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bar (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letitia_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Letitia James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_New_York", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon_General_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surgeon General of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Unified_School_District", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Unified School District"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Social_Work", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Social Work", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Childfree", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Childfree", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Child_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Child Safety", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Media", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/20/4e628221-9e41-481a-bd16-5d294023585a/thumbnail/1200x630/b184666750dae70b91ff73dd4f5fe80f/1718893050268.png?v=5842509bb796a146f9b20d3e8b03dac6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668939", "eventUri": "eng-9668939", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

(NEWS10)- Governor Kathy Hochul signed nation-leading legislation to protect children on social media in Manhattan on Thursday. Hochul put her signature on New York's Stop Addictive Feeds Exploitation (SAFE) for Kids Act, which will turn social media alerts off for children between midnight and 6 a.m.\n\nThe new legislation restricts social media companies from using addictive feed features for children under the age of 18. The Office of the Attorney General plans to impose civil penalties on social media companies up to $5,000 for each violation.\n\nAn advisory by the U.S. Surgeon General said research shows kids who spend three or more hours on social media a day have a doubled risk of experiencing mental health outcomes. Additionally, Pew Research Center reports that 6 of 10 teens say they feel as though they have little to no control over social media companies collecting personal information about them.\n\nThe legislation also includes the establishment of acceptable age verification and parental consent methods. Once Hochul signs the act, the Office of the Attorney General will determine these methods during the rulemaking process.\n\nHochul said with a nationwide mental health crisis among youth being fueled by addictive social media feeds and algorithms, New York is leading the way in addressing the crisis by protecting children. \"By reining in addictive feeds and shielding kids' personal data, we'll provide a safer digital environment, give parents more peace of mind, and create a brighter future for young people across New York,\" she said.\n\nNew York State Attorney General Letitia James said the addictive algorithims and feeds are hooking children in and impeding on their mental health. She added that the families of the children are counting on state officials to help address the crisis.\n\n\"The legislation signed by Governor Hochul today will make New York the national leader in addressing the youth mental health crisis and an example for other states to follow,\" she said. \"As we move forward with the rulemaking process, my office will work tirelessly to defend these new laws to protect New York children.\"", "source": {"uri": "localsyr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsChannel 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Hochul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kathy Hochul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Office (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Albany, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Albany, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parental consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon_General_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surgeon General of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pew Research Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_New_York", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letitia_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Letitia James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rulemaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rulemaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child Welfare", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Information_and_Advice", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Information and Advice", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Organizations", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Policy_and_Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Policy and Advocacy", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.localsyr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2024/06/652724850cc4a9.46169851.jpeg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668939", "eventUri": "eng-9668939", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Albany, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

These include limits on \"addictive feeds\" targeted at users under 18 and a ban on notifications related to such content from midnight to 6 a.m. without parental consent. Additionally, the law mandates the implementation of new tools for age verification and parental oversight, overseen by the state's attorney general.\n\nAccording to a recent poll by Siena College, an overwhelming 70% of New Yorkers approve of the law, signaling broad bipartisan support for measures aimed at safeguarding children online. The survey underscores widespread agreement on the necessity of legislative intervention to mitigate social media's adverse effects on youth.\n\n7News reported that alongside the enactment of the \"Safe for Kids Act,\" Governor Hochul's decision has sparked significant public debate. The law's supporters argue it empowers parents to make informed decisions about their children's online interactions, while critics contend it infringes on personal liberties and parental rights. Hochul, however, highlighted the grassroots support from parents as pivotal in shaping the legislation, emphasizing their role in advocating for stricter regulations.\n\nThe new law reflects a broader national discourse on regulating digital platforms' influence on young people, coinciding with similar initiatives proposed elsewhere in the United States.

Legislation S.7694A/A.8148A establishes the Stop Addictive Feeds Exploitation (SAFE) For Kids Act to require social media companies to restrict addictive feeds on their platforms for users under 18. Legislation S.7695B/A.8149A enables the New York Child Data Protection Act to prohibit online sites from collecting, using, sharing or selling personal data of anyone under the age of 18, unless they receive informed consent or unless doing so is strictly necessary for the purpose of the website.\n\n\"Young people across the nation are facing a mental health crisis fueled by addictive social media feeds - and New York is leading the way with a new model for addressing the crisis and protecting our kids,\" Governor Hochul said. \"By reining in addictive feeds and shielding kids' personal data, we'll provide a safer digital environment, give parents more peace of mind, and create a brighter future for young people across New York.\"\n\nThe Governor was joined at today's bill signing by Attorney General Letitia James and bill sponsors State Senator Andrew Gounardes and State Assemblymember Nily Rozic, marking the culmination of a jointly led push to pass and sign this nation-leading legislation.\n\nWith this newly signed legislation, New York has established the nation's most stringent protections to safeguard kids on social media. This action also builds on Governor Hochul's ongoing efforts to address the youth mental health crisis.\n\nNew York State Attorney General Letitia James said, \"Addictive feeds are getting our kids hooked on social media and hurting their mental health, and families are counting on us to help address this crisis. The legislation signed by Governor Hochul today will make New York the national leader in addressing the youth mental health crisis and an example for other states to follow. I applaud the sponsors, Senator Gounardes and Assemblymember Rozic, for working with my office to introduce and advance this legislation, and I thank the legislative leaders for their support of these historic bills. As we move forward with the rulemaking process, my office will work tirelessly to defend these new laws to protect New York children.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said, \"As we navigate the threats social media poses to our youth in today's ever-evolving technological landscape, I'm proud that, under my leadership, the Senate Majority created the Senate's Internet and Technology Committee to focus on these issues. I thank Governor Hochul, Attorney General James and Bill Sponsor Senator Gounardes for their diligent work on this legislation and collaborating with stakeholders and colleagues to reach an agreement that best supports our youth in achieving healthier social media usage. Together, we will continue to take all necessary actions to protect the mental well-being of our children.\"\n\nAssembly Speaker Carl Heastie said, \"As technology evolves, so must the ways we protect our kids from harm - both on and offline. These bills will give parents the tools to help protect kids from predatory practices that impact their mental health by eliminating the addictive personalized feeds and will make online privacy the default for New York's children, preventing companies from collecting and using their data. Thank you to our Assembly sponsor Nily Rozic and to Governor Kathy Hochul, Attorney General Letitia James and our partners in the Senate for all the work they've done on this to make online spaces safer for kids.\"", "source": {"uri": "governor.ny.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "Governor Kathy Hochul"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Hochul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kathy Hochul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letitia_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letitia James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California State Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gounardes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Gounardes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_New_York", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nily_Rozic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nily Rozic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California State Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_California_State_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the California State Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Heastie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carl Heastie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Stewart-Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Stewart-Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Majority leader"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Policy_and_Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Policy and Advocacy", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Mental_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Mental Health", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Organizations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Internet", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual_Addiction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual Addiction", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/thumbnails/image/Mobilephone.jpg?h=b5f6a62e&itok=u436AS_K", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668939", "eventUri": "eng-9668939", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Kathy Hochul signed two bills into law Thursday clamping down on digital platforms' algorithms and use of children's data.\n\nThe unprecedented move makes New York the first state to pass a law regulating social media algorithms amid nationwide allegations that apps such as Instagram or TikTok have hooked users with addictive features.\n\nHochul's signature comes days after US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called for warning labels to be applied to social media platforms, fueling a debate about social media's potential impact on the mental health of users, particularly teens.\n\nUnder New York's SAFE For Kids Act, social media platforms will be required to display content chronologically by default for kids under 18, while the New York Child Data Protection Act will restrict websites from collecting or sharing the personal data of users under 18 without consent -- expanding on existing federal privacy protections for children under 13.\n\nThe SAFE For Kids Act also requires platforms to limit late-night app notifications that state lawmakers say are engineered to drive user engagement and that risk hindering sleep. Both pieces of legislation were introduced last fall and cleared the state legislature in early June.\n\nNew York officials hailed the legislation as a critical check on social media platforms' influence over teens.\n\n\"Today, we save our children,\" Hochul said Thursday at a press conference. \"We have heard their cries for help, reminding us as adults that we have a moral responsibility to protect young New Yorkers from harm and from addictive forces.\"\n\nSome academics have said that while studies highlight associations between specific types of social media activities and negative mental health outcomes - such as engaging in social comparison - a causal link between those harms and general social media use is less clear. Still, numerous states and federal lawmakers have pushed for legislation clamping down on social media platforms, arguing that tech companies' products are to blame for eating disorders, sleeplessness, distraction and, in some cases, self-harm and suicide.\n\n\"We will save lives with this, my friends,\" Hochul said at Thursday's press conference.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James added Thursday that the legislation would take on \"the most dangerous aspects of social media, the addictive algorithm feeds that exploit impressionable minds.\"\n\n\"These bills will empower my office to set rules and ensure companies are following them,\" James said.\n\nOpponents of the social media algorithm bill -- including but not limited to the tech industry -- have said the legislation is likely unconstitutional because it infringes on children's First Amendment rights and raises other questions about how social media can function in practice across state lines.\n\n\"It's a well-intentioned effort, but it's aimed at the wrong target,\" said Adam Kovacevich, CEO of the tech industry advocacy group Chamber of Progress. \"Algorithmic curation makes teenagers' feeds healthier, and banning algorithms is going to make social media worse for teens.\"\n\nThe legislation's signing sets the stage for another in a long string of court battles over state social media laws.\n\nStates such as Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana and many others have passed laws clamping down on social media companies' approach to teens. Industry groups have challenged some of that legislation, and courts have largely viewed the laws with skepticism. In Ohio this year, for example, a federal judge temporarily blocked a law prohibiting online platforms from creating accounts for users under 16 unless they obtain parental consent, saying the legislation likely violates the First Amendment.\n\nTwo states, Texas and Florida, have passed laws that would restrict online platforms from moderating their sites; legal challenges reached the Supreme Court this term and a decision is expected within weeks.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_fung@cnn.com", "name": "Brian Fung",

The bill also prohibits platforms from sending some notifications to minors between midnight and six a.m. without parental consent.\n\nThe measure appears to define \"addictive feeds\" as feeds that

The audit founds that NYPD fails to make efficient use of its resources and officers' time, and hold SoundThinking, Inc (aka ShotSpotter, Inc) accountable for the system's extremely high rate of unfounded and unconfirmed shootings. The audit also found that the NYPD substantially overstates the reduction in response times achieved by using ShotSpotter.\n\n\"ShotSpotter claims to be 'a proven detection system' that is 'faster and more accurate', but our audit found that 87 percent of the time, ShotSpotter is sending NYPD officers in response to loud noises that don't turn out to be confirmed shootings,\" said Comptroller Brad Lander. \"The evidence shows that NYPD is wasting precious time and money on this technology and needs to do a better job managing its resources. Chasing down car backfires and construction noise does not make us safer.\"\n\nThe ShotSpotter system employs over 2,000 acoustic sensors to detect gunshot activity to assist NYPD in locating suspected gunfire within the five boroughs. Under their contract with the NYPD, the primary metric for ShotSpotter performance is to avoid \"missed incidents:\" ShotSpotter is expected to report 90% or more of probable shooting, thus gives them a strong incentive to over-report loud noises that do not turn out to be confirmed shootings.\n\nFor the eight months in 2022 and 2023 reviewed by the audit, these unconfirmed shootings ranged from 80% to 92% of ShotSpotter alerts, sending officers to investigate 7,262 incidents that did not turn out to be confirmed shootings.\n\nNYPD records show that officers spent an average of 20 minutes investigating alerts deemed unfounded and 32 minutes investigating alerts that went unconfirmed. This translates to thousands of hours of officer time responding to ShotSpotter alerts that do not turn out to be confirmed shootings.\n\nNumber of Confirmed Shooting Incidents vs. Total ShotSpotter Alerts by Month\n\nIn addition, the audit found that ShotSpotter and the NYPD significantly overstate the reduction in response time that ShotSpotter facilitates - the primary value of the technology. While ShotSpotter markets a 5-minute difference between its detection system and emergency calls, the audit found that the average response time to ShotSpotter alerts was 1 minute 38 seconds faster than to 911 reports of outdoor gunfire.\n\nMore than 150 cities across the country use the technology, according to ShotSpotter. Major cities like Chicago, Atlanta, and Portland have decided against using the technology, with city officials and others describing it as \"expensive, racially biased and ineffective.\"\n\nComptroller Lander made five recommendations to the NYPD to address the audit findings. The NYPD rejected three and accepted two.\n\nRecommendation #1: Decline to renew the ShotSpotter contract when it expires in December 2024 without first conducting a more thorough performance evaluation, considering the very low rates of confirmed shooting incidents detected, and factoring in the extensive NYPD officer time spent responding to alerts not ultimately confirmed as shootings.\n\nRecommendation #2: Develop more meaningful performance standards of ShotSpotter's accuracy that better factor in the very high rate of alerts not ultimately confirmed as shootings.\n\nRecommendation #3: Collect and publish relevant data to increase transparency, including the number of published alerts, percentage of alerts that result in confirmed shootings, the number of false negatives and missed incidents, time and staff costs spent responding to alerts that are not ultimately confirmed as shootings, and the relative response times to ShotSpotter alerts versus 911 reports of shots fired outside.\n\nThe NYPD did agree with the Comptroller's office's final two recommendations to follow up with ShotSpotter Inc. on coverage areas where the sensors did not meet the current contractually obligated standard, and to pay its invoices within 30 days, as mandated by procurement rules.\n\nComptroller Lander continued, \"The NYPD's response to these audit findings is disappointing and reflects a disinterest in using data, effective performance metrics, and transparency to improve public safety. With a thorough evaluation before deciding whether to renew this multi-million-dollar contract, better performance standards, and more transparency, the NYPD could deploy its resources - especially its officers' time - far more effectively.\"", "source": {"uri": "comptroller.nyc.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "Office of the New York City Comptroller Brad Lander"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShotSpotter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ShotSpotter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Lander", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Lander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Comptroller", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City Comptroller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comptroller", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comptroller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_of_New_York_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boroughs of New York City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acoustics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sensor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Range_Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Range Facilities", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Shooting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Organizations", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://comptroller.nyc.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Comptroller_Default_Featured_default.jpg?429987", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669301", "eventUri": "eng-9669301", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 236, "relevance": 1}

Shootings were correctly identified just 13% of the time, according to the comptroller's audit, wasting officers' time by sometimes more than a half-hour on a bogus activation -- leading to thousands of hours wasted over a given year.\n\nThe NYPD, however, decried Lander's findings and insisted ShotSpotter has proven its worth in helping to save lives and catch shooters. The audit comes as police brass say they plan to add the technology to drones to provide a faster response to reported shootings.\n\nLander's audit reviewed an eight-month period between 2022 and 2023, and 7,262 incidents that did not lead to confirmed shootings.\n\n\"ShotSpotter claims to be 'a proven detection system' that is 'faster and more accurate', but our audit found that 87% of the time, ShotSpotter is sending NYPD officers in response to loud noises that don't turn out to be confirmed shootings,\" Lander said. \"The evidence shows that NYPD is wasting precious time and money on this technology and needs to do a better job managing its resources. Chasing down car backfires and construction noise does not make us safer.\"\n\nLander recommends the Big Apple does not renew its contract with ShotSpotter, following in the footsteps of other major U.S cities like Chicago, Atlanta and Portland.\n\nIn response to the audit, the NYPD released a six-page rebuttal to the findings and recommendations stating foremost that it is the responsibility of the responding officer, who is already on patrol in that area, to investigate if there was a shooting that set off the ShotSpotter alert.\n\nBallistic evidence is not always present especially if the shooter uses a revolver or does so from a car where the casing remains.\n\n\"The auditors' analysis found that ShotSpotter alerts yield a confirmed shooting rate of 8% to 13% for the second half of fiscal year 2023 (January 2023 to July 2023). The auditors are critical of this low confirmed shooting rate; however, an anticipated benefit of ShotSpotter's technology is to produce a police response to a shooting whether or not a 911 call is made. Year-to-date (as of May 19, 2024), 2,601 ShotSpotter alerts were activated citywide with a 15.6% confirmed shooting rate,\" part of the response said.\n\nLanders' audit reports that \"over-policing\" may occur due to frequent false alerts; however, the NYPD dismisses that notion.\n\nShotSpotter, the NYPD insisted, does not provide officers to stop or arrest an individual; rather, the system only provides a location where a possible crime may have occurred.\n\n\"The NYPD provided a comprehensive response to the audit's findings and recommendations, which was included as part of the report. The Department consistently reviews the effectiveness of technologies it utilizes to combat crime. ShotSpotter remains an integral tool in the NYPD's mission of addressing gun violence and keeping the public safe,\" an NYPD spokesperson said in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "amny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "amNewYork"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dean_moses@amny.com", "name": "Dean Moses", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShotSpotter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ShotSpotter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Lander", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Lander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comptroller", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comptroller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Comptroller", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City Comptroller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartridge_(firearms)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cartridge (firearms)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gun violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revolver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Shooting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.amny.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DSC02575-copy-2-copy.jpg?w=1200&p=q", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669301", "eventUri": "eng-9669301", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 431, "textEnd": 438}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-05-", "textStart": 2588, "textEnd": 2594}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 231, "relevance": 1}

There are currently more than 2,000 sensors installed across the five boroughs.\n\nAccording to a new audit report by the city comptroller's office, ShotSpotter alerts only identified confirmed shootings 13% of the time.\n\n\"If you got it wrong 87 percent of the time, that's pretty a bad F, but more than that, it just means that our officers' time is being wasted. Instead of investigating shootings that actually did happen ... chasing after construction noise or car backfires or who knows what,\" Comptroller Brad Lander said.\n\nFrom the findings, Lander made several recommendations to the NYPD, which includes conducting a thorough evaluation of ShotSpotter before renewing the contract in December.\n\nIn the NYPD's response to that recommendation, it said in part: \"The Department will continue to have discussions with ShotSpotter in order to enhance the performance and evaluation of the technology; however, it is not feasible to conduct an evaluation prior to the contract renewal period.\"\n\nPublic Advocate Jumaane Williams says he was an early supporter of ShotSpotter, deployed in the city in 2015.\n\n\"It looks like it's not working as we want it, as intended. More concerning is a response to the report. Even the recommendations that say, 'let's try to make it better,' the most material of the recommendations were outright rejected by this administration,\" he said.\n\nThe comptroller says he's hoping the recommendations will still be considered before contract renewal the end of the year.\n\nSeven pages of the report includes the NYPD's response to the findings and recommendations, mostly defending use of the technology.\n\nIn a statement to CBS New York, an NYPD spokesperson said: \"The NYPD provided a comprehensive response to the audit's findings and recommendations, which was included as part of the report.

The most in-depth examination of the tech was performed by the Inspector General of the city of Chicago. The report produced by the IG was anything but flattering. It found that mics were clustered heavily in neighborhoods predominantly occupied by people of color. It also found the tech wasn't doing much to help cops tamp down on gun crime in Chicago. Not only did reports rarely produce suspects, much less evidence that would be useful in investigations, it tended to re-route cops from productive patrolling to wandering around streets looking for bullet casings or whatever.\n\nAs the tech's shortcomings became more apparent, more and more cities have chosen not to do business with ShotSpotter. Some terminated their contracts or chose not to renew them. Some reviewed the tech but decided to spend money elsewhere.\n\nOther controversies reared their heads as well. Multiple accusations surfaced claiming ShotSpotter analysts were altering gunshot reports to fit police officers' narratives or justify questionable stops and arrests. ShotSpotter made things worse by trying to sue journalists who reported on these accusations, even when they did nothing more than report on the contents of court documents.\n\nPresumably, this collective shitstorm was the impetus for ShotSpotter's re-branding. It now refers to itself as SoundThinking, but underneath the new letterhead, it's still just ShotSpotter.\n\nThe latest broadside was issued by the federal government. Multiple legislators asked the DOJ to look into recipients of grants from the department to ensure they weren't being spent on tech that was being deployed in contravention of the Civil Rights Act. ShotSpotter was named specifically, due to its omnipresence in neighborhoods primarily occupied by minorities.\n\nShotSpotter is fighting back. But its efforts haven't been all that successful, much less coherent. It erected a \"save ShotSpotter\" page in hopes of peppering Chicago alderpersons with requests that the city not end its contract with the company later this year.\n\nNow, it's firing back against statements made by federal legislators and the ACLU of Massachusetts. Certainly, one would expect nothing less from a company that is now aware its back is against the wall.\n\nBut you'd expect a better effort to be made, especially when it's not being made by some PR intern, but by company executives. It has hired Boston PR firm Regan Communications Group to assist in its pushback, but the ROI of that disbursement isn't immediately observable here:\n\n\"[I]n incidents where lives may hang in the balance and every second counts, the ShotSpotter system alerts police to virtually all gunfire in a community's coverage area within 60 seconds,\" the company's president and CEO Ralph A. Clark, wrote in a 35-page, heavily footnoted letter to the lawmakers.\n\n\"The fast response made possible by this technology ultimately helps save lives, locate suspects, and collect critical evidence,\" he said.\n\nThe ShotSpotter response team needs to get on the same page. Earlier this month, the company insisted people complaining about the tech's uselessness in criminal investigations were looking at the wrong metric for measuring success. Instead, it claimed the tech's true value was providing fast response to reported gunshots to save victims of shootings.\n\nBut in this statement, the company tries to have it both ways. Even if it's true ShotSpotter creates better response times for medical professionals, very few law enforcement agencies are going to pay millions for tech that does little more than scramble ambulances faster. So, the company continues to insist -- despite plenty of evidence to the contrary -- that the tech is a meaningful contributor to criminal investigations and public safety.\n\n\"We are proud of the value that ShotSpotter delivers to law enforcement to help address criminal gunfire and save lives,\" Clark wrote.\n\nAre you really? The \"value\" you speak so highly of hasn't been conclusively demonstrated anywhere. When officials have taken a close look at the tech, those close looks are often followed by contract terminations.\n\nThe company also responded to the ACLU's accusations that its tech -- at least as deployed by most law enforcement agencies -- violates the Civil Rights Act. And again, a company executive was on hand to deliver an inconsistent statement that claims the tech is good for things (1) no one has asked it to be good at (locating gunshot victims) and (2) stuff it has been shown on multiple occasions it's actually bad at.\n\n\"If you read headlines across the country and you can subtract out those pieces that are merely opinion, what you will see reflected over and over again is ShotSpotter locating gunshot wound victims, leading police to arrest offenders,\" said Tom Chittum, SoundThinking's senior vice president of analytics and forensic services.\n\n\"And it's not because this technology simply gets lucky. It's because it really works,\" he said.\n\nWhile it's disappointing to learn Tom Chittum isn't reading my headlines, the real problem here is the claims the company is making. Recently, the company has begun insisting the real value of the tech is locating gunshot victims, rather than locating criminals -- a new PR spin that seems to have been adopted because so much data shows the tech isn't doing much to locate suspects, close investigations, or deliver criminal convictions.\n\nNow, every statement says two things: we save lives and we stop crime. The latter clearly isn't an accurate portrayal of the tech's contribution to law enforcement. And the former is something that can't clearly be determined because absolutely no one is tracking data on EMS response times in relation to ShotSpotter reports.\n\nObviously, statements issued by companies on the defensive will be extremely self-serving. But no one should be duped by this desperation play from SoundThinking. If the company wants us to believe it saves lives, it should make an effort to compile data that demonstrates it, at the very least, can make this contribution to public safety. And while it does that, we're free to draw inferences from existing data on its law enforcement utility, which appears to be almost nil.", "source": {"uri": "techdirt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Techdirt"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_cushing@techdirt.com", "name": "Tim Cushing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShotSpotter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ShotSpotter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inspector general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gun violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forensic science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency medical services"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.techdirt.com/wp-content/themes/techdirt/assets/images/techdirt-white-square.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669301", "eventUri": "eng-9669301", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The system utilizes more than 2,000 acoustic sensors to detect gunshot activity citywide.\n\nA spokesperson for the NYPD referred to the department's response, included at the end of the audit.\n\nThe seven-page reply says, among other things, that the comptroller analysis fails to acknowledge that officers responding to ShotSpotter alerts serve as a form of crime deterrent simply by investigating the scene.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIt also says its difficult for the department to determine exactly how many ShotSpotter reports result in a \"confirmed shooting\" as those are only ones in which shell casings, firearms, property damage, videos, witnesses, victims or other forms of evidence are also identified.\n\nSoundThinking, in an emailed statement, said its reviewing the report but believes it is \"gravely misinformed in its assessment of data and the value of ShotSpotter as a critical public safety tool.\"\n\nThe company argued that the comptroller's office looked at the wrong metrics and that system is not just accurate and effective but also saves lives in communities hit hardest by gun violence.\n\n\"It should focus on full awareness of gunfire as it occurs, rapid response, and most importantly, lives saved,\" the company said of the audit.\n\nAccording to Lander's audit, unconfirmed shootings ranged from 80% to 92% of alerts during the eight months that his office audited the system between 2022 and 2023. That resulted in police officers investigating more than 7,000 incidents that did not turn out to be confirmed shootings, the audit found.\n\nMore than 160 cities nationwide use ShotSpotter, according to the company's website.\n\nBut earlier this year Chicago joined a growing list of major cities, including Atlanta, New Orleans and Charlotte, North Carolina, that decided to stop using the technology.\n\nSome critics said they found it expensive, ineffective and even racially biased.\n\nCommunity groups in Chicago complained in legal filings in 2021 that false gunshot reports sent police into predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods for \"unnecessary and hostile\" encounters.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

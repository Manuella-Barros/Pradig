Citi's Prestige card, which gives the unique benefit of a fourth night free at hotels, already existed.\n\nThe increased competition could help customers. Banks sometimes waive annual fees or offer additional points for certain types of spending in order to drive business. And analysts say the companies' desire to keep their cards distinctive may mean they offer more benefits. But whether enough people want to hold these cards may determine how sustainable the profusion is.\n\nChase's Sapphire Reserve Card was introduced last August with a 100,000-point sign-up bonus, worth $1,500 using Chase's rewards program, a $300 annual travel credit, and no foreign transaction fees, among other perks. Even with the huge fee, customers ate it up. Demand was so high that Chase temporarily ran out of the metal alloy used to make it.\n\nBanks had previously thought that the market for luxury credit cards, while lucrative, would be small - roughly the top 10 percent of U.S. households, and mainly older customers. And the number of people who would carry more than one would be even smaller.\n\nBut the demographics have changed. Younger consumers have been keen on the new generation of luxury cards - perhaps because, as analysts posit, they are willing to pay the large annual fee for access to experiences and travel that they prize more highly.\n\nSome customers who now have both an AmEx Platinum and Chase Sapphire Reserve are paying a combined $1,000 a year in fees for them. The argument among the passionate is that each provides different benefits. AmEx's airport lounge access is broader, while Chase offers more liberal ways of accumulating points.\n\n\"We carry them both because each card offers us different benefits, which we have taken full advantage of,\" said Courtney Valdivia, 31, who with her husband has both cards.\n\nThe card issuers are hoping enough people feel the same way. The early adopters of the Chase Sapphire Reserve card will be deciding soon whether to renew and once again pay the $450 annual fee. While the card gets strong reviews from users, it's not clear whether that will be enough to assuage the sticker shock of the annual fee, analysts say.\n\nAnd with more options, they also may want to give one of the newer cards a try for different benefits. AmEx has tried to gear its Platinum Card toward a younger audience, recently rolling out a $200 a year credit on ride-hailing app Uber.\n\n\"Everyone is chasing the same pool of people,\" said Brian Riley, a director at bank consulting firm Mercator Advisory, who has worked in the credit card industry for more than 25 years.\n\nThe generous benefits may also end up pressuring the companies pursuing those customers.\n\nIndustry analysts said they did not believe Chase's 100,000-point Sapphire promotion was sustainable, and the company did cut its sign-up bonus to 50,000 points roughly six months after the launch. Chase has said it was never meant to be permanent. But there have been other signs the card may be too generous. The Wall Street Journal reported this month that JPMorgan was looking to cut costs in the department.\n\n\"We will have to see how that plays out,\" said Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst with KBW who covers the credit card companies.\n\nRunning a luxury credit card program is expensive. In order to pay for the points programs and sign-up bonuses, banks need customers to charge substantial sums to their cards in a year, often tens of thousands of dollars a year. Even if customers are carrying two cards now, their potential overall spending likely hasn't changed much.\n\nBut if the competition gets too fierce, or makes the cards too expensive to run, banks could cut back on things like lounge access, or points redemption, as they have in the past. And fewer benefits may start a spiral of even fewer customers to keep the cards afloat.\n\n----\n\nKen Sweet covers banks and consumer financial issues for The Associated Press.

Banks sometimes waive annual fees or offer additional points for certain types of spending in order to drive business. And analysts say the companies' desire to keep their cards distinctive may mean they offer more benefits. But whether enough people want to hold these cards may determine how sustainable the profusion is.\n\nChase's Sapphire Reserve Card was introduced last August with a 100,000-point sign-up bonus, worth $1,500 using Chase's rewards program, a $300 annual travel credit, and no foreign transaction fees, among other perks. Even with the huge fee, customers ate it up. Demand was so high that Chase temporarily ran out of the metal alloy used to make it.\n\nBanks had previously thought that the market for luxury credit cards, while lucrative, would be small -- roughly the top 10% of U.S. households, and mainly older customers. And the number of people who would carry more than one would be even smaller.\n\nMore: Americans' 3 greatest financial fears -- and how to avoid them\n\nBut the demographics have changed. Younger consumers have been keen on the new generation of luxury cards -- perhaps because, as analysts posit, they are willing to pay the large annual fee for access to experiences and travel that they prize more highly.\n\nSome customers who now have both an AmEx Platinum and Chase Sapphire Reserve are paying a combined $1,000 a year in fees for them. The argument among the passionate is that each provides different benefits. AmEx's airport lounge access is broader, while Chase offers more liberal ways of accumulating points.\n\n\"We carry them both because each card offers us different benefits, which we have taken full advantage of,\" said Courtney Valdivia, 31, who with her husband has both cards.\n\nThe card issuers are hoping enough people feel the same way. The early adopters of the Chase Sapphire Reserve card will be deciding soon whether to renew and once again pay the $450 annual fee. While the card gets strong reviews from users, it's not clear whether that will be enough to assuage the sticker shock of the annual fee, analysts say.\n\nMore: 3 credit card alerts worth setting up now\n\nAnd with more options, they also may want to give one of the newer cards a try for different benefits. AmEx has tried to gear its Platinum Card toward a younger audience, recently rolling out a $200 a year credit on ride-hailing app Uber.\n\n\"Everyone is chasing the same pool of people,\" said Brian Riley, a director at bank consulting firm Mercator Advisory, who has worked in the credit card industry for more than 25 years.\n\nThe generous benefits may also end up pressuring the companies pursuing those customers.\n\nIndustry analysts said they did not believe Chase's 100,000-point Sapphire promotion was sustainable, and the company did cut its sign-up bonus to 50,000 points roughly six months after the launch. Chase has said it was never meant to be permanent. But there have been other signs the card may be too generous. The Wall Street Journal reported this month that JPMorgan was looking to cut costs in the department.\n\n\"We will have to see how that plays out,\" said Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst with KBW who covers the credit card companies.\n\nMore: 8 questions to ask before opening a new bank account\n\nRunning a luxury credit card program is expensive. In order to pay for the points programs and sign-up bonuses, banks need customers to charge substantial sums to their cards in a year, often tens of thousands of dollars a year. Even if customers are carrying two cards now, their potential overall spending likely hasn't changed much.\n\nBut if the competition gets too fierce, or makes the cards too expensive to run, banks could cut back on things like lounge access, or points redemption, as they have in the past. And fewer benefits may start a spiral of even fewer customers to keep the cards afloat.\n\nKen Sweet covers banks and consumer financial issues for The Associated Press.

Citi's Prestige card, which gives the unique benefit of a fourth night free at hotels, already existed.\n\nChase's Sapphire Reserve Card was introduced last August with a 100,000-point sign-up bonus, worth $1,500 using Chase's rewards program, a $300 annual travel credit, and no foreign transaction fees, among other perks. Even with the huge fee, customers ate it up. Demand was so high that Chase temporarily ran out of the metal alloy used to make it.\n\nBanks had previously thought that the market for luxury credit cards, while lucrative, would be small -- roughly the top 10 percent of U.S. households, and mainly older customers. And the number of people who would carry more than one would be even smaller.\n\nBut the demographics have changed. Younger consumers have been keen on the new generation of luxury cards -- perhaps because, as analysts posit, they are willing to pay the large annual fee for access to experiences and travel that they prize more highly.\n\nSome customers who now have both an AmEx Platinum and Chase Sapphire Reserve are paying a combined $1,000 a year in fees for them. The argument among the passionate is that each provides different benefits. AmEx's airport lounge access is broader, while Chase offers more liberal ways of accumulating points.\n\n\"We carry them both because each card offers us different benefits, which we have taken full advantage of,\" said Courtney Valdivia, 31, who with her husband has both cards.\n\nThe card issuers are hoping enough people feel the same way. The early adopters of the Chase Sapphire Reserve card will be deciding soon whether to renew and once again pay the $450 annual fee. While the card gets strong reviews from users, it's not clear whether that will be enough to assuage the sticker shock of the annual fee, analysts say.\n\n\"Everyone is chasing the same pool of people,\" said Brian Riley, a director at bank consulting firm Mercator Advisory, who has worked in the credit card industry for more than 25 years.\n\nThe generous benefits may also end up pressuring the companies pursuing those customers.\n\nIndustry analysts said they did not believe Chase's 100,000-point Sapphire promotion was sustainable, and the company did cut its sign-up bonus to 50,000 points roughly six months after the launch. Chase has said it was never meant to be permanent. But there have been other signs the card may be too generous. The Wall Street Journal reported this month that JPMorgan was looking to cut costs in the department.\n\n\"We will have to see how that plays out,\" said Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst with KBW who covers the credit card companies.\n\nRunning a luxury credit card program is expensive. In order to pay for the points programs and sign-up bonuses, banks need customers to charge substantial sums to their cards in a year, often tens of thousands of dollars a year. Even if customers are carrying two cards now, their potential overall spending likely hasn't changed much.\n\nBut if the competition gets too fierce, or makes the cards too expensive to run, banks could cut back on things like lounge access, or points redemption, as they have in the past. And fewer benefits may start a spiral of even fewer customers to keep the cards afloat.\n\n____\n\nKen Sweet covers banks and consumer financial issues for The Associated Press.

And, although these cards are competing for the same big-spending, credit-worthy card holders, this card reserves the best perks for those with bank loyalty.\n\nThe Premium Rewards card from Bank of America, available in September, joins the crowded and competitive high-end card field that includes American Express Platinum, the Chase Sapphire Reserve and the Citi Prestige. Those cards have been trending toward higher annual fees and higher spending requirements, said Matt Schulz, senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com.\n\nThe new Bank of America card offers a lower annual fee and spending requirements to unlock bonus points and it offers flexible spending options. It also offers points that increase as the amount of money and investments you have with Bank of America grows.\n\n\"This is a card designed for Bank of America customers or those willing to be Bank of America customers,\" says Schulz, \"they are not looking for credit card gamers.\"\n\nAmong premium cards, \"gamers\" are known to sweep in to reap credit card bonuses and rewards and then stop using the card. That will be harder to do with this card. In order to earn the top level of points from the card, cardholders need to have $100,000 or more in qualifying combined balances in Bank of America accounts or Merrill Edge and Merrill Lynch investment accounts, as well as being enrolled in a special rewards program.\n\nThe Premium Rewards card starts by providing 2 points for each dollar spent on travel and dining purchases, and 1.5 points for each dollar spent on all other purchases. But the big difference is that the points go up -- by 25% to 75% -- for people who have significant amounts banked or invested with Bank of America and are members of the Preferred Rewards program, which begins awards when you reach a balance of $20,000.\n\nIf you have $20,000 to $50,000 in qualifying combined balances and are a member of the rewards program, you'll earn 2.5 points per dollar spent on travel and dining and 1.875 points on everything else. For those in the program who hold $50,000 to $100,000 you'll earn 3 points and 2.25 points, respectively. It tops out at 3.5 points and 2.6 points for those in the program with balances of $100,000 or more.\n\n\"It will be interesting to see if people are willing to move their checking and investment accounts to Bank of America,\" says Schulz. \"Trying to get people who have $20,000 to $100,000 with the bank is a small pond to fish in, but it can be a lucrative one for banks, especially if you can get people to switch.\"\n\nThe card also bucks the trends in fees and spending requirements. The $95 annual fee is hundreds of dollars less than other premium cards. American Express Platinum is the most expensive at $550 annually. And the minimum spending requirement in the first three months to unlock the 50,000 bonus points is only $3,000, compared with the $7,500 to get 75,000 bonus points required by Citi, which is the highest.\n\nUltimately, says Schulz, these cards are competing for the same upscale customers. The Bank of America card signals a shift to a more targeted approach toward hooking card-holders than casting a wide-net with lifestyle appeals like lounge access and exclusive perks.\n\n\"The Chase Sapphire was a giant hit that attracted Millennials on up,\" he says. \"The Citi Prestige narrows the focus by increasing the spending. Now the Bank of America card narrows the focus even more, by tying the rewards you get to the amount you have in these accounts. It is shrinking the universe they're going after.\"\n\nBut among these top players there is a bit of a scramble to find a way to earn customers for the long-haul.

And, although these cards are competing for the same big-spending, credit-worthy card holders, this card reserves the best perks for those with bank loyalty.\n\nThe Premium Rewards card from Bank of America, available in September, joins the crowded and competitive high-end card field that includes American Express Platinum, the Chase Sapphire Reserve and the Citi Prestige. Those cards have been trending toward higher annual fees and higher spending requirements, said Matt Schulz, senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com.\n\nThe new Bank of America card offers a lower annual fee and spending requirements to unlock bonus points and it offers flexible spending options. It also offers points that increase as the amount of money and investments you have with Bank of America grows.\n\n\"This is a card designed for Bank of America customers or those willing to be Bank of America customers,\" says Schulz, \"they are not looking for credit card gamers.\"\n\nAmong premium cards, \"gamers\" are known to sweep in to reap credit card bonuses and rewards and then stop using the card. That will be harder to do with this card. In order to earn the top level of points from the card, cardholders need to have $100,000 or more in qualifying combined balances in Bank of America accounts or Merrill Edge and Merrill Lynch investment accounts, as well as being enrolled in a special rewards program.\n\nThe Premium Rewards card starts by providing 2 points for each dollar spent on travel and dining purchases, and 1.5 points for each dollar spent on all other purchases. But the big difference is that the points go up -- by 25% to 75% -- for people who have significant amounts banked or invested with Bank of America and are members of the Preferred Rewards program, which begins awards when you reach a balance of $20,000.\n\nIf you have $20,000 to $50,000 in qualifying combined balances and are a member of the rewards program, you'll earn 2.5 points per dollar spent on travel and dining and 1.875 points on everything else. For those in the program who hold $50,000 to $100,000 you'll earn 3 points and 2.25 points, respectively. It tops out at 3.5 points and 2.6 points for those in the program with balances of $100,000 or more.\n\n\"It will be interesting to see if people are willing to move their checking and investment accounts to Bank of America,\" says Schulz. \"Trying to get people who have $20,000 to $100,000 with the bank is a small pond to fish in, but it can be a lucrative one for banks, especially if you can get people to switch.\"\n\nThe card also bucks the trends in fees and spending requirements. The $95 annual fee is hundreds of dollars less than other premium cards. American Express Platinum is the most expensive at $550 annually. And the minimum spending requirement in the first three months to unlock the 50,000 bonus points is only $3,000, compared with the $7,500 to get 75,000 bonus points required by Citi, which is the highest.\n\nUltimately, says Schulz, these cards are competing for the same upscale customers. The Bank of America card signals a shift to a more targeted approach toward hooking card-holders than casting a wide-net with lifestyle appeals like lounge access and exclusive perks.\n\n\"The Chase Sapphire was a giant hit that attracted Millennials on up,\" he says. \"The Citi Prestige narrows the focus by increasing the spending. Now the Bank of America card narrows the focus even more, by tying the rewards you get to the amount you have in these accounts. It is shrinking the universe they're going after.\"\n\nBut among these top players there is a bit of a scramble to find a way to earn customers for the long-haul. Even if there are fewer possible customers for the Bank of America card, there may be more loyalty.\n\nMake no mistake, says Schulz, the banks are looking to establish a long-term relationship with these high end folks who they want to build a relationship with for the next 50 years.\n\n\"This model is a new way to go about this sort of product,\" says Schulz. \"Nobody knows if this will be successful, but you can bet Bank of America's competitors will be watching closely to see how this goes.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354638", "details": {"liCnt": 571}, "dateTime": "2017-08-10T22:28:00Z", "sim": 0.8588235378265381, "source": {"uri": "money.cnn.com", "title": "CNN Money", "id": "50"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "22:28:00", "url": "http://money.cnn.com/2017/08/10/pf/bofa-card/index.html", "storyUri": "eng-3354638", "id": "8498241", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170224185751-best-business-credit-cards-all-around-540x304.jpg", "date": "2017-08-10", "time": "22:28:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-10"}

The short answer is that the average American has 2.6 credit cards, but this doesn't tell the full story. Here's a closer look at how many credit cards Americans have and how many credit cards are the ideal number for you.\n\nAccording to data from Gallup, the average American has 2.6 credit cards, although this includes the 29% of Americans who don't have any credit cards at all. When you exclude this group, the average among people who have at least one credit card is 3.7.\n\nThe majority of Americans have zero to two credit cards and just 16% have five or more. Here's a breakdown of the data:\n\nData source: Gallup.\n\nAs you might imagine, Americans with higher credit scores tend to have more credit cards. In fact, FICO data shows that the average consumer with a FICO score of 800 or more (well into the realm of \"excellent\" credit) has 10 open revolving credit accounts. To be fair, this includes other types of revolving credit, such as bank lines of credit, but it's safe to say that the average person with a 800+ FICO score has more than 3.7 credit cards.\n\nThis certainly makes sense. After all, people with strong credit qualify more easily for credit cards, and are able to obtain the most attractive offers. Also, one factor in the FICO scoring formula is the length of time that credit accounts have been open, which gives many high-scoring consumers incentive to keep old credit accounts open, even after they apply for new ones.\n\nThere's no perfect answer to this question. Many people can get a single credit card that will meet all of their needs, while others can make the case for having a dozen or more.\n\nThe key questions to ask yourself is \"How do I spend money?\" and \"What perks and rewards are valuable to me?\"\n\nFor example, if you frequently shop at grocery stores, you can find credit cards that offer up to 6% cash back on groceries, up to certain limitations. If you fly frequently, you can get a credit card that rewards you with a generous earning rate for airline miles, and the same can be said for hotel chains. And for everyday purchases, you can find cards that offer a flat rate for cash back of as much as 2%.\n\nOn the other hand, if you don't travel much, it doesn't make much sense to have a credit card whose best rewards are offered on airline or hotel purchases.\n\nDepartment store credit cards are another consideration. If you shop at a certain retailer often, you can sometimes get extremely generous reward rates and no-interest options that other credit cards simply can't match.\n\nIt's also important to make sure you have a card that will be accepted anywhere, which is an important consideration if your primary credit card(s) are American Express or Discover products. These don't yet have universal acceptance, and it can be a real drag to hear \"Sorry, we don't accept American Express\" if that's the only credit card in your wallet.\n\nIt's important to note that credit card offers change regularly, so a credit card offer that's available when I wrote this article isn't necessarily going to be available when you're reading it. For this reason, instead of discussing specific credit cards, here's a general discussion of how to find the best cards in the categories that apply to you, as well as links to The Motley Fool's favorites, which are updated regularly.\n\nThe bottom line is that while one credit card might be enough for some readers, others would be better off with a combination of two or more cards that can take full advantage of their spending habits and reward preferences.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354638", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T12:51:00Z", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "title": "The Motley Fool", "id": "14061"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "12:51:00", "url": "https://www.fool.com/credit-cards/2017/08/13/how-many-credit-cards-does-the-average-person-have.aspx?source=iedfolrf0000001", "storyUri": "eng-3354638", "id": "8916496", "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F453418%2Fcredit-cards.jpg&h=630&w=1200&op=resize", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "12:51:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Nearly all frequent travelers should have one of these cards in their credit card arsenal.\n\nBut not all travel credit cards are worthy of consideration. You should look for a card with rewards tailored to how you travel - and your spending habits.\n\nAlso, be mindful of the annual fees. While top credit cards may offer huge rewards and best-in-class perks, they also may charge hundreds of dollars year in annual fees. If big annual fees are a turnoff, consider low- or no-annual-fee rewards cards.\n\nHere are three best travel credit cards, as chosen by the experts at CreditCards.com.\n\nChase Sapphire Reserve is a best-in-class card for any frequent traveler given its generous rewards and perks.\n\nHighlights:\n\nWho should get this card\n\nThis is an ideal card for anyone looking for a premium travel card with both a generous sign-up bonus and rewards program plus great additional perks. It's especially useful when paired with the Chase Ultimate Rewards program, where points are worth 50 percent more.\n\nCardholders who frequently fly or stay with Chase's travel partners -- like Virgin Atlantic, Southwest and Hyatt -- will particularly enjoy this card. You can transfer points through the card's loyalty program.\n\nThe annual fee is $450. The card carries a variable APR from 16.74 to 23.74 percent.\n\nWith its simple rewards structure, generous sign-up bonus and flexible redemption plan, this is a worthy card to own.\n\nHighlights:\n\nWho should get this card\n\nThis is a great card for the avid traveler who wants easy-to-use rewards and big bonus opportunities. The Arrival Plus allows you to use your earnings on any airline or hotel and is the only one on our list that has chip-and-PIN capabilities, which is the standard for card readers in Europe.\n\nThis card has a 0 percent introductory APR for 12 months for all balance transfers made within 45 days of opening an account. It comes with a variable APR of 16.99, 20.99 or 23.99 percent, based on creditworthiness.

Here are five big mistakes you could be making that you may not realize could hurt your credit.\n\nA good credit score can make it easier for you to get a loan and can make it far less expensive for you to borrow money for big purchases, like a new home. Unfortunately, while many people have the best of intentions when it comes to earning a high score, it's not always easy to know what you need to do to become a credit superstar. Different credit reporting agencies calculate your score in different ways, and none of the agencies are fully transparent about the specifics of the formula they use.\n\nCompounding the problem: some behaviors you may think will help your credit could actually result in your score dropping. You don't want to inadvertently hurt your efforts to earn good credit by making an innocent and avoidable mistake, so check out these five ways you could be messing up your credit score to avoid preventable errors.\n\nOne of the key factors in determining your credit score is how much of your available credit you've used. A low credit utilization rate -- typically below 30% of your available credit -- will earn you a better score than if you're closer to maxing out your cards. If you've got a $1,000 credit limit and you've charged more than $300, you'll be above your 30% recommended utilization rate and your score can take a hit.\n\nYou may think paying off your credit card balance in full each month would mean you have a very low credit utilization rate so you won't have to worry about hurting your score if you charge a lot each month. The problem is that your credit card company doesn't constantly report your balance in real time. Instead, credit card companies generally report your available balance and your credit limit on the date when your billing cycle closed. This means if you have a $1,000 credit limit and you charged $900 during the month, you'll have a 90% utilization rate reported to the credit bureaus -- even if you pay off the $900 the day the statement arrives in the mail.\n\nYou don't want to stop using your cards because you need a history of on-time payments to build credit -- and because you may be earning generous points or rewards for using your cards. But, if you're going to be applying for a mortgage or other large loan where your credit score really matters, you may want to sign into your online account a few days before your billing cycle closes and pay off the current balance on the card. That way, your creditor should report you have a $0 balance or a very low balance and you can get the best possible score for your low credit utilization.\n\nHave you ever been asked at the cash register to open up a store card for a generous percentage off of your purchase? Or received credit card offers in the mail promising you free airline tickets or other perks if you open a new credit card? These types of offers are common and lots of people take them because they seem like good deals. The problem is, opening up a new card -- for any reason -- can hurt your credit score in a few different ways.\n\nWhen you open up a new credit card, the card issuer is going to check your credit. This means an \"inquiry\" will be placed on your credit report where it will stay for two years. Having too many inquiries on your credit report can lower your score because it could be an indicator to creditors that you're about to get in over your head with debt.\n\nYour new card is also going to lower the average age of your credit, which is also an important factor in determining your score. The longer your credit history, the happier lenders are because they can see your track record of successfully managing credit. Average age of your credit history accounts for about 15% of your score, so you don't want a bunch of new cards to make your credit history look much shorter. That store discount could end up costing you a fortune if opening the card causes your credit score to drop dramatically before you take out a big loan.\n\nIf you're trying to improve your credit and you have a bunch of old cards open, getting rid of the accounts seems logical. Unfortunately, closing old cards can hurt your credit history as much -- or more -- than opening new ones. If you close your oldest card because you don't use it any more, your credit history becomes much shorter and your score suffers. Closing cards also reduces your available credit, which makes your credit utilization ratio appear higher than it was before.\n\nIf you had an old card with a $5,000 limit and a new card with a $1,000 limit and you had a $500 balance on your new card, your overall credit utilization ratio would only be around 8% ($500/$6,000). But once you close that card with the $5,000 limit, all of a sudden your utilization rate is a much more problematic 50% credit utilization.\n\nDid you know that around one in five Americans have a mistake on their credit report? Most people aren't aware how often mistakes are made -- or how damaging those mistakes can be. In one study conducted by the Federal Trade Commission, around 20% of consumers who identified errors on at least one of their credit reports experienced a meaningful credit score increase after fixing the problem.\n\nThese 20% of consumers didn't just see their credit scores go up slightly after the problem was corrected; the increase in their score improved their credit risk tier. Where they may have been considered a poor risk before, they're now considered to be an average risk borrower, while an average rating could be bumped up so the borrower is now low-risk. This change from one tier to another could substantially reduce the costs of borrowing, and could make it possible to get loans which might otherwise have been denied.\n\nIf you don't have to go into debt, you don't want to borrow for no reason and pay interest. But, the catch 22 is that you've got to have debt in order to earn a good credit score. Not only should you use credit cards to build up a history of on-time payments, but you should also have a mix of different kinds of debt to get the highest possible credit score .\n\nBorrowing for a car or other costs you don't need help paying seems counterintuitive, but it's something to consider if you want a diverse mix of different loan types to boost your credit. One possible option: take a loan for a car or a college class and pay it off right away. However, you shouldn't do this if you have to pay high fees for the loan, if there are prepayment penalties, or if it would hurt your score more than help it.\n\nDon't forget, if you apply for new credit -- even if you're doing it to diversify your credit history -- you'll still lower your average credit age and end up with an inquiry. If you're going to go into debt for a big purchase, like buying a house, within the next year or two, it's likely not worth it to take out a loan just to improve your credit mix. But if you're not planning to borrow substantial sums any time soon and you have the chance to take a no-fee or low fee loan that will give you a new credit type on your account, it may be worth doing. Since your credit score can make a huge difference in what you pay to borrow throughout your entire life, a little extra paperwork and hassle can be worth it to boost your score.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354638", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T12:51:00Z", "sim": 0.729411780834198, "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "title": "The Motley Fool", "id": "14061"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "12:51:00", "url": "https://www.fool.com/credit-cards/2017/08/13/5-ways-you-could-be-messing-up-your-credit-score.aspx?source=iedfolrf0000001", "storyUri": "eng-3354638", "id": "8916505", "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F451235%2Fcredit-score-on-tablet-excellent.jpg&h=630&w=1200&op=resize", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "12:51:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

With the barrage of lucrative credit card sign-up bonus offers and some very nice ongoing perks just for holding a certain credit card, I'm making the most of what credit card companies are offering me.\n\nBut managing multiple credit card accounts with different banks can be a bit of a hassle. Knowing which cards to use when and how to get the most out of each of them can take some time to learn as well. And if you don't keep track of all of your cards, you might end up paying unnecessary fees.\n\nHere are some of the best tips on how to manage multiple credit cards.\n\nBefore going out and applying for a dozen new credit cards, make sure you're completely in control of your spending habits. Credit card companies will dole out tons of credit to you if you have a relatively good credit score and a stable income. But that pristine credit report can quickly turn into an embarrassment if you don't know how to manage your ballooning line of credit.\n\nYour spending should be limited to the funds available in your bank account. Unless you have a plan to take advantage of a long-term 0% intro APR card for a big, but necessary purchase, don't spend any more than you can afford to pay off at the end of the month.\n\nNot only will you get hit with late fees and interest payments, late payments will show up on your credit report. That'll make it hard to get approved for more credit cards in the future, and they affect your interest rates for major loans like mortgages and auto loans.\n\nThat means paying attention to your spending and staying on top of all of your accounts, even if they're with several different banks. Luckily, there are some tools and services that can help.\n\nEvery credit card has a few important dates that you should track. Using a simple Excel spreadsheet or just writing them down in a notebook can take care of most of the problems with managing multiple credit cards. You should know the following three dates for every credit card.\n\nWith a bunch of credit card accounts spread across multiple banks, one of the best services you can take advantage of is autopay. As mentioned above, you should know the due dates of all of your credit card bills, but it's easy to let it slip your mind for a couple days. Before you know it, you could be paying a late fee if you don't have autopay set up.\n\nIf you'd like, you can often change your payment due date by calling the bank that issued the credit card. This can make it easier to coincide your credit card payments with when you get paid. So, if you get paid on the 1st and 15th of every month, see if you can change your due dates on your two most-used cards to the 5th and 20th of the month, so the money is in your account by the time autopay hits.\n\nThere are several different online tools that can help you see credit cards from multiple issuers and their balances in one simple dashboard. Two of the most popular are Mint and Personal Capital. Mint was originally focused on budgeting while Personal Capital focused on net worth, but both now have nearly exactly the same functionality. On top of seeing all of your credit cards in one place, you can keep an eye on all your bank accounts, investment accounts, and other assets like real estate.\n\nOne caveat of services like this is that you're trusting another website with your login information for all of your financial accounts. While both Mint and Personal Capital offer bank-level security, some consumers may be uncomfortable with having their login information stored with third-party websites. But if you want to see all of your accounts in one place, there's no better option.\n\nThe main benefit of signing up for a bunch of credit cards is to use reward points for things like travel or simple cash back. But keeping track of multiple award accounts on top of keeping track of all of your credit cards can be a challenge unto itself.\n\nThe service from AwardWallet is like Mint or Personal Capital, but for travel award programs. It can show you balances for all of your airline miles, hotel points, and credit card rewards in one place. You'll have to provide login information for each award program, but savvy awards travelers can get a lot of value out of seeing all of their points in one place to build travel itineraries.\n\nAnother service, Walla.by, will help you maximize category spend bonuses based on your current location and rewards preferences. Instead of asking for your login information, you can manually tell Wallaby what credit cards you have. Its mobile app can use geolocation on your phone to recommend the best card to maximize the category bonus based on where you're shopping and how you value each type of point your various credit cards earn. That can help you increase your rewards totals faster and get the most out of carrying multiple credit cards.\n\nThe last tip for managing multiple credit cards is to take advantage of all of the extra benefits each of your cards offers.\n\nSome hotel and airline credit cards provide an automatic status upgrade, which could provide free room upgrades, late checkout, preferred seating, and even upgrades to first class. Make sure you take advantage of the status you get just for holding a credit card.\n\nOther credit cards offer extra protection over your purchases and travel plans. Many credit cards offer extended warranties and price protection on purchases, but others have even greater benefits. For example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u24c7 offers trip cancellation and interruption insurance, so if your trip is cut short or cancelled due to sickness or weather, you can be reimbursed for prepaid non-refundable expenses. You'll also receive trip delay insurance if you have to stay overnight and the airline won't offer a free hotel room. If you rent a car using the card, you get free collision insurance (decline the car rental agency's offer). Chase Sapphire Preferred\u24c7 cardmembers also receive baggage delay and lost luggage insurance. Knowing these benefits for each of your cards could save you a lot of money someday.\n\nPremium cards like the Platinum Card\u24c7 from American Express often offer annual credits for travel or airline fees, TSA Pre\u2713\u00ae or Global Entry fee reimbursement, and access to a network of airport lounges. The Platinum Card\u24c7 also offers $15 in Uber credits every month (with an extra $30 in December). Taking advantage of all of these benefits is essential for getting maximum value out of the hefty annual fees of cards like the Platinum Card\u24c7 from American Express.\n\nKnowing all of the benefits of your credit cards, and more importantly, which cards have which benefits, is the key to getting the most out of multiple credit cards. But if you don't keep up with the day-to-day maintenance and management, you'll get hit with too many fees to make it worthwhile.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354638", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T14:15:00Z", "sim": 0.729411780834198, "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "title": "The Motley Fool", "id": "14061"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "14:15:00", "url": "https://www.fool.com/credit-cards/2017/08/12/how-to-manage-multiple-credit-cards.aspx?source=iedfolrf0000001", "storyUri": "eng-3354638", "id": "8802482", "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F453127%2Fgettyimages-credit-cards-woman.jpg&h=630&w=1200&op=resize", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "14:15:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Utilization tends to have a negative impact on credit scores once it passes 30 percent.\n\nLate or missed payments can put a dent in your credit score, although the extent of the damage depends on your overall credit.\n\nHow you use credit cards can have a far-reaching impact on your finances. Your credit score affects your ability to borrow money for major purchases such as a car or home as well as how much you'll pay in interest.\n\nHow do credit cards affect your credit report?\n\nCredit score is calculated from information in your credit report. Most big card issuers report account activity to the three major credit bureaus -- Experian, Equifax and TransUnion -- every month. But some card issuers report only to one or two, or even none. If you're trying to build credit, look for a card that reports to all three; if it's not clear, contact the issuer. This way, payments will show up in your credit score, regardless of which report was used to calculate it.\n\nDoes 'no interest' always mean no interest?\n\nPromotional language such as \"no interest for 12 months\" often hides the fact that interest is accruing on a purchase. This is known as \"deferred interest,\" and it's commonly found with credit cards issued by retailers.\n\nWith deferred interest, if you pay off the purchase within the promotional period, you won't pay interest. But if any amount in the balance is left over at the end of the promotion, interest can be charged on the entire amount, going back to the time of the purchase. A balance of even 25 cents could mean that you'll have to pay hundreds of dollars in interest.\n\nBy contrast, on bank-issued credit cards with 0 percent APR promotions, interest doesn't accrue.\n\nWhat happens if you close a credit card account?\n\nClosing a credit card account lowers the amount of credit you have available, which can increase credit utilization -- and possibly hurt your credit score.\n\nRenee VerCruysse of Perris, Calif., said she learned that the hard way. \"I signed up for a couple of credit cards not knowing what the conditions were,\" VerCruysse said.\n\nAfter she closed a card, her credit score suffered. When VerCruysse applied for a car loan, she said she was rejected due to the drop in her score and her short credit history.\n\nIf a card doesn't charge an annual fee, leave the account open and making the occasional purchase with it to keep it active.\n\nMany credit cards offer substantial protections for qualifying purchases. Check with your card issuer for benefits, which may include:\n\nExtended warranty can add up to a year of coverage if there's a manufacturer's warranty.\n\nPurchase protection covers theft and damage up to 90 days after purchase.\n\nPrice protection refunds the difference when items are advertised at a lower price later.\n\nReturn protection offers a refund for items a store won't take back.\n\nBeyond those protections, many cards offer benefits such as rental car insurance, free credit scores or online shopping discounts.

purposes rather than a business credit card. But convenience often comes at a cost, and you may be missing out on business perks that can hasten your company's growth.\n\n\"A common myth is that only large companies need business credit cards, but benefits like expanded buying power, spending rewards and tracking assistance can help fuel business growth regardless of size or industry,\" says Audrey Henley, senior vice president of American Express OPEN.\n\nA 2015 American Express survey of small-business owners found that 63 percent of those with fewer than 100 employees reported having a business credit card. Here are some signs that you should consider joining them.\n\n1. Your accounting could use an overhaul.\n\nChris Van Patten, owner of New York City-based website application developer Van Patten Media, used a personal credit card when he first started his business, but realized he was paying for it at tax time.\n\n\"Keeping track of expenses on my personal card and making sure the business was properly reimbursing them had gotten jumbled and confusing, which led to me avoiding it entirely and personally eating the cost on many expenses,\" he says.\n\nSwitching to a business credit card allowed him to see all of his business purchases in one place and made it easier for him and his accountant to track card spending using business accounting software. Some small businesses may even run into problems with the Internal Revenue Service if they don't keep business and personal expenses separate.\n\n2. You have cash flow problems.\n\nMany small-business owners are all too familiar with late payments and other cash flow disruptions.\n\nSince business cards are targeted toward business owners, they tend to offer terms that are specific to that community's needs. Some may even give business owners longer to pay.\n\nFor example, American Express's Plum Card lets business owners set their own due date, get a 1.5 percent discount when they pay early, and take up to 60 days to pay with no interest added, Henley says.\n\n3. You want to set limits on employee charges.\n\nOne of the most overlooked features offered by most small-business cards is the ability to issue employee cards with spend controls and alerts, says Buck Stinson, head of small-business cards at Capital One.\n\nThat's one of the biggest perks of using a small-business credit card for AJ Saleem, the owner of Houston-based tutoring company Suprex Tutors. Three of his eight employees make work-related purchases.\n\n\"The ones who have access to credit cards have a $100 monthly spending limit, and I monitor that every cycle,\" Saleem says. \"If they have a purchase over that amount, I can temporarily raise the limit.\"\n\n4. You want to expand your buying power.\n\nBusiness cards typically offer generous rewards, such as airline travel miles, and business-specific incentives, including savings on office supplies and shipping.\n\nAaron Udler, president of software training company OfficePro in Gaithersburg, Maryland, looked for a business credit card that would give him the most rewards. Since the company spent a lot of money in office supply stores, he chose a card that offered 5x points on those purchases.\n\nSome small-business owners use business credit cards to make strategic purchases. For instance, according to Stinson, one of Capital One's Spark Business card customers charges all business expenses and uses the 2 percent cash back rewards and \"accumulated enough rewards to buy a new Sprinter van, which is going to directly help grow their business.\"\n\n5. You want higher credit limits.\n\nBusiness cards often carry higher credit limits than personal credit cards since businesses have more expenses than an individual, says Henley. Some even go beyond that.\n\nFor example, some American Express business card products, such as the Blue Business Plus and SimplyCash Plus cards, let certain cardholders spend above their credit limits, based on factors such as the card member's credit history and spending patterns.\n\n6. You want to start building a credit history for your business.\n\nWhen David Waring, co-founder of New York-based FitSmallBusiness.com, started his first venture, he used a personal credit card that was devoted entirely to business expenses.\n\nWhile this allowed him to keep things separate, as the business grew larger and he switched from a sole proprietorship to an LLC, he knew he might eventually want to apply for bigger loans and would want a strong business credit profile.\n\n\"The business card let me start building credit for the business separate from myself,\" he says.\n\nGetting approved\n\nGetting approved for a small-business credit card is much like getting approved for a personal card.\n\n\"When you're ready to apply, expect the card issuer to consider many of the same factors required for consumer cards, including your credit rating, debt amounts, bill payment track record and creditworthiness,\" Stinson says. They may also require you to include your business's tax ID number, standard industry code and legal entity structure.\n\nThere is one important thing to remember: A business credit card doesn't take away your personal responsibility for the debt. Credit card issuers typically have the business owner guarantee the debt, so if you default, the issuer would report it to commercial credit bureaus, which could hurt your credit score, warns small-business adviser Brad Kingsley.\n\nIn addition, business and corporate cards are not covered by consumer protections set forth by the Credit CARD Act of 2009, most meaningful perhaps is that issuers can hike card APRs without notice.\n\n\"There are many good reasons to split business activities from your personal ones, but understand that quite often the owner is on the hook whether the purchase flowed through a personal card or not,\" Kingsley says.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354638", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T13:35:00Z", "sim": 0.6823529601097107, "source": {"uri": "creditcards.com", "title": "creditcards.com", "id": "13253"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "13:35:00", "url": "http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/6-reasons-entrepreneurs-should-get-business-card.php", "storyUri": "eng-3354638", "id": "8626081", "image": "http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/images/can-u-benefit-from-sm-business-card.png", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "13:35:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

The bank has announced that it will roll out its own offering in the popular credit card category in September, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe card will charge a $95 annual fee. That may seem like a hefty price tag, but it's meaningfully below competitors like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and American Express (NYSE:AXP), which charge $450 and $550, respectively, for their analogous premium rewards cards.\n\nBank of America's Premium Rewards card offers the same litany of tiered rewards based on the type of purchase, giving cardholders the most points for money spent on travel and dining. But unlike these other cards, the exact size of the rewards will be conditioned on how much money customers have at the bank in checking, savings, and investment accounts.\n\nSource: The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTo the untrained eye, this could seem like Bank of America's belated effort to jump on the premium rewards card train, so to speak, before it leaves the station.\n\nAmerican Express has long been the standard bearer in the premium credit card space. And when JPMorgan Chase joined the fray last year, the bank literally couldn't keep up with the demand for its Sapphire Reserve Card, which charged a $450 annual fee, but came with 100,000 bonus points -- which has since been cut to 50,000 points.\n\nBut this isn't quite right. The truth is that Bank of America's new premium rewards card goes nicely with the bank's more overarching strategy of capturing a greater share of its customers' wallets.\n\nIn the lead-up to the financial crisis, Bank of America was focused on growing through acquisitions. Under its former CEO, it bought two major banks, a wealth manager, a major credit card issuer, and a mortgage originator. And on the fateful weekend in September 2008 when Lehman Brothers failed, it purchased Merrill Lynch.\n\nSince then, however, Bank of America has redirected its efforts exclusively to internal growth. Its CEO Brian Moynihan refers to this strategy as responsible growth.\n\nThis comes through in the design of its rewards tiers, tying the tiers to how much money a cardholder has in their accounts at Bank of America. This incentivizes users of the card to not only maximize their deposits at the bank, but it will also presumably translate into lower charge-off rates, as the most avid users are likely to maintain high balances of cash and other types of liquid assets with which to pay their credit card bills.\n\nIn short, while Bank of America may be the last of the major credit card issuers to jump into the premium rewards arena, it's doing so in a unique way that could benefit the bank more holistically.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2008-09-", "textEnd": 2020, "textStart": 2006}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354638", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T15:31:00Z", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "title": "The Motley Fool", "id": "14061"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "15:31:00", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/08/12/bank-of-america-joins-the-premium-rewards-card-gam.aspx", "storyUri": "eng-3354638", "id": "8810532", "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F453629%2Fcredit-cards.jpg&h=630&w=1200&op=resize", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "15:31:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

That popularity came with a short-term cost, however: JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the cards' perks ended up cutting the bank's fourth-quarter profit by up to $300 million.\n\n(JPMorgan Chase via AP)\n\nCitigroup just unveiled an updated version of its premium credit card, the Citi Prestige. The new card is made of metal-like its direct competitors, Chase Sapphire Reserve and American Express Platinum-and comes with attractive perks including free nights at hotels, an annual $250 air travel credit, and a signup bonus of 75,000 points, which, according to Citi, are worth $935 in air travel.\n\nThere's a catch, though: To get those 75,000 points, cardholders must spend $7,500 on the card in the first three months.\n\nThat's a dramatic increase from the Prestige's previous minimum of $4,000 over the same time frame. Citi, the world's largest issuer of credit cards, isn't the only bank making it harder to qualify for signup bonuses. When American Express relaunched its Platinum card in March, the minimum spending requirement jumped from $3,000 to $5,000.\n\nSpending a couple thousand dollars a month on a card is no problem for the affluent, globe-trotting customers who are the traditional audience for premium cards. But it's a much heavier lift for the younger customers who have recently been flocking to the cards.\n\n\"It's going to considerably shrink the size of the audience that would be receptive to that card,\" said Matt Schulz, senior analyst at CreditCards.com. \"That's probably the point.\" The minimum spending requirement shows whom Citi is targeting with the new offer, he said, and \"it's clearly not your average credit card holder.\"\n\nA Citi spokeswoman declined to comment on the Prestige's spending requirement.\n\nWhen Chase released its Sapphire Reserve card last year with a signup bonus of 100,000 points, it was such a hit with consumers that the bank temporarily ran out of metal to make the cards. That popularity came with a short-term cost, however: JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the cards' perks ended up cutting the bank's fourth-quarter profit by up to $300 million.\n\nChase's new card set off a rewards war among major U.S. banks, each competing to win customers with more generous perks. U.S. Bancorp introduced a premium rewards card, the Altitude Reserve, in May. After relaunching the Amex Platinum, American Express said it spent $1.9 billion on rewards in the second quarter, the most in at least nine years, while adding 2.7 million new cardholders.\n\nWhile banks compete for new customers, they also want to make sure they'll ultimately make money on them. It's a delicate balance.\n\nBy requiring a minimum spend, banks hope \"to jump-start your use of the card and hopefully make it your go-to card,\" said John Ganotis, founder of Credit Card Insider. Raising the minimum brings in more interchange fees-the small percentage of each credit card transaction retailers pay to banks and card networks -- and also potentially boosts interest payments on any debt customers run up. Another goal of raising the minimum, Ganotis said, may be scaring away so-called credit card churners, people who open multiple cards to collect bonuses but don't become loyal customers.\n\nCredit card rewards have proven especially popular with younger Americans. Millennials drove the popularity of Chase Sapphire Reserve, and Citi said the age group makes up almost half of Prestige's existing customers.\n\nWhen card issuers raise minimum spending requirements, they risk turning off these consumers. There's a limited supply of affluent millennials who can afford the higher spending requirements without overspending or racking up lots of debt. In the most recent U.S. Census Bureau data, the median household income for Americans age 25 to 34 was $57,366.\n\nFrank Leppar, 30, would be a prime candidate for the Citi Prestige. A blogger for Loophole Travel and a technology director for a school district, Leppar loves to travel and has built up a stash of reward points from other cards. But Leppar and his wife, a paralegal, \"make middle-class money,\" he said, so he's wary of the Prestige's $7,500 spending requirement.\n\nStill, he's tempted. He already has the Amex Platinum and Chase Sapphire Reserve. \"For anyone who travels somewhat regularly, both cards pay themselves off rather quickly,\" he said.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354638", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T12:37:00Z", "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "source": {"uri": "dailyherald.com", "title": "Daily Herald", "id": "180"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "12:37:00", "url": "http://www.dailyherald.com/business/20170813/why-credit-card-rewards-are-getting-harder-to-earn", "storyUri": "eng-3349746", "id": "8915158", "image": "http://www.dailyherald.com/storyimage/DA/20170813/BUSINESS/170819826/AR/0/AR-170819826.jpg&updated=201708111011&imageversion=Facebook&exactH=630&exactW=1200&exactfit=crop&noborder", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "12:37:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

This compensation may impact how and where products appear on this site (including, for example, the order in which they appear). This site does not include all credit card companies or all available credit card offers.\n\nEditor's note: The Chase Slate offer is no longer available through our site.\n\nZero interest can last forever -- if you never carry a balance.\n\nBut if you can't always afford to pay your bill in full, it's nice to know there are some credit cards out there that give you an interest-free pass for more than a year.\n\nThe experts at CreditCards.com picked their favorite credit cards from a number of categories. Here are the best 0 interest credit cards on their list.\n\nIt doesn't have much in the way of rewards bells and whistles, but the PNC Core Visa does have one of the lowest interest rates available. Plus, it comes with an extended interest-free period on purchases and balance transfers. Compare this with the best balance transfer credit cards available.\n\nHighlights:\n\nWho should get this card\n\nThe PNC Core Visa -- and its accompanying zero-percent interest intro offer -- is a fit for someone with a lot of existing credit card debt or who plans on doing some heavy-duty spending. Use this card to significantly pay down a big purchase or tackle that home-improvement project without it costing you more in interest charges over the long-term.But only those with stellar credit are likely to get approved for the card's lowest APR. And remember, there are no sign-up bonuses or rewards, something competing cards offer.\n\nAlthough there are other cards with lower standard rates, Citi Diamond Preferred stands out for its lengthy interest-free introductory period for purchases and balance transfers -- and its attached perks.\n\nHighlights:\n\nWho should get this card\n\nThis card is good for those who are looking to shed debt or anyone considering an expensive purchase that they want to pay off over a nearly two-year period.You'll have to mind the balance transfer fee, which is $5 or 3 percent of the balance you plan to transfer. And if you plan to carry a balance after the promotional period expires, know that you might be able to find a better interest rate elsewhere.\n\nIf you're looking to cut interest charges and earn cash back on everything, the SunTrust Cash Rewards credit card offers a good blend of the two. You'll earn decent rewards on gas and grocery purchases, and you'll pay no interest on purchases or balance transfers for 15 months.\n\nHighlights:\n\nWho should get this card\n\nSunTrust account holders benefit the most from this card. Depending on your deposit relationship, you can earn an additional bonus of 10 to 75 percent. For example, SunTrust Signature Advantage account holders with at $100,000 on deposit will earn a 50 percent cash-back bonus. That means for every $100 in rewards you earn, SunTrust will add another $50 on top.\n\nLow interest credit cards are typically sought out by those looking to transfer a good-sized balance or those who want to make a big purchase and minimize the additional interest accrued over time.

Anyone with a credit card runs some risk of building up debt.\n\nBut credit cards can also help college students learn how to track spending, pay bills responsibly and avoid interest and fees. Perhaps most important, credit cards give young adults and their parents a chance to talk about finances at least once a month, when the bill comes.\n\nFor those reasons, financial experts say credit cards can be a valuable tool for teaching your college student how to budget, as long as you follow some ground rules:\n\nLet your college student make some (minor) mistakes\n\nThe Credit Card Act of 2009 makes it hard for college students who don't have an independent income to qualify for a credit card on their own, so many students first become authorized users on a parent's card.\n\nTo reduce the risk of overspending, parents could add a student to a card with a low credit limit, such as $500 or $1,000. \"Parents can see all of the activity and coach them,\" says Jennifer Harper, founder and director of Bridge Financial Planning in Chattanooga, Tenn. The risk, though, is that if a student overspends, it could hurt the parent's credit score.\n\nAt the same time, Harper says, allowing your college student to make some mistakes might prove helpful in the long run. If they spend more than planned one month, you can talk about what happened and how to prevent it in the future, she says. \"Now they can still be teachable moments -- later it will be bigger dollars without parental guidance,\" she says.\n\nStress the importance of paying in full\n\nWhen you pay your credit card balance in full every month, you don't get charged interest. Further, committing to paying in full requires you to live within your means -- spending only what you can afford. Helping a student understand this can lower the chances that he or she will rack up debt later.\n\n\"Show them a credit card statement,\" Harper suggests, and walk them through how to review the charges, check the interest rate on the card and understand any fees.\n\nSchedule a monthly chat\n\nThe monthly credit card bill is an opportunity to review spending with your college student, and spending is easier to track with a card than if you're using cash. That's what Preeti Shah, a financial planner in Matawan, N.J., found when she worked with clients who had a son in college on their household budget.\n\nAt first, the couple deposited a flat amount into their son's bank account each month, which he supplemented with part-time work. But he quickly burned through his money and never seemed able to pinpoint where it went.\n\nWhen the couple switched their son to a credit card, they were better able to monitor his spending -- and realized he was spending far too much at restaurants instead of using his meal plan.\n\nPick a card that earns rewards\n\nIf your college student is using a credit card, he or she might as well be earning rewards for purchases.\n\nHelen Ngo, a financial planner and founder of Capital Benchmark Partners in Atlanta, says she encourages parents and students to use cards that give cash rewards for spending in specific categories that are common in college students' budgets, such as gas and groceries. This teaches how to get the most out of a credit card, in addition to how to use one responsibly.\n\nHelp your child build credit\n\nAuthorized user status can help your college student build credit, so the new graduate will have a strong credit score along with that diploma. \"It's nice to build your credit history early,\" says Brian Hanks, a financial planner in Salt Lake City.\n\nEven more important, he says, is learning to take responsibility for one's spending. \"Most college kids are ready,\" he says.\n\nAnd if they're not, making a few mistakes now could help them get there.\n\nMORE:\n\nWhat to do if you can't get a student credit card\n\nBest college student credit cards of 2017\n\nThe 3 different kinds of cash-back credit cards\n\nKimberly Palmer is a staff writer at NerdWallet, a personal finance website.

According to the latest update from the Federal Reserve, credit card debt stood at $1.027 trillion, an all-time high that now surpasses the record that was set about a decade ago. That's great news for a U.S. economy that's approximately 70% based on consumption, but worrisome news for the roughly seven in 10 adults in the U.S. who have at least one credit card in their wallet.\n\nIf used properly, credit cards can actually be a useful tool that helps save money over the long run. Adhering to the five factors that influence your credit score, and working to push your credit score into the \"excellent\" or \"good\" category, can improve your choices when you need a loan, as well as provide you with lower interest rate options, which over the long run could be saving you thousands or tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nBut there's an even more worrisome addendum to Americans simply hitting a new all-time high in terms of revolving credit card debt. As noted by CreditCards.com on Aug. 2, the national average annual percentage rate (APR) for new card offers climbed to an all-time record high of 16.13%. Prior to 2017, the previous record-high for APRs was 15.29%, implying an 84-basis-point jump in annual lending rates from the all-time high. The fact that the Federal Reserve has raised its federal funds target by 25 basis points on three separate occasions since December 2016 has meant that lenders have passed along interest rate hikes to consumers with credit cards that have variable rate APRs (which is practically all credit cards).\n\nIn other words, credit card debt is at an all-time high, and the interest rate card-carrying consumers have to pay to service their revolving debt, if they don't pay it off each month, is at an all-time high. That's not a very good combination.\n\nAccording to TransUnion, on average, a 25-basis-point increase in lending rates only translates into a $6.45 increase in consumers' credit card balances, with CreditCards.com suggesting that 82% of Americans see a jump of less than $10 a month in financing costs with a quarter-point rate hike. Comparatively, 1% of the population sees their debt-servicing costs increase more than $50 a month with a quarter-point hike.\n\nNevertheless, we've seen this story play out before, and it's only a matter of time, if consumers don't keep a watchful eye on their debt and spending habits, before something bad happens. Matt Schulz, CreditCards.com's senior industry analyst, had this to say: \"America's credit card balances have never been higher, but there's no reason to think they won't just keep climbing. Combine that with steadily rising interest rates and you have a potentially volatile mix.\"\n\nThese all-time highs serve as a warning that consumers need to be more prudent with their spending habits and their credit cards in general.\n\nBeginning first with spending habits, the single most useful thing consumers can do to improve their chances of not falling into a credit card debt trap is implementing a household budget. A 2013 Gallup poll found that a mere 32% of U.S. households was sticking to a monthly household budget, which is far too low. Without a budget, it's very difficult to get a good understanding of your cash flow, and without understanding your cash flow, you can't optimally adjust your spending and saving habits.\n\nFormulating a budget is considerably easier than it was a decade or more ago. Budgeting software can be found online, which means you can access it from anywhere, wirelessly, and in many cases for free. It also handles all the math for you, which should be a sigh of relief for you math-phobic people out there.\n\nThe far tougher challenge is actually sticking to a formulated budget and to that end here are a handful of suggestions:\n\nThe other side of this equation to keep yourself out of steep credit card debt involves staying in the good graces of your lenders. Remember, the higher your credit score and the more creditworthy you're seen by lenders, the more the ball will be in your court when it comes to negotiating for new credit cards and for a few other perks I'll note below.\n\nAs mentioned above, five factors influence your credit score:\n\nYour ability to make payments on time, and utilizing less than 30% of your aggregate credit available, combines to account for about 65% of your credit score, with everything else a pretty distance second. Being prudent about your credit usage and paying your bills on time when you do use your credit cards can really boost your credit score in a fairly short amount of time. And a higher credit score gives you a big bargaining chip.\n\nIf you're late on a payment, but you've had a long history of on-time payments, request that your lender forgive the late payment. Chances are, more often than not, your lender will overlook a rare late payment, especially if you have a good or excellent credit score. It's far costlier for lenders to find new customers than to appease and keep existing ones with an occasional concession.\n\nLikewise, never be afraid to ask your lender to lower your credit card interest rate. Studies have shown that lenders are more likely than not to lower your rate if you ask. Unfortunately, most people don't ask, because they either don't realize they can or they're afraid they'll be told \"no.\" And let me tell you, there are far worse things in this world than being told \"no.\"\n\nIf you follow these credit basics and stay smart with your spending habits, you should have a good chance to avoid becoming an unwanted credit card statistic.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-02", "textEnd": 1047, "textStart": 1041}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-12-", "textEnd": 1442, "textStart": 1429}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354638", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T11:04:00Z", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "title": "The Motley Fool", "id": "14061"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "11:04:00", "url": "https://www.fool.com/credit-cards/2017/08/12/credit-card-debt-just-hit-an-all-time-high-and-so.aspx?source=iedfolrf0000001", "storyUri": "eng-3354638", "id": "8781793", "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F453636%2Fcredit-card-score-worry-late-payment-fico-getty.jpg&h=630&w=1200&op=resize", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "11:04:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

all while watching a free cooking demonstration by a famed chef.\n\nIt's the kind of perk that Chase Sapphire cards have become known for as the New York bank successfully woos customers who like food and travel, despite a hefty $450 annual fee for the Sapphire Reserve card. Any fan who has this card or the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card, which has a lower fee, can stop by the hospitality venue this week by just showing their card.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, cardholders circulated in and out of the tent, grabbing free waters, checking out golf from the porch and buying drinks from the cash bar. Amid the clatter, chef Todd English chatted with the crowd as he whipped up a tuna poke dish packed inside a colorful dragon fruit. Servers walked around distributing his creation.\n\n\"You guys from what I've heard are the biggest foodies of of any of the credit card companies out there,\" English, known for a number of restaurants and a PBS cooking show, said as he bantered with the audience.\n\nThe Sapphire Reserve card made its debut about a year ago in the latest effort by banks to woo customers, especially millennials, with high-end cards that come with expensive annual fees but also big rewards points and perks. The Reserve card has been a hit, even spurring new members to post videos of themselves \"unboxing\" their cards when they come in the mail.\n\nSome of its perks include three-times rewards on travel and dining and a $300 annual travel credit.\n\nAmerican Express pioneered high-end credit cards, but now faces competition from Chase, Citigroup and Barclaycard, said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, which tracks the industry. Charlotte-based Bank of America is also launching a new high-end card, but with a lower annual fee.\n\n\"Exclusive experiences is now required for all upscale cards,\" Robertson said.\n\nJPMorgan Chase doesn't release cardholders numbers, but the bank overall is the largest U.S. card-card issuer, with more than 16 percent market share, based on outstanding balances, according to The Nilson Report. Bank of America is No. 2 at 11.6 percent.\n\nChase's Sapphire card has been the official card of the PGA Championship for three years. In addition to the free hospitality area, the bank also sells special ticket packages for the event.\n\nThe cardmember club is a unique benefit because typically you need a special invite to come out to a hospitality tent at a golf tournament, said Lisa Walker, the Chase executive who oversees the cards.\n\n\"It allows people to experience the tournament in a special way,\" said Walker, who is on-site this week at Quail Hollow. \"It's a unique benefit most people don't get a chance to enjoy.\"\n\nA recent Wall Street Journal report said the high-end rewards paid out by the card were leading to a need for cost-cutting in the business unit. Walker, however, said the bank hasn't ordered cost cuts because of the Sapphire cards, although it's always looking to become more efficient companywide.\n\nOn Thursday, the hospitality tent off the first hole was decked out with a wood floor, high-end bar and Chase insignias. In addition to the cooking demonstration, some cardmembers, who are allowed to bring a guest, were happy to simply take a break at one of the tables.\n\n\"We just walked by and saw it,\" said Theresa Hall, who was relaxing at a table with Tom Kendrick. \"They have nice bathrooms. Free waters. It's nice here.\"\n\nJessica Sack was another customer who also happened to notice the tent and decided to stop by. She ended up getting a free tuna poke, hand-made by English in the demonstration.\n\n\"I love Todd English,\" Sack said as she cradled the dish. \"I didn't even know he would be here. I'm excited to try it.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354638", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-10T18:00:00Z", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "title": "The Charlotte Observer", "id": "46"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "21:21:00", "url": "http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/business/article166511622.html", "storyUri": "eng-3349746", "id": "8489074", "image": "http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/business/12l80b/picture166511612/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/PGA_THURSDAY_CHASE_06", "date": "2017-08-10", "time": "18:00:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-10"}

debit and credit cards is used for online shopping the latest figures from the Central Bank of Ireland have revealed.\n\nInternet shopping makes up half of the transactions made with credit cards, and just over a third with debit cards.\n\nOverall debit card point of sale transactions in Ireland were worth \u20ac2.9bn in June, up 16% higher than the same month in 2016.\n\nThe data also shows that the public are increasing the amount of spending they are putting on their credit cards, with spending on plastic up 5% on the same period in 2016.\n\nDebit card transaction online amounted to \u20ac873 million, more than one quarter higher than the same month a year ago.\n\nExperts believe that the growing popularity of contactless payments is also driving the move away from cash.\n\nPeople are also using debit cards more while on holiday abroad.\n\nThe figures show that total debit and credit card spending outside Ireland amounted to \u20ac1.1 billion in the three months to the end of June, some 17 per cent higher than the corresponding period last year.\n\n\"Credit or debit card expenditure outside Ireland provides an indication of expenditure abroad by Irish tourists,\" a spokesperson for the Central Bank said.\n\n\"A large seasonal effect can be seen in the data, particularly for debit cards, with higher expenditures outside Ireland recorded in the summer months than in the winter months,\" it added.\n\nThe figures also revealed how people are spending their money.\n\nSpending on professional services has increased by 27% in the last year.\n\nIrish families are also spending more on treating themselves to dinner out or days out - a sign that consumer confidence is returning.\n\nBut the stats could also reveal that Irish people are beginning to build up debt on their credit cards again.\n\nAt the end of June there was over \u20ac1.1bn in outstanding credit card balances owed.\n\nSeven percent of accounts has exceeded their agreed credit limits and almost a third had balances between 74-100% of their credit limit.\n\nBut despite a slight year on year rise the outstanding balances represent a 3% drop in the same categories from the amounts recorded when the series began in January 2015.\n\nCredit card are expected to become more popualr in the next twelve months as consumers will no longer have to pay surcharges for using credit cards from the start of next year.\n\nNew European Union rules will ban the charge that can add up to 2% to the cost of goods or services.\n\nBut the revised EU Payment Services Directive will ban surcharging on all payment cards - potentially making spending on plastic more popular.\n\nRead More Today's top stories", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date":

Churners don't make for good business.\n\nSo how is Bank of America distinguishing its Premium Rewards card? For starters, it will have a lower bonus, lower minimum-spending threshold to earn that bonus, and lower annual fee.\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, the points cardholders will earn directly correspond with how much money they have at the bank, rewarding those enrolled in their Preferred Rewards program who have deeper ties and are less likely to cut and run.\n\nBI Intelligence's Jaime Toplin explains:\n\n\"At its base, consumers get two rewards points for travel and dining, and 1.5 for everything else -- a platform similar to 'mass-market' cards, according to the WSJ. But the firm also has a tiered system in place, where consumers with active BofA accounts can get higher rewards based on their account balances, with totals of up to 3.5 and 2.6 points, respectively, available to consumers. This system could help the card attract and incentivize lucrative customers without sacrificing mass appeal, ultimately broadening its user base.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354638", "details": {"liCnt": 14}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T13:14:00Z", "sim": 0.6039215922355652, "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "title": "Business Insider", "id": "711"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "13:14:00", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/top-travel-reward-credit-cards-bank-of-america-vs-sapphire-reserve-2017-8", "storyUri": "eng-3354638", "id": "8795975", "image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/598e14bed9a6a01b008b4f9e-1190-625/bank-of-america-just-revealed-its-new-travel-rewards-credit-card-heres-how-it-compares-to-the-chase-sapphire-reserve-and-others.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "13:14:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

We purposefully didn't add our Wells Fargo credit card to the bankruptcy so we could keep using it. The day it was final, Wells Fargo canceled it, and won't give us another one.\n\nI've applied to other companies and have been turned down.\n\nIf I get a credit card that is savings-based, does my credit score know the difference between a credit card with or without a savings-based account? And, will a credit card of this type help my score?\n\nThanks for your help,\n\nSteve\n\nAccording to the American Bankruptcy Institute, during the first six months of 2017, there were about 400,000 non-business bankruptcy filings in the United States. Sound high? During the first six months of 2009, there were nearly 700,000 filings.\n\nWhile filing bankruptcy isn't easy, it's often a relief. It begins when you determine it's time to file, (a question I address in \"Ask Stacy: When Should You File Bankruptcy?\") and ends after the dust settles and you're on the road to rebuilding your credit.\n\nRebuilding credit after a bankruptcy isn't easy, but it is simple. I'll answer Steve's questions as I lay out the steps.\n\nWhile there are techniques you can use to begin re-establishing credit immediately after a bankruptcy, getting back to a great credit history and score is going to take time.\n\nChapter 7 and Chapter 11 bankruptcies remain on your credit history for up to 10 years, while a discharged Chapter 13 will fall off after a maximum of seven. That doesn't mean you won't get credit for seven or 10 years -- you might be able to get it the same day your filing goes through. And as time passes and the negative effect on your credit fades, it will get easier.\n\nBut it's important to know there's no trick that will magically erase your bankruptcy or instantly give your credit score a significant boost. Rule of thumb: If anyone promises a quick fix, they're lying.\n\nIt's no surprise Wells Fargo canceled Steve's credit card the instant his bankruptcy became final. But that doesn't mean getting new credit will be impossible, even right away.\n\nWhen you're ready to get back in the saddle, the credit card Steve described -- a secured card -- will be your easiest ride. As the name implies, secured cards require a security deposit matching your credit limit. So if you get a card with a $500 credit limit, you'll put up $500 as collateral. Since your deposit guarantees your credit line, it's very low-risk for the bank, which means you'll have high odds of being approved. After successfully using a secured card for a period of time, that issuer or another one may offer more traditional plastic.\n\nBefore you get a secured card, however, make sure it will report your transactions to credit reporting agencies like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. Banks are not required to report your payment history, and some secured credit cards don't -- which makes them useless in rebuilding credit.\n\nWe offer some options for secured cards in the \"Secured\" section of our credit card page.\n\nNow, for Steve's questions:\n\nAnother thing Steve might consider is opening an account with a credit union. In addition to offering lower rates on loans and higher rates on savings (See \"12 Great Reasons to Drop Your Bank and Join a Credit Union\"), credit unions sometimes (but not always) are more flexible with lending standards. So it might be easier to get a credit card, car loan or signature loan there than at a big national bank. Don't expect miracles, however, and do expect to begin your credit union relationship with a savings deposit.\n\nOne final idea for positive additions to a credit history: You can ask utilities and other companies to report your on-time behavior.\n\nIn February 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau began seeking public feedback on \"the benefits and risks of tapping alternative data sources such as bills for mobile phones and rent payments to make lending decisions about consumers whose lack of credit history might otherwise block opportunities.\"\n\nSo maybe someday soon these types of payments will be counted in credit scores. In the meantime, these companies might report your payments if you ask. But don't hold your breath. See our stories \"8 Little-Known Ways to Raise Your Credit Score\" and \"Credit Scores Hit New Highs -- Learn How to Boost Yours.\"\n\nI know what you're thinking -- duh. But I mention this because it's the single most important thing you'll do to rebuild your credit, and it's often left out in favor of things that don't matter nearly as much -- like getting a secured credit card.\n\nIt takes time to create a bad credit history, but not as long as it takes to create a good one. So be patient, get what credit you can, then pay on time. As your bankruptcy fades into the past, your credit score will rise. And as you learn to live without credit, by the time it's back where it used to be, you may not care all that much about it anyway.\n\nYou can ask a question simply by hitting \"reply\" to our email newsletter.

And with consumers now caring more about the type of rewards being offered than any other card feature, competition to offer the most lucrative and attractive rewards has intensified dramatically.\n\nBut it's also important to note that offering such high-valued rewards comes at a price -- Chase's Sapphire Reserve card ended up reducing the bank's profits by $200 million to $300 million in Q4 2016, according to Bloomberg. And as costs continue to rise, issuers will have to adjust to this new landscape by leveraging technology and partnerships to keep consumers engaged without sacrificing profits.\n\nAyoub Aouad, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed credit card rewards explainer that:", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354638", "details": {"liCnt": 5}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T14:12:00Z", "sim": 0.5843137502670288, "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "title": "Business Insider", "id": "711"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "14:12:00", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/bank-of-america-to-offer-premium-rewards-card-2017-8", "storyUri": "eng-3354638", "id": "8633350", "image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/598d99c0cb9701301e8b45ba-1190-625/bank-of-america-to-offer-premium-rewards-card.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "14:12:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Budgeting is the process of documenting the amount of money you receive and spend within a specific period of time. Usually this is tracked on a monthly basis. The goal of a budget is to ensure you are meeting your basic needs -- and some wants -- without spending more money than you actually have or will receive.\n\nStart by writing down all of your income and expenses. This income may come from a part-time job or possibly your parents in the form of an allowance. Next, write down how much you spend monthly on items such as lunches, Starbucks lattes, movies, clothes, music, etc. Do you have money left at the end of the month? Or do you run out before the end of the month and need to ask your parents for more? If you have money left at the end of the month, you are living within your budget. If you are running out of money prior to the end of the month, you are not. It is key to determine why.\n\nMaybe you can afford to buy a Starbucks latte once a week, but not three times. Some of your expenses may be for a need, such as eating lunch. It is your option to bring a lunch from home or to purchase it. Some purchases are wants, such as buying a new outfit or that Starbucks latte. If you are not living within your budget and need to reduce your expenses, your wants are usually the first items to reduce or eliminate. But not always. Maybe in lieu of buying lunch you choose to save money by bringing your lunch from home. By making this trade off, at the end of the month you may have saved enough money to spend it on a new outfit.\n\nBudgeting will help you prioritize your spending, earmark money to save for the future, and plan for your short- and long-term goals.\n\nSavings accounts are used to hold money at your bank for longer periods than in a checking account. Because you are lending your bank money, they will pay you interest in return. Banks will take the money you deposit in your savings and lend it to someone else, charging a fee or interest. They make money on the spread, the difference between what they pay you and the interest they charge on the loans they fund with your money. Savings accounts don't typically have check-writing privileges or debit cards attached to them, making it a bit more difficult for you to access this cash.\n\nLearning to be diligent about saving at a young age will make a tremendous impact on your lifestyle, especially when you are older. Accumulating cash or investments is empowering. Eventually, you may be able to purchase a car outright, buy a home, or retire earlier than planned. The more money you save, the more control you have over your destiny. And at some point, if you save and invest regularly, you should be able to live off the income generated by your investments; that saved money is now working for you! By starting early, you benefit from compounding -- and your small sums of money can grow into large amounts over time.\n\nCompounding is the process where the value of an investment increases because the earnings on an investment, earn interest as time passes. This exponential growth occurs because the total growth of an investment, along with its principal, earn money in the next period.\n\nFor example, if you save $100 per month for 50 years in an account that does not pay interest, you will accumulate $60,000. If you take that same $100 per month and place it in an account that pays 5 percent interest compounded daily for 50 years, you will have saved $269,547.84. That's a huge difference!\n\nAn easy calculator to run compound interest calculations is found on Investor.gov, it is called the Compound Interest Calculator and Savings Goal Calculator. Here, you can see how much money you will earn if you invest a certain amount of money and it grows by a certain interest rate over time.\n\nEventually, you will accumulate enough cash in your account to consider investing. Investing involves putting money into stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or real estate, among other things. Sometimes these options are called investment vehicles, which is just another way of saying \"a way to invest.\" All investment vehicles have risk, so it is important to diversify your investments. The goal of investing in a diversified portfolio is to put your money to work for you so that it earns more money than a basic savings account will pay you. Even though this is a simple idea, it is an important concept to understand.\n\nCredit is borrowing money to purchase goods and services with the promise that you will pay the money back at a later date. This means you are making the purchase with a loan and not the cash in your pocket or bank account. Credit is important. Without credit, it is difficult or impossible to purchase a home or a car unless you have the cash saved to purchase the item outright.\n\nWhen you apply for credit, it is very important to understand what you are signing up for. Often there are fees and charges that are not obvious to you when you are signing the application. Don't be shy about asking questions when you are applying for credit until you are comfortable with the answers.\n\nCredit cards are a good tool to use when starting out. They are easy to access and, if properly managed, are a good way to establish credit. Just be wary of the fine print.\n\nBefore you sign up for a credit card, make sure you understand the answers to the following questions:\n\nWhat is the annual percentage rate (APR)? (This is the cost of credit, expressed as a yearly rate.)\n\nWhat is the periodic rate? (This is the rate of interest the credit card company is charging you for the loan if you do not pay your credit card balance off at the end of the month.)\n\nWhat is the APR for cash advances? (A cash advance is when you borrow cash from your credit card. The interest rate may be much higher than the APR for purchasing items with your credit card.)\n\nWhat is the grace period? (This is the number of days that you have to pay the bill in full before interest is charged.)\n\nIs there an annual fee? (Sometimes the credit card company will charge you an annual fee just to have the card.)\n\nWhat is the late payment fee? (If you make a late payment, you are often charged an additional fee.)\n\nWhat happens if you default? (If you skip a payment, your monthly APR will likely increase and your credit rating may be negatively impacted. This could make it more expensive or impossible to borrow money for a major purchase like a home or a car.)\n\nWhen you apply for a credit card, a loan, or insurance, a file is created on you. This file is managed by credit reporting companies and the information is called your credit report. Your payment history and the amount of credit that you have is tracked over your lifetime. Managing your credit is very important. If you have negative credit -- perhaps because you are not making your loan payments on time or at all -- it can take up to seven years to be removed from your credit report. Some negative credit issues, such as a bankruptcy, can take up to 10 years to be removed from your credit report.\n\nPoor credit history can make it difficult for you to rent an apartment, get a car loan, or even find a job. To manage your credit:\n\nReview the charges (debits) and the payments (credits) posted to your monthly credit card and loan account statements.\n\nPay your bills on time each month. Late fees will likely be assessed if a bill is not paid on time.\n\nBe very careful about over-extending yourself with too much credit. Often people have too many credit cards and cannot pay off their balances at the end of the month. This can become a very dangerous cycle. Only charge what you can pay off in a short period of time. Excluding the loan for a home or a car, if you cannot pay off the debt in a short period of time, you probably should delay your purchase until you can better afford it.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354638", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T10:25:00Z", "sim": 0.5647059082984924, "source": {"uri": "pe.com", "title": "Press Enterprise", "id": "1785"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "17:28:00", "url": "http://www.pe.com/2017/08/12/women-on-money-and-mindset-5-lessons-for-youths/", "storyUri": "eng-3354638", "id": "8822896", "image": "http://www.pe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/womenbiz2.jpg?w=640", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "10:25:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

For no more than $100 every five years, you can skip the long security lines when you first arrive at the airport or have to pass through customs when returning from an international trip. To add icing to the cake, select credit cards will also pay your application fee.\n\nThere are a few things to know about Global Entry. First off, Global Entry requires a valid passport and is good for international and domestic travel. The application fee is $100 every five years.\n\nTSA Precheck doesn't require a passport to be approved and only allows you to move through the expedited security lines for domestic travel. The application fee is $85 every five years. This can be the better option if you rarely travel abroad, or do not have time to visit a Global Entry enrollment center to complete the security interview.\n\nSeveral travel credit cards will give you a credit for the Global Entry & TSA Precheck fees. All the travel credit cards are listed in order of the credit card issuer.\n\nThe Platinum Card from American Express has an annual fee of $550. Each year, you receive a $200 annual air travel credit and $200 in Uber credits.\n\nOther flight-related rewards include complimentary access to The Centurion, International American Express, Delta Sky Club, and Priority Pass Select airport lounge programs. You will also earn 5 points per $1 on airline and hotel purchases, making the Amex Platinum the best card for earning airline rewards miles.\n\nIf you invest with Charles Schwab, the American Express Platinum Card for Schwab has all the same benefits as the regular Amex Platinum. The one difference is that you can redeem your Amex Membership Rewards points for deposits that can be invested.\n\nThis invitation-only travel credit card from Amex will also reimburse your TSA Precheck and Global Entry fees. You will also enjoy Platinum Medallion status with the American Express Centurion Black Card in addition to a few other elevated membership benefits.\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Reserve provides you a $300 annual travel credit that will reimburse any travel-related purchase. You also get complimentary Priority Pass Select Airport Lounge Access for you and two guests. Plus, you earn three points for every dollar on travel and dining purchases.\n\nRedeeming travel rewards with the Sapphire Reserve is also a great benefit.

You can visit your local U.S. Bank location to determine your eligibility.\n\nWhile paying $85 for TSA Precheck or $100 for Global Entry isn't a budget buster, it's still nice to know that some credit cards will reimburse the application fee. Every five years, you just have to swipe your credit card to pay for the application and your credit card company will reimburse the fee in the form of a statement credit. If you don't own one of these cards already, you will be able to enjoy the best travel benefits that credit cards have to offer.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354638", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T15:28:00Z", "sim": 0.5529412031173706, "source": {"uri": "johnnyjet.com", "title": "Johnny Jet", "id": "16600"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "15:28:00", "url": "http://www.johnnyjet.com/credit-cards-get-tsa-precheck-global-entry/", "storyUri": "eng-3354638", "id": "8648750", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "15:28:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Well, there is a new wrinkle.\n\nThe Atlanta Journal Constitution reported on Sunday that some credit card companies have gone beyond looking at how much its customers spend or how promptly they pay and are now evaluating where they live and even more remarkable, where they shop.\n\nIn other words, redlining is apparently alive and well, aided and abetted by the very companies which could not restrain themselves from blindly offering credit cards and balance transfers to anyone who opened the mailbox, even if they were underage and without visible means of support.\n\nThe AJC recounts the experience of one Atlanta resident, Kevin Johnson, who recently found his credit limit dramatically reduced by American Express. His payment history was spotless, his credit score high, and he was nowhere near the card limit before it was changed. When he asked the company for an explanation he was told that, to quote the AJC, \"It didn't like where he shopped.\"\n\nAmerican Express told Johnson that other customers who had made purchases with their credit cards at places where he had also recently shopped had a poor repayment history. Instant guilt by association.\n\nIn a conversation with the newspaper American Express confirmed that, in its ongoing efforts to keep payment default rates low, it examines customer spending patterns. It also takes into account the customer's mortgage lender and whether his home is located in an area where housing prices are going down. We assume that this means that a subprime mortgage can cause even more problems for the borrower.\n\nAmerican Express told the AJC that a shopping profile would never be the only consideration for a credit reduction; that overall debt was the primary factor. Mr. Johnson said the explanation given in his letter from American Express that his debt level, repayment history, and length of credit history each played a role in the company's credit decision was \"hogwash.\"\n\nThe type of debt and or lender has long been a component of credit scoring. Fair Isaac Corporation which administers FICO scoring counts a loan from a finance company as a less favorable credit attribute than one from a state or federally chartered bank, but most of the other criteria they use in credit scoring is specific to the individual - payment history, debt level, available credit - and can be rationally accepted as an indication of that person's \"Three Cs\" of credit, character, capacity, and capital. American Express's additions have injected criteria into the computation over which an individual borrower has little control. Thus it is attempting to identify and characterize Mr. Johnson and others of its customers merely by their address and their associations", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354638", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T22:33:00Z", "sim": 0.4980392158031464, "source": {"uri": "mortgagenewsdaily.com", "title": "Mortgage News Daily", "id": "1759"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "22:33:00", "url": "http://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/12222008_Credit_Limits.asp#774216", "storyUri": "eng-3354638", "id": "8850712", "image": "http://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/utility/images/MND-Logo-OG.png", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "22:33:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

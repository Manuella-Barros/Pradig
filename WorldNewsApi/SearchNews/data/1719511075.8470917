The Duchess of Sussex spent three days in Nigeria earlier this month, where she was accompanied by her husband Prince Harry. Meghan made a number of outfit changes during the trip and it seems her fashion was taken as an insult by First Lady, Senator Oluremi Tinubu. She gave a speech at an event to mark President Bola Tinubu's one year in office. During the talk, the First Lasy spoke about how women have made significant contributions to society and made a sly dig about Meghan.

We see the way they dress. They keep forgetting that Nigeria, we are beautiful. You can see what they showcase on the stage, I said, 'We are fashionable, we see what is going on'. \"We are not having the Met Gala. And everyone, the nakedness, is just everywhere and the men are well-clothed. So we have to do something. Tell them we don't accept nakedness in our culture. That is not beautiful. It's not beautiful at all. \"And they're all beautiful girls, but they should be confident in who they are. They do not want to mimic and try to emulate film stars from America. They don't know where they come from. Why did Meghan come here looking for Africa? That is something we have to take home with. We know who we are. Don't lose who you are.\" A clip of the speech has been shared on X, formerly known as Twitter, with one person writing: \"Meghan Markle managed to create an international incident! We warned her about the clothes.\" Another said: \"I agree with the First Lady.\" A third person posted: \"She should really respect other people culture and should apologise to the country.\" However, others didn't believe the First Lady was actually hitting out at the Duchess of Sussex. One person wrote: \"The message is not for her. Stop giving yourself a headache because of her,\" while another said: \"She's talking about Nigerian girls dressing like the Kardashians. She even said look at Meghan that came here, implying even M was interested in the country. She was talking in praise. Letting girls know they can be proud of their country. Stop twisting het words.\" Meghan wore a lot of different outfits and accessories in Nigeria, spending almost \u00a3120,000 on jewellery and new clothes. She wore a number of high-end brands on the trip, including Carolina Herrera, Altuzarra, and Johanna Ortiz. The decision has been criticised by some given the extreme levels of poverty in Nigeria, where more than 112million people are living in poverty. The inequality is not caused by a lack of resources, with Nigeria being the largest economy in Africa, but instead by those in charge being out of touch with the struggles of everyday people. The poverty in Nigeria is due to the misallocation of resources, with political corruption adding to the struggles. In one example of poverty in Nigeria, the amount of money the richest Nigerian man can earn annually from his wealth is sufficient to save 2million people from poverty. * Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "summary": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle visited Nigeria earlier this month and it seems their trip is still causing a stir, with the Duchess of Sussex being slammed for outfit choices", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/us-celebrity-news/meghan-markle-slammed-first-lady-32896533", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32896561.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Nigeria_MAIN.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:51:39", "author": "Scarlett O'Toole,Scarlett-otoole", "authors": ["Scarlett O'Toole", "Scarlett-otoole"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.04}

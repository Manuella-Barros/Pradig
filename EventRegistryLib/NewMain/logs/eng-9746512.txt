This shift in political fortunes can be attributed to several factors, with the ongoing ethnic conflict in Manipur playing a pivotal role. The BJP's failure to address and resolve the crisis has not only tarnished its image but also alienated the minority communities in the region.\n\nManipur has been embroiled in ethnic violence for over a year, primarily between the Kuki-Zo and Meitei communities. The state government, dominated by the Meitei community, has been accused of neglecting the plight of the Kuki-Zo people. The Meiteis, with 40 out of 60 MLAs and control over the state's executive positions, have allegedly turned a blind eye to the unauthorized occupation of Kuki-Zo buildings in Imphal, economic blockades, and open extortion by radical elements. This has led to a state of lawlessness and despair among the residents. The conflict has rendered the ten Kuki-Zo MLAs and their tribes unable to return to Imphal, further exacerbating tensions. The BJP's inaction and lack of a visible resolution strategy have been perceived as an attempt to subdue the minority Kuki-Zo community, leading to widespread disillusionment.\n\nThe impact of the ethnic violence in Manipur has been profound, particularly in the northeastern states of Mizoram, Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Manipur. The BJP and its allies suffered electoral defeats to the Congress and regional parties, who capitalized on the BJP's perceived failure to address the crisis. The conflict provided ample fodder for the opposition to paint the BJP as an anti-minority party during their election campaigns. Moreover, the Union government's decision to withdraw the Free Movement Regime (FMR) with Myanmar and erect a border fence further alienated the tribal communities in Nagaland, Manipur, and Mizoram. The move, recommended by the Manipur chief minister, was seen as prioritizing the Meitei community's interests over those of the minority tribes.\n\nThe contrast between Mizoram and Manipur's handling of refugees from Myanmar is stark. Mizoram, which is sheltering over 40,000 refugees, has managed the situation by confining them to camps at the border and extending humanitarian assistance. In contrast, the Manipur government adopted a policy of turning refugees back to Myanmar, forcing them to enter the state through unfenced areas and set up unauthorized settlements. The lack of humanitarian assistance in Manipur compelled the refugees to erect their own shelters and engage in subsistence farming, including potentially illicit activities like poppy cultivation. The Manipur government's approach has not only failed to address the refugee crisis but has also contributed to the broader state of lawlessness. Radical elements freely parade the streets of Imphal in police and armed forces uniforms, and extortion has become rampant. The state government's inaction has fueled suspicions of tacit support for these radical elements, further eroding public trust.\n\nThe BJP's handling of the Manipur conflict and its repercussions have led to significant electoral losses. The Meitei community, disillusioned by the lawlessness and economic hardships, turned against the BJP. The Kuki-Zo community, feeling abandoned by the BJP and their own representatives, overwhelmingly supported the Congress in the Outer Manipur constituency. The Naga People's Front (NPF), allied with the BJP, also faced backlash due to its association with the party and proximity to the NSCN, a group detested by the Kuki-Zo. The chief minister of Assam has acknowledged the impact of the Manipur conflict on the BJP's electoral performance in states with significant Christian populations. Church leaders, motivated by the BJP's anti-minority policies, played a proactive role in mobilizing voters against the party. This shift in voter sentiment underscores the broader regional discontent with the BJP's handling of minority issues.\n\nThe BJP's electoral setbacks in the northeastern states have necessitated a coalition government at the Centre. This coalition dynamic may compel the BJP to moderate its stance on minority issues to avoid alienating its powerful allies. The recent statement by the RSS chief emphasizing the need to resolve the Manipur crisis on priority indicates a potential shift in approach. The BJP's future in the northeastern states hinges on its ability to address the underlying issues fueling the ethnic conflict in Manipur. A sincere and concerted effort to restore peace, ensure communal harmony, and address the grievances of the minority communities is essential. Failure to do so will only exacerbate the existing discontent and further erode the party's support base in the region.", "source": {"uri": "southasiajournal.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "South

The concurrence of the two visits resulted in an exchange of barbs between the ruling party and the Opposition on diverse platforms.\n\nWhile the Opposition accused Narendra Modi of neglecting Manipur and criticised him for not visiting the violence-hit state, the ruling dispensation accused Rahul Gandhi of using the victims of Manipur for gaining political mileage. It is important to note that the Congress leader has recently assumed the role of Leader of the Opposition in the House for the first time, and has been vocal on several issues, including Manipur.\n\nAccompanied by his colleagues and supporters, Rahul Gandhi spoke with the victims of the Manipur violence and their families. A tweet shared by the Congress leader contained a video from the relief camp, in which he stated that this was his third visit to Manipur since the violence had broken out. He urged the Prime Minister to visit the state, listen to the locals, and make an appeal for peace. Gandhi assured the victims that he would advocate for them in parliament and pressure the government to intervene in the crisis.\n\nRecently, Gandhi also visited Uttar Pradesh, where he met victims of a stampede and the mother of the late Indian Army Captain Anshuman Singh. In this case, too, his efforts to show solidarity with the victims and their families have been perceived by the ruling party as a political stunt.\n\nAaj Tak and other major Hindi news channels ran several tickers in live debates on Rahul Gandhi's Manipur visit accusing him of playing politics and taking advantage of the tragedy.\n\nAs seen on the news channel Aaj Tak, BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia questioned Congress, saying that Rahul Gandhi took up these visits for photo opportunities, but ran away when there was a discussion in Parliament. Anchor Anjana Om Kashyap echoed this sentiment by questioning Congress spokesperson Alok Sharma about whether Rahul's visit came as a relief for the residents of Manipur or if it was merely for political traction.\n\nThe tickers running on the TV channel during this debate included:\n\nThese tickers or were not attributed to any BJP spokesperson. In other words, there was no mention that these were allegations made by a political party. Without attribution, these appeared to be the views or questions of the channel itself.\n\nOn Times Now Navbharat, an anchor raised questions about the Opposition's objections to the Prime Minister's visit to Russia. He asked whether the Opposition was attacking the government by comparing PM Modi's visit to Russia to Rahul Gandhi's visit to Manipur. The anchor attempted to introduce a Hindu-Muslim spin to the debate by questioning why Rahul Gandhi was concerned about the plight of the people of Manipur, but looked the other way when it came to the suffering of \"Hindu mothers and daughters in Bengal\".\n\nThe tickers running on the channel during this show included the following:\n\nAnchor Aman Chopra of News 18 said that Rahul Gandhi was on a tour of Manipur and was also being praised on social media. But at the same time, questions are being asked whether Rahul has gone to Manipur to heal its wounds or to find a political opportunity? Has Rahul Gandhi gone to share the pain of the people of Manipur or has this tour of Rahul been a part of 'violence tourism'? Chopra further stated that this question was being raised because the Prime Minister had said in Parliament that Manipur was being used for political gains. And BJP leaders had said that some people were trying to incite violence in Manipur, who could not tolerate peace. Prime Minister had said that work was being done to add fuel to the fire in Manipur, Chopra added.\n\nThe tickers running during this program included:\n\nThe statements in the tickers were not present as allegations by the BJP.\n\nIt is worth noting that the ruling party's questioning of Rahul Gandhi's visit to Manipur was echoed by these news channels, and the charges brought by the BJP were presented as the opinion of the media outlet without any attribution. Generally, taking the questions of the Opposition to the ruling party is considered a duty the media; in this case, it was the opposite. For instance, the BJP questioned why Rahul Gandhi did not visit West Bengal if he was so concerned about the victims. The mainstream media echoed this question, blurring the distinction between the role of a political party and that of a media outlet. Not stopping at that, an anchor on Navbharat Times communalised the issue by bringing in the Hindu angle.\n\nThe tickers used in these bulletins were particularly problematic as the channels did not specify where those statements had come from. Using statements without quotes or attribution and passing them off as news is unethical. Attributing a quote to whoever it came from is one of the basic lessons of journalism that was ignored in these shows.", "source": {"uri": "altnews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alt News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhishek_kumar@altnews.in", "name": "Abhishek Kumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipur", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manipur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manipur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mahatma Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruling_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ruling party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaj_Tak", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaj Tak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Now", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Times Now"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(armed_forces)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (armed forces)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navbharat_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Navbharat Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bengal"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bengal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bengal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.altnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/manipur.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746512", "eventUri": "eng-9746512", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "textStart": 205, "textEnd": 211}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

It is the first sign the ice is thawing.\n\nFirstly, illegally procured fire arms looted from the police armouries are being recovered in regular frequency. Secondly, the willingness of all societies in Manipur, including the Kuki-Zo organisations, to get National Registry of Citizens (NRC) conducted is a significant positive development.\n\nThirdly, significant development is the desire expressed by displaced Kuki-Zo families sheltering in Kangpokpi area to return to Imphal. It can be read as a signal to the state government that steps for normalisation may be taken up now. Fourthly, inference can be made from the utterances that an empowered territorial council in the lines of the Bodoland Territorial Council under Article 244-A for the Kuki-Zo may be an acceptable step in lieu of a separate administration.\n\nNarrowing down the problems to these four points is a big step forward towards normalisation of the crisis faced by Manipur as a state. Recovery of looted guns, to make all civilians feel safe, would depend much on the will and determination of the state government. The outcome of these efforts would be a litmus test for the state government about its sincerity and seriousness to normalise the law and order situation. Under no circumstances civilians of both sides can remain armed and the looted guns would need to be recovered fully at a faster pace on war footing within given timelines.\n\nThe tricky issue about NRC is the choice of the cut-off year. Some cut-off years like 1951 and 1961 have been suggested earlier, but the determining factor would be the availability of detailed household records of Manipur of the relevant Census period with the Office of the Registrar General & Census Commissioner of India (RG & CCI) and Office of Registrar General of Citizen Registration (RGCR). The village-wise register of citizens is to be drawn up from the relevant Census records. Also, a current National Population Register (NPR) is to be prepared. The state government should therefore, in consultation with the RG&CCI and RGCR with reference to lessons derived from the pitfalls faced by Assam government (the only state that has implemented NRC) in the implementation of NRC, consider a cut-off year with least difficulties for implementation of NRC in Manipur. This exercise will be a long drawn out affair and will result in deportation of foreigners/illegal immigrants.\n\nAlthough the desire of the internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Kangpokpi to return to Imphal is a significant steps of willingness to let 'bygones be bygones', this feeling also needs to be expressed by the Kuki-Zo people in Churachandpur and Moreh towns where Meitei families were displaced in the ethnic conflict and also voiced similarly by the CSOs of the valley districts. A normalcy restoration plan for the safe return of IDPs of both communities is required and it should have assurance from the CSOs of both communities not to take law into their own hands with expressed intent to restraint and disengage their radical elements. The plan should consider having outposts of security forces in all sensitive areas buttressed by properly constituted peace committees of state government chaired by senior officers of district administration including members from security forces. The posting policy of the state government would need to be revisited and modified to ensure that there are persons of both communities posted in sensitive locations particularly in police stations, health centres including hospitals to ensure there is no discrimination and ill treatment of minority communities in that particular locality/village.\n\nThe world around us has progressed on all fronts and the internet is replete with information for citizens to discern from their environment whether they deserve better treatment. The 73rd Amendment 1992 added a new Part IX to the constitution titled \"The Panchayats\" covering provisions from Article 243 to 243(O); and a new Eleventh Schedule covering 29 subjects were brought within the functions of the Panchayats. This facility is being implemented in the valley districts of Manipur since 1994 giving them an empowered local self-government. A similar local self-government provision was made for tribal areas in the Sixth Schedule under Article 244 of the Constitution of India. The sixth schedule was designed to protect the indigenous and tribal groups by establishing autonomous district councils or ADCs for administration of tribal areas in the States of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram to safeguard the rights of the tribal population in these states. They are the Karbi-Anglong District, Bodoland Territorial Council, Dima Hasao Autonomous District Council in Assam, Mara Autonomous District Council (MADC), Lai Autonomous District Council (LADC) and Chakma Autonomous District Council (originally Pwi-Lakher Regional Council, now trifurcated) in Mizoram, Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council, Jaintia Hills Autonomous District Council and Garo Hills Autonomous District Council in Meghalaya, and Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council in Tripura. This special provision is provided under Article 244-A, 244(2) and Article 275(1) of the Constitution. The existing district councils of Manipur is neither in the Fifth Schedule nor in the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India and is essentially a state law made by Parliament in 1971 when Manipur was a Part C State of India without legislative powers. The tribes of Manipur, have seen the facilities enjoyed by other tribes living under the ten autonomous district councils across four north eastern states who have been given Sixth Schedule and the special provisions for Nagaland under Article 371-A. Having noticed that the world has changed around them while the tribes in the Hill Areas of Manipur are suppressed and subjugated ever since Manipur became part of the Union of India, and the Bodo people have been given an empowered Bodoland territorial council in 2003 under Article 244-A of the Constitution, the Manipur tribes have been demanding for inclusion of their areas in the Sixth Schedule. The Kuki-Zo tribes, if offered such political settlement against their demand for separate administration may in most probability settle for a similar local self government mechanism.\n\nThe path towards normalcy is clear. There are many stakeholders involved to be consulted towards the goal for peace. The Indo-Naga Peace Talks and the issues involved around it would need to be kept in perspective as there are certain sensitivities concerning land of the Naga tribes in the Hill Areas of Manipur which can potentially become a stumbling block and a trigger for conflict. However, most positive thinking people, who want peace and maintain Manipur integrity, may see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. This hope should be the driving force for all progressive thinking people to strive for a solution to end the Manipur crisis.", "source": {"uri": "morungexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

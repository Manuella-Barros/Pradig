{"id": 243289064, "title": "Propelling Ogun Industrial Growth Through Infrastructure Signature", "text": "It is the desire of every govern-ment at any level to grow the economy for the improved welfare of the citizenry. However, not all those elected into public offices have the right strategy to achieve their as-pirations. Some came unprepared for the job. As such, they spend their time learning the rope. Before coming into the saddle, Prince Dapo Abiodun had a clear vi-sion of taking Ogun State to the next level of sustainable economic growth focusing on road infrastructure as a catalyst for industrial transforma-tion. Already, so much has been said about the network of roads under the administration. This has turned Ogun State into the preferred desti-nation of choice for investors. Today, the state can boast of no less than 6000 industries, including the largest ce-ment factories in Nigeria, producing the highest tonnes of cement. These include Lafarge, Dangote as well as others that are just springing up. The state is equally the home of industrial giants like Nestle, Cadbury, Unilever, May & Baker, International Brewer-ies, Olams, Flour Mills, and a host of others. Already, there is also a projec-tion that the ongoing industrial zone will create between 30,000 and 50,000 new jobs with multiplier effects on the state economy and the country at large. As a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement between the state government and private companies, the industrial zone has been chosen as an economic hub with partnerships in different parts of the sub-region, Ivory Coast, Garbon, Togo, Republic of Benin and so on. With this feat, one cannot say that Governor Abiodun is reinventing the wheel. What he is doing differently as against the policies of his prede-cessors is the priority placed on the creation of an enabling environment for industrial growth through aggres-sive road infrastructures, security, and land reforms, among others. There is a nexus between roads and industrial growth. The two are mutually rein-forcing. Roads not only enhance con-nectivity among communities but also extend trade and network. It equally helps in rapid industrialisation, in-creases employment opportunities, boosts interstate connectivity, and promotes even development. For those conversant with history, roads, canals, and railways were three major components of transportation improved during the first industrial revolution. People used the roads as the basic way to transport goods from one place to another. The trajectory of growth under the Abiodun adminis-tration follows the same pattern. And it is the reason the state has emerged as one of the three leading most eco-nomically viable states in the country. In so far as the network of road projects is concerned, Governor Abio-dun has left his imprints in the sand of time. Through the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) initiative, he has successfully transformed the state\u2019s infrastructure landscape. Today, over 500 kilometres of roads have been constructed across the state to ease the movement of goods and persons. Apart from internal connectivity, priority has also been given to the highways that connect Ogun with neighbouring states, particularly La-gos. As a result, people can now travel between Lagos and Ogun State in less than an hour for a journey that would hitherto take two or three hours or even more before the advent of the present administration. More and more people are now coming to Ogun State to live, to work and to hold con-ferences because of easy accessibility. Other than roads, the real game changer is the construction of the Gateway Agro-Cargo International Airport billed to commence flight op-erations anytime from now. Though a capital-intensive project, the Airport was built in a record-breaking short period of two years, making it the fastest to be constructed ever in the history of this country. It recorded the first historic flight landing some-time last year. As already projected, the Airport will begin scheduled and non-scheduled flights any time from now, as the approval process to get the airport running has reached an advanced stage. To give further boost to industri-al transformation initiative of the administration, the Governor has expressed interest in acquiring the Hydro Power Plant situated at the Ogun-Osun River Basin Development Authority to facilitate the availabili-ty of energy for investors in the state. The Governor revealed this during a meeting with the new Managing Director and CEO of the Ogun Osun River Basin Development Authority, Engr. Adedeji Ashiru and his manage-ment team. Abiodun emphasised the signifi-cance of revitalising the long-aban-doned Hydro Power Plant to attract sufficient energy for business inter-ests in the state. He highlighted the potential for the state to become a hub for industrial activities by ensuring affordable energy costs through this acquisition. He had this to say: \u201cWe are aware there is a Hydro Power Plant that is installed in the river basin for several years. It was a Federal Government initiative. As a state government, we have expressed interest in the acquisi-tion of that Hydro Power Plant. \u201cIt is almost obsolete by now. Only God knows the level of vandalisation, but we believe that if it is transferred to us as a state government, I think they\u2019ve already spoken to the OEM, the original equipment manufactur-er and we can jointly look at how to ensure that not only do we resuscitate it, but actually expand it. \u201cYou are aware that we are the in-dustrial capital of Nigeria and elec-tricity is a key enabler in the indus-trial revolution and one of the vision we have as a state government is to ensure that Ogun State becomes one of the state if not the state where the cost of energy will be the cheapest. \u201cI believe that if we are able to ac-quire this Hydro Power Plant, it will go a long way to supporting the actu-alisation of our vision.\u201d Governor Abiodun further ac-knowledged the importance of effec-tive management of the river basin in controlling flooding, particularly in areas like Ibafo, Isheri, and Kara. He disclosed plans to engage consultants to address the recurring flooding chal-lenges and enhance water resource management. \u201cAs a state government, we are looking at engaging consultants to recommend to us what we can do to ensure that this perennial recurrent problem is finally resolved. \u201cI am sure you also know that the management of that river basin is also very key to the control of flooding in Ogun State. \u201cThe water table rises and falls. The areas between Kara, Mowe, Ibafo, Isheri North have in the recent times been flooded that many people cannot even access their homes. \u201cWe have called the attention of the Ministers of Water Resources, Humanitarian and a few other min-isters have come here to look into what are the immediate causes, what can be done to manage the situation in the immediate and the long term,\u201d he added. As a major stakeholder in the re-newed economic integration among South West states, Abiodun stressed the need for collaborative efforts to leverage the Basin Authority\u2019s resources for agricultural develop-ment and food security initiatives in the region. \u201cThis River Basin is also very fundamental to agriculture and food security. This is an area that is extremely important to the President and his Renewed Hope agenda. \u201cAs a state government, we are looking forward to working with you collaboratively to ensure that we tap into the advantage of having you and having the Basin Authority in this state to ensure that it becomes a resource that will catalyse the agricultural pro-gram we are currently implementing and our food security initiatives. \u201cThrough that River Basin Au-thority, we can ensure that there is adequate water supply for our farmers that are either upstream or downstream from the dam,\u201d Abiodun enthused. In his remarks, Ashiru said that the basin under his watch would en-hance water resources management, promote agriculture, and also support infrastructure development within the region. Development effort without secu-rity is nothing. Concerned with ade-quate protection of lives and property, the Abiodun administration has been able to tackle the challenges of insecu-rity by equipping security agencies with modern gadgets and patrol ve-hicles. With the establishment of the Security Trust Fund, the state has procured relevant security gadgets, in-cluding drones, for security agencies in the state, while also augmenting the allowances and living conditions of security personnel to enhance secu-rity and safety in the state. In return of these gestures, Gover-nor Abiodun has acknowledged the effort of the Nigeria Police Force in securing lives and properties in the state. He gave commendation to the state police command when he re-ceived the Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) in charge of the South West region, Mr. Abiodun Alabi, who was in his office on a courtesy call. He said police personnel in the state had been up and doing in the dis-charge of their constitutional roles in collaboration with other sister agen-cies. \u201cWe have enjoyed the cooperation of the police. Their collaboration with other security agencies including the Army, the Department of State Ser-vices (DSS), the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corp (NSCDC) and of course our Amotekun has led to the peaceful atmosphere that we enjoy and this has also encouraged investors to come and do business in our state.\u201d The Governor also lauded the col-laborative efforts of the Ogun, Oyo and Lagos state commands in tackling criminal activities, particularly on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, stating that this had brought down the rate of criminality in that corridor. He applauded DIG Alabi for touring the region to see how his men were far-ing and how they relate with the peo-ple. He commended the Inspector Gen-eral of Police (Dr Kayode Egbetokun) for his support and the Commissioner of Police (Mr Abiodun Alamutu) for doing a wonderful job in the State. In his remark, DIG Alabi said there was the need for interface with relevant stakeholders to ensure ef-fective community policing in the country, adding that his visit was in line with the directive of the IGP for the six DIGs to tour their regions to assess security situation and come up with strategies to deal with such. He thanked Governor Abiodun for always supporting the force, even as he pledged the readiness of his men to up their game and provide the State with the needed security. Despite all these, the Governor has promised not let his guard down. What\u2019s more! He has said that his ad-ministration has awarded contract for the reconstruction of the 63km Ado-Odo/Abeokuta expressway road. He disclosed this during the commis-sioning of Ilaro -Iwoye-Owode road in Yewa South Local Government Area. He said the reconstruction of the road was part of his administration\u2019s efforts to address the infrastructur-al deficit in the State. He described the road as the second busiest in the country, adding that when complet-ed, it would allow for the evacuation of goods and services from the axis through the Lagos-Ibadan Express-way to other parts of the country. He said construction work had commenced on the Sagamu-Papalanto road, while that of Papalanto to Ilaro remained on course. \u201cWe have just awarded the Ado-Odo/Abeokuta road. It will be the most expensive road this administration has reconstructed. It is 63 kilometres. \u201cThat road is the second busiest road in the country and extremely im-portant to the economy of Yewaland, Ogun Central, and the entire Ogun State. \u201cFrom our industrial capital of Ado-Odo/Ota, it allows you to evac-uate goods and services through that road to the hinterland. Those in Ado- Odo/Ota will go on that road through Papalanto, link the interchange and you are there on Lagos-Ibadan ex-pressway,\u201d he stated. Development is forever a work in progress. Thought the state might not have reached the desired desti-nation envisaged by the Abiodun ad-ministration, there is assurance that things will progressively get better as the state marches on in its drive for economic prosperity. Yes, the best has yet to come. \u2026Ogbonnikan writes from Abeokuta, Ogun State capital", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"532\" height=\"466\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Gov-Dapo-Abiodun-e1719631912918.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" /></div>It is the desire of every govern\u00adment at any level to grow the economy for the improved welfare of the citizenry.

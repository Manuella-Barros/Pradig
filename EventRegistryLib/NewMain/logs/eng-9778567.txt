A perfect mix of facts and humour, exposing the dirty politics of the INDI Alliance,\" he said.\n\nThe Congress responded sharply, saying that the Prime Minister had encouraged a \"serious breach of parliamentary privilege\" by sharing the speech, which it described as a \"highly abusive and unconstitutional tirade\".\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nMr Thakur's remarks against Mr Gandhi drew a sharp response from the Opposition benches yesterday. Senior Congress MP Jagdambika Pal, who was in the Chair, had assured the remarks would be expunged. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said that while expunged comments are edited out of videos uploaded online, Sansad TV has uploaded the unedited speech in this case. \"This is a new and shameful low in the annals of India's parliamentary history. It reflects the BJP-RSS and Mr. Modi's deep-rooted casteism,\" he alleged.\n\nA five-time MP from Hamirpur in Himachal Pradesh, Anurag Thakur was speaking during the debate on Budget 2024 when he launched a personal attack on Mr Gandhi, drawing a sharp response from Opposition benches. The Leader of the Opposition interjected to say he should be given an opportunity to respond because Mr Thakur had insulted him.\"You can insult me as much as you want, do it every day. But don't forget that we (the opposition) will get the Bill (on Caste Census) passed here (in Parliament),\" Mr Gandhi said.", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "saikat_kumar_bose@ndtv.com", "name": "Saikat Kumar Bose", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "aishvarya_jain@ndtv.com", "name": "Aishvarya Jain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anurag_Thakur", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anurag Thakur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charanjit_Singh_Channi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charanjit Singh Channi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalandhar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalandhar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jalandhar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDTV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NDTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagdambika_Pal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jagdambika Pal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_privilege", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary privilege"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jairam_Ramesh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jairam Ramesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mahatma Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Extreme_Sports/Videos_and_Films", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Extreme Sports/Videos and Films", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/016od8e8_pm-modi_625x300_22_July_24.jpeg?ver-20240615.100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778567", "eventUri": "eng-9778567", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The party has alleged that the video shared by PM Modi contained defamatory portions that were directed at Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi. These remarks were later expunged from house proceedings by the Speaker.\n\nAs elected representatives, the members of the House enjoy certain rights and immunities to effectively discharge their functions.\n\nIndia lacks a law that defines what is a parliamentary privilege. Article 105 in the Indian Constitution explicitly mentions only two kinds of privileges, freedom of speech in the Parliament and the right to publish the house proceedings.\n\nThe Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, grants freedom from arrest and detention of members under a civil process during house proceedings or during the functioning of any of its committees. Members also enjoy immunity for forty days before its commencement and after the conclusion of any house or committee proceedings.\n\nApart from the Indian constitution and Code of Civil Procedure, privileges are also based on house rules and other parliamentary conventions. Members are not liable for any court proceedings for anything said or published regarding house or committee proceedings.\n\nIf a member believes that such a privilege has been breached or misused, a motion or complaint can be raised to the house chairman or speaker.\n\nTwo conditions exist - the question shall be restricted to a specific matter of recent occurrence and the matter requires the intervention of the Council.\n\nThe Speaker/Chair upon initial examination can either admit or reject such motion. When admitted, the motion is then referred to a privileges committee consisting of members nominated by him from time to time.\n\nThe committee on examination of a privilege motion can make recommendations that it deems to be fit. It can also call relevant persons and is empowered to look at related documents if any. A report shall be presented within a maximum time limit of one month or at an early date suggested by the Chair/Speaker.\n\nAfter the committee submits its report, the House can consider the recommendations and suggest amendments. Penal action against members is recommended only in extreme cases.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charanjit_Singh_Channi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charanjit Singh Channi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anurag_Thakur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anurag Thakur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_privilege", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary privilege"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Commons_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/31/1600x900/PTI07-30-2024-000131A-0_1722328289926_1722421861619.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778567", "eventUri": "eng-9778567", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

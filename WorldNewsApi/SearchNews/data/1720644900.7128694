In a recent Reddit post shared to the popular \u201cAm I The A**hole?\u201d subreddit, the teen explained that for a combination of an 18th birthday present and a high school graduation present, their parents got them a cruise, which became a family vacation. Normally, the family only goes to \u201call inclusive\u201d resorts and were warned ahead of time that cruises run with a strict schedule that needs to be followed. \u201cWell it was a week-long cruise and they would not head back to the ship when I said it was time to go. They were busy shopping and bargaining with the locals. I finally said that I was heading back to the ship. My mom waved me off,\u201d the teen wrote in their Reddit post. Their parents ended up missing the ship\u2019s departure by 45 minutes and reached out to the Reddit poster to question why they didn\u2019t stop the boat from leaving without them. \u201cI wanted to scream that they were not going to inconvenience 3,998 people because two could not understand what a schedule was,\u201d the teen continued. \u201cThey ended up having to fly to the next port from there and it was expensive. They are pissed at me for leaving them behind.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what I was supposed to do. They literally told me that they knew what they were doing. I wish I had never asked for this. They are making me miserable because I left without them.\u201d After posting, many people were quick to turn to the comments section to agree with the teenager\u2019s opinion and general frustration with their parents, pointing out that the two adults should have been capable of getting back to the ship on time. \u201cThey seriously think the ship will delay for 45 minutes, yeah no,\u201d one comment began. \u201cThe docks and ship have a schedule to keep. They are adults and need to be responsible for getting back on time. Which is something you have figured out in less than six months of being an adult. At least you don\u2019t have to go on any more vacations with them after this.\u201d \u201cYour parents are in the wrong,\u201d another commenter agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t do cruises but I have some experience with them because I travel to a place where cruise ships are common. I also thought passengers were warned that the ship leaves no matter who is on board.\u201d \u201cYou would never have been able to prevent the cruise ship from leaving. They have a schedule and they keep to it. The ship waits for no one. This is ALL on your parents.. They didn\u2019t respect the ship schedule.\u201d A third commenter even pointed out that they weren\u2019t sure what the teenager could have done to stop the ship from leaving given how the schedule is typically emphasized prior to the cruise itself. \u201cWhat precisely do they think you could have done? Kidnapped the captain? Staged your own drowning? You didn\u2019t abandon them, they abandoned you, don\u2019t let them weasel word this around to being your fault in any way, shape or form!\u201d the comment read. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry your parents have ruined this for you. It\u2019s pretty pathetic of them to blame you for their extremely easy to avoid deliberate bad decision. They owe you at least two apologies, one for ignoring your sage advice in the first place, the second for behaving like spoiled four year olds.\u201d", "summary": "<p>\u2018You would never have been able to prevent the cruise ship from leaving.

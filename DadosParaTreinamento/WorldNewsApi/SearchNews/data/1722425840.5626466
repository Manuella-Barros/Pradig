In an interview with The Associated Press, the embattled leader denied once again that Wednesday's attack on the government palace was a \u201cself-coup\u201d designed to garner him political points. \u201cI didn\u2019t escape, I stayed to defend democracy,\" Arce said. About ongoing political spats with his one-time ally Evo Morales, Arce said \u201cwe\u2019ve been politically attacked\u201d by Morales, underscoring a \u201clegislative boycott\u201d which has hamstrung the government in taking on economic turmoil. Arce washed his hands of claims by family members of the 21 detained by the government who were innocent of attempting a coup, and that they were tricked by the ex-military General Juan Jose Z\u00fa\u00f1iga. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem of those who were involved, it\u2019s not the government\u2019s problem,\u201d Arce told the AP.", "summary": "Bolivian President Luis Arce says a former general had intended to take over the government and become president in a failed coup, and he denied that the Andean nation was experiencing an economic crisis", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/bolivias-president-general-accused-leading-failed-coup-wanted-111535746", "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/7c3918fa-13fd-483b-b0f6-884b755e3c33/wirestory_ade93ba7392bfaa18fd0b39bd0647473_16x9.jpg?w=1600", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:38:45", "author": "The Associated Press", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.402}

Educators say that although they have not seen student-led demonstrations at their high schools, they still are prioritizing safety \u2014 and maintaining the \u201ccelebratory\u201d environment \u2014 at upcoming commencement events, when thousands of graduates in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties will receive their diplomas. \u201cSafety, it\u2019s always our top priority, especially at events such as graduation,\u201d said Hilda Ramirez Horvath, a spokesperson for the Pasadena Unified School District. \u201cGraduations are always a really important milestone for students and their families, and we want these events to be special and meaningful for our community.\u201d Horvath said the district will take general safety precautions \u2014 with support from the Pasadena Police Department and venue security \u2014 at its six ticketed graduation ceremonies planned at Pasadena\u2019s Civic Auditorium, starting with Blair High School\u2019s commencement at 11 a.m. Thursday, May 30. But, she quickly added, those measures are \u201cnot related to the idea of any protest.\u201d Related: As school year winds down, Southern California colleges weigh security measures in wake of protests Similarly, Temecula Valley Unified is \u201cnot aware of any incidents or info related to either side of this issue on our campuses,\u201d spokesperson James Evans said, but he noted that security measures will be in place as they routinely are at large campus events. \u201cAs always, safety and security is our number one priority,\u201d said Evans, noting that the district\u2019s graduations are scheduled for June 6 and 7. In the Long Beach Unified School District, which will hold its graduation ceremonies in June, spokesperson Elvia Cano said, \u201cWe remain confident in our safety preparedness for a successful graduation season.\u201d The Orange Unified School District, which will have its commencement events June 5 and 6 at Fred Kelly Stadium, is making preparations \u201cto ensure a safe and memorable experience for our graduates and all attendees,\u201d spokesperson Hana Brake said. Other Orange County districts, including Newport Mesa Unified, Garden Grove Unified, Santa Ana Unified and Irvine Unified, echoed similar sentiments for upcoming late May and June graduations. Officials said they haven\u2019t seen protest activity on high school campuses, and schools have established safety protocols in place to ensure a smooth graduation. \u201cWe do not have any indication that protests will occur during graduation ceremonies,\u201d Irvine Unified spokesperson Annie Brown said. \u201cAs with any IUSD-related event or activity, our priority is the safety and well-being of our students, staff and families.\u201d And in the Jurupa Unified School District, where graduations for its four high schools already are underway, spokesperson Jacqueline Paul said, \u201cEverything is going well.\u201d School district officials throughout the region are mindful that their graduating seniors have been exposed to widespread media coverage of pro-Palestinian campus protests at universities for more than a month. Locally, UCLA, USC, UC Irvine, Cal State L.A., Chapman University and Pomona College have been hotbeds of student activism. And, recently, some graduates have walked out of commencement ceremonies nationally \u2014 notably, at Harvard, Yale, Tufts and George Washington University \u2014 and others at Morehouse College turned their backs on President Joe Biden during his address to highlight their support of a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and divestiture of its financial support for Israel. Columbia University, ground zero for the pro-Palestinian campus protests, canceled its main commencement, as did USC, which pivoted to smaller ceremonies for individual schools after tensions boiled over partly because of the cancelation of a speech by Muslim valedictorian Asna Tabassum, a Chino Hills resident. Whether graduating high school seniors in Southern California feel empowered to emulate their college counterparts, of course, is unknown, but public secondary schools operate under slightly more restrictive free expression rights. High schoolers are limited partly because public schools mandate attendance up to a certain grade level, while going to college is voluntary, said Aaron Terr, director of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), which defends and promotes free speech on school campuses. Additionally, he said, teachers and administrators, working under strict district guidelines, stand in the place of parents to some extent while students are at school. Still, Terr said, public schools cannot punish students for free speech just because \u201cit expresses a view that makes students or administrators uncomfortable.\u201d Student speech on public secondary school campuses, the Supreme Court has ruled, is protected unless it substantially disrupts or interferes with school operations. That standard emerged from a high court decision in 1969, Tinker v. Des Moines, that affirmed public school students\u2019 First Amendment right to wear black armbands to school to protest the Vietnam War. \u201cStudents don\u2019t shed their constitutional rights at the schoolhouse gate,\u201d the justices wrote, affirming the right to the armband protest because it was quiet and passive, and did not interfere with other students\u2019 learning environment. \u201cThe following year, millions of college and high school students around the country participated in walkouts to protest the United States\u2019 escalation of the Vietnam War and, soon after, the Kent State shooting,\u201d Terr said. \u201cLike the current campus protests, they were a mix of peaceful protest, civil disobedience, and violence or lawlessness.\u201d Terr also recalled the 2018 walkout of students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, to protest gun violence in the wake of the shooting that killed 14 students and three staff members, and injured others. That demonstration, he said, is \u201canother historical precedent\u201d for the current student-led, pro-Palestinian protests. Public school districts say they are mindful of the need to balance student rights to free expression with the desire to avoid disruptions at school events, such as commencement exercises. \u201cWe strive to allow students the opportunity to express their viewpoints in a way that is consistent with maintaining safe and welcoming environments,\u201d said Los Angeles Unified School District spokesperson Rebekah Salgado. LAUSD \u2014 which this year has 116,507 students in grades 9 through 12, including thousands of graduates \u2014 has specific plans in place to \u201censure that graduations are safe and welcoming events,\u201d Salgado said, noting that commencement ceremonies begin in early June. At all events, she said in an email, the district will welcome students\u2019 voices \u201camplified and supported as appropriate to the ceremony. We support each school on a case-by-case basis, factoring in several elements such as size of the graduation, venue, etc.\u201d In the Torrance Unified School District, activities at commencement ceremonies must abide by the district\u2019s policy on civility, which maintains that \u201call speech and expression will comport with norms of civil behavior,\u201d spokesperson Sara Myers said by email. About 2,000 seniors will be graduating from the district\u2019s four high schools the week of June 10, and Myers said commencement events will have \u201cwell-communicated rules and security protocols\u201d to help manage crowds. \u201cWe recognize the effect that global events and tragedies can have on our students, so we have continued to work as a community to support each other and promote wellness, safety and kindness during these trying times,\u201d Myers said. Torrance schools, she said, have hosted multicultural events that celebrate all backgrounds, customs and traditions, and they welcome that spirit of diversity at school events. Similarly, Pasadena Unified\u2019s Horvath said, \u201cAs far as protests, our position is always that the best place for students to talk about concerns or issues is in school with teachers and staff. We actively encourage dialogue and campus activities where all opinions are respected in both words and actions. And so we have structures for that to happen.\u201d One high school senior who participated in an off-campus, pro-Palestinian protest in Redlands said she hopes to see more activism from secondary school students in her community and beyond. \u201cI feel like our voices are always the most important because we have staff members, adults and community members looking at us, and we\u2019re the next generation, so it means even more,\u201d said Bayan Yousef, a member of a student-led group called Redlands for Palestine. \u201cSometimes, because we\u2019re young, we get more attention on the cause when we do it, too.\u201d Yousef, who plans to attend community college, acknowledged that those who protested with her in early May at Sylvan Park were concerned about retaliation from school officials or college admissions offices. But compared to what\u2019s happening in Gaza, she said, that seems unimportant. \u201cI was a little worried that they were going to take our graduation away for protesting, and some people were worried their university acceptance letters would be revoked,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t stop us, of course.\u201d Staff writers Sarah Hoffman, Madison Hart, Teresa Liu and the Associated Press contributed to this report.", "summary": "Educators throughout the region are mindful of their students' rights to free expression, but are confident they can avoid any commencement disruptions.", "url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2024/05/26/socal-high-schools-work-to-ensure-safe-celebratory-graduations-amid-college-turmoil-over-gaza/", "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/OCR-L-HSPROTESTS-0526.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:30:20", "author": "Allyson Vergara,Victoria Ivie", "authors": ["Allyson Vergara", "Victoria Ivie"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.515}

{"id": 231966128, "title": "Ten dogs found dead in bag pulled from Leeds canal", "text": "In August, a family of French bulldogs - two adults and three puppies - which were believed to have been drowned were pulled from the canal, again in a Sports Direct bag, the charity said. Despite an appeal for information from the RSPCA, no one responsible for the incident was traced. Ms Williams said: \"It is very suspicious that two identical incidents have occurred in the same area, both families of French bulldogs and both in Sports Direct bags. \"It seems highly likely these are linked.\" She added: \"It's awful to think what these poor dogs went through and I'm keen to piece together what happened leading up to finding them. \"They didn't appear to be in ill health, which makes us believe they could have been intentionally drowned.\" The RSPCA has appealed for anyone with information about the incident to contact them. The charity also asked local residents to check any security camera footage from around 20 May to see if it showed anyone walking French bulldogs or carrying a large Sports Direct bag.

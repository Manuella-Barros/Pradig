Sellers and real estate agents can face up to one year of prison time for violating the law.\n\n\"Every day I am getting phone calls from people asking if they can buy a house under the law,\" said Hoo, who has sold real estate in Florida for 10 years. \"I tell them to talk to an attorney, but for those who aren't sure about their status, we don't want to take the risk.\"\n\nThe Florida law restricts \"foreign principals\" from six other \"countries of concern,\" like Venezuela and Cuba, from owning property. But the most onerous restrictions -- and harshest penalties -- are specifically aimed at Chinese citizens.\n\nThe law was part of a broader package passed by the Florida Legislature last spring that included a bill restricting the state's public universities and colleges from offering research positions to students from China and other countries. That law is also being challenged in court.\n\n\"The deeper that you look under the hood, the deeper that you see China has been clandestinely going after land grabs in the United States,\" said state Rep.

But in Florida, the Chinese community is just 0.6% of the population. Many are first-generation immigrants who moved to the state to study or work at universities. And there are very few Asian American politicians in the Legislature.\n\nThe Florida activists' dissent barely registered.\n\nLobbyists for the prominent hedge fund Citadel, which moved to Miami from Chicago in 2022 and employs a large number of Chinese citizens, were more effective and managed to secure an exemption for Chinese people on valid work visas to buy one primary residence as long as the property is smaller than 2 acres and not within 5 miles of a military installation.\n\nBut most of the initially proposed restrictions were kept in place, and the impact of the law was felt almost immediately.\n\nSunny Long, a real estate agent in Tallahassee, said that she now pores over Google Maps to approximate where her Chinese clients could be eligible to buy property. Florida has around 20 major military bases, many small military outposts and even more critical facilities like airports and water treatment plants that could be covered under the law.\n\n\"Many of my clients would like to buy in a certain neighborhood that has a good school district, but it's too close to the airport,\" she said. \"It's been a big test for me.\"\n\nAsian Americans are also concerned that the law has led to profiling of anyone perceived to be Chinese, no matter their citizenship or residency status.\n\nOne man said a real estate agent at an open house asked him if he was qualified to buy the house after he chatted in Mandarin with his parents.\n\nEvelyn Yang, a real estate agent in Palm Beach Gardens, said that shortly after the law went into effect, she repeatedly made inquiries about an apartment in Miami on behalf of a Chinese client who had permanent residency. She didn't hear back from the seller's agent for days, she said.\n\n\"When they finally returned my calls, they just said, 'Can your buyer buy? Can't Chinese people not buy right now?'\" Yang recalled. \"They see that our names are Chinese and assume that we can't buy.\"\n\nSuch interactions could be considered intentional discrimination based on national origin, which is prohibited by the Fair Housing Act of 1968, said Scott Chang, senior counsel for the National Fair Housing Alliance. On Monday, the alliance and several other groups plan to announce a new lawsuit making that allegation.\n\nNearly one year after her homebuying attempt fell through, Li, the renter in Miami, still vividly recalls the days spent frantically trying to salvage her deal.\n\nThe desperate calls to attorneys and state lawmakers. The time spent calculating distances. Li's real estate agent even drove to the Coast Guard outpost on South Beach to try to determine if it was a \"military installation\" under the law.\n\nLi said she still loved living in Miami. It was clean compared to New York City, where she lived before.

So Li, a 28-year-old who came to the United States 11 years ago as a college student from China, put in an offer, had her bid accepted and began ordering furniture.\n\nThen things took a sharp turn. At the last minute, the title company raised concerns about a small U.S. Coast Guard outpost near South Beach a few miles away. The company said her purchase might run afoul of a new Florida law that prohibits many Chinese citizens from buying property in the state, especially near military installations, airports or refineries.\n\nUnder the law, Li could face prison time, and the sellers and real estate agents could be held liable. The deal collapsed.\n\n\"The whole experience was very hurtful and tiring,\" Li said in Miami, where she is still renting. \"I just feel that, as someone who has lived and worked in this country for many years, and as a legal taxpayer, at the very least I should have the ability to buy a home that I can live in.\"\n\nMore than three dozen states have enacted or are considering similar laws restricting land purchases by Chinese citizens and companies, arguing that such transactions are a growing threat to national security and that the federal government has failed to stop Chinese Communist Party influence in America.\n\nFlorida's law, in effect since July, is among the furthest reaching. In addition to barring Chinese entities from buying agricultural land, it effectively prohibits most Chinese individuals without a green card from purchasing residential property.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis signed the measure just before launching his Republican presidential campaign, warning voters that China represented the biggest threat to the United States.\n\n\"Today, Florida makes it very clear: We don't want the C.C.P. in the Sunshine State,\" DeSantis said last year.\n\nIn more than a dozen interviews, Chinese residents in Florida voiced frustrations about being cut off from the ultimate American dream. Other residents of Chinese descent said they faced discrimination as they tried to buy a home.\n\nCivil rights and Asian American groups are unaware of anyone being charged with violating the law. But some people of Chinese descent said they feel the anti-China sentiment intensifying. The law is currently being challenged in federal court.\n\n\"I never felt any discrimination here before this law,\" said Jin Bian, a Chinese software developer who works in Tampa and is among those now barred from buying property. \"But now I'm wondering if I need to leave Florida.\"\n\nThe law has also had an apparent chilling effect on the real estate industry, an important part of the state's economy. Developers often rely on Chinese investors to help build projects in Florida, and the law appears to have barred such financing, prompting pushback from a prominent real estate lobbying group.\n\nYukey Hoo, a real estate agent in Winter Garden near Orlando, estimated that she has turned away 10 potential clients, about 20% of her usual business, because she could not determine their eligibility to buy property.\n\nThe law technically applies to people who are \"domiciled\" in China and don't hold U.S. citizenship or permanent residency, and much of the confusion has centered on what \"domicile\" means. Sellers and real estate agents can face up to one year of prison time for violating the law.\n\n\"Every day I am getting phone calls from people asking if they can buy a house under the law,\" said Hoo, who has sold real estate in Florida for 10 years. \"I tell them to talk to an attorney, but for those who aren't sure about their status, we don't want to take the risk.\"\n\nThe Florida law restricts \"foreign principals\" from six other \"countries of concern,\" like Venezuela and Cuba, from owning property. But the most onerous restrictions -- and harshest penalties -- are specifically aimed at Chinese citizens.\n\n\"The deeper that you look under the hood, the deeper that you see China has been clandestinely going after land grabs in the United States,\" said state Rep. David Borrero, a Republican from the Miami area who was one of the sponsors of the land law. \"We can't just have that in our backyard.\"\n\nBorrero disagreed with critics who said the property bill was discriminatory. \"Our national security interests come first,\" he said.\n\nThe Chinese government has a record of using economic coercion and espionage to further its geopolitical goals and, in recent years, both the United States and China have stepped up efforts to advance their spying capabilities around the world.\n\nState lawmakers have been especially worried about Chinese investment in agricultural land and territory near military installations, fearing that China could throttle America's food supply or use the land as a spy post. Chinese interests own less than 1% of foreign-held agricultural land in the United States, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nNational security experts said the specific threat posed by Chinese people owning homes has not been clearly articulated.\n\nHolden Triplett, a former FBI counterintelligence official who led the bureau's offices in China, said Chinese citizens are more likely to have family ties to China that could be weaponized by state security agencies there. But he said categorical bans could further alienate a Chinese diaspora community that could be of particular help to the United States in the event of a conflict with China.\n\n\"We need to be careful about these blunt instrument laws,\" said Triplett, who left the FBI in 2020 and co-founded Trenchcoat Advisors, a risk management consultancy.\n\nCivil rights groups and residents have challenged the Florida law in federal court on grounds that it violates the Equal Protection Clause and the Fair Housing Act, and that it undercuts the federal government powers on foreign affairs.\n\nIn Texas, opposition from the Asian American community, including a former Republican lawmaker of Chinese descent, helped roll back some provisions in a similar bill. But in Florida, the Chinese community is just 0.6% of the population. Many are first-generation immigrants who moved to the state to study or work at universities. And there are very few Asian American politicians in the Legislature.\n\nLi said she still loved living in Miami. It was clean compared to New York City, where she lived before. She loved taking tennis lessons at the courts in Palm Island Park and exploring the diverse food scene with her friends.\n\nBut the experience left her with a bitter taste.\n\n\"I think I may just have to leave,\" she said. \"Who knows what policies they might come up with next?\"", "source": {"uri": "orlandosentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Orlando Sentinel"}, "authors": [],

What was meant to be a milestone moment in her journey as an immigrant quickly turned into a disheartening ordeal, emblematic of a broader struggle facing Chinese residents in Florida.\n\nLi's aspirations were dashed by the implementation of a contentious law that has sent ripples of controversy through the real estate landscape. Under the guise of national security concerns, Florida legislators enacted legislation aimed at curbing property ownership by Chinese citizens. The law, effective since July, prohibits many Chinese individuals from purchasing residential properties, particularly those in close proximity to military installations, airports, or refineries.\n\n\"The whole experience was very hurtful and tiring,\" Li shared, reflecting on her thwarted endeavor. \"I just feel that, as someone who has lived and worked in this country for many years, and as a legal taxpayer, at the very least I should have the ability to buy a home that I can live in.\"\n\nThe law's proponents argue that such measures are necessary to safeguard national interests, citing growing concerns over Chinese Communist Party influence in America. Governor Ron DeSantis, in signing the measure, asserted \"We don't want the C.C.P. in the Sunshine State.\"\n\nYet, critics decry the legislation as discriminatory and counterproductive, highlighting its adverse impact on both individuals and the broader economy. Yukey Hoo, a seasoned real estate agent, lamented turning away numerous potential clients due to the law's ambiguity, underscoring the chilling effect it has cast over the industry.\n\nMoreover, the law's enforcement has elicited merited accusations of racial profiling and discrimination. Evelyn Yang, another real estate agent, recounted instances where clients faced skepticism solely based on their Chinese heritage, raising concerns of systemic bias and unfair treatment.\n\nWhile the legal battle over the law's constitutionality unfolds in federal court, its ramifications reverberate throughout Florida's Chinese community. As the Sunshine State grapples with the fallout of its controversial legislation, it faces a pivotal reckoning over the balance between security imperatives and the principles of equality and inclusion that underpin the American ethos.

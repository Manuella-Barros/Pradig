The Indians had also won 10 straight games in Minnesota, all but one this season.\n\nYan Gomes and Jason Kipnis each homered and had three hits for the Indians in a 9-3 victory in the opener as the Twins set a franchise record with 19 strikeouts.\n\nRecalled from Triple-A Rochester as the 26th player for the nightcap, Slegers allowed only two hits and two runs with two walks and two strikeouts.

But I'm fine, thank God,\" Ramirez said through a translator.

He allowed one walk, two singles and two hit by pitches for two runs.\n\nTHIS AND THAT\n\nIndians CF Bradley Zimmer stopped an 0-for-36 slide with a single off Perkins in the second game.\n\nBUXTON BUILDING\n\nByron Buxton reached on an error on 3B Giovanny Urshela, stole 2B for his 21st steal in 22 attempts, moved up on a groundout and scored on Ehire Adrianza's sacrifice fly for a 2-1 lead in the fourth inning of the second game. He homered in the first game.\n\nTRAINERS ROOM\n\nIndians: All-Star 3B Jose Ramirez left the first game in the second inning after becoming the first of four Indians batters hit by a pitch, but X-rays on his right forearm were negative. \"It hurt really bad, and I thought that I broke it. But I'm fine, thank God,\" Ramirez said through a translator. He sat out the second game.\n\nTwins: RF Robbie Grossman broke his left thumb, following a collision with Buxton in CF during a flyout in the second inning of the second game. He was replaced by Kepler in the third.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIndians: RHP Corey Kluber (11-3, 2.71 ERA) pitches Friday in Kansas City to launch a three-game series. RHP Ian Kennedy (4-8, 4.80 ERA) starts for the Royals.\n\nTwins: RHP Ervin Santana (12-7, 3.28 ERA) takes the mound Friday against Arizona for the opener of a three-game set. RHP Zack Godley (5-5, 2.95 ERA) pitches for the Diamondbacks, who will bring with them bench coach and former Twins manager Ron Gardenhire.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The Indians had won 10 straight games in Minnesota, all but one this season.\n\n\"I'm not sure he knows all that's transpired between us and that particular team on this field here, but he did a nice job of trusting himself,\" Twins manager Paul Molitor said, adding: \"It was just I think a big boost for everybody. He won a lot of respect from a lot of people in that clubhouse tonight.\"\n\nYan Gomes and Jason Kipnis each homered and had three hits for the Indians in a 9-3 victory in the opener as the Twins set a franchise record with 19 strikeouts.\n\nSlegers tried his best to keep the nerves at bay.\n\nRecalled from Triple-A Rochester as the 26th player for the nightcap, Slegers allowed only two hits and two runs with two walks and two strikeouts. The 6-foot-10 right-hander lost the lead when he left a runner on with one out in the seventh and Carlos Santana greeted Trevor Hildenberger (2-1) with an RBI triple while Kepler slipped in the right-field corner trying to grab it.\n\nBut Kepler responded with his 15th homer, off Mike Clevinger (6-5) in a spot relief appearance, and Matt Belisle recorded the last two outs for his third save. The Twins stayed six games behind the Indians in the AL Central and one game out of the second wild card spot, with Kansas City also in the way in both races.\n\n\"You always feel good coming out on top in a series. But this is a tough one,\" Clevinger said.\n\nKepler predicted he'd go deep to teammate Byron Buxton.\n\n\"Right before that, we were talking and he was like, 'I'm going to get that one back. Watch,'\" Buxton said. \"Sure enough.\"\n\nJay Bruce homered with two outs in the fourth inning for Cleveland's first hit off Slegers, giving the veteran right fielder five extra-base hits and six RBIs in eight games since being acquired in a trade with the New York Mets.\n\nRight-hander Ryan Merritt, the 26th player for the Indians who was summoned from Triple-A Columbus to start, hung in there until the fourth as the Twins built up their total of 13 men left on base.\n\nBut Buxton reached on an error on third baseman Giovanny Urshela, picked up his 21st steal in 22 attempts, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Ehire Adrianza's sacrifice fly for a 2-1 lead in the fourth inning.\n\nSlegers, a true late bloomer who was limited by many injuries in high school and college , was a fifth-round draft pick by the Twins out of Indiana in 2013. He actually pitched at Target Field in the Big Ten tournament that year. His parents, grandparents and numerous other relatives, some of them Minnesota natives, were in attendance to watch.\n\n\"It's a little larger stage than the wild card race we have in Triple-A,\" Slegers said.\n\nConsider Indians manager Terry Francona a fan, too.\n\n\"He pitched with a lot more maturity than you'd maybe think a kid making his first start,\" Francona said.\n\nFOR STARTERS\n\nIndians starter Carlos Carrasco (12-5) allowed one run in five innings and escaped trouble with nine strikeouts. The Twins loaded the bases with no outs in the first, but Carrasco struck out the next two hitters.\n\n\"We'll take it because that had a chance to be a complete bullpen game,\" Francona said.\n\nKyle Gibson (6-10) allowed three runs and seven hits in four-plus innings for the Twins, the 15th time in 21 starts this season he didn't complete six innings.\n\nPERKINS RETURNS\n\nTwins LHP Glen Perkins returned to major league action in the ninth inning of the first game after a 493-day absence since April 10, 2016. After recovering from a torn labrum, Perkins retired one of six batters. He allowed one walk, two singles and two hit by pitches for two runs.\n\nTHIS AND THAT\n\nIndians CF Bradley Zimmer stopped an 0-for-36 slide with a single off Perkins in the second game. ... Buxton, who homered in the first game, is batting .341 in 82 at-bats since July 1.\n\nTRAINERS ROOM\n\nIndians: All-Star 3B Jose Ramirez left the first game in the second inning after becoming the first of four Indians batters hit by a pitch, but X-rays on his right forearm were negative. \"It hurt really bad, and I thought that I broke it. But I'm fine, thank God,\" Ramirez said through a translator. He sat out the second game.\n\nTwins: RF Robbie Grossman broke his left thumb, following a collision with Buxton's forearm in CF during a flyout in the second inning of the second game. He was replaced by Kepler in the third. Buxton said neither he nor Grossman heard the other calling. Molitor said Grossman will miss at least three weeks.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIndians: RHP Corey Kluber (11-3, 2.71 ERA) pitches Friday in Kansas City. RHP Ian Kennedy (4-8, 4.80 ERA) starts for the Royals.\n\nTwins: RHP Ervin Santana (12-7, 3.28 ERA) takes the mound Friday against Arizona. RHP Zack Godley (5-5, 2.95 ERA) pitches for the Diamondbacks.\n\n-- -- --\n\nFor more AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

Kipnis went deep two batters later to make it 7-2.\n\nWinners of six straight, the Indians are 9-0 at Target Field this year, outscoring Minnesota 65-19.\n\nByron Buxton homered for Minnesota, which set a franchise record by striking out 19 times in a nine-inning game.\n\nSponsored Content: How is your agency managing and maximizing its data? Share your opinions in a Federal News Radio survey.\n\nCarlos Carrasco (12-5) allowed five hits in five innings. He retired nine straight batters -- including five straight strikeouts -- after Buxton's second-inning home run. Carrasco has struck out 19 batters in 13 innings over his last two starts.\n\nCleveland starters have held opponents to one run or fewer in 10 of the last 13 games.\n\nJorge Polanco had an RBI triple with no outs in the seventh to get Minnesota to within 3-2, but Jason Castro struck out and Brian Dozier grounded out against Bryan Shaw before Tyler Olson struck out Robbie Grossman.\n\nKyle Gibson (6-10) allowed three runs on seven hits in four-plus innings for the Twins. Among his 97 pitches, he hit two batters and threw a wild pitch. This is the 15th time in 21 starts this season that Gibson didn't pitch six innings.\n\nJay Bruce had a two-run single in the first for the Indians and Kipnis an RBI single in the second.\n\nRAMIREZ HURT\n\nPostal Service may be able to raise price of stamps this fall\n\nCleveland 3B Jose Ramirez left the game in the second inning with an apparent right forearm injury. The first-time All-Star has 18 home runs and 58 RBIs this season. He leads the American League with 61 extra-base hits, including a league-tying 38 doubles.\n\nPERKINS IS BACK\n\nTwins reliever Glen Perkins allowed two runs in one-third of an inning after being reinstated from the disabled list. He missed more than 16 months with shoulder trouble.\n\nTen of his 19 pitches were strikes. He gave up a walk and hit two batters.\n\nPerkins last pitched for the Twins on April 10, 2016, eventually having surgery to repair a torn labrum on June 23, 2016. The former closer and three-time All-Star has spent his entire career with the Twins organization since being drafted in the first round in 2004.\n\nTRAINERS ROOM\n\nIndians: LHP Andrew Miller struck out two in a scoreless inning for Triple-A Columbus on Wednesday. On the disabled list since Aug. 2 with right knee tendinitis, the reliever is expected to rejoin Cleveland on Friday in Kansas City.\n\nTwins: LHP Dietrich Enns was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a left shoulder strain. Enns, who missed 2\u00bd months earlier this year with a shoulder strain, said he's not sure if it's same thing. An MRI is expected Thursday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRyan Merritt (0-0, 3.60) is scheduled to start Game 2 of the doubleheader for Cleveland against Minnesota's Aaron Slegers (0-0, 0.00). Both were called up as their team's 26th man. Making his major league debut, Slegers is 13-4 with a 3.18 ERA this season at Triple-A Rochester.\n\n___\n\nFor more AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball", "date": "2017-08-17",

Edwin Encarnacion scored from first on the play after singling as the final batter Slegers faced.\n\nTrevor Hildenberger (2-1) gave up the hit to Santana but stranded him at third base with a pair of groundouts. Hildenberger pitched 1 1/3 innings with the one hit allowed as Minnesota beat the Indians for the first time in nine home games this season.\n\nMatt Belisle struck out Encarnacion and Santana in the ninth for his third save.\n\nCleveland, which had its five-game winning streak snapped, has outscored the Twins 67-22 in Target Field this year.\n\nMike Clevinger (6-5) took the loss in relief of starter Ryan Merritt. Clevinger surrendered two runs on three hits and three walks in 2 2/3 innings.\n\nClevinger was originally scheduled to start Thursday before the Wednesday game was postponed due to rain, allowing Merritt to be added from Triple-A. Jay Bruce added his first homer in eight games for the Indians since being acquired from the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nCleveland won the first game 9-3 as Yan Gomes and Jason Kipnis each had three hits with a homer, and Carlos Carrasco continued the Indians' strong run of starting pitching.\n\nGomes provided a big insurance blast with a three-run homer in the eighth after the Twins closed within a run. Kipnis followed with his second homer in as many games, a solo shot, later in the inning.\n\nCarrasco (12-5) surrendered one run on a Byron Buxton home run in five innings while striking out nine batters. He yielded five hits and a walk.\n\nTwins starter Kyle Gibson (6-10) gave up three runs on seven hits and a walk in four innings. Minnesota struck out 19 times in the first game to set a team record for a nine-inning game.\n\nSlegers wasn't overpowering in the minors, striking out 97 batters in 130 1/3 innings in Triple-A this season, but the 6-foot-10 right-hander kept Cleveland off-balance with a mix of pitches. Slegers retired the first seven batters he faced. Bruce's homer with two outs in the fourth was the first hit and run allowed by the 24-year-old.\n\nBoth starters were recalled as the 26th man for the doubleheaders for their respective teams.\n\nMerritt, who had made a spot start in a doubleheader against the Twins earlier this season, avoided major trouble in his 3 2/3 innings. He was charged with two runs (one earned).\n\nMinnesota left the bases loaded in the second inning. The Twins added a run in the third off Merritt when Eduardo Escobar blooped a single to right field with the bases loaded. Merritt stranded two runners to end the inning.\n\nNOTES: Cleveland 3B Jose Ramirez left the first game in the second inning after being hit in the right forearm area by a fastball from Kyle Gibson. X-rays were negative, and Ramirez said he was feeling fine after the game. Manager Terry Francona said it was possible Ramirez could even play in the second game, but he was held out. ... Minnesota OF Robbie Grossman left the evening game with a fractured left thumb. Grossman collided with CF Byron Buxton in the second inning but stayed in the game and singled in his first at-bat. Max Kepler pinch-hit for Grossman an inning later. ... The Twins activated LHP Glen Perkins from the 60-day disabled list. Perkins, who had surgery to repair a torn labrum in his throwing shoulder last year, pitched in the ninth inning for his first appearance in the majors since April 10, 2016, a span of 273 games. He allowed two runs while getting one out. ... Minnesota placed LHP Dietrich Enns on the 10-day disabled list with a left shoulder strain. ...

He matched Jose Bautista in that category, and he has two more games in the current series to try to attain the title for himself.\n\nMore Twins coverage Preview: Twins vs. IndiansSantana, Indians power past Twins 8-1WATCH: Twins' Buxton robs homer in center fieldCleveland series critical for resurgent TwinsStaTuesday: Cuddyer carved out a niche with Twins\n\nYet Santana insists there is nothing about Target Field that has led to his success at the plate when he visits Minnesota.\n\n\"I try to concentrate on good contact, and that happens,\" Santana said after Cleveland's 8-1 win over the Twins on Tuesday. \"It doesn't matter if it's here or another park. Right now, I'm feeling comfortable. ... I feel great here.\"\n\nSantana wasn't the only Indians batter to enjoy his night at the plate Tuesday. Cleveland clubbed five homers as it won its fifth straight game. The Indians' lineup has continued to roll as of late and looks to do so again Wednesday with the chance to push Minnesota even further down in the American League Central standings.\n\nThe Twins (59-58) and the Kansas City Royals (60-59) are tied for second, six games behind the Indians (65-52).\n\nMinnesota right-hander Kyle Gibson will be tasked with slowing down the red-hot Cleveland lineup. Gibson (6-9, 6.02 ERA) hasn't pitched deep into games lately. He has gone more than six innings just once in his past five starts.\n\nNow Gibson faces a team he hasn't had much luck against throughout his career. In 12 starts vs. Cleveland, he is 2-5 with a 5.75 ERA. This season, he is 0-2 with a 3.94 ERA in three starts against the Indians.\n\nGibson has another factor working against him Wednesday. The Twins have yet to beat the Indians at Target Field this year in eight attempts. Cleveland has dominated Minnesota in Minneapolis but is just 1-5 at home against the Twins.\n\n\"It doesn't really make sense, but there's a lot of things in our game that you spin your head around trying to figure out,\" Twins manager Paul Molitor said. \"Obviously, I'm well aware that they've come in here and dominated us in our own park. We've got a couple more chances to get in the win column against them here before we go there and play them there in September.\"\n\nTrying to make it a perfect 9-0 for Cleveland at Target Field will be Carlos Carrasco, who takes the mound Wednesday. Carrasco (11-5, 3.83 ERA) has already pitched in Minneapolis once this season, earning a win back on June 16 when he gave up just one run and four hits in 6 1/3 innings. He is 3-6 with a 4.43 ERA in 15 career games (12 starts) against the Twins.\n\nCarrasco got plenty of run support in his previous outing at Target Field as Cleveland won that game 8-1 -- the same final as Tuesday's victory. The Indians' lineup hopes to keep riding the wave as the series continues.\n\n\"It's one of those things that's contagious,\" said Austin Jackson, who hit one of Cleveland's five homers on Tuesday. \"When you see those guys swinging the bats, doing their job in the middle of the order, it definitely takes a lot of pressure off the rest of us.\"", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 100, "id": 206, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "wgt": 100, "id": 432, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The_Americas", "wgt": 100, "id": 654, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The Americas"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "type": "loc", "id": "213443"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "type": "loc", "id": "213450"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "302624", "label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303571", "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304992", "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305786", "label": {"eng": "Batting average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305791", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "305860", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305863", "label": {"eng": "American League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Indians", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "305864", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "310511", "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "310553", "label": {"eng": "Baseball park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Bautista", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310891", "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Bautista"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Santana", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "311255", "label": {"eng": "Carlos Santana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "312738", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Molitor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "330933", "label": {"eng": "Paul Molitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "340436", "label": {"eng": "Target Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santana_(band)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "348589", "label": {"eng": "Santana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Carrasco_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "384769", "label": {"eng": "Carlos Carrasco (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Gibson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "425317", "label": {"eng": "Kyle Gibson"}}]}

He was charged with two runs (one earned).\n\nMinnesota left the bases loaded in the second inning. The Twins added a run in the third off Merritt when Eduardo Escobar blooped a single to right field with the bases loaded. Merritt stranded two runners to end the inning.\n\nNOTES: Cleveland 3B Jose Ramirez left the first game in the second inning after being hit in the right forearm area by a fastball from Kyle Gibson. X-rays were negative, and Ramirez said he was feeling fine after the game. Manager Terry Francona said it was possible Ramirez could even play in the second game, but he was held out. ...

But it also kept them just one game behind the Angels for a wild-card berth.\n\nMinnesota, unable to convert on multiple chances to drive in runs from third base, lost the afternoon half of the two-game day, 9-3.\n\nThe night game, a makeup of Wednesday's rainout that was played before fewer than 10,000 fans, wasn't all positive for the Twins, however. Robbie Grossman, the team's regular designated hitter, suffered a fractured left thumb during a collision with Byron Buxton while chasing a fly ball in the second inning. He's likely headed for the disabled list, and the remainder of his season may be in doubt.\n\nSlegers, a fifth-round pick out of Indiana University in 2013, received a loud ovation from the crowd as he departed in the seventh inning, after delivering one of the best debuts by a Twins pitcher in decades. Not since Pat Mahomes in 1992 and Brad Havens in 1981 had a Twins rookie pitched six or more innings and allowed only two hits in his first big-league game.\n\nUsing a fastball that clocked in as high as 94 mph and a changeup in the mid-80s, Slegers, called up just for the day as the designated \"26th man,\" retired the first seven batters he faced, walked Roberto Perez, and quickly erased him with a double-play grounder. Only when Jay Bruce connected with a 3-2 fastball, driving it into the seats in right field in the fourth inning, did Slegers give up a hit. And he responded by retiring another eight consecutive batters before a Edwin Encarnacion's single caused Twins manager Paul Molitor to remove him with one out in the seventh inning, leading 2-1.\n\nThe lead quickly vanished, however, when Carlos Santana greeted reliever Trevor Hildenberger with a line drive into the right-field corner, and Kepler slipped as he tried to field it. The ball reached the wall for a triple, tying the game. But Kepler redeemed himself in the bottom of the inning, blasting a pitch from Mike Clevinger into the right-field stands, the eighth time among his 32 career homers that he's connected against Cleveland.\n\nThe Twins added another run in the eighth when Eduardo Escobar's 100th career double scored Ehire Adrianza with an insurance run.\n\nThe day's first game was far slower and less heartening for the Twins, who struck out 19 times, a new franchise record in a nine-inning game.\n\nThe Indians, who outscored Minnesota 32-9 from the seventh inning on at Target Field this season, turned a 3-2 game into another rout when Gomes connected on a three-run homer off Ryan Pressly. The Twins had no such timely hit, though they had plenty of chances: Minnesota put three runners on third base in the game, had eight different batters try to drive them home, and failed every time -- six of them by striking out.\n\nKyle Gibson surrendered two runs in the first inning by giving up three hits to the first five hitters he faced; Bruce had a two-run single. Another run scored on Jason Kipnis' two-out hit in the second, and Gibson lasted only four innings, the seventh time in his 21 starts that he has failed to pitch five innings.", "date": "2017-08-18",

Kipnis followed with his second homer in as many games, a solo shot, later in the inning.\n\nCarrasco (12-5) surrendered one run on a Byron Buxton home run with five hits allowed in five innings while striking out nine batters.\n\nThe Indians' starting pitching has given up no more than one run in 10 of the past 13 games.\n\nThe Twins struck out 19 times in the game to set a new record for a single game.\n\nTwins starter Kyle Gibson (6-10) yielded three runs on seven hits and a walk in four innings. Minnesota has been outscored 62-18 at home by Cleveland this season.\n\nCarrasco lasted just five innings after some initial struggles. He threw 39 pitches in the first inning but escaped a bases-loaded, no-out situation without giving up a run. From there, the right-hander had the Twins swinging and missing at his offerings.\n\nAfter Buxton's leadoff homer in the second, Carrasco retired nine in a row. He struck out five straight batters at one point and six of seven. He gave up two hits to start the fifth, but held Minnesota off the board again.\n\nGibson threw 31 pitches in a long first inning. Miguel Sano's was charged with an error when he couldn't pick up Jose Ramirez's slow ground ball, adding to the woes. Gibson excited after allowing the first two batters to reach in the fifth.\n\nGibson has allowed nine runs in 14 innings in three starts since getting his spot in the rotation back when Jamie Garcia was traded to New York. He hasn't made it out of the fifth inning in seven of his 21 starts this season.\n\nNOTES: Cleveland 3B Jose Ramirez left the game in the second inning after being hit in the right forearm area by a fastball from Kyle Gibson. Ramirez was down in obvious pain before as he was attended to by an athletic trainer and was replaced by Giovanny Urshela. ... Minnesota activated LHP Glen Perkins from the 60-day disabled list on Thursday. Perkins has rehabbed from surgery to repair a torn labrum in his throwing shoulder last year. He pitched in the ninth inning for his first appearance in the majors since April 10, 2016, a span of 273 games. He allowed two runs on two hits, a walk and hit two batters while getting one out. ... The Twins placed LHP Dietrich Enns on the 10-day disabled list with a left shoulder strain. Enns, who was acquired from the New York Yankees in the Jamie Garcia trade, had allowed four runs -- three earned -- in four innings for Minnesota. ...

He matched Jose Bautista in that category, and he has two more games in the current series to try to attain the title for himself.\n\nYet Santana insists there is nothing about Target Field that has led to his success at the plate when he visits Minnesota.\n\n\"I try to concentrate on good contact, and that happens,\" Santana said after Cleveland's 8-1 win over the Twins on Tuesday. \"It doesn't matter if it's here or another park. Right now, I'm feeling comfortable. ... I feel great here.\"\n\nSantana wasn't the only Indians batter to enjoy his night at the plate Tuesday. Cleveland clubbed five homers as it won its fifth straight game. The Indians' lineup has continued to roll as of late and looks to do so again Wednesday with the chance to push Minnesota even further down in the American League Central standings.\n\nThe Twins (59-58) and the Kansas City Royals (60-59) are tied for second, six games behind the Indians (65-52).\n\nMinnesota right-hander Kyle Gibson will be tasked with slowing down the red-hot Cleveland lineup. Gibson (6-9, 6.02 ERA) hasn't pitched deep into games lately. He has gone more than six innings just once in his past five starts.\n\nNow Gibson faces a team he hasn't had much luck against throughout his career. In 12 starts vs. Cleveland, he is 2-5 with a 5.75 ERA. This season, he is 0-2 with a 3.94 ERA in three starts against the Indians.\n\nGibson has another factor working against him Wednesday. The Twins have yet to beat the Indians at Target Field this year in eight attempts. Cleveland has dominated Minnesota in Minneapolis but is just 1-5 at home against the Twins.\n\n\"It doesn't really make sense, but there's a lot of things in our game that you spin your head around trying to figure out,\" Twins manager Paul Molitor said. \"Obviously, I'm well aware that they've come in here and dominated us in our own park. We've got a couple more chances to get in the win column against them here before we go there and play them there in September.\"\n\nTrying to make it a perfect 9-0 for Cleveland at Target Field will be Carlos Carrasco, who takes the mound Wednesday. Carrasco (11-5, 3.83 ERA) has already pitched in Minneapolis once this season, earning a win back on June 16 when he gave up just one run and four hits in 6 1/3 innings. He is 3-6 with a 4.43 ERA in 15 career games (12 starts) against the Twins.\n\nCarrasco got plenty of run support in his previous outing at Target Field as Cleveland won that game 8-1 -- the same final as Tuesday's victory. The Indians' lineup hopes to keep riding the wave as the series continues.\n\n\"It's one of those things that's contagious,\" said Austin Jackson, who hit one of Cleveland's five homers on Tuesday. \"When you see those guys swinging the bats, doing their job in the middle of the order, it definitely takes a lot of pressure off the rest of us.\"", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "wgt": 100, "id": 52, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 100, "id": 206, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "wgt": 100, "id": 432, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "type": "loc", "id": "213443"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "type": "loc", "id": "213450"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302624", "label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303571", "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304992", "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305016", "label": {"eng": "Batting (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305786", "label": {"eng": "Batting average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305791", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "305860", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305863", "label": {"eng": "American League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Indians", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "305864", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "310511", "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310553", "label": {"eng": "Baseball park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Bautista", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310891", "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Bautista"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Santana", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "311255", "label": {"eng": "Carlos Santana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "312738", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Molitor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "330933", "label": {"eng": "Paul Molitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "340436", "label": {"eng": "Target Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santana_(band)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "348589", "label": {"eng": "Santana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Carrasco_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "384769", "label": {"eng": "Carlos Carrasco (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Gibson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "425317", "label": {"eng": "Kyle Gibson"}}]}

The chicken sacrifice failed to secure the proper mojo. Then, the injury bug interfered with his season.\n\nSo, Gomes was long overdue for some healthy karma in Minnesota. Thursday afternoon, the catcher delivered three hits, including a game-changing, three-run homer, to direct the Indians to their sixth straight victory, 9-3, against the Twins. The teams will meet again Thursday night for the nightcap of their doubleheader.\n\nGomes launched an 0-2 fastball into the left-field seats in the eighth, a few minutes after the Indians narrowly averted disaster.\n\nThe Twins clawed to within 3-2 and placed a runner at third with no outs. Bryan Shaw then struck out Jason Castro and induced a harmless groundout to third off the bat of Brian Dozier. Tyler Olson entered and struck out Robbie Grossman to end the threat and preserve the Indians' lead.\n\nThe offense rewarded the pitching staff for sidestepping danger. Two batters after Gomes' homer, Jason Kipnis socked a solo shot into the bed of red flowers above the wall in right-center.\n\nCarlos Carrasco labored through five innings, but he continued the Indians' recent rash of strong starts. Tribe starters have limited the opposition to one or zero runs in 10 of their last 13 games. The rotation owns the American League's best ERA since July 1.\n\nCarrasco held the Twins to one run on five hits. He tallied nine strikeouts.\n\nIt wasn't always pretty. Carrasco needed 39 pitches to complete the first inning. Dozier started things off with a 10-pitch walk. Carrasco somehow escaped damage, even though the Twins loaded the bases with no outs.\n\nThe Indians staked the right-hander to an early advantage, as Jay Bruce contributed a two-run single in the top of the first. Kipnis delivered an RBI single the following frame.\n\nCleveland forced Twins starter Kyle Gibson to toss 31 pitches in the first inning. Gibson surrendered three runs on seven hits over four innings.\n\nGomes reached in all five of his plate appearances. He was a factor behind the plate, too. He picked off Jorge Polanco at second base in the fifth inning with an on-target throw that had Carrasco hit the deck. Gomes also applied an impressive tag on Joe Mauer as the first baseman attempted to score on an Eddie Rosario single off the center-field fence. Gomes caught the relay throw and swiped Mauer on the helmet as he slid into the plate.\n\nWhat it means\n\nThe Indians improved to 9-0 at Target Field this season. They have started their four-city, 11-game roadtrip with a 6-1 mark.\n\nEarly exit\n\nJose Ramirez exited in the top of the second after he was struck by a pitch in the right arm. Ramirez started his jog to first base, but he stopped about halfway and crouched down in pain. Manager Terry Francona and head athletic trainer James Quinlan rushed out of the dugout to check on him.\n\nGiovanny Urshela replaced Ramirez on the bases and at the third-base position. Ramirez has appeared in all but one game for the Indians this season.\n\nAt last\n\nBradley Zimmer recorded his first hit of August with a ninth-inning single. That snapped an 0-for-36 stretch that included 18 strikeouts.\n\nSwing and a miss\n\nTribe pitchers totaled 19 strikeouts, a record for a team facing the Twins. Every Twins hitter who appeared in the game struck out at least once.\n\nBrief cameos\n\nTwins starting pitchers have lasted five innings or fewer in six straight games. Gibson departed after allowing the first two batters to reach in the fifth.\n\nWelcome back\n\nMinnesota reliever Glen Perkins made his first appearance since April 10, 2016. He had been recovering from shoulder surgery.\n\nThey came, they saw\n\nA crowd of 29,579 watched the first game of the split doubleheader.\n\nWhat's next\n\nThe teams will reconvene for the nightcap, which carries a 7:10 p.m. ET first pitch. Both teams will use a roster addition, as southpaw Ryan Merritt will oppose right-hander Aaron Slegers, who will be making his major-league debut.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri":

He threw a lot of strikes. To go as long as he did and pitch as effectively as he did, it was just, I think, a big boost for everybody.\n\n\"He won a lot of respect for a lot of people in that clubhouse tonight.\"\n\nArizona is also challenging for the playoffs, owning one wild-card spot in the National League after a 4-0 win in Houston on Thursday.\n\nTwo prime pitching matchups will be featured in the next couple of games. Minnesota All-Star right-hander Ervin Santana (12-7, 3.28 ERA) will start Friday against Arizona's Zack Godley (5-5, 2.95), and Minnesota's Jose Berrios will face Arizona's Zack Greinke on Saturday.\n\nBartolo Colon will start the third game for the Twins, but Arizona is unsure of its Sunday starter.\n\n\"We have some candidates that we're walking through,\" manager Torey Lovullo told MLB.com. \"We still haven't made that final decision. Sunday is TBA. We want to get to it as soon as possible so we can let everyone prepare for what they're going to do.\"\n\nSantana is coming off a five-inning no-decision against Detroit in his last outing as he gave up four runs (two earned) on Sunday. Santana is 3-0 with a 1.23 ERA in four career starts against the Diamondbacks.\n\nWith their ace on the mound and finally getting a win against the Indians at home, Minnesota can turn the page to Arizona.\n\n\"It's the old 1-9 is better than 0-10 kind of deal, so we'll take it,\" Molitor said of playing Cleveland. \"Hopefully these guys get a good rest, and you don't have long before you have to get back at a new team.\"\n\nThe Twins lost the first game of Thursday's doubleheader 9-3 but came back to win 4-2 in the nightcap behind Slegers' strong performance and Max Kepler's go-ahead homer in the seventh inning.\n\n\"Most definitely,\" outfielder Byron Buxton said of the nightcap being a big win. \"After that first game, we just told ourselves not to press and not worry about anything. Just come back out there and play the game the right way and play it hard and whatever happens, happens.\"\n\nArizona also felt beating Houston on Thursday was important after back-to-back losses.\n\n\"You don't want to call it a must-win, but this is a good team -- the type of team that we would face if we get into the playoffs -- and they got us the last two nights,\" Daniel Descalso told MLB.com after hitting an inside-the-park homer in the game.\n\nGodley has established himself as an important figure in the Diamondbacks' push for the playoffs.

Only one newcomer stood in the way.\n\nThat unfamiliar right arm, Twins pitcher Aaron Slegers, defended Minnesota's home turf in fine fashion. For the first and only time this season, the Indians dropped a game in the Twin Cities, 4-2.\n\nThe loss snapped Cleveland's six-game winning streak.\n\nSlegers shut down the Indians' offense, which erupted in the late innings of the opener of Thursday's doubleheader. The Tribe bats hibernated in the nightcap, as the Indians wrapped up the road portion of their season series against the Twins with a 9-1 record.\n\nThe Indians mustered only two hits against the 6-foot-10 right-hander. Jay Bruce tagged him for a solo shot to deep right in the fourth, the club's first hit of the game. Edwin Encarnacion forced Slegers from the game with a one-out single in the seventh. Carlos Santana then socked a triple to right to erase the Indians' one-run deficit.\n\nMax Kepler, who slipped in the right-field corner to aid Santana's cause, atoned for his miscue with a go-ahead home run in the ensuing half-inning.\n\nIt was an astute way for the Twins to reattain the lead, considering the small village of runners they had already stranded on the bases. After the sixth inning, the Twins had out-hit the Indians, 10-1, but had stranded 11 runners.\n\nThey left the bases loaded in the second and the sixth and they squandered another bases-loaded opportunity in the fourth. With the bags packed, Eddie Rosario sent a bouncer to Carlos Santana, who stepped on first and threw to the plate. Roberto Perez placed the tag on Joe Mauer, who failed to sneak his right foot in behind Perez's glove. The double play stood after a review of one minute, 56 seconds.\n\nThe Indians tabbed southpaw Ryan Merritt for the spot start on Thursday night. He lasted only 3 2/3 innings, as he allowed two runs (one earned) on six hits. The Indians' rotation had limited the opposition to one or zero runs in 10 of the team's previous 13 games.\n\nCarlos Carrasco logged only five innings in the opening game and the Indians called upon five relievers to patch together the remaining frames. So, Terry Francona turned to Mike Clevinger to cover a sizable chunk of Thursday evening's game.\n\nClevinger was originally scheduled to start on Thursday, but Wednesday's rainout had the Indians shuffle their plans. Had Clevinger and Carrasco both started on Thursday, the Indians would have had to make a roster move to add a starter for Monday's series opener against Boston.\n\nClevinger labored through 60 pitches, however, and Kepler smacked an 88-mph offering toward the drink rails in right field. The Twins tacked on an insurance run in the eighth, as Trevor Bauer -- slated to start for the Tribe on Saturday -- served up an RBI double to Eduardo Escobar.\n\nWhat it means\n\nThe Indians (66-53) stand at 6-2 on their four-city, 11-game road trip.\n\nNight off\n\nJose Ramirez did not make an appearance, though the Indians were relieved Thursday afternoon to learn his X-rays came back negative. Ramirez was struck by a pitch in the right arm and exited the opening game in the second inning.\n\nOuch\n\nKepler replaced right fielder Robbie Grossman at the plate in the third inning. Grossman, who singled in his only at-bat, left the game with a fractured left thumb.\n\nNot too shabby\n\nSlegers' outing was the longest by a Twins hurler making his major-league debut since Yohan Pino went seven innings against the White Sox on June 19, 2014. Slegers was the first Twins pitcher to record an out in the sixth inning since Bartolo Colon did so on Aug. 9.\n\nThe Indians' season-long trip concludes with three games in Kansas City this weekend. Corey Kluber (11-3, 2.71 ERA) will start the series opener on Friday night at Kauffman Stadium. The right-hander has posted a 1.85 ERA in 14 starts since June 1, with 151 strikeouts in 102 1/3 innings. The Royals will counter the Tribe ace with righty Ian Kennedy (4-8, 4.80 ERA).", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games"}, {"uri":

The 6-10 Slegers will start the second game, which is scheduled to begin at 6:10 p.m.\n\nWith the Twins also playing a doubleheader against the White Sox on Monday in Chicago, they now have to play seven games over a five-day stretch -- and they will need a different starting pitcher for each game.\n\nSlegers, 24, will be the 32nd pitcher used by the Twins this season, adding to their club record, and he will be the 10th Twins player (and ninth pitcher) to make his major league debut. Slegers, who throws a good sinking fastball, was 13-4 with a 3.18 ERA in 21 starts for Class AAA Rochester. In 130\u2153 innings, Slegers has walked 27 and struck out 97.\n\nIt won't be his Target Field debut, however. Slegers pitched there for Indiana in the 2013 Big Ten tournament.\n\nIn his most recent start for the Red Wings on Saturday, Slegers gave up two runs over 7\u2153 innings on eight hits with no walks and six strikeouts. He needs to be added to the 40-man roster, but the Twins have some flexibility on that end, with only 38 players on it as of Wednesday.\n\nThursday's first game will feature Wednesday's scheduled starters, Kyle Gibson for the Twins and Carlos Carrasco for the Indians. In Game 2, Slegers will face Cleveland lefthander Ryan Merritt. Merritt, whose wife is from Minnesota, also started a makeup game June 17 at Target Field, which Cleveland won 9-3; that was Merritt's only other major league start this season. The Indians are 8-0 at Target Field this season.\n\nThe Twins have spent the season trying to find some continuity in their starting rotation, but injuries and ineffectiveness have forced them to scour the waiver wire and reach as far down as Class AA Chattanooga for pitching help. Even so. they have remained in the running for a playoff spot; they trail Cleveland by six games in the AL Central Division and are one game out of the AL wild-card race.\n\n\"Trying to hold our own here in a couple different races,\" Twins manager Paul Molitor said Wednesday. \"Give ourselves a chance.\"\n\nBut Wednesday's postponement throws another wrench into their starting pitching plans.\n\nBetween the doubleheaders, the Twins play host to a three-game weekend series with Arizona. Jose Berrios, who was originally scheduled to start Thursday, has been pushed back to Saturday. Ervin Santana will start Friday vs. the Diamondbacks and Bartolo Colon on Sunday.\n\nAs for Monday's doubleheader, the Twins have not announced anything. Here's where they will either dip down into the minors again -- or pull a magic rabbit out of their hat.\n\nRighthander Dillon Gee could be used in one of the games Monday. But it's likely that he will be needed out of the bullpen during this busy period. Rookie lefthander Dietrich Enns, who made his major league debut last Thursday at Milwaukee, had been scheduled to start Sunday against Arizona, but his status was unknown as of Wednesday night.\n\nSo the Twins might have to look toward Rochester again. Lefthander Stephen Gonsalves, the organization's top pitching prospect, pitched Tuesday for the Red Wings and could be summoned to face the White Sox on an extra day of rest. He has made two starts since being promoted from Chattanooga, going 1-0 with a 2.08 ERA.\n\nOr the Twins might have something else up their sleeves.

The catcher also helped starter Carlos Carrasco grind out five innings, and delivered a key pickoff throw to halt a potential Twins rally while the game was still close.\n\nWith the victory, the Indians have now won their last 10 games at Target Field, dating back to last season. That is Cleveland's longest road winning streak in Minnesota in franchise history.\n\nGomes' home run came in a four-run eighth inning against Minnesota reliever Ryan Pressly, who also yielded a solo shot to Jason Kipnis. Twins starter Kyle Gibson lasted four-plus innings, in which he was charged with three runs on seven hits. Indians right fielder Jay Bruce (two-run single) and Kipnis (RBI single) each chipped in against Gibson.\n\nCarrasco endured a rocky start to his afternoon, but the big righty reeled things in and limited the Twins to one run (on a Byron Buxton homer) and ended with nine strikeouts. Jorge Polanco later contributed an RBI triple against Tribe reliever Bryan Shaw in the seventh.\n\nMOMENTS THAT MATTERED\n\nPolanco picked off: Trailing 3-1 in the fifth, the Twins had the makings of a rally with runners on first and second with no outs. Carrasco then struck out Brian Dozier, setting the stage for a critical play. With Max Kepler batting, Gomes came up firing after a Carrasco pitch, picking off Polanco at second base. Per Statcast\u2122, Polanco's secondary lead pulled him 21 feet away from the bag. Kepler then grounded out to end the frame.\n\nCarrasco's escape: After the Indians forced Gibson to toil through 31 pitches in the top of the first, the Twins answered by making Carrasco work through 39 in the home half. Minnesota loaded the bases with no outs, but the Tribe starter found a way to sidestep harm in the draining inning. Carrasco struck out Miguel Sano and Eddie Rosario, and then induced an inning-ending groundout off the bat of Eduardo Escobar.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "wgt": 100, "id": 432, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "type": "loc", "id": "213450"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302624", "label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303569", "label": {"eng": "Handedness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303713", "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303714", "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305018", "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305020", "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305021", "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305786", "label": {"eng": "Batting average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305791", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305794", "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "305860", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305863", "label": {"eng": "American League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307686", "label": {"eng": "Triple (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310537", "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball_(H)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "310543", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of baseball (H)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball_(S)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310589", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of baseball (S)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310591", "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "327981", "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Buxton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "330938", "label": {"eng": "Byron Buxton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Bruce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "334409", "label": {"eng": "Jay Bruce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "334720", "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_by_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "339036", "label": {"eng": "Hit by pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "340436", "label": {"eng": "Target Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kipnis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "384150", "label": {"eng": "Jason Kipnis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Dozier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "384151", "label": {"eng": "Brian Dozier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Carrasco_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "384769", "label": {"eng": "Carlos Carrasco (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Gibson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "425317", "label": {"eng": "Kyle Gibson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "516066", "label": {"eng": "Bryan Shaw"}}]}

That homer also served as a bit of redemption for Kepler in the process.\n\nIn the top of the seventh, Kepler slipped and tumbled to the grass while in pursuit of a hit off the bat of Carlos Santana. The ball bounced to the wall to give Santana a triple that scored Edwin Encarnacion from first base, tying the game at 2. That blunder cost Twins rookie Aaron Slegers a win in a strong Major League debut.\n\nSlegers held the American League Central-leading Indians to two hits in 6 1/3 innings. That represented the longest outing for a Twins pitcher in his MLB debut since June 19, 2014, when Yohan Pino went seven. One of the runs off Slegers came courtesy of Jay Bruce's first homer with the Tribe, his 30th overall on the season.\n\nMOMENTS THAT MATTERED\n\nEscobar delivers: The Twins struggled with the bases loaded during both games of the twin bill. Eduardo Escobar broke through with the bags full in the third, however, with an RBI single. Escobar smacked an 0-1 cutter from Ryan Merritt into right, which allowed Brian Dozier to score. Minnesota came up empty with the bases loaded and one out the previous inning and did the same with two out in the sixth. In Game 1, the Twins loaded the bases with none out in the opening frame and were unable to score.\n\nUPON FURTHER REVIEW\n\nThe Twins elected to use their challenge on a play at the plate in the third inning. With the bases loaded and none out, Eddie Rosario hit a chopper to Indians first baseman Santana, who stepped on the bag and threw out Joe Mauer at home. Catcher Roberto Perez appeared to place the tag just before Mauer's foot crossed home plate. The call was ruled to stand.\n\nIn the fifth inning, the Indians challenged a safe ruling on a pickoff attempt by Clevinger. Santana gloved the throw and made a quick tag on Escobar as he dove back to the bag. After a review, the call was ruled to stand. Clevinger then struck out Byron Buxton to end the inning.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\nIndians: Ace Corey Kluber (11-3, 2.71 ERA) continues his AL Cy Young Award candidacy on Friday at 8:15 p.m. ET, when the Indians open a key three-game set with the Royals at Kauffman Stadium. Kluber, who has not faced Kansas City this year, is 8-1 with a 1.85 ERA and 151 strikeouts against 17 walks over his last 14 starts (102 1/3 innings).\n\nTwins: Right-hander Ervin Santana (12-7, 3.27) is slated to start the series opener at 7:10 p.m. CT on Friday against the D-backs at Target Field. In his last start, Santana allowed four runs (two earned) across five innings against the Tigers. He is 3-0 with a 1.23 ERA in four career starts vs. the D-backs.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games"}, {"uri":

Minnesota begins Friday one game behind the Los Angeles Angels for the second wild card in the AL.\n\n\"It was much-needed for Aaron to come up here, given the circumstances,\" Minnesota manager Paul Molitor said. \"I'm not sure he knows all that's transpired between us and that particular team (Cleveland) on this field here, but he did a nice job of trusting himself. He threw a lot of strikes. To go as long as he did and pitch as effectively as he did, it was just, I think, a big boost for everybody.\n\n\"He won a lot of respect for a lot of people in that clubhouse tonight.\"\n\nArizona is also challenging for the playoffs, owning one wild-card spot in the National League after a 4-0 win in Houston on Thursday.\n\nTwo prime pitching matchups will be featured in the next couple of games. Minnesota All-Star right-hander Ervin Santana (12-7, 3.28 ERA) will start Friday against Arizona's Zack Godley (5-5, 2.95), and Minnesota's Jose Berrios will face Arizona's Zack Greinke on Saturday.\n\nBartolo Colon will start the third game for the Twins, but Arizona is unsure of its Sunday starter.\n\n\"We have some candidates that we're walking through,\" manager Torey Lovullo told MLB.com. \"We still haven't made that final decision. Sunday is TBA. We want to get to it as soon as possible so we can let everyone prepare for what they're going to do.\"\n\nSantana is coming off a five-inning no-decision against Detroit in his last outing as he gave up four runs (two earned) on Sunday. Santana is 3-0 with a 1.23 ERA in four career starts against the Diamondbacks.\n\nWith their ace on the mound and finally getting a win against the Indians at home, Minnesota can turn the page to Arizona.\n\n\"It's the old 1-9 is better than 0-10 kind of deal, so we'll take it,\" Molitor said of playing Cleveland. \"Hopefully these guys get a good rest, and you don't have long before you have to get back at a new team.\"\n\nThe Twins lost the first game of Thursday's doubleheader 9-3 but came back to win 4-2 in the nightcap behind Slegers' strong performance and Max Kepler's go-ahead homer in the seventh inning.\n\n\"Most definitely,\" outfielder Byron Buxton said of the nightcap being a big win. \"After that first game, we just told ourselves not to press and not worry about anything. Just come back out there and play the game the right way and play it hard and whatever happens, happens.\"\n\nArizona also felt beating Houston on Thursday was important after back-to-back losses.\n\n\"You don't want to call it a must-win, but this is a good team -- the type of team that we would face if we get into the playoffs -- and they got us the last two nights,\" Daniel Descalso told MLB.com after hitting an inside-the-park homer in the game.\n\nGodley has established himself as an important figure in the Diamondbacks' push for the playoffs. The right-hander is 2-1 with a 1.78 ERA over his last four starts.

Minnesota begins Friday one game behind the Los Angeles Angels for the second wild card in the AL.\n\n\"It was much-needed for Aaron to come up here, given the circumstances,\" Minnesota manager Paul Molitor said. \"I'm not sure he knows all that's transpired between us and that particular team (Cleveland) on this field here, but he did a nice job of trusting himself. He threw a lot of strikes. To go as long as he did and pitch as effectively as he did, it was just, I think, a big boost for everybody.\n\n\"He won a lot of respect for a lot of people in that clubhouse tonight.\"\n\nArizona is also challenging for the playoffs, owning one wild-card spot in the National League after a 4-0 win in Houston on Thursday.\n\nTwo prime pitching matchups will be featured in the next couple of games. Minnesota All-Star right-hander Ervin Santana (12-7, 3.28 ERA) will start Friday against Arizona's Zack Godley (5-5, 2.95), and Minnesota's Jose Berrios will face Arizona's Zack Greinke on Saturday.\n\nBartolo Colon will start the third game for the Twins, but Arizona is unsure of its Sunday starter.\n\n\"We have some candidates that we're walking through,\" manager Torey Lovullo told MLB.com. \"We still haven't made that final decision. Sunday is TBA. We want to get to it as soon as possible so we can let everyone prepare for what they're going to do.\"\n\nSantana is coming off a five-inning no-decision against Detroit in his last outing as he gave up four runs (two earned) on Sunday. Santana is 3-0 with a 1.23 ERA in four career starts against the Diamondbacks.\n\nWith their ace on the mound and finally getting a win against the Indians at home, Minnesota can turn the page to Arizona.\n\n\"It's the old 1-9 is better than 0-10 kind of deal, so we'll take it,\" Molitor said of playing Cleveland. \"Hopefully these guys get a good rest, and you don't have long before you have to get back at a new team.\"\n\nThe Twins lost the first game of Thursday's doubleheader 9-3 but came back to win 4-2 in the nightcap behind Slegers' strong performance and Max Kepler's go-ahead homer in the seventh inning.\n\n\"Most definitely,\" outfielder Byron Buxton said of the nightcap being a big win. \"After that first game, we just told ourselves not to press and not worry about anything. Just come back out there and play the game the right way and play it hard and whatever happens, happens.\"\n\nArizona also felt beating Houston on Thursday was important after back-to-back losses.\n\n\"You don't want to call it a must-win, but this is a good team -- the type of team that we would face if we get into the playoffs -- and they got us the last two nights,\" Daniel Descalso told MLB.com after hitting an inside-the-park homer in the game.\n\nGodley has established himself as an important figure in the Diamondbacks' push for the playoffs. The right-hander is 2-1 with a 1.78 ERA over his last four starts.

Athletes who compete are not resilient. They are athletes. Competing is exactly their job.\n\nAnother: Consistency. As if a streaky hitter who produces 50 home runs isn't as admirable as a drone who hits .250 all season.\n\nBy the new, meaningless definition of the word, Kyle Gibson is a paragon of consistency. Since his first start of 2017, the season during which he was supposed to move toward the top of the Twins' rotation, he has finished just one start with an ERA lower than 6.00.\n\nCriticizing Gibson's performance may seem redundant, but he showed again on Thursday why his failure is so important to the Twins.\n\nHe was a first-round pick in 2009 by a franchise desperate for pitching. He teased in his first two full big-league seasons, going 13-12 with a 4.47 ERA in 2014 and 11-11 with a 3.84 ERA in 2015. If not an ace, he seemed destined to pitch in the middle to top of the rotation for years.\n\nThursday, he allowed three earned runs in four innings while throwing 97 pitches and fell to 6-10 with a 6.05 ERA.\n\nHe should spend next spring trying to make the Padres, or the Saints, but baseball is so bereft of functional pitchers that he may get another shot with the Twins.\n\nHe shouldn't. He has almost single-handedly kept the Twins from competing for a division title this year.\n\nHe is 0-3 in four starts against Cleveland this season. Statisticians argue that pitching victories can mislead, and that is often the case, but when losses accompany terrible pitching lines and unwatchable pitching performances, go ahead and stick the \"L'' on the appropriate forehead.\n\nIf Gibson had merely performed as well this year as he did in 2014, when he was still figuring out where the visiting clubhouses were in other ballparks, the Twins would have at least a few more victories, and would have required fewer innings from an overtaxed bullpen. They'd at least be in better position to win the second wild-card position.\n\nThursday, Gibson pitched against Cleveland at Target Field in the first game of a doubleheader. He knew that the bullpen was stretched thin and that he would have to be efficient as well as effective. He was neither. His four-inning stint was his shortest since July 9.\n\nHe fell behind, nibbled and failed to put away hitters with two strikes all while showing the mound presence of a shrug emoji. He wasn't just awful, he was awful in a way that sucked the energy out of his dugout and home ballpark, throwing 60 pitches in the first two innings of what could have been a meaningful doubleheader for the home team.\n\nGibson is making $2.9 million this year. That's not much for a veteran pitcher, but the way arbitration works, he'll make more next year if the Twins decide to keep him.\n\nWith his size, stuff and pedigree, Gibson could figure out how to pitch elsewhere, but in my eyes he's used up his chances here.

He'll cost his team a chance to win, then discuss how he saw some \"good signs.''\n\nAt this point in his career, the best sign for Gibson would read \"Lindbergh Terminal.\"\n\nHe doesn't meet even the lowest standards for the word \"resilient.\"\n\nConsistent?

These days, Sam Dyson is pretty good, and he pitches for the Giants. In April, Sam Dyson was pretty bad, and he was pitching for the Rangers. In the first game of the season, the Rangers led the Indians 5-3 in the seventh. The lead slipped away, and Dyson allowed three runs in the ninth to take the loss. In the third game of the season, the Rangers led the Indians 6-4 in the ninth. The lead slipped away, and Dyson allowed five runs to take the loss. The big knock was a one-out grand slam by Francisco Lindor; that currently stands as having been the third-highest-leverage plate appearance of the Indians' year. The half-inning was as unforgettable as any half-inning can be in the first week of April.\n\nThe Indians got things started with a sweep, a sweep that featured plenty of good clutch hitting. That's a great way to kick off a campaign, and it comes as little surprise that, in the middle of August, the team's sitting fairly comfortably atop the AL Central. They've done well to hold off the Twins. They've done well to hold off the Royals. Ask the Indians, and they'd probably tell you they've expected to return to the playoffs from day one. They are plenty good enough. And yet in one sense, while the Indians have a good record, they've won despite their own efforts.\n\nThis page shows the current BaseRuns records. The super-quick summary of BaseRuns is that it estimates wins and losses based on underlying performances. It attempts to strip away factors it interprets as lucky or unsustainable. By actual winning percentage, league-wide, the Indians rank sixth. By BaseRuns winning percentage, league-wide, the Indians rank third. Within the Central, they're clear of the Royals by 5.5 games, and they have a six-game lead over the Twins. Turn to BaseRuns, however, and the lead grows to 15.5 games over the Royals, and 20 games over the Twins. A comfortable lead becomes a laughable one. BaseRuns thinks the Indians have been all by themselves.\n\nNobody wins championships based on BaseRuns. And when there are deviations, the reasons are often numerous. There are reasons why the Twins and the Royals have both overachieved. I'm choosing here to highlight but one single factor. Why haven't the Indians been quite as good as it seems like they should've been? I'm going to borrow from the Baseball Reference team-splits page.\n\nOf course, FanGraphs has its own leverage splits, and I am contractually obligated to be brand-loyal, but I'm using data from Baseball Reference because of that tOPS+ statistic. It's like regular OPS+, except for any given split, it's calculated for a player or team relative to his or its overall performance. As always, with OPS+, average is 100. The key number in that table is 77. It's a reflection of how poorly the Indians have produced in the most important spots.\n\nIs this something the Indians have done before? Not so much.\n\nA year ago, in high-leverage situations, the Indians ranked 11th in baseball in tOPS+. Neither great nor bad. Just totally normal. This year, they're dead last. I probably don't need to spell out for you the link between high-leverage under-performance and overall team under-performance. A metric like BaseRuns tries to strip away the influence of timing. But, in reality, those high-leverage situations are the most critical. There's the most to gain or lose. If you are unusually lousy in the biggest spots, that's going to mean more than going hitless for a few too many first innings.\n\nUsing the Play Index, I examined the Indians as a franchise, going back to 1960. This information doesn't exist for the entirety of baseball history, so I went with 1960 as a simple cutoff. On a year-to-year basis, here is how the Indians have done in the high-leverage split, by tOPS+.\n\nThis year, again, they're at 77. Their previous low was 89. One would expect this season's figure to move, as there's still time for good ol' regression to take place, but if the season were to end today, the Indians would have one of the very worst marks on record. Here's the bottom 10, with the Indians highlighted.\n\nIf you figure all the 77s are tied, then only one team has been worse -- the 1994 A's, who played 114 games. It's not a coincidence such a number would've been achieved in a strike-shortened season. Again, the probability is that the Indians finish higher than 77 -- if you look at their breakdown, this isn't the kind of thing anyone would've expected.\n\nZimmer is a rookie, without a track record. Out of the other players, four are exceeding their career high-leverage tOPS+ marks, while eight have under-performed. There's no good reason why these Indians ought to be unclutch, and there's still time for them to find their level. You could say it's already happening. This is somewhat reflected by our own Clutch statistic, available on the team leaderboards. In April, by batting Clutch, the Indians ranked 23rd. In May, they were 29th. In June, 26th, and in July, 30th. So far in August, they're 10th. It's getting better. It's gotten better. The Indians have stretched their advantage.\n\nThey're better than this, and they're likely to play better than this. That's generally the conclusion of any and every post that discusses unclutch performance. You've read enough of them before. The Indians shouldn't finish with that tOPS+ of 77, but the fact of the matter is that, three-quarters of the way through the year, this is where they stand. That's what they've done. It's a mark that would quality as historically poor, and it helps to explain why the Indians' record isn't what it probably should be. Which isn't to say they're not responsible for their own outs, but I can't imagine why it would be a talent issue. My assumption is it's more of a timing issue. It's a thing that's just kind of happened.\n\nThe Indians have been legitimately unclutch. On the offensive side, anyway. They've been below-average in this regard on the pitching side as well, but it hasn't been nearly so dramatic. It's been the lack of big hits that's prevented the Indians from rising even higher in the standings. That seems like a bad thing, and indeed, no team would want this to be true. But the Indians get to move forward assuming this is going to normalize. That only makes them look even better.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "wgt": 100, "id": 381, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The_Americas", "wgt": 100, "id": 654, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The Americas"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Ethnic_and_Regional/North_American", "wgt": 100, "id": 875, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Ethnic and Regional/North American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/World_Cuisines", "wgt": 100, "id": 1258, "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/World Cuisines"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303571", "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303711", "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305786", "label": {"eng": "Batting average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310534", "label": {"eng": "Baseball statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310669", "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "338528", "label": {"eng": "Plate appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "338530", "label": {"eng": "Francisco Lindor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Dyson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "356282", "label": {"eng": "Sam Dyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_runs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "374586", "label": {"eng": "Base runs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPS ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "553867", "label": {"eng": "OPS+"}}]}

Salazar solicited the veteran for some pitching insight.\n\nIt either paid dividends, or Salazar never needed it to begin with.\n\nThe right-hander has silenced opposing bats in five starts since his return from the disabled list. Meanwhile, Colon pitched on Tuesday like a 44-year-old who debuted in the big leagues when Salazar was 7 years old.\n\n\"I wish him a lot of luck and a lot of health and to accomplish what he wants to accomplish,\" Salazar said.\n\nHere are a few thoughts on the Tribe.\n\n1. Words of wisdom: Salazar started to give himself between-pitch pep talks on the mound in the third inning.\n\n\"I was like, 'Slow, up, set and go,'\" Salazar said. \"I felt like I was rushing a little bit.\"\n\nSalazar began the routine amid a stretch of four consecutive strikeouts and 12 straight outs overall.\n\nIn his last five starts, Salazar has recorded a 1.39 ERA and a .161/.223/.223 opponents slash line. He has totaled nine walks and 46 strikeouts in 32 1/3 innings.\n\n2. Rotating: The easiest path to a lengthy winning streak is a torrid stretch from the starting rotation. The Indians' unit has produced a 1.89 ERA over the last 12 games. In that stretch, Tribe starters have limited the opposition to one run or zero runs on nine occasions.\n\nThe Indians are 17-7 over their last 24 games. Aside from a brief, two-game blip on the radar in Boston, the rotation has served as the catalyst.\n\n\"It's so fluid,\" Francona said. \"The minute you say that, somebody beats your [behind].\"\n\n3. That's a start: One solo home run off a quadragenarian does not a return to form make, but any strong swing from Jason Kipnis is a plus at this point. Kipnis launched his ninth homer of the season into the seats in right-center to hand the Indians the lead on Tuesday. Terry Francona seems intent on keeping Kipnis near the top of the order, so the second baseman -- constantly hampered by injuries this season -- might as well start hitting.\n\n4. Outer space: Edwin Encarnacion doesn't get cheated. His home runs typically scratch the ozone layer before landing in the seats. He nearly reached the third deck at Target Field with his fifth-inning home run on Tuesday. Byron Buxton ensured Encarnacion wouldn't register his second straight multi-homer effort with a leaping grab at the wall in the seventh.\n\nEncarnacion has produced a .253/.370/.491 slash line this season, with one home run every 18.3 plate appearances.\n\nLast season, Encarnacion logged a .263/.357/.529 slash line, with one home run every 16.7 plate appearances.\n\nSo, there's a slight drop-off (to be expected from a 34-year-old), but it's not as dramatic as it appeared earlier this season. It helps that that he has clubbed five homers in his last five games.\n\n5. Tale of two outfielders: As Austin Jackson continues his season-long resurgence, Bradley Zimmer continues his downward spiral at the plate.\n\nJackson, who signed a minor-league deal with the Indians over the winter, couldn't be giving the club better bang for its buck. He owns a .323 average and a .907 OPS this season. He's fared well against both lefties and righties. He's filled in at all three outfield spots.\n\nZimmer, on the other hand, is hitless in 32 at-bats in August. He drew a walk and stole a base on Tuesday. He can still impact games with his legs and his glove, but his bat has gone missing. Few, if any, rookies can avoid hitting a wall at some point, but this has been a brutal stretch for the Indians' center fielder.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "wgt":

The Red Sox third basemen created Boston\u2019s only highlight in a contest against the Padres that went downhill very far, very quickly on Friday night. Devers blasted a 439-foot home run in the bottom of the sixth inning, good for his 17th of the year. He broke a tie with Tyler O\u2019Neill for most home runs on the team following the solo shot. Devers also has a career high in OPS currently, sitting at .941 following Friday night. Despite that, Devers isn\u2019t gaining a whole lot of traction towards the MLB All-Star game. Jose Ramirez is leading the race to be the American League representative at third base. His home run (22) and RBI (73) totals are significantly higher than the Boston sluggers are, but it\u2019s worth noting Devers does possess a much better OPS than Ramirez (.879). After the Red Sox\u2019 recent series against Toronto, Blue Jays pitcher Chris Bassitt praised Devers\u2019s approach at the plate, and his understanding of how pitchers want to attack him. The Red Sox offense has come in waves this season, But Devers has been a positive contributor helping Boston inch closer to a wildcard spot. As for the rest of the game, though, it was all Padres. San Diego flooded Boston in the fifth inning, scoring nine runs and putting the game well out of reach. Nick Pivetta, known for putting together long starts, only managed four innings. He gave up five of the nine runs in the fifth and was pulled before recording an out.", "summary": "<p>Devers blasted a solo shot on Friday night, his 17th home run of the season.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-red-sox/2024/06/28/mlb-red-sox-padres-rafael-devers-home-run-ops-highlights/\">Rafael Devers gives a glimmer of positivity, but Red Sox lose in a blowout</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.boston.com\">Boston.com</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-red-sox/2024/06/28/mlb-red-sox-padres-rafael-devers-home-run-ops-highlights/", "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Padres_Red_Sox_Baseball_39355-667f80e25bfa7-scaled-e1719632118258-768x432.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 03:48:44", "author": "Colin McCarthy", "authors": ["Colin McCarthy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.063}

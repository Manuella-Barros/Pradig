I am sure that this also comes from the neocolonial mentality, the mentality of the colonial period, the period of the slave trade, and imperialism,\" she said.\n\n\"This does not only apply to India. The reason is the desire to unbalance the internal political situation in India in order to complicate the general parliamentary elections taking place in the country. Of course, this is part of interference in India's internal affairs,\" she added.\n\nGurpatwant Singh Pannun is an India-designated terrorist who holds American and Canadian citizenship. Earlier in November, the US Justice Department unsealed an indictment against an Indian national for his alleged involvement in a foiled plot to assassinate Pannun.\n\nThe External Affairs Ministry, in April, had rejected a report in The Washington Post naming Indian Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) official's involvement in the alleged post to kill Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the US.\n\nDescribing it as an \"unwarranted and unsubstantiated\" imputation on a \"serious matter\" that is under investigation, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said the US media report was \"speculative and irresponsible\".\n\nIn response to media queries on the report that appeared in Washington Post, a US national daily, Jaiswal said that a High-Level Committee set up by the Indian government is carrying out an investigation into the security concerns shared by the US government on networks of organized criminals, terrorists, and others.\n\n\"The report in question makes unwarranted and unsubstantiated imputations on a serious matter. There is an ongoing investigation of the High-Level Committee set up by the Government of India to look into the security concerns shared by the US government on networks of organised criminals, terrorists and others. Speculative and irresponsible comments on it are not helpful.\"\n\nCiting officials and a US indictment, the Washington Post report claimed that the RAW official identified as Vikram Yadav had directed Indian businessman Nikhil Gupta, to hire a hitman to kill Pannun outside his New York residence.\n\nGupta, now in custody in the Czech Republic has a pending extradition to the US to stand trial in the case. As per the report in the US Daily, the operation targeting Pannun was approved by then-RAW chief Samant Goel.\n\nNotably, as per the US Justice Department indictment, Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, who is currently in custody, has been charged with the murder-for-hire of Pannun.\n\nThe US Justice Department has claimed that Indian government employee (named CC-1), who was not identified in the indictment filed in a federal court in Manhattan, recruited an Indian national named Nikhil Gupta to hire a hitman to carry out the assassination, which was foiled by US authorities, according to prosecutors.\n\nGupta has been charged with murder-for-hire, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Czech authorities arrested and detained Gupta on June 30, pursuant to the bilateral extradition treaty between the United States and the Czech Republic.\n\nFollowing this, MEA said that a case filed against an individual in a US court and allegedly linking him to an Indian official is a \"matter of concern\" and is contrary to government policy.\n\nIndia has also set up a high-level committee to probe the matter.

I am sure that this also comes from the neocolonial mentality, the mentality of the colonial period, the period of the slave trade, and imperialism,\" she said.\n\n\"This does not only apply to India. The reason is the desire to unbalance the internal political situation in India in order to complicate the general parliamentary elections taking place in the country. Of course, this is part of interference in India's internal affairs,\" she added.\n\nGurpatwant Singh Pannun is an India-designated terrorist who holds American and Canadian citizenship. Earlier in November, the US Justice Department unsealed an indictment against an Indian national for his alleged involvement in a foiled plot to assassinate Pannun.\n\nThe External Affairs Ministry, in April, had rejected a report in The Washington Post naming Indian Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) official's involvement in the alleged post to kill Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the US.\n\nDescribing it as an \"unwarranted and unsubstantiated\" imputation on a \"serious matter\" that is under investigation, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said the US media report was \"speculative and irresponsible\".\n\nIn response to media queries on the report that appeared in Washington Post, a US national daily, Jaiswal said that a High-Level Committee set up by the Indian government is carrying out an investigation into the security concerns shared by the US government on networks of organized criminals, terrorists, and others.\n\n\"The report in question makes unwarranted and unsubstantiated imputations on a serious matter. There is an ongoing investigation of the High-Level Committee set up by the Government of India to look into the security concerns shared by the US government on networks of organised criminals, terrorists and others. Speculative and irresponsible comments on it are not helpful.\"\n\nCiting officials and a US indictment, the Washington Post report claimed that the RAW official identified as Vikram Yadav had directed Indian businessman Nikhil Gupta, to hire a hitman to kill Pannun outside his New York residence.\n\nGupta, now in custody in the Czech Republic has a pending extradition to the US to stand trial in the case. As per the report in the US Daily, the operation targeting Pannun was approved by then-RAW chief Samant Goel.\n\nNotably, as per the US Justice Department indictment, Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, who is currently in custody, has been charged with the murder-for-hire of Pannun.\n\nThe US Justice Department has claimed that Indian government employee (named CC-1), who was not identified in the indictment filed in a federal court in Manhattan, recruited an Indian national named Nikhil Gupta to hire a hitman to carry out the assassination, which was foiled by US authorities, according to prosecutors.\n\nGupta has been charged with murder-for-hire, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Czech authorities arrested and detained Gupta on June 30, pursuant to the bilateral extradition treaty between the United States and the Czech Republic.\n\nFollowing this, MEA said that a case filed against an individual in a US court and allegedly linking him to an Indian official is a \"matter of concern\" and is contrary to government policy.\n\nIndia has also set up a high-level committee to probe the matter.

Source: File Image/ Reuters\n\nRussia came out in support of India and gave a strong rebuttal to the allegations made by the United States over the foiled assassination plot against pro-Khalistani extremist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. The Russian Foreign Ministry not only rejected the American administration but also accused Washington of complicating the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.\n\nOn Wednesday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that the United States has not provided any form of substantial evidence in this matter, ANI reported.\n\n\"According to the information we have, Washington has not yet provided any reliable evidence of the involvement of Indian citizens in the preparation of the murder of a certain GS Pannun,\" Zakharova said in a press briefing. \"Speculation on this topic in the absence of evidence is unacceptable,\" she added.\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry spokesperson insisted that hurling such allegations without any solid evidence is disrespectful to India as a State. The Russian official's remarks came in response to a media query on Moscow's reaction to accusations against an Indian official of a foiled \"assassination\" plot.\n\nLast month, a Washington Post article claimed a Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) officer named Vikram Yadav was allegedly involved in the assassination plot. Citing unnamed sources, the news outlet mentioned that Yadav had enlisted a \"hit team\" to carry out the so-called operation.\n\nRussia accuses the US of meddling with the Lok Sabha polls\n\nDuring the press briefing, Zakharova bashed both The Washington Post and the US. She even pointed out the fact that the United States has hurled similar groundless allegations against several other nations.\n\n\"The Washington Post, it seems to me, should use the term \"repressive regime\" and everything you quoted in relation to Washington. It is difficult to imagine a more repressive regime than Washington, both in domestic and international affairs. Now directly about your question,\" Zakharova said.\n\n\"Regular unfounded accusations by the United States against New Delhi (we see that they groundlessly accuse not only India but also many other states) of violating religious freedoms are a reflection of the United States' misunderstanding of the national mentality, the historical context of the development of the Indian state and disrespect for India as a state,\" she added.\n\nDescribing the interference as a \"colonial period mentality,\" the Russian spokesperson accused the White House of complicating the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. \"The reason is the desire to unbalance the internal political situation in India in order to complicate the general parliamentary elections taking place in the country. Of course, this is part of interference in India's internal affairs,\" she added.\n\nThe Pannun Saga\n\nGurpatwant Singh Pannun is an India-designated terrorist who holds American and Canadian citizenship. Last year, the US Department of Justice unsealed an indictment against an Indian national and alleged his involvement in the assassination plot against Pannun.\n\nLast month, The External Affairs Ministry rejected the damming Washington Post report naming the RAW official. The ministry described the report as \"unwarranted and unsubstantiated\" imputation on a \"serious matter\" that is under investigation. MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal even called the report \"speculative and irresponsible\".\n\n\"The report in question makes unwarranted and unsubstantiated imputations on a serious matter. There is an ongoing investigation of the High-Level Committee set up by the Government of India to look into the security concerns shared by the US government on networks of organised criminals, terrorists and others. Speculative and irresponsible comments on it are not helpful,\" Jaiswal exclaimed.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Justice Department has already indicted Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, who is currently in custody and has been charged with the murder-for-hire of Pannun. The Czech authorities detained Gupta on June 30.\n\nAfter the arrest, MEA maintained that a case file against the individual and his alleged link to an Indian official is a \"matter of concern\" and is contrary to government policy. In light of this, India has also set up a high-level committee to probe the matter.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Pannun, wanted in India on terror charges, holds dual citizenship of the US and Canada. He has been designated as a terrorist by the Union home ministry under the anti-terror law Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.\n\nLast month, The Washington Post, citing unnamed sources, named a Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) officer in connection with the alleged plot to kill Pannun. According to the report, the R&AW official - Vikram Yadav - had enlisted a \"hit team\" to carry out the operation, marking Pannun as a \"priority\" target.\n\nFollowing the report, India set up a high-level committee to investigate the allegations.\n\nEarlier this week, the US said that it is waiting to see the results of the Indian investigations on the issue. \"They (Indian government) opened a committee of inquiry to look into the matter, and that work is ongoing; we'll wait to see the results. But we made it very clear that it's something that we are taking seriously and we think they, too, should take this seriously,\" US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller told the media.\n\nMeanwhile, India, last month, sharply reacted to The Washington Post's report on the alleged assassination plot of Pannun, saying that it is \"unwarranted\" and \"unsubstantiated\". Addressing the media, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said that speculative and irresponsible comments on the issue are \"not helpful\".", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurpatwant_Singh_Pannun", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gurpatwant Singh Pannun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Pakistani_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1970 Pakistani general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Zakharova", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maria Zakharova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_Analysis_Wing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Research and Analysis Wing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlawful_Activities_(Prevention)_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_External_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of External Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/09/1600x900/RUSSIA-EAEU--38_1715217897524_1715217927368.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544848", "eventUri": "eng-9544848", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

The ministry stated that Washington had failed to furnish sufficient evidence to substantiate Indian involvement in the incident.\n\n\"According to the information we have, Washington has not yet provided any reliable evidence of the involvement of Indian citizens in the preparation of the murder of a certain GS Pannun. Speculation on this topic in the absence of evidence is unacceptable,\" the official spokeswoman of the Russian foreign ministry, Maria Zakharova said at a briefing.\n\nAlso read: 'Speculative, irresponsible...' India dumps WaPo story naming RAW officer behind Gurpatwant Pannun murder plot\n\nZakharova highlighted that the United States demonstrates a lack of comprehension regarding India's national mentality and historical context in its development as a state, thus exhibiting disrespect towards India as a sovereign nation. Her comments were made in response to a media inquiry regarding Moscow's stance on accusations against an Indian official regarding a thwarted \"assassination\" plot, as reported by an American news publication.\n\n\"'The Washington Post', it seems to me, should use the term \"repressive regime' and everything you quoted in relation to Washington. It is hard to think of a more repressive government than Washington, in both domestic and international matters. Now directly about your question,\" Zakharova said, according to the readout of the briefing released by the Russian foreign ministry.\n\n\"Regular unfounded accusations by the United States against New Delhi (we see that they groundlessly accuse not only India but also many other states) of violating religious freedoms are a reflection of the United States' misunderstanding of the national mentality, the historical context of the development of the Indian state and disrespect for India as a state . I am sure that this also comes from the neocolonial mentality, the mentality of the colonial period, the period of the slave trade, and imperialism,\" she added.\n\n\"This does not only apply to India. The reason is the desire to unbalance the internal political situation in India in order to complicate the general parliamentary elections taking place in the country. Of course, this is part of interference in India's internal affairs,\" she added.\n\nGurpatwant Singh Pannun, identified as a terrorist by India, holds citizenship in both America and Canada. In November, the US Justice Department disclosed an indictment against an Indian individual suspected of involvement in a foiled plan to assassinate Pannun.\n\nPreviously, India's External Affairs Ministry dismissed a report in The Washington Post in April implicating an Indian Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) official in an alleged plot to eliminate Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the US. Describing it as an \"unwarranted and unsubstantiated\" accusation on a \"serious matter\" under investigation, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal emphasized that the US media report was \"speculative and irresponsible.\"\n\nResponding to media inquiries about the Washington Post report, Jaiswal highlighted that an Indian government-appointed High-Level Committee is currently investigating security concerns raised by the US government regarding organized criminal networks, terrorists, and other individuals. He stated, \"Speculative and irresponsible comments on it are not helpful.\"\n\nAlso read: WaPo reveals identity of RAW officer accused of ordering hit on Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun\n\nThe Washington Post report alleged that a RAW official named Vikram Yadav instructed Indian businessman Nikhil Gupta to hire a hitman to assassinate Pannun outside his New York residence.\n\nGupta is presently detained in the Czech Republic and faces extradition to the US to face trial in the case. According to the US Daily's report, the operation targeting Pannun received approval from then-RAW chief Samant Goel.\n\nThe US Justice Department asserted that an Indian government employee (referred to as CC-1), unnamed in the indictment submitted in a Manhattan federal court, recruited an Indian individual named Nikhil Gupta to enlist a hitman for the assassination, thwarted by US authorities, as per prosecutors. Gupta faces charges of murder-for-hire, carrying a maximum prison term of 10 years. Czech authorities apprehended and detained Gupta on June 30, following a bilateral extradition agreement between the United States and the Czech Republic.\n\nSubsequently, the MEA stated that a case filed against an individual in a US court, purportedly linking them to an Indian official, is a \"matter of concern\" and runs contrary to government policy.", "source": {"uri":

The Russian foreign ministry accused the US of having a \"neo-colonial mentality\" and called the allegations unfounded.\n\nForeign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova, when asked to respond to a report by the Washington Post claiming that India is trying to adopt the policies as Russia and Saudi Arabia, said, \"According to the information we have, Washington has not yet provided any reliable evidence of the involvement of Indian citizens in the preparation of the murder of a certain GS Pannun.

It is difficult to imagine a more repressive regime than Washington, both in domestic and international affairs,\" she also said.\n\nThe report by the Washington Post claimed that an officer in India's spy wing, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) had relayed final instructions to a \"hired hit team\" to carrying out the assassination of the Khalistani separatist, who has threatened numerous attacks against India. As soon as the would-be assassins could confirm that Pannun was home, \"it would be a go-ahead from us\", it added.\n\nThe External Affairs Ministry on Tuesday rejected the US media report. It dubbed the report \"unwarranted and unsubstantiated imputations on a serious matter\" at a time when New Delhi is investigating the issue. \"Speculative and irresponsible comments on it are not helpful,\" foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a statement.\n\nThe White House and the US State Department have said the foiled murder plot is being taken seriously and expected accountability from India, which has launched its own investigations after an Indian national was indicted last year. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Monday said India should take the allegations of its involvement very seriously and investigate.\n\nNotably, Pannun, a most wanted terrorist in India, is the general counsel of Sikhs for Justice, a group that New Delhi labelled an \"unlawful association\" in 2019, citing its involvement in extremist activities. Subsequently, in 2020, India listed Pannun as an \"individual terrorist\". The issue is a delicate one for both India and the Biden administration in the United States as they try to build closer ties in the face of shared concerns about China's growing power.\n\nThe US Justice Department has claimed that Indian government employee (named CC-1), who was not identified in the indictment filed in a federal court in Manhattan, recruited an Indian national named Nikhil Gupta to hire a hitman to carry out the assassination, which was foiled by US authorities, according to prosecutors. Gupta, now in custody in the Czech Republic has a pending extradition to the US to stand trial in the case.\n\n(with ANI inputs)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Czech authorities arrested and detained Gupta on June 30, pursuant to the bilateral extradition treaty between the United States and the Czech Republic.\n\nFollowing this, MEA said that a case filed against an individual in a US court and allegedly linking him to an Indian official is a \"matter of concern\" and is contrary to government policy.\n\nIndia has also set up a high-level committee to probe the matter.\n\nThis report is auto-generated from ANI news service.

According to the report in the US Daily, the operation targeting Pannun was approved by the then-RAW chief Samant Goel.\n\nThe US justice department has claimed that an Indian government employee (referred to as CC-1), who was not named in the indictment submitted in a federal court in Manhattan, enlisted an Indian individual named Nikhil Gupta to engage a hitman for the purpose of executing the assassination, which was prevented by US authorities, as per prosecutors.\n\nGupta has been accused of murder-for-hire, which can result in a maximum prison sentence of 10 years. Czech authorities apprehended and held Gupta on June 30, following the bilateral extradition agreement between the United States and the Czech Republic.\n\nFollowing this, MEA said that a case filed against an individual in a US court and allegedly linking him to an Indian official is a \"matter of concern' and is contrary to government policy.\n\n( with input from agency)\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

She said that the United States does not understand the national mentality or the historical context of the Indian state's development, and that it disrespects India as a state.\n\nZakharova's remarks came in response to a media question about Moscow's reaction to allegations against an Indian official of a foiled \"assassination\" plot, and the American news publication 'The Washington Post' stating that India is attempting to do the same as Russia and Saudi Arabia against its adversary.\n\n\"I believe 'The Washington Post' should use the term \"repressive regime\" and everything you quoted about Washington. It is difficult to imagine a more repressive regime than Washington, both domestically and internationally. Now, directly to your question,\" she added.\n\n\"Regular unfounded accusations by the US against New Delhi (we see that they falsely accuse not only India but also many other states) of violating religious freedoms reflect the US' misunderstanding of the national mentality, the historical context of the development of the Indian state, and disrespect for India as a state.

Russian foreign ministry accused the White House of complicating the 2024 Lok Sabha polls and described the interference as a \"colonial period mentality\".\n\nMoscow stated that Washington has not yet provided any reliable evidence of the baseless claims of involvement of Indian citizens in the murder plot of a Khalistani terrorist in that country.\n\nThe foreign ministry responded to a question regarding a recent report by the Washington Post, which claimed that an Indian intelligence officer hired a hit team to kill Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun.\n\nAlso read: Gaza war: Hamas and Israel teams leave Egypt amid 'ongoing' mediation efforts\n\nIndia has already issued a strong-worded response and denied the report, stating that the report made \"unwarranted and unsubstantiated\" imputations on a serious matter and that an investigation into the case was underway.\n\nThe ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said, \"According to the information we have, Washington has not yet provided any reliable evidence of the involvement of Indian citizens in the preparation of the murder of a certain G.S. Pannun. Speculation on this topic in the absence of evidence is unacceptable.\"\n\nLast year in November, US federal prosecutors charged an Indian national with collaborating with an Indian government official in the failed conspiracy to assassinate Pannun, who was designated as a terrorist by India under the anti-terror law Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.\n\nAlso read: Another Indian student goes missing in US; family alleges Chicago police 'not responding properly'\n\nZakharova further added that the US lacks an understanding of India's national mentality and history. She slammed the report for making \"unfounded accusations\" about religious freedoms in India.\n\n\"Regular unfounded accusations by the United States against New Delhi... we see that they groundlessly accuse not only India but also many other states... of violating religious freedoms are a reflection of the United States' misunderstanding of the national mentality, the historical context of the development of the Indian state and disrespect for India as a state,\" she said.\n\nAs quoted by RT news, she said, \"The reason is that they try to unbalance the internal political situation in India in order to complicate the general parliamentary elections. That is part of meddling in India's internal affairs.\"\n\nShe added, \"The Washington Post, it seems to me, should use the term \"repressive regime\" and everything you quoted in relation to Washington. It is difficult to imagine a more repressive regime than Washington, both in domestic and international affairs.\"", "source": {"uri": "wionews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WION"}, "authors":

Until they're proven before a jury that anyone can go and read, I won't speak to them here because, of course, it's an ongoing legal matter, and I'll leave it at that,\" spokesperson Matthew Miller said at a State Department briefing on Thursday (local time).\n\nMiller's remarks came in response to a media query on Pannun's case investigation.\n\nNotably, a Czech court has ruled that Prague can extradite to the United States the 52-year-old Indian, Nikhil Gupta, who is accused by the United States of involvement in the alleged attempt to kill Sikh separatist leader Pannun, a Czech-based media outlet Seznam Zpravy reported, citing judicial database Infosoud.\n\nAs per the US Justice Department indictment, Indian national Nikhil Gupta is currently in custody and has been charged with murder-for-hire, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Czech authorities arrested and detained Gupta on June 30, 2023, under the bilateral extradition treaty between the United States and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe US Justice Department had claimed that an Indian government employee, who was not identified in the indictment filed in a federal court in Manhattan, had recruited Indian national Nikhil Gupta to hire a hitman to allegedly assassinate Panun, which was foiled by US authorities.\n\nThe External Affairs Ministry too, in April, had rejected a report in The Washington Post naming Indian Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) official's involvement in the alleged plot to kill Khalistani terrorist Pannun in the US.\n\nDescribing it as an \"unwarranted and unsubstantiated\" imputation on a \"serious matter\" that is under investigation, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said the US media report was \"speculative and irresponsible.\"\n\nIndia has also set up a high-level committee to probe the matter.\n\nMoreover, the Russian Foreign Ministry on Wednesday said that Washington has not yet provided any reliable evidence of the involvement of Indian citizens in the case.\n\n\"According to the information we have, Washington has not yet provided any reliable evidence of the involvement of Indian citizens in the preparation of the murder of a certain GS Pannun. Speculation on this topic in the absence of evidence is unacceptable,\" the official spokeswoman of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova said at a briefing.\n\nMeanwhile, responding to a media query on the ongoing elections in India, the US State Department spokesperson said that Washington does not involve itself in polls anywhere around the world.\n\n\"Elections in India, as we don't involve ourselves in elections anywhere in the world,. Those are decisions for the people of India to make,\" Miller said.\n\nIn April, US State Department Principal Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel, on being asked about Lok Sabha elections in India and whether the US has sent any observers, said, \"I am not aware of the United States sending any observers. We generally don't in the case of advanced democracies like India.\"\n\n\"We, of course, are eager to continue to deepen and strengthen our cooperation with our partners in India, and we are just going to let the election play out. I don't have any assessment or comment to offer on that,\" he had said at a press briefing.\n\nLok Sabha elections are being conducted in seven phases from April 19-June 1 and is the second-longest polling exercise in the Indi's electoral history after the first general election, which was held over five months between September 1951 and February 1952.\n\nThe votes will be counted on June 4. Notably, the last general elections in 2019 were also held in seven phases.

The report had flagged India as a \"country of particular concern\" for the year 2024. The list also included Afghanistan, Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia as countries of concern with regard to the protection of their citizens' religious freedoms.\n\n\"[There have been] regular unfounded accusations by the United States against New Delhi,\" Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said at a press briefing, PTI reported citing RT News.\n\n\"We see that they groundlessly accuse not only India but also many other states of violating religious freedoms. [This is a] reflection of the United States' misunderstanding of the national mentality, the historical context of the development of the Indian state and disrespect for India as a state.\"\n\nZakharova added that the US' accusations were aimed at creating an imbalance in the internal political situation in India and \"complicating\" the general election.\n\nIndia's external affairs ministry on May 2 had described the US Commission on International Religious Freedom as a \"biased organisation with a political agenda\".\n\n\"We really have no expectation that USCIRF will even seek to understand India's diverse, pluralistic and democratic ethos,\" Randhir Jaiswal, external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal had said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Zakharova also commented on a report by The Washington Post that alleged the involvement of a Research and Analysis Wing officer named Vikram Yadav in an alleged foiled plot to assassinate Sikh Separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the United States.\n\nThe report, published on April 30, was the first time that allegations emerged about the identity and affiliation of an individual from within India's foreign intelligence agency in the Pannun case.\n\nThe report also cited assessments of American intelligence agencies that the operation against Pannun had been cleared by Samant Goel, the former chief of India's foreign intelligence agency..\n\nHowever, on Wednesday, Zakharova said that Washington has not yet provided any reliable evidence of the involvement of Indian citizens in the plot against Pannun. \"Speculation on this topic in the absence of evidence is unacceptable,\" she said.\n\nShe added: \"The Washington Post, it seems to me, should use the term \"repressive regime\" [for the United States government]. It is difficult to imagine a more repressive regime than Washington, both in domestic and international affairs.\"\n\nThe United States' spy agencies, according to the April 30 report in The Washington Post, also \"tentatively assessed\" that India's National Security Advisor Ajit Doval was likely to have known about the plans of the Research and Analysis Wing to kill Pannun. However, the newspaper quoted unidentified officials as saying that \"no smoking gun proof\" had emerged.\n\nIndia's external affairs ministry has said that the report made \"unwarranted and unsubstantiated imputations on a serious matter\".\n\nThe Washington Post's report came after the US Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York on November 29 announced that it had filed \"murder-for-hire charges\" against another Indian citizen named Nikhil Gupta in connection the alleged assassination plot. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.\n\nGupta was arrested on June 30 by the Czech authorities at the request of the United States when he travelled from India to Prague.\n\nThe Constitutional Court in the Czech Republic has stayed lower court orders approving Gupta's extradition to the United States.", "source": {"uri": "scroll.in", "dataType": "news",

RT news, a Russian government-owned news network, quoted the foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova saying that Washington lacks understanding of India's national mentality and history and continues to make \"unfounded accusations\" about religious freedoms in India.\n\nIn a statement, Zakharova called it disrespectful to India as a country and a State. \"The reason [behind the US accusations] is to unbalance the internal political situation in India and complicate the general elections,\" RT news quoted her as saying.\n\nIn the meantime, rubbishing the allegations by the US on India for a foiled assassination plot against pro-Khalistan radical Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that Washington has not yet provided any reliable evidence of the involvement of Indian citizens in the case.\n\n\"According to the information we have, Washington has not yet provided any reliable evidence of the involvement of Indian citizens in the preparation of the murder of a certain GS Pannun. Speculation on this topic in the absence of evidence is unacceptable,\" the official spokeswoman of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova said at a briefing on Wednesday (local time).\n\nShe said that the US does not understand the national mentality, as well as the historical context of the development of the Indian state and it disrespects India as a state.\n\nZakharova's remarks came in response to a media query on Moscow's reaction to accusations against an Indian official of a foiled \"assassination\" plot, and the American news publication 'The Washington Post' stating that India is trying to do the same as Russia and Saudi Arabia against its enemy.\n\n\"'The Washington Post', it seems to me, should use the term \"repressive regime\" and everything you quoted in relation to Washington. It is difficult to imagine a more repressive regime than Washington, both in domestic and international affairs. Now directly about your question,\" Zakharova said, according to the readout of the briefing released by the Russian Foreign Ministry.\n\n\"Regular unfounded accusations by the United States against New Delhi (we see that they groundlessly accuse not only India but also many other states) of violating religious freedoms are a reflection of the United States' misunderstanding of the national mentality, the historical context of the development of the Indian state and disrespect for India as a state .

Zakharova further criticized the US for its apparent disregard of India's national mentality and historical context, asserting that such accusations disrespect India as a sovereign state.\n\nZakharova's remarks come amidst escalating tensions sparked by accusations against an Indian official in connection with the foiled assassination plot. Referring to reports by 'The Washington Post' alleging similarities between India's actions and those of Russia and Saudi Arabia against perceived enemies, Zakharova suggested that the term \"repressive regime\" would better apply to Washington, highlighting what she perceives as a double standard in the assessment of global affairs.\n\nMoreover, Zakharova condemned the recurring unfounded accusations leveled by the United States against India, attributing them to a lack of understanding of India's national psyche and historical background. She suggested that such actions stem from a neocolonial mentality, aimed at destabilizing India's internal political landscape and interfering with its parliamentary elections.\n\nGurpatwant Singh Pannun, identified as an India-designated terrorist holding American and Canadian citizenship, has been at the center of the controversy. In November, the US Justice Department unveiled an indictment against an Indian national for his alleged involvement in the plot to assassinate Pannun.\n\nIndia's Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has vehemently denied the allegations, describing them as unwarranted and unsubstantiated. MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal emphasized that the matter is under investigation by a High-Level Committee established by the Indian government, urging against speculative and irresponsible commentary.\n\nAlso read: Sam Pitroda Resigns Amidst Controversy Over Racist Remark\n\nThe Washington Post report, citing officials and a US indictment, implicated a Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) official named Vikram Yadav in directing an Indian businessman, Nikhil Gupta, to orchestrate the assassination of Pannun in New York. Gupta, currently in custody in the Czech Republic pending extradition to the US, faces charges related to the murder-for-hire plot.\n\nThe US Justice Department has alleged that an Indian government employee, identified as \"CC-1,\" recruited Nikhil Gupta to hire a hitman for the assassination, a charge that Gupta denies. Gupta's arrest by Czech authorities and the subsequent legal proceedings underscore the gravity of the situation.\n\nIn response to these developments, the MEA expressed concern over the implications of the case, particularly its connection to an Indian official, emphasizing the government's commitment to conducting a thorough investigation.\n\nAs the accusations and counterarguments continue to unfold, the diplomatic relations between India and the United States face renewed scrutiny, with both sides grappling to navigate the complexities of the situation while upholding their respective interests and integrity.", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsX"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The article was based on interviews with three dozen current and former unidentified senior officials in the United States, India, Canada, Britain, Germany and Australia.\n\nThe United States' spy agencies also \"more tentatively assessed\" that India's National Security Advisor Ajit Doval was likely to have known about the plans of the Research and Analysis Wing, according to The Washington Post. However, the newspaper quoted unidentified officials as saying that \"no smoking gun proof\" had emerged.\n\nIndia's external affairs ministry said that the report made \"unwarranted and unsubstantiated imputations on a serious matter\".\n\nIn March, a Bloomberg report said that New Delhi's investigation into the claims found that rogue officials not authorised by the Indian government had been involved in the alleged plot to kill the Sikh separatist leader, who is a designated terrorist in India.\n\nThe allegations of India's involvement in the alleged assassination plot first came to light on November 29, when the United States Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York, announced that it had filed \"murder-for-hire charges\" against an Indian national named Nikhil Gupta in connection with the matter.\n\nThe United States' charges came two months after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that there were \"credible\" allegations linking Indian agents to the murder of Nijjar, who was shot dead in the parking lot of a gurdwara in Surrey near Vancouver on June 18.", "source": {"uri": "scroll.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scroll.in"},

That is part of meddling into India's domestic affairs,\" Zakharova was quoted as saying by The Times of India.\n\n\"Regular unfounded accusations by the United States against New Delhi of violating religious freedoms are a reflection of the United States' misunderstanding of the national mentality, the historical context of the development of the Indian state and disrespect for India as a state. I am sure that this also comes from the neocolonial mentality, the mentality of the colonial period, the period of the slave trade, and imperialism,\" she said, as quoted by ANI.\n\nThe report in question, drawn by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), raised concerns over India's purported infringements on religious freedom. It evoked a strong response from India's Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), which denounced it as biased and part of a recurring pattern of anti-India propaganda.\n\nZakharova, in addition to criticising the US stance on religious freedom, also accused Washington of adopting a repressive attitude and failing to respect India's sovereignty. She suggested that such behaviour stems from America's colonial mindset rooted in historical exploitation.\n\nFurthermore, Zakharova addressed allegations against an Indian official regarding an alleged \"assassination\" plot targeting pro-Khalistan leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. The Washington Post had published a report implicating a Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) official in the purported assassination attempt on Pannun.\n\nIndia's Ministry of External Affairs condemned the report as baseless and unverified, emphasising that the matter is under investigation. It also criticised the US media for publishing speculative and irresponsible information.\n\nZakharova weighed in on the situation, stating: \"According to the information we have, Washington has not yet provided any reliable evidence of the involvement of Indian citizens in the preparation of the murder of a certain GS Pannun. Speculation on this topic in the absence of evidence is unacceptable.\"\n\nWith accusations and counter-accusations flying between Russia and the US, tensions between the two over their respective stances on continue to escalate. As India grapples with these external pressures, it will be a walk on the tightrope for the country as it attempts to maintain friendly diplomatic relationships with both global superpowers.\n\n(With inputs from TOI)", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Zakharova", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maria Zakharova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Commission_on_International_Religious_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Commission on International Religious Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_External_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of External Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Russia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic slave trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Times of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imperialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Raj"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocolonialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neocolonialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_Analysis_Wing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Research and Analysis Wing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superpower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Jainism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Jainism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/109978344/is-the-us-interfering-with-lok-sabha-elections-russia-accuses-america-of-disrespecting-india-influencing-democratic-processes.jpg?imgsize=27226", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544848", "eventUri": "eng-9544848", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

The remarks come at a time when the case has seen numerous twists and turns.\n\nResponding to a media query on the arrest of three individuals \"linked to the murder\", US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, \"I would refer you to the Canadian authorities for the details into the investigation there.\"\n\nAsserting that the US would wait to see the results, Miller said, \"They opened a committee of inquiry to look into the matter. That work is ongoing. We'll wait to see the results. But we made very clear that it's something that we take seriously and we think it's something they should take seriously as well.\"\n\nIndia and Canada are dealing with an unprecedented diplomatic crisis after the Canadian PM accused \"agents of the Indian government\" of killing Canadian Khalistani leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023.

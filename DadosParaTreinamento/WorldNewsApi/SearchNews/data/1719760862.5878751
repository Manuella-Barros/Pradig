{"id": 225026444, "title": "Pilot's 'unexpected announcement' leaves family member mortified in cabin", "text": "An airline pilot left a family member in shock mid-flight after delivering an unexpected announcement over the plane's radio tannoy. The pilot embarrassed his cousin by revealing her seat number and joking she's a \"world class Olympic Polo player\" who \"carries her Olympic silver medal around everywhere\" with her. The 'Olympian' in question \u2013 Siobhan Leadbetter \u2013 is actually a Sky TV presenter and senior creative writer, who later took to TikTok to share a video of her unique shoutout with her followers after it left her red-faced. The majority of her fellow passengers appeared to miss the pilot's gag, however \u2013 even though Polo hasn't been an Olympic sport since 1936. The pilot began his speech as normal. He said: \"We have about one hour left or so or 50 minutes until the end of our journey.\" It was then he dragged poor Siobhan into his prank. \"Otherwise, the next thing I've got is a special shoutout \u2013 down in seat 8 is my cousin Siobhan \u2013 first family member in five years of flying that has managed to fly with me,\" he continued. \"So thanks Siobhan for coming. Everyone else on board should know she's also a world class Olympic Polo player with a silver medal at the Olympics so can we all give her a giant round of applause, that would be much appreciated.\" As Siobhan laughed nervously, her cousin joked: \"Thanks, I'm sure she will love that. She always carries her medal around with her... so if you want to see it just ask!\" Captioning the clip, Siobhan wrote: \"Was NOT expecting that announcement from the pilot. Realise he's about to royally wind me up.\" Her followers found the whole ordeal hilarious and were quick to comment on her clip. One person responded: \"Omg this is world class trolling. What a legend!\" Another asked: \"I mean your cousin winding you up from the cockpit... whose gonna top that?!\" A third added: \"Oh man. That\u2019s amazing and lovely.\" And a fourth agreed: \"Did you dirty!\"", "summary": "A television presenter has shared her embarrassment on TikTok after her airline pilot cousin made an unexpected announcement about her while they were on the same flight", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/pilots-unexpected-announcement-leaves-family-32915860", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30904043.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Airline-captain-and-first-officer-sitting-in-the-cockpit.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:15:08", "author": "Alan Johnson,Alan-johnson", "authors": ["Alan Johnson", "Alan-johnson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.204}

He had two running backs that could've played for anybody in the country. But he was a good player.\"\n\nRoughly 12 years later, they became position coaches at West Virginia University. Trickett coached the defensive line for two seasons before Saban joined for the 1978 and 1979 seasons to coach the defensive backs. Trickett later changed to offensive line, and has coached the position ever since.\n\nTrickett later met Jimbo Fisher, now Florida State's head coach, on an airplane ride they shared in 1993 before interviewing and spending six seasons coaching together under Terry Bowden at Auburn.\n\nAs Saban was forming his new coaching staff at LSU after being hired away from Michigan State in 1999, he needed an offensive coordinator and sought advice from an old friend.\n\n\"I was the one who introduced Jimbo,\" Trickett said.\n\nSaban, Fisher and Trickett only coached together for their first season at LSU before Trickett moved back to West Virginia to rejoin the Mountaineers. But their friendship remains strong whenever they reconnect.\n\nOn Sept. 2, FSU and Alabama will open the 2017 season in Atlanta.\n\nIt will be the first matchup for both teams since FSU beat Alabama 21-14 in Jacksonville on Sept. 29, 2007, during Saban's first season and Fisher's first as an offensive coordinator for Bobby Bowden.\n\nIn the highly anticipated game this time around, it will be the first meeting between Fisher and Saban as head coaches. But Fisher will not be the only former Saban assistant looking to score a victory.\n\nCurrent FSU linebackers coach Bill Miller and defensive ends coach Brad Lawing finished their first season on Saban's staff at Michigan State in 1999 before Saban left for LSU. The Spartans (9-2) won the 2000 Citrus Bowl against Florida and wanted to keep most of the coaching staff together under new coach Bobby Williams, who was later fired in 2002.\n\n\"Well, [Saban] left us, and he asked several of us to go with him,\" said Miller, who joined FSU in 2013. \"I know I'm a better football coach because I coached for Nick and learned from him. ... It's going to be a real fun thing here in a few weeks.\"\n\nLawing, who has spent the bulk of his 38-year coaching career in North and South Carolina, said moving to Michigan was out of his comfort zone. But working with Saban, even just for a season, was well worth it.\n\n\"The things I've learned from [Saban] have afforded me many opportunities in football,\" said Lawing, who joined FSU in 2015 after two seasons at Florida. \"We were always on the cutting edge on what was going on defensively, and I learned that from him.\"\n\nFisher's assistants say they can see the similarities in coaching styles between him and Saban, while Trickett adds Bobby Bowden's imprint is also evident.\n\n\"They're similar because they're both intense, want to win, and they want to do it the right way -- the total improvement of the kid as a player on the field and off the field, too,\" Lawing said.\n\nMiller stated it much more succinctly.\n\n\"Winning,\" he said with a laugh.\n\nBefore Fisher encouraged Bowden to hire Trickett and receivers coach Lawrence Dawsey in 2007, Dawsey worked with Saban and Fisher as a graduate assistant at LSU in 2003.\n\n\"I was the reason we won -- one and done,\" Dawsey said with a laugh.\n\nDawsey says the difference between the two is Fisher's stamp on the FSU program.\n\n\"I think he took a lot of things he learned from Coach Saban at LSU, but the thing I've seen the most is the players are empowered,\" Dawsey said of Fisher. \"It's their team. That's [your] team, but we're just here to help you manage the team.\"\n\nWith the season opener approaching, Fisher can lean on four assistants who are familiar with Saban. Meanwhile, Saban has former FSU defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt, who helped Fisher during the 2013 title run, on his staff.\n\nThe assistants may be a valuable asset for their head coaches, but Saban and Fisher insist time and evolving playbooks tend to offset any familiarity.\n\n\"It can't be good. It can't be bad,\" Fisher said coyly of the familiarity. \"We'll see.\"\n\nEmail Safid Deen at sdeen@orlandosentinel.com.

Stats aren't released but Nick Saban typically indicates whether the offense or defense gets the better of a given intrasquad.\n\nAs the lone voice on the topic, Saban's word stands typically until players get their take a few days later.\n\nSo, which was better in Saturday's first of two scrimmages? Saban answered when asked about new offensive coordinator Brian Daboll running things Saturday.\n\n\"I don't think we had the rhythm that we'd like to see on offense,\" Saban said. \"I'm sure he would say the same thing to you. I don't think that's a reflection on him. It's just the way it went today.\"\n\nAbsent of the full context, a few clues could be found in photos released by the school from the scrimmage action. A series shows cornerback Trevon Diggs intercepting a pass, though it wasn't clear which quarterback threw it.\n\n\"We've had good days and we've had bad days,\" Saban said. \"Today we made some plays and we made some really good plays. But the consistency wasn't what it needed to be in terms of finishing drives and playing with the consistency of... There were a lot of good things to build on.\"\n\nInjury updates on 2 Alabama running backs\n\nThe arrival of Daboll will mean a third offensive playcaller will be in charge in the last three games after Lane Kiffin did it in the Peach Bowl before Steve Sarkisian took over in the national title game.\n\nThat whole operation takes work too.\n\n\"We do it every day in practice,\" Saban said. \"We have team periods in practice where we put the coaches on the sidelines, we signal the defense and signal the offense and we call the plays every day. That's basically how we practice.\"\n\nOf course, they do their share of instruction outside of that construct. Going seven-on-seven, coaches are out there to walk through the situations.\n\nIt all has a time and place.\n\n\"I used to be in the middle of it, coaching players all the time, coaching them every play in team periods and all that,\" Saban said. \"Bill Belichick used to kick me out and say 'Let the players play.' There was a time when you have to let them play. You call it and they have to make the adjustments and they have to do it. So, we get that in scrimmages but we also get it in practice when we have team periods. It gives the coaches a chance to practice what they're going to call situationally as well.\"\n\nBoth sides of that dynamic will get a rest from that Sunday.

Well, this year isn't packed with those at Alabama with a quarterback locked in and a committee of running backs in place.\n\nOff to the side at Crimson Tide practices are the players in perhaps the most underrated competition of August. For the first time in quite a while, there's competition for the top kicking job.\n\nFreshman Joseph Bulovas and senior Andy Pappanastos appear to be the primary options replacing three-year starter Adam Griffith. Punter JK Scott has also been used at times in the kicking game.\n\nThere really hasn't been must question as to who would be taking over after the last few kickers graduated.\n\nThis transition is a little different with Pappanastos seeing limited action last year after transferring from Ole Miss. He was 6-for-6 on extra points and was 1-for-1 on field goals. Two attempts in the A-Day game missed the mark from 31 and 38 yards respectively.\n\nThe first scrimmage of the preseason is Saturday in Bryant-Denny Stadium. Nick Saban said he'll be keeping an eye on how they respond to success and failure in the closest representation of live fire.\n\n\"You watch it closely all the time. It's all a part of it. Can a guy deliver? It's one thing to go out there and kick field goals on air,\" Saban said. \"It's another thing when there are 11 guys rushing and a lot of stuff happening around you. You got to get a good snap, a good hold and good operation time.\n\n\"You have to get a good zone relative to all those things so that you can execute properly. That's what we're in the process of working on, and we're trying to make evaluations about that between now and the first game.\"\n\nBulovas comes from Mandeville, La., where he was 68-for-76 on extra points and 11-for-25 kicking field goals with a long of 52.\n\nSaban never mentioned kickers by name when asked about the competition Thursday.\n\nThere's also a battle for the long snapping job vacated by four-year starter Cole Mazza. Freshman Thomas Fletcher is the lone scholarship player at the position. He's joined by redshirt freshman Scott Meyer and junior Ryan Parris.\n\n\"I think the snappers are certainly capable of throwing strikes,\" Saban said. \"It's getting the other parts of it right. I think there's good competition at the long snapper position. We're looking at several people and same thing with field goal (kickers). I think it' too early to tell but I think what happens on Saturday probably tells us a little more than what's happened in practice.\"", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "15:17:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "15:22:00", "title": "What Nick Saban is watching with kicker competition in scrimmage", "date": "2017-08-11", "uri": "707980970", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/alabamafootball_impact/photo/23216780-standard.jpg", "source": {"title": "AL.com", "uri": "al.com", "id": "461"}, "id": "8647222", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 100, "id": 52}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 100, "id": 69}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 100, "id": 552}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Jewelry", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Jewelry", "wgt": 100, "id": 553}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Fields", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Fields", "wgt": 100, "id": 624}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 100, "id": 641}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost_or_Missing", "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost or Missing", "wgt": 100, "id": 645}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "id": "204177", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302552", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305440", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305872", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirt_(college_sports)", "label": {"eng": "Redshirt (college sports)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310751", "score": 1}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_(gridiron_football)", "label": {"eng": "Conversion (gridiron football)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "311349", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placekicker", "label": {"eng": "Placekicker"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "311350", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "316239", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(gridiron_football)", "label": {"eng": "Rush (gridiron football)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "324223", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "324224", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban", "label": {"eng": "Nick Saban"}, "type": "person", "id": "325612", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ole_Miss_Rebels_football", "label": {"eng": "Ole Miss Rebels football"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "325924", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punter_(football)", "label": {"eng": "Punter (football)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "328981", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryant\u2013Denny_Stadium", "label": {"eng": "Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "342451", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutjanidae", "label": {"eng": "Lutjanidae"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "344831", "score": 1}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Day_(University_of_Alabama)", "label": {"eng": "A-Day (University of Alabama)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "519007", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Meyer_(author)", "label": {"eng": "Scott Meyer (author)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "964315", "score": 1}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal", "label": {"eng": "Field goal"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1268994", "score": 4}]}

Lap one at Monte Carlo was a chaotic affair, with collisions between Carlos Sainz and Oscar Piastri, and Alpine teammates Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly. But it was a \u2018monster\u2019 crash between Sergio Perez, Kevin Magnussen and Nico Hulkenberg that brought out out the red flag and stopped the race for 45 minutes. After a disastrous qualifying, Red Bull\u2019s Perez started 16th but after a poor start slipped right to the back where the two Haas\u2019 were. As they ran up the hill after turn one, Magnussen got his front wheels alongside Perez\u2019s rear and neither driver was willing to yield despite the track narrowing, leading to pair making contact. Both were sent hurtling into the walls at high speed, with a helpless Hulkenberg collected by both cars, with all three instantly out of the grand prix and debris scattered across the track. The stewards investigated the incident but decided to classify the crash as a racing incident, though many felt Magnussen was lucky to escape punishment, especially with the Dane on the verge of a race ban. \u201cThat is a MONSTER of an accident!\u201d \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00b2A look at the huge crash between Perez and both Haas drivers which caused a red flag \u2013 thankfully all three drivers are out of the cars and are fine \u00e2\u009c\u0085 pic.twitter.com/Df10hRTSIf\u2014 Sky Sports F1 (@SkySportsF1) May 26, 2024 Magnussen put the blame squarely at Perez\u2019s door however, telling Sky Sports: \u2018From my point of view, I had a good part of my front on Perez\u2019s rear and when he went to the wall I got pushed to the wall and made contact with him. \u2018I trusted he was going to leave space for me since I was there, it\u2019s not a corner where you\u2019re braking into it, it\u2019s a bend on the straight so you have to have a car [width] otherwise you leave the other guy no option. \u2018From my point of view, I was there and I got squeezed to the wall.\u2019 He later added: \u2018It\u2019s not good to see both cars in one crash. It sucks. It\u2019s a sh*tty, sh*tty situation.\u2019 Debris was left scattered across the Monaco track (Photo: Getty) Teammate Hulkenberg had the best view of what caused the crash and initially took a more diplomatic approach: \u2018It was a typical lap-one racing accident. \u2018Two drivers who both didn\u2019t want to bail out and didn\u2019t give enough room on a tight track like Monaco, and I was the unlucky victim there.\u2019 His mood turned later though, adding: \u2018It was obviously stupid between Kevin and Checo [Perez].

Checo could have left space. At the same time, I think Kevin was also very optimistic about staying on there, where the track gets narrower and there are little kinks up to Turn 3. \u2018I think unnecessary from both really, it could have been avoided easily. Obviously, for me, who wasn\u2019t directly involved, it\u2019s the sh*ttiest of all. I missed it probably by two-tenths. \u2018If I would have been two times further up the road, he would have missed me. I\u2019m gutted and disappointed because everyone in the team, we all invest a lot of energy and time and it\u2019s just frustrating.\u2019 More to follow\u2026 For more stories like this, check our sport page.
